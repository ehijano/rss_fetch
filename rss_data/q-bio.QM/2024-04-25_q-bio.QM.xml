      <title>Bioregionalization analyses with the bioregion R-package</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bioregionalization consists in the identification of spatial units with similar species composition and is a classical approach in the fields of biogeography and macroecology. The recent emergence of global databases, improvements in computational power, and the development of clustering algorithms coming from the network theory have led to several major updates of the bioregionalizations of many taxa. A typical bioregionalization workflow involves five different steps: formatting the input data, computing a (dis)similarity matrix, selecting a clustering algorithm, evaluating the resulting bioregionalization, and mapping and interpreting the bioregions. For most of these steps, there are many options available in the methods and R packages. Here, we present bioregion, a package that includes all the steps of a bioregionalization workflow under a single architecture, with an exhaustive list of the clustering algorithms used in biogeography and macroecology. These algorithms include (non-)hierarchical algorithms as well as community detection algorithms coming from the network theory. Some key methods from the literature, such as Infomap or OSLOM, that were not available in the R language are included in bioregion. By allowing different methods coming from different fields to communicate easily, bioregion will allow a reproducible and complete comparison of the different bioregionalization methods, which is still missing in the literature.</description>

      <title>VASARI-auto: equitable, efficient, and economical featurisation of glioma MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The VASARI MRI feature set is a quantitative system designed to standardise glioma imaging descriptions. Though effective, deriving VASARI is time-consuming and seldom used in clinical practice. This is a problem that machine learning could plausibly automate. Using glioma data from 1172 patients, we developed VASARI-auto, an automated labelling software applied to both open-source lesion masks and our openly available tumour segmentation model. In parallel, two consultant neuroradiologists independently quantified VASARI features in a subsample of 100 glioblastoma cases. We quantified: 1) agreement across neuroradiologists and VASARI-auto; 2) calibration of performance equity; 3) an economic workforce analysis; and 4) fidelity in predicting patient survival. Tumour segmentation was compatible with the current state of the art and equally performant regardless of age or sex. A modest inter-rater variability between in-house neuroradiologists was comparable to between neuroradiologists and VASARI-auto, with far higher agreement between VASARI-auto methods. The time taken for neuroradiologists to derive VASARI was substantially higher than VASARI-auto (mean time per case 317 vs. 3 seconds). A UK hospital workforce analysis forecast that three years of VASARI featurisation would demand 29,777 consultant neuroradiologist workforce hours ({\pounds}1,574,935), reducible to 332 hours of computing time (and {\pounds}146 of power) with VASARI-auto. The best-performing survival model utilised VASARI-auto features as opposed to those derived by neuroradiologists. VASARI-auto is a highly efficient automated labelling system with equitable performance across patient age or sex, a favourable economic profile if used as a decision support tool, and with non-inferior fidelity in downstream patient survival prediction. Future work should iterate upon and integrate such tools to enhance patient care.</description>

      <title>Frailty Assessment in Aortic Stenosis based on Dynamic Interconnection between Cardiac and Motor Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Aortic stenosis (AS) is the most common acquired valvar disease and is associated with increased risk for frailty. Frailty as a geriatric syndrome is associated with muscle weakness and a compromised autonomic nervous system (ANS) performance in older adults. The purpose of the current work was to assess differences in both motor and ANS performance, and interaction between them, as symptoms of frailty in community dwelling older adults with and without AS. Results: Eighty-six participants were recruited, including 30 with (age=72$\pm$11, 10 non-frail and 20 pre-frail/frail) and 56 without AS (age=80$\pm$8, 12 non-frail and 44 pre-frail/frail). There was a significant difference in UEF motor score between older adults with and without AS (p&lt;0.01, mean values of 0.57$\pm$0.25 and 0.48$\pm$0.23, respectively). Differences in UEF motor score was also observed between the frailty groups (p=0.02, mean values of 0.55$\pm$0.24 and 0.40$\pm$0.20 for pre-frail/frail and non-frail, respectively). CCM parameters showed significant differences between the frailty groups (p=0.02, mean CCM of 0.69$\pm$0.05 for non-frail and 0.54$\pm$0.03 for pre-frail/frail), but not between the AS groups (p&gt;0.70). No significant interaction was observed between frailty and AS condition (p&gt;0.08). Conclusion: Current findings suggest that ANS measures may be highly associated with frailty regardless of AS condition. Combining motor and HR dynamics parameters in a multimodal model may provide a promising tool for frailty assessment</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Applied to the Detection of Mycotoxin in Food: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mycotoxins, toxic secondary metabolites produced by certain fungi, pose significant threats to global food safety and public health. These compounds can contaminate a variety of crops, leading to economic losses and health risks to both humans and animals. Traditional lab analysis methods for mycotoxin detection can be time-consuming and may not always be suitable for large-scale screenings. However, in recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have gained popularity for use in the detection of mycotoxins and in the food safety industry in general, due to their accurate and timely predictions. We provide a systematic review on some of the recent ML applications for detecting/predicting the presence of mycotoxin on a variety of food ingredients, highlighting their advantages, challenges, and potential for future advancements. We address the need for reproducibility and transparency in ML research through open access to data and code. An observation from our findings is the frequent lack of detailed reporting on hyperparameters in many studies as well as a lack of open source code, which raises concerns about the reproducibility and optimisation of the ML models used. The findings reveal that while the majority of studies predominantly utilised neural networks for mycotoxin detection, there was a notable diversity in the types of neural network architectures employed, with convolutional neural networks being the most popular.</description>

      <title>The Past, Present, and Future of Plant Stress Research</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Life finds a way. For sessile organisms like plants, the need to adapt to changes in the environment is even more poignant. For humanity, the need to develop crops that can grow in diverse environments and feed our growing population is an existential one. The development of fast-growing, high-yielding crop varieties sparked the Green Revolution, and the advent of the genomics era enabled the development of customized transgenic crops enhanced for specific traits or resistances. Today, the proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) allows scientists to rapidly screen through massive and complex datasets to uncover elusive patterns in the data, enabling us to create more robust and faster models for prediction and hypothesis generation in a bid to develop more stress-resilient plants. This review aims to provide an overview of the evolution of environmental stress research across the plant kingdom over the past fifty years. It will cover historical landmark concepts and discoveries that were seminal in advancing the field, provide a global snapshot of our current scientific progress, and conclude with a discussion on the advent of AI tools that would help accelerate scientific discovery.</description>

      <title>Quantifying cell cycle regulation by tissue crowding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08805v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The spatiotemporal coordination and regulation of cell proliferation is fundamental in many aspects of development and tissue maintenance. Cells have the ability to adapt their division rates in response to mechanical constraints, yet we do not fully understand how cell proliferation regulation impacts cell migration phenomena. Here, we present a minimal continuum model of cell migration with cell cycle dynamics, which includes density-dependent effects and hence can account for cell proliferation regulation. By combining minimal mathematical modelling, Bayesian inference, and recent experimental data, we quantify the impact of tissue crowding across different cell cycle stages in epithelial tissue expansion experiments. Our model suggests that cells sense local density and adapt cell cycle progression in response, during G1 and the combined S/G2/M phases, providing an explicit relationship between each cell cycle stage duration and local tissue density, which is consistent with several experimental observations. Finally, we compare our mathematical model predictions to different experiments studying cell cycle regulation and present a quantitative analysis on the impact of density-dependent regulation on cell migration patterns. Our work presents a systematic approach for investigating and analysing cell cycle data, providing mechanistic insights into how individual cells regulate proliferation, based on population-based experimental measurements.</description>

      <title>Learning from Two Decades of Blood Pressure Data: Demography-Specific Patterns Across 75 Million Patient Encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01598v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypertension is a global health concern with an increasing prevalence, underscoring the need for effective monitoring and analysis of blood pressure (BP) dynamics. We analyzed a substantial BP dataset comprising 75,636,128 records from 2,054,462 unique patients collected between 2000 and 2022 at Emory Healthcare in Georgia, USA, representing a demographically diverse population. We examined and compared population-wide statistics of bivariate changes in systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) across sex, age, and race/ethnicity. The analysis revealed that males have higher BP levels than females and exhibit a distinct BP profile with age. Notably, average SBP consistently rises with age, whereas average DBP peaks in the forties age group. Among the ethnic groups studied, Blacks have marginally higher BPs and a greater standard deviation. We also discovered a significant correlation between SBP and DBP at the population level, a phenomenon not previously researched. These results emphasize the importance of demography-specific BP analysis for clinical diagnosis and provide valuable insights for developing personalized, demography-specific healthcare interventions.</description>

      <title>Sequential Inference of Hospitalization Electronic Health Records Using Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19011v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the dynamic hospital setting, decision support can be a valuable tool for improving patient outcomes. Data-driven inference of future outcomes is challenging in this dynamic setting, where long sequences such as laboratory tests and medications are updated frequently. This is due in part to heterogeneity of data types and mixed-sequence types contained in variable length sequences. In this work we design a probabilistic unsupervised model for multiple arbitrary-length sequences contained in hospitalization Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. The model uses a latent variable structure and captures complex relationships between medications, diagnoses, laboratory tests, neurological assessments, and medications. It can be trained on original data, without requiring any lossy transformations or time binning. Inference algorithms are derived that use partial data to infer properties of the complete sequences, including their length and presence of specific values. We train this model on data from subjects receiving medical care in the Kaiser Permanente Northern California integrated healthcare delivery system. The results are evaluated against held-out data for predicting the length of sequences and presence of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in hospitalization bed sequences. Our method outperforms a baseline approach, showing that in these experiments the trained model captures information in the sequences that is informative of their future values.</description>

      <title>Quenching of stable pulses in slow-fast excitable media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14854v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop linear theory for the prediction of excitation wave quenching--the construction of minimal perturbations which return stable excitations to quiescence--for localized pulse solutions of models of excitable media. The theory requires accounting for an additional degree of freedom in the formulation of the linear theory, and a reconsideration of heuristics for choosing optimal reference states from their group representation. We compare the predictions made with the linear theory to direct numerical simulations across a family of perturbations and assess the accuracy of predictions for models with distinct stable excitation structures. We find that the theory achieves qualitative predictive power with only the effort of distinguishing a root from the asymptotic case, and achieves quantitative predictive power in many circumstances. Finally, we compare the computational cost of our prediction technique to other numerical methods for the determination of transitions in extended excitable systems.</description>
