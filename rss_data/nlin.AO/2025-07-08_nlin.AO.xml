      <title>Particle-Based Framework for Continuous Fields of Coupled Phase Oscillators: Exploring Spontaneous Local Synchronization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a particle-based framework inspired by smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) to simulate the dynamics of a continuous field of coupled phase oscillators. This methodology discretizes the spatial domain into particles and employs a smoothing kernel to model non-local interactions, enabling the exploration of how spatial heterogeneities and interaction ranges influence the synchronization and pattern formation of coupled phase oscillators. Notably, we observe the emergence of spatially localized synchronization clusters, providing evidence for spontaneous local synchronization in these systems. This local synchronization refers to the transition from an initially homogeneous state, where no preferred spatial organization exists, to one where structured synchronization patterns emerge due to local interactions. Our results advance the theoretical understanding of spatiotemporal synchronization and demonstrate the utility of SPH-inspired techniques for modeling complex, spatially distributed systems. These findings are particularly relevant to applications where spatial interactions drive collective dynamics, such as in neural systems, ecosystems, power grids, social models, chemical oscillators, and climate systems, as well as in condensed matter and collective phenomena involving synchronization.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article critically examines the foundational principles of contemporary AI methods, exploring the limitations that hinder its potential. We draw parallels between the modern AI landscape and the 20th-century Modern Synthesis in evolutionary biology, and highlight how advancements in evolutionary theory that augmented the Modern Synthesis, particularly those of Evolutionary Developmental Biology, offer insights that can inform a new design paradigm for AI. By synthesizing findings across AI and evolutionary theory, we propose a pathway to overcome existing limitations, enabling AI to achieve its aspirational goals. We also examine how this perspective transforms the idea of an AI-driven technological singularity from speculative futurism into a grounded prospect.</description>

      <title>When Does Diversity Matter? A Unified Framework for Binary-Choice Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a modeling framework for binary-choice dynamics in which agents update their states using two mechanisms selected based on individual preference drawn from an arbitrary distribution. We compare annealed dynamics, where preferences change over time, and quenched dynamics, where they remain fixed. Our framework bridges gaps between existing models and provides a systematic approach to assess when individual-level diversity affects collective dynamics and when it can be effectively ignored. We identify a constraint on transition probabilities that makes annealed and quenched dynamics equivalent. We show that when this condition is satisfied, the quenched dynamics reduces to a one-dimensional system, ruling out oscillatory behavior that may otherwise emerge.</description>

      <title>Universal quantum melting of quasiperiodic attractors in driven-dissipative cavities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear classical mechanics has established countless intriguing and profound phenomena. These include limit tori defined by toroidal attractors that support quasiperiodic motion of at least two incommensurate frequencies. Here we address the question, whether and how such phenomena persist in open quantum systems. We develop a quantum description of limit tori within the Lindblad master-equation formalism for a system of two coupled driven-dissipative Kerr cavities. Using the spectral theory of the Liouvillian and the truncated Wigner approximation, we analyze the system across the quantum-to-classical transition. In the classical limit, we identify two pairs of purely imaginary Liouvillian eigenvalues, corresponding to persistent quasiperiodic modes of the limit torus. Quantum fluctuations induce small negative real parts to these eigenvalues, giving rise to finite lifetimes of these modes. The corresponding Liouvillian gaps vanish algebraically in the classical limit. This behavior signals a genuine continuous dynamical phase transition, marked by the spontaneous breaking of time-translational symmetry. Analysis of individual quantum trajectories reveals quantum-fluctuation-induced dephasing as the primary mechanism behind this "quantum melting" of the torus. We quantify this dephasing using a circular-variance-based order parameter, revealing universal scaling with both system size and time. These scaling laws are robust and independent of microscopic parameters. Our results establish the quantum melting of limit tori as a distinct non-equilibrium critical phenomenon and provide concrete signatures for experimental observation in trapped ions and superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Latent FxLMS: Accelerating Active Noise Control with Neural Adaptive Filters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Filtered-X LMS (FxLMS) is commonly used for active noise control (ANC), wherein the soundfield is minimized at a desired location. Given prior knowledge of the spatial region of the noise or control sources, we could improve FxLMS by adapting along the low-dimensional manifold of possible adaptive filter weights. We train an auto-encoder on the filter coefficients of the steady-state adaptive filter for each primary source location sampled from a given spatial region and constrain the weights of the adaptive filter to be the output of the decoder for a given state of latent variables. Then, we perform updates in the latent space and use the decoder to generate the cancellation filter. We evaluate how various neural network constraints and normalization techniques impact the convergence speed and steady-state mean squared error. Under certain conditions, our Latent FxLMS model converges in fewer steps with comparable steady-state error to the standard FxLMS.</description>

      <title>Nested economies of scale in city mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A longstanding puzzle in urban science is whether there's an intrinsic match between human populations and the mass of their built environments. Previous findings have revealed various urban properties scaling nonlinearly with population, yet existing models of city built mass are still dominated by per-capita linear thinking. Our analysis of &gt;3,000 cities globally reveals universal sublinear scaling of city mass with population at both the city (\{beta}=0.90) and neighborhood levels ({\delta}=0.75). This means that larger cities and denser neighborhoods achieve economies of scale with less per-capita city mass. Our theoretical framework further shows that city-level scaling emerges naturally from within-city disparities. This multi-scale understanding redefines "over-built" and "under-built" conditions as deviations from expected scaling patterns, implying either excessive environmental impacts or inadequate living standards. Effective urban policy thus requires moving beyond simple per-capita assumptions, adopting scale-adjusted metrics and managing cities as nested, complex systems.</description>

      <title>Leadership Detection via Time-Lagged Correlation-Based Network Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding leadership dynamics in collective behavior is a key challenge in animal ecology, swarm robotics, and intelligent transportation. Traditional information-theoretic approaches, including Transfer Entropy (TE) and Time-Lagged Mutual Information (TLMI), have been widely used to infer leader-follower relationships but face critical limitations in noisy or short-duration datasets due to their reliance on robust probability estimations. This study proposes a method based on dynamic network inference using time-lagged correlations across multiple kinematic variables: velocity, acceleration, and direction. Our approach constructs directed influence graphs over time, enabling the identification of leadership patterns without the need for large volumes of data or parameter-sensitive discretization. We validate our method through two multi-agent simulations in NetLogo: a modified Vicsek model with informed leaders and a predator-prey model featuring coordinated and independent wolf groups. Experimental results demonstrate that the network-based method outperforms TE and TLMI in scenarios with limited spatiotemporal observations, ranking true leaders at the top of influence metrics more consistently than TE and TLMI.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Systems Perspective on the Analysis of Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this chapter, we utilize dynamical systems to analyze several aspects of machine learning algorithms. As an expository contribution we demonstrate how to re-formulate a wide variety of challenges from deep neural networks, (stochastic) gradient descent, and related topics into dynamical statements. We also tackle three concrete challenges. First, we consider the process of information propagation through a neural network, i.e., we study the input-output map for different architectures. We explain the universal embedding property for augmented neural ODEs representing arbitrary functions of given regularity, the classification of multilayer perceptrons and neural ODEs in terms of suitable function classes, and the memory-dependence in neural delay equations. Second, we consider the training aspect of neural networks dynamically. We describe a dynamical systems perspective on gradient descent and study stability for overdetermined problems. We then extend this analysis to the overparameterized setting and describe the edge of stability phenomenon, also in the context of possible explanations for implicit bias. For stochastic gradient descent, we present stability results for the overparameterized setting via Lyapunov exponents of interpolation solutions. Third, we explain several results regarding mean-field limits of neural networks. We describe a result that extends existing techniques to heterogeneous neural networks involving graph limits via digraph measures. This shows how large classes of neural networks naturally fall within the framework of Kuramoto-type models on graphs and their large-graph limits. Finally, we point out that similar strategies to use dynamics to study explainable and reliable AI can also be applied to settings such as generative models or fundamental issues in gradient training methods, such as backpropagation or vanishing/exploding gradients.</description>

      <title>How more data can hurt: Instability and regularization in next-generation reservoir computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08641v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been found recently that more data can, counter-intuitively, hurt the performance of deep neural networks. Here, we show that a more extreme version of the phenomenon occurs in data-driven models of dynamical systems. To elucidate the underlying mechanism, we focus on next-generation reservoir computing (NGRC) -- a popular framework for learning dynamics from data. We find that, despite learning a better representation of the flow map with more training data, NGRC can adopt an ill-conditioned ``integrator'' and lose stability. We link this data-induced instability to the auxiliary dimensions created by the delayed states in NGRC. Based on these findings, we propose simple strategies to mitigate the instability, either by increasing regularization strength in tandem with data size, or by carefully introducing noise during training. Our results highlight the importance of proper regularization in data-driven modeling of dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Walking Through Complex Spatial Patterns of Climate and Conflict-Induced Displacements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extreme weather events are projected to intensify global migration, increase resource competition, and amplify socio-spatial phenomena, including intergroup conflicts, socioeconomic inequalities, and unplanned displacements, among others. Addressing these challenges requires consolidating heterogeneous data to identify, estimate, and predict the dynamical process behind climate-induced movements. We propose a novel hybrid approach to reconstruct hazard-induced displacements by analysing the statistical properties of a diffusion process (walks) that explores the spatial network constructed from real displacements. The likely trajectories produced by the walks inform the typical journey of individuals, identifying potential hazards that may be encountered when fleeing high-risk areas. As a proof of concept, we apply this method to Somalia's detailed displacement tracking matrix, containing 20,220 movements dating from February 8 to June 18, 2025. We reconstruct the likely routes that displaced persons could have taken when fleeing areas affected by conflict or climate hazards. We find that individuals using the most likely paths based on current flows would experience mainly droughts and conflicts, while the latter becomes less prominent at every subsequent step. We also find that the probability of conflict and drought across all trajectories is widely dispersed, meaning that there is no typical exposure. This work provides an understanding of the mechanisms underlying displacement patterns and a framework for estimating future movements in areas expected to face increasing hazards.</description>

      <title>A unifying approach to self-organizing systems interacting via conservation laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for embedding and analyzing dynamical systems using generalized projection operators rooted in local conservation laws. By representing physical, biological, and engineered systems as graphs with incidence and cycle matrices, we derive dual projection operators that decompose network fluxes and potentials. This formalism aligns with principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics and captures a broad class of systems governed by flux-forcing relationships and local constraints. We extend this approach to collective dynamics through the PRojective Embedding of Dynamical Systems (PrEDS), which lifts low-dimensional dynamics into a high-dimensional space, enabling both replication and recovery of the original dynamics. When systems fall within the PrEDS class, their collective behavior can be effectively approximated through projection onto a mean-field space. We demonstrate the versatility of PrEDS across diverse domains, including resistive and memristive circuits, adaptive flow networks (e.g., slime molds), elastic string networks, and particle swarms. Notably, we establish a direct correspondence between PrEDS and swarm dynamics, revealing new insights into optimization and self-organization. Our results offer a general theoretical foundation for analyzing complex networked systems and for designing systems that self-organize through local interactions.</description>
