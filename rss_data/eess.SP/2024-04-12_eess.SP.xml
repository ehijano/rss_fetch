      <title>Attention-aware Semantic Communications for Collaborative Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a communication-efficient collaborative inference framework in the domain of edge inference, focusing on the efficient use of vision transformer (ViTs) models. The partitioning strategy of conventional collaborative inference fails to reduce communication cost because of the inherent architecture of ViTs maintaining consistent layer dimensions across the entire transformer encoder. Therefore, instead of employing the partitioning strategy, our framework utilizes a lightweight ViT model on the edge device, with the server deploying a complicated ViT model. To enhance communication efficiency and achieve the classification accuracy of the server model, we propose two strategies: 1) attention-aware patch selection and 2) entropy-aware image transmission. Attention-aware patch selection leverages the attention scores generated by the edge device's transformer encoder to identify and select the image patches critical for classification. This strategy enables the edge device to transmit only the essential patches to the server, significantly improving communication efficiency. Entropy-aware image transmission uses min-entropy as a metric to accurately determine whether to depend on the lightweight model on the edge device or to request the inference from the server model. In our framework, the lightweight ViT model on the edge device acts as a semantic encoder, efficiently identifying and selecting the crucial image information required for the classification task. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed collaborative inference framework can reduce communication overhead by 68% with only a minimal loss in accuracy compared to the server model.</description>

      <title>Precoder Design for User-Centric Network Massive MIMO with Matrix Manifold Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the precoder design for user-centric network (UCN) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) downlink with matrix manifold optimization. In UCN mMIMO systems, each user terminal (UT) is served by a subset of base stations (BSs) instead of all the BSs, facilitating the implementation of the system and lowering the dimension of the precoders to be designed. By proving that the precoder set satisfying the per-BS power constraints forms a Riemannian submanifold of a linear product manifold, we transform the constrained precoder design problem in Euclidean space to an unconstrained one on the Riemannian submanifold. Riemannian ingredients, including orthogonal projection, Riemannian gradient, retraction and vector transport, of the problem on the Riemannian submanifold are further derived, with which the Riemannian conjugate gradient (RCG) design method is proposed for solving the unconstrained problem. The proposed method avoids the inverses of large dimensional matrices, which is beneficial in practice. The complexity analyses show the high computational efficiency of RCG precoder design. Simulation results demonstrate the numerical superiority of the proposed precoder design and the high efficiency of the UCN mMIMO system.</description>

      <title>Cramer-Rao Bounds for Near-Field Sensing: A Generic Modular Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generic modular array architecture is proposed, featuring uniform/non-uniform subarray layouts that allows for flexible deployment. The bistatic near-field sensing system is considered, where the target is located in the near-field of the whole modular array and the far-field of each subarray. Then, the closed-form expressions of Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for range and angle estimations are derived based on the hybrid spherical and planar wave model (HSPM). Simulation results validate the accuracy of the derived closed-form CRBs and demonstrate that: i) The HSPM with varying angles of arrival (AoAs) between subarrays can reduce the CRB for range estimation compared to the traditional HSPM with shared AoA; and ii) The proposed generic modular architecture with subarrays positioned closer to the edges can significantly reduce the CRBs compared to the traditional modular architecture with uniform subarray layout, when the array aperture is fixed.</description>

      <title>Integrated Sensing and Communication Under DISCO Physical-Layer Jamming Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems traditionally presuppose that sensing and communication (S&amp;C) channels remain approximately constant during their coherence time. However, a "DISCO" reconfigurable intelligent surface (DRIS), i.e., an illegitimate RIS with random, time-varying reflection properties that acts like a "disco ball," introduces a paradigm shift that enables active channel aging more rapidly during the channel coherence time. In this letter, we investigate the impact of DISCO jamming attacks launched by a DRISbased fully-passive jammer (FPJ) on an ISAC system. Specifically, an ISAC problem formulation and a corresponding waveform optimization are presented in which the ISAC waveform design considers the trade-off between the S&amp;C performance and is formulated as a Pareto optimization problem. Moreover, a theoretical analysis is conducted to quantify the impact of DISCO jamming attacks. Numerical results are presented to evaluate the S&amp;C performance under DISCO jamming attacks and to validate the derived theoretical analysis.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Data Recovery Loops in 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanisms for data recovery and packet reliability are essential components of the upcoming 6th generation (6G) communication system. In this paper, we evaluate the interaction between a fast hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) scheme, present in the physical and medium access control layers, and a higher layer automatic repeat request (ARQ) scheme which may be present in the radio link control layer. Through extensive system-level simulations, we show that despite its higher complexity, a fast HARQ scheme yields &gt; 66 % downlink average user throughput gains over simpler solutions without energy combining gains and orders of magnitude larger gains for users in challenging radio conditions. We present results for the design trade-off between HARQ and higher-layer data recovery mechanisms in the presence of realistic control and data channel errors, network delays, and transport protocols. We derive that, with a suitable design of 6G control and data channels reaching residual errors at the medium access control layer of 5 E-5 or better, a higher layer data recovery mechanism can be disabled. We then derive design targets for 6G control channel design, as well as promising enhancements to 6G higher layer data recovery to extend support for latency-intolerant services.</description>

      <title>Novel Active Sensing and Inference for mmWave Beam Alignment Using Single RF Chain Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel sensing approach for the beam alignment problem in millimeter wave systems using a single Radio Frequency (RF) chain. Conventionally, beam alignment using a single phased array involves comparing beamformer output power across different spatial regions. This incurs large training overhead due to the need to perform the beam scan operation. The proposed Synthesis of Virtual Array Manifold (SVAM) sensing methodology is inspired from synthetic aperture radar systems and realizes a virtual array geometry over temporal measurements. We demonstrate the benefits of SVAM using Cram\'er-Rao bound (CRB) analysis over schemes that repeat beam pattern to boost signal-to-noise (SNR) ratio. We also showcase versatile applicability of the proposed SVAM sensing by incorporating it within existing beam alignment procedures that assume perfect knowledge of the small-scale fading coefficient. We further consider the practical scenario wherein we estimate the fading coefficient and propose a novel beam alignment procedure based on efficient computation of an approximate posterior density on dominant path angle. We provide numerical experiments to study the impact of parameters involved in the procedure. The performance of the proposed sensing and beam alignment algorithm is empirically observed to approach the fading coefficient-perfectly known performance, even at low SNR.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Pull and Push Communication in Wireless Access for IoT Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a setup with Internet of Things (IoT), where a base station (BS) collects data from nodes that use two different communication modes. The first is pull-based, where the BS retrieves the data from specific nodes through queries. In addition, the nodes that apply pull-based communication contain a wake-up receiver: upon a query, the BS sends wake-up signal (WuS) to activate the corresponding devices equipped with wake-up receiver (WuDs). The second one is push-based communication, in which the nodes decide when to send to the BS. Consider a time-slotted model, where the time slots in each frame are shared for both pull-based and push-based communications. Therein, this coexistence scenario gives rise to a new type of problem with fundamental trade-offs in sharing communication resources: the objective to serve a maximum number of queries, within a specified deadline, limits the transmission opportunities for push sensors, and vice versa. This work develops a mathematical model that characterizes these trade-offs, validates them through simulations, and optimizes the frame design to meet the objectives of both the pull- and push-based communications.</description>

      <title>Trainable Joint Channel Estimation, Detection and Decoding for MIMO URLLC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The receiver design for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) ultra-reliable and low-latency communication (URLLC) systems can be a tough task due to the use of short channel codes and few pilot symbols. Consequently, error propagation can occur in traditional turbo receivers, leading to performance degradation. Moreover, the processing delay induced by information exchange between different modules may also be undesirable for URLLC. To address the issues, we advocate to perform joint channel estimation, detection, and decoding (JCDD) for MIMO URLLC systems encoded by short low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Specifically, we develop two novel JCDD problem formulations based on the maximum a posteriori (MAP) criterion for Gaussian MIMO channels and sparse mmWave MIMO channels, respectively, which integrate the pilots, the bit-to-symbol mapping, the LDPC code constraints, as well as the channel statistical information. Both the challenging large-scale non-convex problems are then solved based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithms, where closed-form solutions are achieved in each ADMM iteration. Furthermore, two JCDD neural networks, called JCDDNet-G and JCDDNet-S, are built by unfolding the derived ADMM algorithms and introducing trainable parameters. It is interesting to find via simulations that the proposed trainable JCDD receivers can outperform the turbo receivers with affordable computational complexities.</description>

      <title>Damage identification of offshore jacket platforms in a digital twin framework considering optimal sensor placement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new digital twin (DT) framework with optimal sensor placement (OSP) is proposed to accurately calculate the modal responses and identify the damage ratios of the offshore jacket platforms. The proposed damage identification framework consists of two models (namely one OSP model and one damage identification model). The OSP model adopts the multi-objective Lichtenberg algorithm (MOLA) to perform the sensor number/location optimization to make a good balance between the sensor cost and the modal calculation accuracy. In the damage identification model, the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-Bayesian method is developed to calculate the structural damage ratios based on the modal information obtained from the sensory measurements, where the uncertainties of the structural parameters are quantified. The proposed method is validated using an offshore jacket platform, and the analysis results demonstrate efficient identification of the structural damage location and severity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emerging technologies for mobile broadband wireless are being considered as a Commercial Off-The-Shelf solution to cover the operational requirements of the future warfare. The capabilities of these technologies are being enhanced to meet the growing market demands on performance. In this context, several standards such as WiMAX, LTE or WLAN are introducing themselves as strong candidates to fulfill these requirements. This paper presents an innovative scenario-based approach to develop a Military Broadband Wireless Communication System (MBWCS). Its main objective is to analyze how similar a military MBWCS can be to the identified civil standards, taking operational and high level technical requirements into account. This specification will be used for analyzing the applicability and the modifications of each of the standards layers individually. Proving the feasibility and aptitude of each standard provides strong foundations to address a MBWCS in the most efficient way.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a multi-user offloading problem in the overlapping domain of a multi-server mobile edge computing system. We divide the original problem into two stages: the offloading decision making stage and the request scheduling stage. To prevent the terminal from going out of service area during offloading, we consider the mobility parameter of the terminal according to the human behaviour model when making the offloading decision, and then introduce a server evaluation mechanism based on both the mobility parameter and the server load to select the optimal offloading server. In order to fully utilise the server resources, we design a double deep Q-network (DDQN)-based reward evaluation algorithm that considers the priority of tasks when scheduling offload requests. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify that our proposed method outperforms traditional mathematical computation methods as well as the DQN algorithm.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents two models to address the problem of multi-person activity recognition using ambient sensors in a home. The first model, Seq2Res, uses a sequence generation approach to separate sensor events from different residents. The second model, BiGRU+Q2L, uses a Query2Label multi-label classifier to predict multiple activities simultaneously. Performances of these models are compared to a state-of-the-art model in different experimental scenarios, using a state-of-the-art dataset of two residents in a home instrumented with ambient sensors. These results lead to a discussion on the advantages and drawbacks of resident separation and multi-label classification for multi-person activity recognition.</description>

      <title>Indoor Location Fingerprinting Privacy: A Comprehensive Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pervasive integration of Indoor Positioning Systems (IPS) arises from the limitations of Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) in indoor environments, leading to the widespread adoption of Location-Based Services (LBS). Specifically, indoor location fingerprinting employs diverse signal fingerprints from user devices, enabling precise location identification by Location Service Providers (LSP). Despite its broad applications across various domains, indoor location fingerprinting introduces a notable privacy risk, as both LSP and potential adversaries inherently have access to this sensitive information, compromising users' privacy. Consequently, concerns regarding privacy vulnerabilities in this context necessitate a focused exploration of privacy-preserving mechanisms. In response to these concerns, this survey presents a comprehensive review of Privacy-Preserving Mechanisms in Indoor Location Fingerprinting (ILFPPM) based on cryptographic, anonymization, differential privacy (DP), and federated learning (FL) techniques. We also propose a distinctive and novel grouping of privacy vulnerabilities, adversary and attack models, and available evaluation metrics specific to indoor location fingerprinting systems. Given the identified limitations and research gaps in this survey, we highlight numerous prospective opportunities for future investigation, aiming to motivate researchers interested in advancing this field. This survey serves as a valuable reference for researchers and provides a clear overview for those beyond this specific research domain.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Directly parameterizing and learning gradients of functions has widespread significance, with specific applications in optimization, generative modeling, and optimal transport. This paper introduces gradient networks (GradNets): novel neural network architectures that parameterize gradients of various function classes. GradNets exhibit specialized architectural constraints that ensure correspondence to gradient functions. We provide a comprehensive GradNet design framework that includes methods for transforming GradNets into monotone gradient networks (mGradNets), which are guaranteed to represent gradients of convex functions. We establish the approximation capabilities of the proposed GradNet and mGradNet. Our results demonstrate that these networks universally approximate the gradients of (convex) functions. Furthermore, these networks can be customized to correspond to specific spaces of (monotone) gradient functions, including gradients of transformed sums of (convex) ridge functions. Our analysis leads to two distinct GradNet architectures, GradNet-C and GradNet-M, and we describe the corresponding monotone versions, mGradNet-C and mGradNet-M. Our empirical results show that these architectures offer efficient parameterizations and outperform popular methods in gradient field learning tasks.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private GANs for Generating Synthetic Indoor Location Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The advent of location-based services has led to the widespread adoption of indoor localization systems, which enable location tracking of individuals within enclosed spaces such as buildings. While these systems provide numerous benefits such as improved security and personalized services, they also raise concerns regarding privacy violations. As such, there is a growing need for privacy-preserving solutions that can protect users' sensitive location information while still enabling the functionality of indoor localization systems. In recent years, Differentially Private Generative Adversarial Networks (DPGANs) have emerged as a powerful methodology that aims to protect the privacy of individual data points while generating realistic synthetic data similar to original data. DPGANs combine the power of generative adversarial networks (GANs) with the privacy-preserving technique of differential privacy (DP). In this paper, we introduce an indoor localization framework employing DPGANs in order to generate privacy-preserving indoor location data. We evaluate the performance of our framework on a real-world indoor localization dataset and demonstrate its effectiveness in preserving privacy while maintaining the accuracy of the localization system.</description>

Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs)-enabled aerial communication provides a flexible, reliable, and cost-effective solution for a range of wireless applications. However, due to the high line-of-sight (LoS) probability, aerial communications between UAVs are vulnerable to eavesdropping attacks, particularly when multiple eavesdroppers collude. In this work, we aim to introduce distributed collaborative beamforming (DCB) into UAV swarms and handle the eavesdropper collusion by controlling the corresponding signal distributions. Specifically, we consider a two-way DCB-enabled aerial communication between two UAV swarms and construct these swarms as two UAV virtual antenna arrays. Then, we minimize the two-way known secrecy capacity and the maximum sidelobe level to avoid information leakage from the known and unknown eavesdroppers, respectively. Simultaneously, we also minimize the energy consumption of UAVs for constructing virtual antenna arrays. Due to the conflicting relationships between secure performance and energy efficiency, we consider these objectives as a multi-objective optimization problem. Following this, we propose an enhanced multi-objective swarm intelligence algorithm via the characterized properties of the problem. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm can obtain a set of informative solutions and outperform other state-of-the-art baseline algorithms. Experimental tests demonstrate that our method can be deployed in limited computing power platforms of UAVs and is beneficial for saving computational resources.</description>

      <title>Generating Comprehensive Lithium Battery Charging Data with Generative AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In optimizing performance and extending the lifespan of lithium batteries, accurate state prediction is pivotal. Traditional regression and classification methods have achieved some success in battery state prediction. However, the efficacy of these data-driven approaches heavily relies on the availability and quality of public datasets. Additionally, generating electrochemical data predominantly through battery experiments is a lengthy and costly process, making it challenging to acquire high-quality electrochemical data. This difficulty, coupled with data incompleteness, significantly impacts prediction accuracy. Addressing these challenges, this study introduces the End of Life (EOL) and Equivalent Cycle Life (ECL) as conditions for generative AI models. By integrating an embedding layer into the CVAE model, we developed the Refined Conditional Variational Autoencoder (RCVAE). Through preprocessing data into a quasi-video format, our study achieves an integrated synthesis of electrochemical data, including voltage, current, temperature, and charging capacity, which is then processed by the RCVAE model. Coupled with customized training and inference algorithms, this model can generate specific electrochemical data for EOL and ECL under supervised conditions. This method provides users with a comprehensive electrochemical dataset, pioneering a new research domain for the artificial synthesis of lithium battery data. Furthermore, based on the detailed synthetic data, various battery state indicators can be calculated, offering new perspectives and possibilities for lithium battery performance prediction.</description>

      <title>RIS-Assisted OTFS Communications: Phase Configuration via Received Energy Maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the integration of two revolutionary technologies, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, to enhance high-speed wireless communications. We introduce a novel phase shift design algorithm for RIS-assisted OTFS, optimizing energy reception and channel gain in dynamic environments. The study evaluates the proposed approach in a downlink scenario, demonstrating significant performance improvements compared to benchmark schemes in the literature, particularly in terms of bit error rate (BER). Our results showcase the potential of RIS to enhance the system's performance. Specifically, our proposed phase shift design technique outperforms the benchmark solutions by over 4 dB. Furthermore, even greater gains can be obtained as the number of RIS elements increases.</description>

      <title>The Role of Confidence for Trust-based Resilient Consensus (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07838v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a multi-agent system where agents aim to achieve a consensus despite interactions with malicious agents that communicate misleading information. Physical channels supporting communication in cyberphysical systems offer attractive opportunities to detect malicious agents, nevertheless, trustworthiness indications coming from the channel are subject to uncertainty and need to be treated with this in mind. We propose a resilient consensus protocol that incorporates trust observations from the channel and weighs them with a parameter that accounts for how confident an agent is regarding its understanding of the legitimacy of other agents in the network, with no need for the initial observation window $T_0$ that has been utilized in previous works. Analytical and numerical results show that (i) our protocol achieves a resilient consensus in the presence of malicious agents and (ii) the steady-state deviation from nominal consensus can be minimized by a suitable choice of the confidence parameter that depends on the statistics of trust observations.</description>

      <title>Verifying the Smoothness of Graph Signals: A Graph Signal Processing Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19618v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) deals with the representation, analysis, and processing of structured data, i.e. graph signals that are defined on the vertex set of a generic graph. A crucial prerequisite for applying various GSP and graph neural network (GNN) approaches is that the examined signals are smooth graph signals with respect to the underlying graph, or, equivalently, have low graph total variation (TV). In this paper, we develop GSP-based approaches to verify the validity of the smoothness assumption of given signals (data) and an associated graph. The proposed approaches are based on the representation of network data as the output of a graph filter with a given graph topology. In particular, we develop two smoothness detectors for the graph-filter-output model: 1) the likelihood ratio test (LRT) for known model parameters; and 2) a semi-parametric detector that estimates the graph filter and then validates its smoothness. The properties of the proposed GSP-based detectors are investigated, and some special cases are discussed. The performance of the GSP-based detectors is evaluated using synthetic data, data from the IEEE 14-bus power system, and measurements from a network of light intensity sensors, under different setups. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and its robustness to different generating models, noise levels, and number of samples.</description>

      <title>Precoder Design for Massive MIMO Downlink with Matrix Manifold Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.00201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.00201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization linear precoder design for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink. We consider a single-cell system with multiple users and propose a unified matrix manifold optimization framework applicable to total power constraint (TPC), per-user power constraint (PUPC) and per-antenna power constraint (PAPC). We prove that the precoders under TPC, PUPC and PAPC are on distinct Riemannian submanifolds, and transform the constrained problems in Euclidean space to unconstrained ones on manifolds. In accordance with this, we derive Riemannian ingredients, including orthogonal projection, Riemannian gradient, Riemannian Hessian, retraction and vector transport, which are needed for precoder design in the matrix manifold framework. Then, Riemannian design methods using Riemannian steepest descent, Riemannian conjugate gradient and Riemannian trust region are provided to design the WSR-maximization precoders under TPC, PUPC or PAPC. Riemannian methods do not involve the inverses of the large dimensional matrices during the iterations, reducing the computational complexities of the algorithms. Complexity analyses and performance simulations demonstrate the advantages of the proposed precoder design.</description>

      <title>RIShield: Enabling Electromagnetic Blackout in Radiation-Sensitive Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.13203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) have emerged as a disruptive technology with the potential to revolutionize wireless communication systems. In this paper, we present RIShield, a novel application of RIS technology specifically designed for radiation-sensitive environments. The aim of RIShield is to enable electromagnetic blackouts, preventing radiation leakage from target areas. We propose a comprehensive framework for RIShield deployment, considering the unique challenges and requirements of radiation-sensitive environments. By strategically positioning RIS panels, we create an intelligent shielding mechanism that selectively absorbs and reflects electromagnetic waves, effectively blocking radiation transmission. To achieve optimal performance, we model the corresponding channel and design a dynamic control that adjusts the RIS configuration based on real-time radiation monitoring. By leveraging the principles of reconfiguration and intelligent control, RIShield ensures adaptive and efficient protection while minimizing signal degradation. Through full-wave and ray-tracing simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of RIShield in achieving significant electromagnetic attenuation. Our results highlight the potential of RIS technology to address critical concerns in radiation-sensitive environments, paving the way for safer and more secure operations in industries such as healthcare, nuclear facilities, and defense.</description>

      <title>Interpretation of Intracardiac Electrograms Through Textual Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the irregular electrical activity of atrial fibrillation (AFib) has been a key challenge in electrocardiography. For serious cases of AFib, catheter ablations are performed to collect intracardiac electrograms (EGMs). EGMs offer intricately detailed and localized electrical activity of the heart and are an ideal modality for interpretable cardiac studies. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) has allowed some works to utilize deep learning frameworks to interpret EGMs during AFib. Additionally, language models (LMs) have shown exceptional performance in being able to generalize to unseen domains, especially in healthcare. In this study, we are the first to leverage pretrained LMs for finetuning of EGM interpolation and AFib classification via masked language modeling. We formulate the EGM as a textual sequence and present competitive performances on AFib classification compared against other representations. Lastly, we provide a comprehensive interpretability study to provide a multi-perspective intuition of the model's behavior, which could greatly benefit the clinical use.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Multi-User MIMO Equalization via In-Context Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05538v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large pre-trained sequence models, such as transformers, excel as few-shot learners capable of in-context learning (ICL). In ICL, a model is trained to adapt its operation to a new task based on limited contextual information, typically in the form of a few training examples for the given task. Previous work has explored the use of ICL for channel equalization in single-user multi-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this work, we demonstrate that ICL can be also used to tackle the problem of multi-user equalization in cell-free MIMO systems with limited fronthaul capacity. In this scenario, a task is defined by channel statistics, signal-to-noise ratio, and modulation schemes. The context encompasses the users' pilot sequences, the corresponding quantized received signals, and the current received data signal. Different prompt design strategies are proposed and evaluated that encompass also large-scale fading and modulation information. Experiments demonstrate that ICL-based equalization provides estimates with lower mean squared error as compared to the linear minimum mean squared error equalizer, especially in the presence of limited fronthaul capacity and pilot contamination.</description>

      <title>Joint Active And Passive IRS Aided Wireless Communication: Elements Allocation and Achievable Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Equipping reflecting elements at the active intelligent reflecting surface (AIRS) enhances signal amplification capability but meanwhile incurs non-negligible amplification noise, which thus challenges the determination of elements allocation for maximizing achievable rate in multi-cooperative AIRS and passive IRS (PIRS) jointly aided wireless communication system. To tackle this issue, we consider the downlink communication from a single-antenna transmitter (Tx) to a single-antenna receiver (Rx), which aided by a pair of AIRS and PIRS with two different deployment orders. Specifically, we target to determine the number of AIRS/PIRS elements over both transmission orders under given deployment budget for the achievable rate maximization. Our analysis illustrates that the PIRS should be allocated more elements than the AIRS for achieving optimized rate and linear signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scaling orders are attained in both schemes. Simulation results are provided to evaluate the proposed algorithm and compare the rate performance of the AIRS and PIRS jointly aided wireless system with various benchmark systems.</description>
