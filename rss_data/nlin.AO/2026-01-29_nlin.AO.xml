      <title>Noise-induced excitability: bloom, bust and extirpation in autotoxic population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Species populations often modify their environment as they grow. When environmental feedback operates more slowly than population growth, the system can undergo boom-bust dynamics, where the population overshoots its carrying capacity and subsequently collapses. In extreme cases, this collapse leads to total extinction. While deterministic models typically fail to capture these finite-time extinction events, we propose a stochastic framework, derived from an individual-based model, to describe boom-bust-extirpation dynamics. We identify a noise-driven, threshold-like behavior where, depending on initial conditions, the population either undergoes a "boom" or is extirpated before the expansion occurs. Furthermore, we characterize a transition between an excitable regime, where most trajectories are captured by the absorbing state immediately after the first bust, and a persistent regime, where most populations reach a metastable state. We show that this transition is governed by the diffusion strength and the ratio of environmental-to-population timescales. This framework provides a theoretical basis for understanding irreversible transitions in invasive species, plant succession, and microbial dynamics.</description>

      <title>Order Out of Noise and Disorder: Fate of the Frustrated Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.18653v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Langevin dynamics of $N$ Brownian particles on two-dimensional Riemannian manifolds, interacting through pairwise potentials linear in geodesic distance with quenched random couplings. These \emph{frustrated Brownian particles} experience competing demands of random attractive and repulsive interactions while confined to curved surfaces. We consider three geometries: the sphere $S^2$, torus $T^2$, and bounded cylinder. Our central finding is disorder-induced dimension reduction with spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking: order emerges from two sources of randomness (thermal noise and quenched disorder), with manifold topology determining the character of emerging structures. Glassy relaxation drives particles from 2D distributions to quasi-1D structures: bands on $S^2$, rings on $T^2$, and localized clusters on the cylinder. Unlike conventional symmetry breaking, the symmetry-breaking direction is not frozen but evolves slowly via thermal noise. On the sphere, the structure normal precesses diffusively on the Goldstone manifold with correlation time $\tau_c \approx 18$, a classical realization of type-A dissipative Nambu-Goldstone dynamics. The model requires no thermodynamic gradients, no fine-tuning, and no slow external input. We discuss connections to spin glass theory, quantum field theory, astrophysical structure formation, and self-organizing systems. The model admits a large-$N$ limit yielding statistical field theory on Riemannian surfaces, while remaining experimentally realizable in colloidal and soft matter systems.</description>

      <title>Self-induced stochastic resonance: A physics-informed machine learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-induced stochastic resonance (SISR) is the emergence of coherent oscillations in slow-fast excitable systems driven solely by noise, without external periodic forcing or proximity to a bifurcation. This work presents a physics-informed machine learning framework for modeling and predicting SISR in the stochastic FitzHugh-Nagumo neuron. We embed the governing stochastic differential equations and SISR-asymptotic timescale-matching constraints directly into a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) based on a Noise-Augmented State Predictor architecture. The composite loss integrates data fidelity, dynamical residuals, and barrier-based physical constraints derived from Kramers' escape theory. The trained PINN accurately predicts the dependence of spike-train coherence on noise intensity, excitability, and timescale separation, matching results from direct stochastic simulations with substantial improvements in accuracy and generalization compared with purely data-driven methods, while requiring significantly less computation. The framework provides a data-efficient and interpretable surrogate model for simulating and analyzing noise-induced coherence in multiscale stochastic systems.</description>
