      <title>Efficient estimation of partially linear additive Cox models and variance estimation under shape restrictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shape-restricted inferences have exhibited empirical success in various applications with survival data. However, certain works fall short in providing a rigorous theoretical justification and an easy-to-use variance estimator with theoretical guarantee. Motivated by Deng et al. (2023), this paper delves into an additive and shape-restricted partially linear Cox model for right-censored data, where each additive component satisfies a specific shape restriction, encompassing monotonic increasing/decreasing and convexity/concavity. We systematically investigate the consistencies and convergence rates of the shape-restricted maximum partial likelihood estimator (SMPLE) of all the underlying parameters. We further establish the aymptotic normality and semiparametric effiency of the SMPLE for the linear covariate shift. To estimate the asymptotic variance, we propose an innovative data-splitting variance estimation method that boasts exceptional versatility and broad applicability. Our simulation results and an analysis of the Rotterdam Breast Cancer dataset demonstrate that the SMPLE has comparable performance with the maximum likelihood estimator under the Cox model when the Cox model is correct, and outperforms the latter and Huang (1999)'s method when the Cox model is violated or the hazard is nonsmooth. Meanwhile, the proposed variance estimation method usually leads to reliable interval estimates based on the SMPLE and its competitors.</description>

      <title>Generalized Estimation and Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper extends the idea of a generalized estimator for a scalar parameter (Vos, 2022) to multi-dimensional parameters both with and without nuisance parameters. The title reflects the fact that generalized estimators provide more than simply another method to find point estimators, and that the methods to assess generalized estimators differ from those for point estimators. By generalized estimation we mean the use of generalized estimators together with an extended definition of information to assess their inferential properties. We show that Fisher information provides an upper bound for the information utilized by an estimator and that the score attains this bound.</description>

      <title>Multi-resolution subsampling for large-scale linear classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05691v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Subsampling is one of the popular methods to balance statistical efficiency and computational efficiency in the big data era. Most approaches aim at selecting informative or representative sample points to achieve good overall information of the full data. The present work takes the view that sampling techniques are recommended for the region we focus on and summary measures are enough to collect the information for the rest according to a well-designed data partitioning. We propose a multi-resolution subsampling strategy that combines global information described by summary measures and local information obtained from selected subsample points. We show that the proposed method will lead to a more efficient subsample-based estimator for general large-scale classification problems. Some asymptotic properties of the proposed method are established and connections to existing subsampling procedures are explored. Finally, we illustrate the proposed subsampling strategy via simulated and real-world examples.</description>

      <title>Subadditivity and optimal matching of unbounded samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06352v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain new bounds for the optimal matching cost for empirical measures with unbounded support. For a large class of radially symmetric and rapidly decaying probability laws, we prove for the first time the asymptotic rate of convergence for the whole range of power exponents $p$ and dimensions $d$. Moreover we identify the exact prefactor when $p\le d$. We cover in particular the Gaussian case, going far beyond the currently known bounds. Our proof technique is based on approximate sub- and super-additivity bounds along a geometric decomposition adapted to some features the density, such as its radial symmetry and its decay at infinity.</description>

      <title>Sampling distributions and estimation for multi-type Branching Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.07101v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a multi-dimensional supercritical branching process with offspring distribution in a parametric family. Here, each vector coordinate corresponds to the number of offspring of a given type. The process is observed under family-size sampling: a random sample is drawn, each individual reporting its vector of brood sizes. In this work, we show that the set in which no siblings are sampled (so that the sample can be considered independent) has probability converging to one under certain conditions on the sampling size. Furthermore, we show that the sampling distribution of the observed sizes converges to the product of identical distributions, hence developing a framework for which the process can be considered iid, and the usual methods for parameter estimation apply. We provide asymptotic distributions for the resulting estimators.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic properties of maximum likelihood estimators for determinantal point processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.00733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.00733v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain the almost sure strong consistency and the Berry-Esseen type bound for the maximum likelihood estimator Ln of the ensemble L for determinantal point processes (DPPs), strengthening and completing previous work initiated in Brunel, Moitra, Rigollet, and Urschel [BMRU17]. Numerical algorithms of estimating DPPs are developed and simulation studies are performed. Lastly, we give explicit formula and a detailed discussion for the maximum likelihood estimator for blocked determinantal matrix of two by two submatrices and compare it with the frequency method.</description>

      <title>On posterior consistency of data assimilation with Gaussian process priors: the 2D Navier-Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08136v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a non-linear Bayesian data assimilation model for the periodic two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations with initial condition modelled by a Gaussian process prior. We show that if the system is updated with sufficiently many discrete noisy measurements of the velocity field, then the posterior distribution eventually concentrates near the ground truth solution of the time evolution equation, and in particular that the initial condition is recovered consistently by the posterior mean vector field. We further show that the convergence rate can in general not be faster than inverse logarithmic in sample size, but describe specific conditions on the initial conditions when faster rates are possible. In the proofs we provide an explicit quantitative estimate for backward uniqueness of solutions of the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations.</description>

      <title>Semiparametric Modeling and Analysis for Longitudinal Network Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a semiparametric latent space model for analyzing longitudinal network data. The model consists of a static latent space component and a time-varying node-specific baseline component. We develop a semiparametric efficient score equation for the latent space parameter by adjusting for the baseline nuisance component. Estimation is accomplished through a one-step update estimator and an appropriately penalized maximum likelihood estimator. We derive oracle error bounds for the two estimators and address identifiability concerns from a quotient manifold perspective. Our approach is demonstrated using the New York Citi Bike Dataset.</description>

      <title>Persistence Diagram Estimation of Multivariate Piecewise H\"older-continuous Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19396v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To our knowledge, the analysis of convergence rates for persistence diagram estimation from noisy signals had predominantly relied on lifting signal estimation results through sup norm (or other functional norm) stability theorems. We believe that moving forward from this approach can lead to considerable gains. We illustrate it in the setting of Gaussian white noise model. We examine from a minimax perspective, the inference of persistence diagram (for sublevel sets filtration). We show that for piecewise H\"older-continuous functions, with control over the reach of the discontinuities set, taking the persistence diagram coming from a simple histogram estimator of the signal, permit to achieve the minimax rates known for H\"older-continuous functions.</description>
