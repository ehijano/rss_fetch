      <title>Kinetic representation of the unified gas-kinetic wave-particle method and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05691v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The unified gas-kinetic wave-particle (UGKWP) method is a hybrid method for multiscale flow simulations, in which the contributions to the whole gas evolution from deterministic hydrodynamic wave and stochastic particle transport are combined simultaneously. Originally, the UGKWP method was developed as a direct modeling approach at discrete level. In this work, we revisit the time evolution of each part of the involved simulation particles and wave molecules in UGKWP, and present the corresponding kinetic equations. The resultant kinetic system can be viewed as a collision decomposition of the original kinetic equation, which can serve as a basis for developing other kinetic methods for flows in all flow regimes.</description>

      <title>Simulating the dynamics of NV^- formation in diamond in the presence of carbon self-interstitials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study utilises linear-scaling density functional theory (DFT) and develops a new machine-learning potential for carbon and nitrogen (GAP-CN), based on the carbon potential (GAP20), to investigate the interaction between carbon self-interstitials and nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond, focusing on their excited states and diffusion behaviour. From the simulated excited states, 'Bright', 'Spike', and 'Dark' defect configurations are classified based on their absorption spectrum features. Furthermore, machine learning molecular dynamics simulation provides insight into the possible diffusion mechanism of Ci and NV, showing that Ci can diffuse away or recombine with NV. The study yields new insight into the formation of NV defects in diamond for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>SOFI: Finding point group symmetries in atomic clusters as finding the set of degenerate solutions in a shape-matching problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Point Group (PG) symmetries play a fundamental role in many aspects of theoretical chemistry and computational materials science. With the objective to automatize the search of PG symmetry operations of generic atomic clusters, we present a new algorithm called Symmetry Operation FInder (SOFI). SOFI addresses the problem of identifying PG symmetry by framing it as a degenerate shape-matching problem, where the multiple solutions correspond to distinct symmetry operations. The developed algorithm is compared against three other algorithms dedicated to PG identification, on a large set of atomic clusters. The results, along with some illustrative use cases, showcase the effectiveness of SOFI. The SOFI algorithm is released as part of the IRA library, accessible at https://github.com/mammasmias/IterativeRotationsAssignments.</description>

      <title>Thermal Stoner-Wohlfarth Model for Magnetodynamics of Single Domain Nanoparticles: Implementation and Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the thermal Stoner-Wohlfarth (tSW) model and apply it in the context of Molecular Dynamics simulations. The model is validated against an ensemble of immobilized, non-interacting, randomly oriented uniaxial particles (solid superparamagnet) and a classical dilute (non-interacting) ferrofluid for different combinations of anisotropy strength and magnetic field/moment coupling, at a fixed temperature. We compare analytical and simulation results to quantify the viability of the tSW model in reproducing the equilibrium and dynamic properties of magnetic soft matter systems. We show that if the anisotropy of a particle is more than four-five times higher than the thermal fluctuations, tSW is applicable and efficient. It provides a valuable insight into the interplay between internal magnetization degrees of freedom and Browninan rotation that is often neglected in the fixed point-dipole representation-based magnetic soft matter theoretical investigations.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Descriptors for Condensed Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06156v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational scientists have long been developing a diverse portfolio of methodologies to characterise condensed matter systems. Most of the descriptors resulting from these efforts are ultimately based on the spatial configurations of particles, atoms, or molecules within these systems. Noteworthy examples include symmetry functions and the smooth overlap of atomic positions (SOAP) descriptors, which have significantly advanced the performance of predictive machine learning models for both condensed matter and small molecules. However, while graph-based descriptors are frequently employed in machine learning models to predict the functional properties of small molecules, their application in the context of condensed matter has been limited. In this paper, we put forward a number of graph-based descriptors (such as node centrality and clustering coefficients) traditionally utilised in network science, as alternative representations for condensed matter systems. We apply this graph-based formalism to investigate the dynamical properties and phase transitions of the prototypical Lennard-Jones system. We find that our graph-based formalism outperforms symmetry function descriptors in predicting the dynamical properties and phase transitions of this system. These results demonstrate the broad applicability of graph-based features in representing condensed matter systems, paving the way for exciting advancements in the field of condensed matter through the integration of network science concepts.</description>

      <title>Modelling wildfire spread and spotfire merger using conformal mapping and AAA-least squares methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A two-dimensional model of wildfire spread and merger is presented. Three features affect the fire propagation: (i) a constant basic rate of spread term accounting for radiative and convective heat transfer, (ii) the unidirectional, constant ambient wind, and (iii) a fire-induced pyrogenic wind. Two numerical methods are proposed to solve for the harmonic pyrogenic potential. The first utilizes the conformal invariance of the Laplace equation, reducing the wildfire system to a single Polubarinova-Galin type equation. The second method uses a AAA-least squares method to find a rational approximation of the potential. Various wildfire scenarios are presented and the effects of the pyrogenic wind and the radiative/convective basic rate of spread terms investigated. Firebreaks such as roads and lakes are also included and solutions are found to match well with existing numerical and experimental results. The methods proposed in this work are suitably fast and accurate to be considered for operational use.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Weakly Supervised Learning for Interatomic Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning plays an increasingly important role in computational chemistry and materials science, complementing computationally intensive ab initio and first-principles methods. Despite their utility, machine-learning models often lack generalization capability and robustness during atomistic simulations, yielding unphysical energy and force predictions that hinder their real-world applications. We address this challenge by introducing a physics-informed, weakly supervised approach for training machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs). We introduce two novel loss functions, extrapolating the potential energy via a Taylor expansion and using the concept of conservative forces. Our approach improves the accuracy of MLIPs applied to training tasks with sparse training data sets and reduces the need for pre-training computationally demanding models with large data sets. Particularly, we perform extensive experiments demonstrating reduced energy and force errors -- often lower by a factor of two -- for various baseline models and benchmark data sets. Finally, we show that our approach facilitates MLIPs' training in a setting where the computation of forces is infeasible at the reference level, such as those employing complete-basis-set extrapolation.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural network for nonlinear dynamics of self-trapped necklace beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05414v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A physics-informed neural network (PINN) is used to produce a variety of self-trapped necklace solutions of the (2+1)-dimensional nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger/Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We elaborate the analysis for the existence and evolution of necklace patterns with integer, half-integer, and fractional reduced orbital angular momenta by means of PINN. The patterns exhibit phenomena similar to rotation of rigid bodies and centrifugal force. Even though the necklaces slowly expand (or shrink), they preserve their structure in the course of the quasi-stable propagation over several diffraction lengths, which is completely different from the ordinary fast diffraction-dominated dynamics. By comparing different ingredients, including the training time, loss value and $\mathbb{L}_{2}$ error, PINN accurately predicts specific nonlinear dynamical properties of the evolving necklace patterns. Furthermore, we perform the data-driven discovery of parameters for both clean and perturbed training data, adding $1\%$ random noise in the latter case. The results reveal that PINN not only effectively emulates the solution of partial differential equations, but also offers applications for predicting the nonlinear dynamics of physically relevant types of patterns.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.05481v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is the theoretical structure of electromagnetism that led Einstein to special relativity. To foster an intuitive understanding of relativity's core idea, it is valuable to create a fully special relativistic computer simulation incorporating electromagnetic dynamics. In this paper, we provide a basic formulation for such an implementation. Specifically, the player observes the world via their past light cone and experiences the Lorentz force generated by the electromagnetic field at their spacetime location. The electromagnetic field at any given spacetime point is determined by the sublight-speed motion of individual point charges on the past light cone of that spacetime point.</description>

      <title>Emission Spectrum of Doped Graphene Quantum Dots: A high-throughput TDDFT Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) calculations of fluorescence emission energies for 284 distinct graphene quantum dots (GQDs) of varying shapes (square, hexagonal, and amorphous) and sizes ($\sim$1-2 nm). These GQDs are doped with one or two elements from B, N, O, S, and P at dopant percentages of 1.5%, 3%, 5%, and 7%. Our study systematically investigates the trends and patterns in emission energies as a function of shape, size, dopant type and dopant percentage. Twelve structures are identified to have emission wavelengths in the visible spectrum. The emission energies derived from our calculations can guide the formulation of specific GQD mixtures to achieve desired emission spectra within and beyond the visible range for industrial applications. Furthermore, the extensive dataset, including emission energies along with molecular structures generated in this work, creates a DFT dateset for further machine learning studies.</description>

      <title>Surface Termination and Band Alignment in 2D Heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Heterostructures are ubiquitous in many optoelectronic devices and as photocatalysts. One of the key features of a heterojunction is the proper band alignment between the two materials. Estimation of the correct relative band positions with density functional theory (DFT) based electronic structure calculations is often constrained by the accuracy and cost associated with the various DFT functionals. In this study, we introduce a novel computational approach that achieves band alignments closely matching experimental results with the widely used PBE functional. We specifically examine the well-documented MoO3/MoS2 system, a type-II heterojunction. In our setup, the MoS2 layers are kept as it is but for MoO3 the individual layers are chosen differently. These alternative layers have higher surface energy, and hence, the band edges are higher than the conventional layers. This shift in band edges of the alternative MoO3 layers changes the band alignment in MoO3/MoS2 heterojunction from type-III to the experimentally observed type-II character. We also extend this computational strategy to additional systems, demonstrating its versatility and effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Pauli Decomposition via the Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The decomposition of a square matrix into a sum of Pauli strings is a classical pre-processing step required to realize many quantum algorithms. Such a decomposition requires significant computational resources for large matrices. We present a new exact and explicit formula for the Pauli string coefficients which inspires an efficient algorithm to compute them. More specifically, we show that up to a permutation of the matrix elements, the decomposition coefficients are related to the original matrix by a multiplication of a generalised Hadamard matrix. This allows one to use the Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform and calculate all Pauli decomposition coefficients in $\mathcal{O}(N^2\log N)$ time and using $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional memory, for an $N\times N$ matrix. A numerical implementation of our equation outperforms currently available solutions.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Circuit Simulation by Tensor Network Methods on Modern GPUs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.03978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient simulation of quantum circuits has become indispensable with the rapid development of quantum hardware. The primary simulation methods are based on state vectors and tensor networks. As the number of qubits and quantum gates grows larger in current quantum devices, traditional state-vector based quantum circuit simulation methods prove inadequate due to the overwhelming size of the Hilbert space and extensive entanglement. Consequently, brutal force tensor network simulation algorithms become the only viable solution in such scenarios. The two main challenges faced in tensor network simulation algorithms are optimal contraction path finding and efficient execution on modern computing devices, with the latter determines the actual efficiency. In this study, we investigate the optimization of such tensor network simulations on modern GPUs and propose general optimization strategies from two aspects: computational efficiency and accuracy. Firstly, we propose to transform critical Einstein summation operations into GEMM operations, leveraging the specific features of tensor network simulations to amplify the efficiency of GPUs. Secondly, by analyzing the data characteristics of quantum circuits, we employ extended precision to ensure the accuracy of simulation results and mixed precision to fully exploit the potential of GPUs, resulting in faster and more precise simulations. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that our approach can achieve a 3.96x reduction in verification time for random quantum circuit samples in the 18-cycle case of Sycamore, with sustained performance exceeding 21 TFLOPS on one A100. This method can be easily extended to the 20-cycle case, maintaining the same performance, accelerating by 12.5x compared to the state-of-the-art CPU-based results and 4.48-6.78x compared to the state-of-the-art GPU-based results reported in the literature.</description>

Abstract: Quantum computing promises to provide the next step up in computational power for diverse application areas. In this review, we examine the science behind the quantum hype, and the breakthroughs required to achieve true quantum advantage in real world applications. Areas that are likely to have the greatest impact on high performance computing (HPC) include simulation of quantum systems, optimization, and machine learning. We draw our examples from electronic structure calculations and computational fluid dynamics which account for a large fraction of current scientific and engineering use of HPC. Potential challenges include encoding and decoding classical data for quantum devices, and mismatched clock speeds between classical and quantum processors. Even a modest quantum enhancement to current classical techniques would have far-reaching impacts in areas such as weather forecasting, engineering, aerospace, drug design, and the design of "green" materials for sustainable development. This requires significant effort from the computational science, engineering and quantum computing communities working together.</description>

Abstract: Control of topological edge modes is desirable for encoding quantum information resiliently against external noise. Their implementation on quantum hardware, however, remains a long-standing problem due to current limitations of circuit depth and noise, which grows with the number of time steps. By utilizing recently developed constant-depth quantum circuits in which the circuit depth is independent of time, we demonstrate successful long-time dynamics simulation of bulk and surface modes in topological insulators on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processors, which exhibits robust signatures of localized topological modes. We further identify a class of one-dimensional topological Hamiltonians that can be readily simulated with NISQ hardware. Our results provide a pathway towards stable long-time implementation of topological quantum spin systems on present day quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.10846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning generative models (GMs) have created high capabilities in accessing and assessing complex high-dimensional data, allowing superior efficiency in navigating vast material configuration space in search of viable structures. Coupling such capabilities with physically significant data to construct trained models for materials discovery is crucial to moving this emerging field forward. Here, we present a universal GM for crystal structure prediction (CSP) via a conditional crystal diffusion variational autoencoder (Cond-CDVAE) approach, which is tailored to allow user-defined material and physical parameters such as composition and pressure. This model is trained on an expansive dataset containing over 670,000 local minimum structures, including a rich spectrum of high-pressure structures, along with ambient-pressure structures in Materials Project database. We demonstrate that the Cond-CDVAE model can generate physically plausible structures with high fidelity under diverse pressure conditions without necessitating local optimization, accurately predicting 59.3% of the 3,547 unseen ambient-pressure experimental structures within 800 structure samplings, with the accuracy rate climbing to 83.2% for structures comprising fewer than 20 atoms per unit cell. These results meet or exceed those achieved via conventional CSP methods based on global optimization. The present findings showcase substantial potential of GMs in the realm of CSP.</description>

Abstract: Multi-layer perceptrons (MLP's) have been extensively utilized in discovering Deep Koopman operators for linearizing nonlinear dynamics. With the emergence of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as a more efficient and accurate alternative to the MLP Neural Network, we propose a comparison of the performance of each network type in the context of learning Koopman operators with control. In this work, we propose a KANs-based deep Koopman framework with applications to an orbital Two-Body Problem (2BP) and the pendulum for data-driven discovery of linear system dynamics. KANs were found to be superior in nearly all aspects of training; learning 31 times faster, being 15 times more parameter efficiency, and predicting 1.25 times more accurately as compared to the MLP Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) in the case of the 2BP. Thus, KANs shows potential for being an efficient tool in the development of Deep Koopman Theory.</description>
