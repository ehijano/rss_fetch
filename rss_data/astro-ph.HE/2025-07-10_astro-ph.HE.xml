      <title>Broad-band Spectral Modeling of Prompt Emission from Gamma-Ray Bursts Observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical observations of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) contemporaneous with their prompt high-energy emission are rare, but they can provide insights into the physical processes underlying these explosive events. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite's (TESS) large field of view and continuous observation capabilities make it uniquely positioned to detect and characterize prompt optical flashes from GRBs. In this work, we fit phenomenological models to the gamma-ray through optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of 24 bursts with arcsecond-level localizations that fell within the TESS field of view between 2018 July and 2024 December. In four cases, the extrapolation of the high-energy SED agrees with the observed optical flux to within 1-$\sigma$. In one case, there is a significant excess of optical flux relative to the extrapolation. In two cases, upper limits from TESS did not constrain the optical portion of the SED. In the remaining 17 cases, the optical flux is overpredicted by the extrapolation from high energies. This discrepancy could be explained by dust extinction in the host galaxy.</description>

      <title>The Structure of the Relativistic Fe Line in GX 340+0 as Viewed with XRISM/Resolve, NICER, and NuSTAR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06289v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a 152 ks XRISM/Resolve observation of the persistently accreting Z source GX 340+0. Simultaneous observations also occurred with NuSTAR and NICER for 22.47 ks and 2.7 ks, respectively. The source covered the normal branch to the flaring branching during the observations. The data from all three missions were modeled concurrently for each spectral branch. The superior energy resolution of XRISM/Resolve reveals structure within the iron emission line complex regardless of spectral state. We model the reprocessed Fe K line with a reflection model tailored for thermal illumination of the accretion disk by a neutron star. The currently available model encompasses the broad components, but narrow emission features remain at the ~5% level. These remaining features may be described by the presence of an ionized plasma in the system as has been observed in the Z source Cygnus X-2, but subsequent updates to the reflection model code may be able to explain these features.</description>

      <title>Optical polarization of stellar-fed active and quiescent supermassive black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the MOPTOP polarimeter on the 2-meter Liverpool Telescope, we conducted a monitoring campaign targeting three optically-discovered TDEs (AT2024bgz, AT2024pvu, and AT2024wsd) and two Bowen flares in AGN (AT2020afhd and AT2019aalc). The three thermal TDEs showed low intrinsic polarization levels ($\Delta P \approx 0$-$6\%$) with stable polarization angles. The Bowen flares also showed variable polarization degree ($ \Delta P \approx 0$-$8\%$), but significant polarization angle variability: AT2020afhd exhibited a $\Delta \theta = 83 \pm 8 \,^\circ$ shift at 150 days post-optical peak, while the AT2019aalc displayed quasi-periodic swings of $\Delta \theta \approx 40 \, ^\circ$ amplitude starting 190 days after peak brightness. The TDEs of this study are well described by models invoking rapid disk formation and reprocessed emission from optically thick outflows, whereas the Bowen flares reveal more complex reprocessing geometries, potentially consistent with TDEs occurring in AGN gas-rich environments. We find that moderate polarization is observed at later times for TDEs with low-Eddington ratios and highly extended photospheres. This implies that, as the accretion level declines, we expect more asymmetric reprocessing layers along a given viewing angle. Since the outflow density and velocity depend sensitively on the inclination angle, we expect TDEs with low-Eddington ratios and highly extended photospheres to exhibit varying levels of polarization. The polarization of AT2019aalc (Seyfert 1) hints at a clumpy, asymmetric outflow and the presence of a tilted, precessing accretion disk, while the polarization of AT2020afhd (AGN type 2) is consistent with the detection of a scattered light echo.</description>

      <title>An updated list of target sources for IceCube neutrino cluster alerts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multimessenger astronomy seeks to uncover the origins of cosmic rays and neutrinos. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory plays a key role in monitoring the sky for revealing high energy neutrinos and neutrino time clusters possibly associated with astrophysical sources, issuing alerts to the astrophysical community for significant excesses. This enables joint observations with other astronomical facilities that could reveal the hidden mechanisms behind the most extreme environments in the Universe. In particular, since 2006 the Gamma-ray Follow-Up (GFU) program shares cluster alerts with partner Imaging Air Cherenkov Telescopes. The faint cosmic signals, searched against large atmospheric backgrounds, are widely masked by the statistical penalties that arise when scanning the full sky in an unbiased way. Hence, targeted analyses of pre-selected neutrino source candidates have proven to increase our search sensitivity. Our understanding of astrophysical environments has improved in recent years, with evidence of neutrino emission from the blazar TXS 0506+056 and the Seyfert galaxy NGC 1068. The aim of expanding observational possibilities and engaging the broader scientific community through public cluster alerts has motivated the creation of a new list of target sources to be monitored by IceCube. This contribution presents the systematic compilation of this list, which extends the well-established focus on gamma-ray bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) to include X-ray bright AGN and binary systems.</description>

      <title>Growing the Intermediate-mass Black Hole in Omega Centauri</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent detection of fast-moving stars in the core of Omega Centauri ($\omega$ Cen), the most massive globular cluster (GC) in the Milky Way, has provided strong evidence for the presence of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH). As $\omega$ Cen, is likely the accreted nucleus of a dwarf galaxy, this IMBH also represents a unique opportunity to study BH seeding mechanisms and their potential role in the formation of supermassive BHs. We present Monte Carlo $N$-body models of $\omega$ Cen with detailed treatments for the loss cone dynamics involving stars, binaries, and compact objects. Starting with BH seeds of $500-5000 \, M_{\odot}$ (consistent with runaway collisions of massive stars), our cluster models grow IMBHs with masses of $\sim50{,}000 \, M_{\odot}$ after 12 Gyr, while successfully reproducing the present-day surface brightness and velocity dispersion profiles of $\omega$ Cen. We find a population of fast stars similar to those observed in the core of $\omega$ Cen, with the fastest stars originating from binaries that were tidally disrupted by the IMBH. The IMBH growth is primarily driven by mergers with $30-40 \, M_{\odot}$ BHs, suggesting a present-day IMBH-BH merger rate of $\sim(4-8)\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$ in $\omega$ Cen-like GCs. Our models also predict a similar rate of tidal disruption events ($\sim5\times10^{-8}~\rm{yr}^{-1}$) which, depending on the frequency of $\omega$ Cen-like GCs per galaxy, may represent anywhere from $0.1\%$ to $10\%$ of the observed TDE rate.</description>

      <title>Mapping the ice stratigraphy in IceCube using camera deployment footage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Neutrino Observatory is a cubic-kilometer Cherenkov array deployed in the deep, glacial ice at the geographic South Pole. An important feature of the instrumented ice are undulations of layers of constant optical properties over the footprint of the detector. During detector construction, these layers were mapped using stratigraphy measurements obtained from a stand-alone laser dust logger. While this system is very precise, its cost does not scale to the instrumented volume envisioned for the proposed IceCube-Gen2 Observatory. Here, we explore the possibility of obtaining equivalent stratigraphy data from camera footage recorded during the deployment of IceCube more than a decade ago. If successful, this could be an alternative technique to be considered for IceCube-Gen2.</description>

      <title>State of the Ice Model in the IceCube Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IceCube is a neutrino observatory located at the South Pole that uses Antarctic ice as a medium for detection of Cherenkov photons. As such, analysis of the data relies on our understanding of the properties of ice within and around the instrumented volume. Over the years we have made significant progress in understanding the glacial ice and now have a comprehensive model that covers many of the relevant aspects of the photon propagation in it. In this report we give a historical overview of the ice description within the IceCube detector, list some of the remaining issues, and assess how much more improvement is still needed. As the IceCube Upgrade is expected to be installed in less than a year, with several new types of calibration devices aiming to further our understanding of ice, this is the perfect time to review the current state of the ice model.</description>

      <title>AXES-SDSS: Solving the puzzle of X-ray emission of optical galaxy groups via a modified Hausdorff distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of X-ray and CMB sources as galaxy groups and clusters is a prerequisite for cluster cosmology. But the identification of groups, especially nearby ones, suffers from projection effects which in turn affect the purity of the sample. In X-rays, the position of the cluster can be given either by the peak of the emission, or by the full information content of the cluster image. Similarly, the optical center, or its member galaxies, can describe the optical counterpart. With the progress of numerical simulations, it is currently feasible to reproduce both the optical group membership assignment and the behavior of the group outskirts in X-rays, and therefore there is an opportunity to define a reproducible group identification procedure. We performed two-way matching between X-ray contours, drawn at a fixed surface brightness level corresponding to a baryonic overdensity of ~500, to the projected galaxy positions using a modified Hausdorff distance (MHD). We used the volume-limited SDSS group catalog to evaluate the purity and completeness of the procedure, maintaining the constant performance of the optical group finder with redshift. We find that an MHD of 0.631 Mpc provides 90% purity. This is a clear improvement over the methods that rely on the optical counterparts' distance and richness. We study the purity versus MHD and the completeness versus redshift and velocity dispersion. Over half of nearby groups have X-ray emission, even those with velocity dispersions as low as 200km/s; this has never previously been demonstrated. The bulk of these groups follow the same scaling relations as the groups with a small separation between the optical and X-ray centers, removing feedback as an explanation for the lack of matches in previous studies. Instead, the problem is caused by over-merging in the optical group catalog construction and source confusion in X-rays.</description>

      <title>Supernovae from stellar mergers and accretors of binary mass transfer: Implications for Type IIP, 1987A-like and interacting supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As most massive stars are born in binary and other multiple-star systems, many are expected to exchange mass with a companion star or merge with it during their lives. This means that most supernovae (SNe) are from such binary products. Here, we focus on hydrogen-rich Type II SNe from accretors of binary mass transfer and stellar mergers. We compute various SN properties such as the explosion energies, nickel yields, and neutron star (NS) kick velocities, but also consider NS masses. We find tight correlations between these parameters and, e.g., the central specific entropy and core compactness. However, there is no obvious relation between these explosion properties and the evolutionary history of the pre-SN stars. We find linear relations between the nickel mass and the SN explosion energy and the NS remnant mass. We further group our models into progenitors of SNe IIP, SN 1987A-like and interacting SNe, predict their SN and SN-progenitor properties and compare to observations. Accretors of binary mass transfer and stellar mergers naturally produce SNe IIP with long plateau durations from progenitors with relatively small CO-cores but large envelope masses (c.f. SN 2015ba). Our models give rise to tight relations between the plateau luminosity and the nickel mass as well as the SN ejecta velocity as inferred observationally for SNe IIP. We speculate that cool/red supergiants at $\log\,L/L_\odot\,{\geq}\,5.5$ encounter enhanced mass loss due to envelope instabilities and could then explode in interacting SNe IIn. The rate of such SNe from our models seems compatible with observations. Some of our binary models explode as $10^6\,L_\odot$ blue supergiants that may have encountered enhanced and/or eruptive mass loss shortly before their SNe and could thus help understand interacting SNe such as SN 1961V and SN 2005gl but also superluminous Type II SNe such as SN 2010jl.

      <title>Wakes from Companion Interactions in Type Ia Supernovae Nebular Emission Line Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermonuclear supernovae (SNe) are the result of the nuclear transformation of carbon/oxygen (C/O) white dwarfs (WDs) to the radioactive element $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ and intermediate mass elements (IMEs) like Ca, Ar, etc. Most progenitor scenarios involve a companion star which donates matter to the exploding white dwarf, implying a fundamental prediction: the formation of a wake in the explosive ejecta as it runs into and moves past the companion star. This wake leaves an indelible imprint on the ejecta's density, velocity, and composition structure that remains fixed as the ejecta reaches homologous expansion. We simulate the interaction of the ejecta and Roche-lobe filling donor in a double degenerate double detonation Type Ia progenitor scenario and explore the detectability of this imprint in late-time nebular phase spectroscopy of Type Ia SNe under the assumption of local heating ($t &gt; 200$ days). At these times, the velocity profiles of forbidden emission lines reflect the velocity distribution of all of the ejecta and the critical electron density for that forbidden line. We explicitly calculate line shapes for the [Co III] $11.89 \mu\mathrm{m}$ line that traces the initial $^{56}\mathrm{Ni}$ distribution and the [Ar III] $8.99 \mu\mathrm{m}$ line, which traces a typical intermediate mass element. We predict the viewing angle dependence of the line shape, present a tool to quickly calculate optically thin line shapes for various 3D density-velocity profiles and discuss JWST observations.</description>

      <title>Optically Overluminous Tidal Disruption Events: Outflow Properties and Implications for Extremely Relativistic Disruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies suggest that tidal disruption events (TDEs) with off-axis jets may manifest as optically overluminous events. To search for jet signatures at late times, we conducted radio observations of eight such optically overluminous ($M_{g, \rm peak} &lt; -20.8$ mag) TDEs with the Very Large Array. We detect radio counterparts in four events. The observed radio luminosities ($L_{\rm 6 GHz} \sim 10^{38}$--$10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$) are two orders of magnitude lower than those of on-axis jetted TDEs, and we find no evidence for off-axis jets within rest-frame time of 3 yrs. Two of them (AT2022hvp and AT2021aeou) exhibit evolving radio emission, consistent with synchrotron emission from non-relativistic outflows launched near the time of first optical light. Two events (AT2020ysg and AT2020qhs) show no statistically significant variability, which can be attributed to either non-relativistic outflows or pre-existing active galactic nuclei. Compared to a control sample of fainter TDEs with $M_{g, \rm peak} &gt; -20.5$ mag observed at similar rest-frame timescales ($t_{\rm rest} ~ 1.5$\,yr), our sample shows systematically more luminous radio emission, suggesting that optically overluminous TDEs may launch more powerful prompt non-relativistic outflows. We speculate that strong general relativistic effects near high-mass black holes ($M_{\rm BH} ~ 10^8\,M_\odot$) may play a key role. These findings motivate further investigation into the nature of relativistic disruptions around massive black holes and the physical conditions necessary for jet formation.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning correction for the calorimeter saturation of cosmic-rays ions with the Dark Matter Particle Explorer: towards the PeV scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Dark MAtter Particle Explorer (DAMPE) instrument is a space-born cosmic-ray detector, capable of measuring ion fluxes up to $\sim$500 TeV/n. This energy scale is made accessible through its calorimeter, which is the deepest currently operating in orbit. Saturation of the calorimeter readout channels start occurring above $\sim$100 TeV of incident energy, and can significantly affect the primary energy reconstruction. Different techniques, analytical and machine-learning based, have been developed to tackle this issue, focusing on the recovery of single-bar deposits, up to several hundreds of TeV. In this work, a new machine-learning technique is presented, which profit of a unique model to correct the total deposited energy in DAMPE calorimeter. The described method is able to generalise its corrections for different ions and extend the maximum detectable incident energy to the PeV scale.</description>

Abstract: Observations of our Galaxy at very-high and ultra-high photon energies have revealed a rich population of sources, many of which have significant angular extension and/or are positionally coincident with energetic pulsars. We assessed whether the properties of these gamma-ray emitters are consistent with the predictions of a model for the non-thermal leptonic emission of a pulsar wind nebula expanding within a supernova remnant, including the possibility of particle escape across the different components of the system up to the ambient medium. We used a multi-zone model framework that describes the transport and radiation of a population of ultra-relativistic electron-positron pairs. The dynamics of the system is retrieved from numerical hydrodynamics simulations, which allows to follow the evolution through advanced stages. Model predictions for typical parameter setups are compared to source catalogs issued by the H.E.S.S. and LHAASO collaborations. If particles remain confined in the nebula, 1-100TeV emission is only partially consistent with the properties of observed sources in terms of surface brightness, angular extent, and photon index. In particular, the systems spend a long time in a bright and soft state that has no equivalent in observations. Conversely, including the possibility of energy-dependent particle escape across the object results in a much better agreement, both in the 1-10TeV range explored with H.E.S.S. or LHAASO-WCDA, and in the 20-100TeV range explored by LHAASO-KM2A. Emission components with intermediate to low brightnesses and large to very large sizes result from particles trapped in the remnant or escaped in the surrounding medium. Particle escape, clearly seen in the form of misaligned jets or halos around middle-aged pulsars, is a very important process in much younger systems with 1-100kyr ages, and shapes their appearance as TeV/PeV sources.</description>

      <title>Using End-to-End Optimized Summary Statistics to Improve IceCube's Diffuse Galactic Fits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing the astrophysical neutrino flux with the IceCube Neutrino Observatory traditionally relies on a binned forward-folding likelihood approach. Insufficient Monte Carlo (MC) statistics in each bin limits the granularity and dimensionality of the binning scheme. A neural network can be employed to optimize a summary statistic that serves as the input for data analysis, yielding the best possible outcomes. This end-to-end optimized summary statistic allows for the inclusion of more observables while maintaining adequate MC statistics per bin. This work will detail the application of end-to-end optimized summary statistics in analyzing and characterizing the galactic neutrino flux, achieving improved resolution in the likelihood contours for selected signal parameters and models.</description>

      <title>Effects of Lorentz invariance violation on particle and photon production in astrophysical sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) on radiation processes in astrophysical sources, focusing on synchrotron and inverse Compton interactions. We derive modified expressions for radiated power and photon energy under LIV assumptions and incorporate them into first-order Fermi acceleration models. Our analysis reveals energy thresholds beyond which LIV significantly alters particle dynamics and photon spectra, introducing non-physical divergences that highlight limitations in perturbative approaches. We model synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) emission in the presence of LIV and assess its consequences for photon fluxes from blazars, including Markarian 501 and the BL Lac population. LIV introduces distinct high-energy emission regions that deviate from standard expectations. Comparisons with observational data, particularly upper limits from the Pierre Auger Observatory, suggest that future multi-messenger observations could constrain LIV parameters through the non-detection of such excesses.</description>

      <title>A Search for Astrophysical Neutrinos from Flaring X-ray Binaries with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, IceCube has observed an excess of astrophysical neutrinos from the Galactic plane. Such a signal may indicate the presence of individual sources or a diffuse neutrino flux from the interactions of Galactic, hadronic cosmic rays. We consider the prospect of neutrino production in galactic X-ray binary systems. A model for neutrino production in the variable jets of these systems is discussed, and how such information may be incorporated within searches for astrophysical neutrinos from these sources. Two ongoing studies are presented on behalf of the IceCube Collaboration using 13 years of cascades and track-like events. In the first study, recently published model predictions are used to motivate the analysis of five selected black-hole X-ray binaries. Gamma-ray data from Fermi-LAT, as well as X-ray data from Swift/BAT and MAXI are used to search for temporal correlations between radiative cycles of the disk-jet system and potential neutrino emission. In the second study, a wider selection of variable X-ray binaries and their Swift/BAT light curves is considered and a stacking search is used to constrain the contribution of this source population to the Galactic neutrino flux.</description>

      <title>Measuring the initial mass of 44Ti in SN 1987A through the 44Sc emission line</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Deriving the mass and large-scale asymmetries of radioactive isotopes offers valuable insights into the complex phases of a supernova explosion. Important examples are $^{56}$Ni, with its decay products $^{56}$Co and $^{56}$Fe, and $^{44}$Ti, which are studied through their X-rays emission lines and provide a powerful diagnostic tool to probe the explosive nucleosynthesis processes in the inner layers of the exploding star. Aims. In this framework, SN 1987A provides a privileged laboratory being the youngest supernova remnant from which the mass of Ti has been estimated. However, some tension exists in determining the initial mass of $^{44}$Ti. Previous analysis, relying on \textit{NuSTAR} and \textit{INTEGRAL} data, report $M_{44} = (1.5 \pm 0.3) \times 10^{-4}$ $M_\odot$ and $M_{44}=(3.1 \pm 0.8) \times 10^{-4} M_\odot$, respectively. In this paper we estimate the initial mass of $^{44}$Ti via its decay product, the $^{44}$Sc emission line at 4.09 keV, using \textit{Chandra} observations. Methods. We perform multi-epoch spectral analysis focusing on the inner part of the remnant, to minimize the contamination from the X-ray emission stemming from the shocked plasma. As a result, we provide the detection of $^{44}$Sc emission line in the central part of SN 1987A with a $\sim$99.7\% (3 $\sigma$) significance. Results. The simultaneous fit of the spectra extracted from observations between 2016 and 2021 provides a line flux of $6.8^{+2.2}_{-2.3}\times 10^{-7}$ photons s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ corresponding to a $^{44}$Ti mass $M_{44}=(1.6\pm0.5) \times 10^{-4} M_\odot$ (errors at the $90\%$ confidence level). The results obtained with our spectral analysis seem to align with those derived with NuSTAR.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flavor composition using High Energy Starting Events with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astrophysical neutrinos provide crucial insights into their sources and play a key role in multi-messenger astronomy. The neutrino flavor composition at Earth allows us to probe the mechanisms of neutrino production and cosmic ray acceleration, as well as the properties of the environments in which they originate. Understanding the flavor composition also offers a unique opportunity to test new physics in the neutrino sector. The IceCube Neutrino Observatory consists of 1 km$^3$ of ice instrumented with photomultipliers that detect neutrinos through Cherenkov radiation from their interaction products. Different neutrino interactions result in distinct event topologies, such as tracks, cascades, and double cascade events, which allow for the identification of the interacting neutrino type and measurement of the flavor composition of the astrophysical neutrino flux. In this contribution we present the results of the measurement of the flavor ratio of the High-Energy Starting Event Selection based on 12 years of data, a high-purity sample of neutrino interactions that occur inside the detector. In addition, we discuss various methods that could further improve the analysis in the future.</description>

      <title>History of UHECR production in Centaurus A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06894v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the UHECR continues to puzzle, however, an excess of detection in the direction of the radio galaxy Centaurus A (Cen A) raises the possibility of this object being the first UHECR source identifiable. Cen A is known to be currently active, and also exhibits known past episodes of high activity. In this work, we investigate whether the known activity episodes in Cen A may be related to the excess events in the \textit{Centaurus region}. Analysing the energy of the events and the overall mass composition of UHECR, we report that an activity in the last $\sim30$ Myr is necessary to explain the excess of events. This period perfectly fits with the timescale where the transition regions and the Giant Lobes must be energized, as revealed by radio and $\gamma$ ray observations.</description>

      <title>Search for High Energy Neutrinos from Infrared Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IceCube has detected a diffuse flux of high-energy neutrinos, whose origin still remains uncertain. Accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs) have been proposed as plausible sources of neutrinos. Candidate sources include AT2019dsg, which is likely a stellar tidal disruption event (TDE), and AT2019dfr, an AGN flare. Both present delayed emission in the IR band with respect to the optical signal. This emission can be interpreted as the reprocessing of X-rays to optical light of the flare by dust located in a torus around the SMBH. An additional study using an optically detected sample of 63 accretion flares revealed another candidate as a potential high-energy neutrino counterpart: AT2019aalc, which is also accompanied by a dust echo. However, follow-up stacking analysis of the 63 nuclear flares using the full IceCube data sample did not show any significant excess over background. Motivated by these three suggested neutrino-TDE correlations, we analyze a more extensive catalog of IR flares, 823 dust-echo-like flares identified using WISE satellite data, against the IceCube 10-year sample of track events from the Northern Sky. Our analysis aims to perform sensitivity studies and assess the potential detectability of neutrino emission from these types of accretion flares. In addition, we carry out a correlation study of the 823 dust echo-like flares against a revised catalog of IceCube high-purity astrophysical alerts, and reevaluate the previous study of 63 nuclear flares against the same revised alerts sample.</description>

      <title>Improvements in the Reconstruction of IceCube Realtime Alerts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2016, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory launched its realtime program. When a neutrino candidate of likely astrophysical origin is detected, a public alert is issued, typically within one minute. These alerts allow the astrophysical community to follow up on the region of the sky where the neutrino likely originated. Initially, the system issued around six track-signature alerts per year, with a highlight being IceCube-170922A, which was later associated with the flaring blazar TXS 0506+056. Since 2019, IceCube has expanded the selection criteria for neutrino candidates, increasing the track alert rate to around 30 per year with additional alerts for cascade signatures of probable astrophysical origin implemented in 2020. This work describes several improvements in the reconstruction of track alerts, which were introduced into the realtime stream in 2024, and details the two algorithms that are alternately used for reconstruction, depending on the reconstructed muon energy. The improvements result in more precise directional localizations, with a factor of 5 (4) reduction in the 50% (90%) contour area. Systematic errors affecting the reconstructions, such as the ice model or the geometry of the detector, have also been investigated to ensure statistical coverage. In addition to its application in the realtime stream, the improvements described here are also being applied to historical alerts with an updated catalog of track alerts forthcoming.</description>

      <title>Very Late Afterpulses and Search for the Neutron Echo in IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While high-energy astrophysical neutrinos are well-established, their flavor composition remains relatively unconstrained. In IceCube, long muon tracks from $\nu_\mu$ charged-current interactions are easily identified but the detector geometry does not allow sufficient resolution to distinguish cascade-type events. The Neutron Echo - a delayed light signal in the detector from neutron capture and de-excitation - can probe the shower's hadronic content and thus the underlying interaction. A significant background arises from late PMT afterpulses, which are temporally coincident with the physics signal. The traditional IceCube data acquisition system has a limited readout window with significant deadtime between triggers, which is insufficient to capture the late pulses. A recently developed deadtime-free readout mode, with an extended window, enables their detection. An observed excess in the delayed time spectrum over the background would be compatible with the Neutron Echo hypothesis. In this contribution, we summarize the physics scope of delayed signals, discuss the timing spectrum of signal and PMT background, highlight the capabilities of the new system for recording late pulses, and emphasize the potential of IceCube for particle identification through delayed signals.</description>

      <title>Influence of interstellar environment near the solar system on cosmic-ray spectra and dipole anisotropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Properties of interstellar environment near the solar system have been probed by missions like IBEX, Voyager over the last two decades. Although it has been well recognized that properties of cosmic rays up to the PeV energy can be affected by the local interstellar environment, detailed modeling has not been done. We show that a three component model for the cosmic ray proton and helium spectra from GV to several PV can naturally explain the energy dependence of the dipole anisotropy of cosmic ray fluxes by considering effects of the local interstellar environment on cosmic ray transport, addressing the so-called cosmic ray anisotropy problem. In particular, it is shown that the dipole amplitude and position angle below $\sim 100$ TeV are very sensitive to the velocity of the heliosphere in the local interstellar cloud and the motion of the local interstellar cloud in the local standard of rest. Better measurement of cosmic ray flux anisotropy by experiments like LHAASO and properties of the local interstellar environment by future missions like IMAP will be able to test this model.</description>

      <title>Impact of Hole-ice Calibration on High Energy Event Reconstruction with the IceCube Upgrade</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Upgrade, currently under construction at the geographic South Pole, is the next development stage of the IceCube detector. It will consist of seven new columns of novel optical sensors and advanced calibration devices densely deployed at the centre of the existing array. The sensors are frozen into the ice in boreholes created by hot water drilling. The refreezing forms hole ice around modules with optical properties that differ from the surrounding glacial ice. A key objective of the IceCube Upgrade is to enhance our understanding of the optical properties of both bulk ice and refrozen hole ice. Precise ice modelling is crucial for the directional reconstruction of TeV-PeV neutrinos, as resolutions at such high energies can be strongly impacted by uncertainties in ice properties and optical sensor response. An improved directional reconstruction performance will translate to a boost in neutrino source sensitivities using IceCube data collected over the last 12 years. In this contribution, we present the expected improvements in reconstruction performance resulting from advances in hole-ice modelling and the resulting impact on IceCube's sensitivity to astrophysical neutrino sources across three distinct event samples.</description>

      <title>All-Sky Cosmic-Ray Anisotropy Update at Multiple Energies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present preliminary results on an updated full-sky analysis of the cosmic-ray arrival direction distribution with data collected by the High-Altitude Water Cherenkov (HAWC) Observatory and IceCube Neutrino Observatory with complementary field of views covering a large fraction of the sky. This study extends the energy range to higher energies. The HAWC Observatory, located at 19$^{\circ}$N has analyzed 8 years of cosmic-ray data over an energy range between 3.0 TeV and 1.0 PeV and confirms an energy-dependent anisotropy in the arrival direction distribution of cosmic rays seen by other experiments. Combined with recently published results from IceCube with 12 years of data, the combined sky maps with 93\% coverage of the sky -- between 70$^{\circ}$N and 90$^{\circ}$S -- and the corresponding angular power spectra largely eliminate biases that result from partial sky coverage.</description>

      <title>The cosmic-ray sea explains the Galactic $\gamma$-ray and $\nu$ diffuse emissions from GeV to PeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The LHAASO collaboration has recently released the spectrum and the angular distribution of the gamma-ray Galactic diffuse emission from 1 TeV to 1 PeV measured with the Kilometer-2 Array (KM2A) and the Water Cherenkov Detector Array (WCDA). We show that those data are in remarkably good agreement with a set of pre-existing models that assume the emission to be produced by the Galactic population of cosmic rays if its spectral shape traces that measured by CALET, DAMPE as well as KASCADE at higher energies. No extra-components besides the CR sea is needed to explain LHAASO results. Spatial dependent CR transport models, although not required to reproduce LHAASO results, are in better agreement with them respect to conventional ones and needed to consistently reproduce Fermi-LAT and neutrino data.</description>

      <title>Investigating the CREDIT history of supernova remnants as cosmic-ray sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07088v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) have long been suspected to be the primary sources of Galactic cosmic rays. Over the past decades, great strides have been made in the modelling of particle acceleration, magnetic field amplification, and escape from SNRs. Yet while many SNRs have been observed in nonthermal emission in radio, X-rays, and gamma rays, there is no evidence for any individual object contributing to the locally observed flux. Here, we propose a particular spectral signature from individual remnants that is due to the energy-dependent escape from SNRs. For young and nearby sources, we predict fluxes enhanced by tens of percent in narrow rigidity intervals; given the percent-level flux uncertainties of contemporary cosmic-ray data, such features should be readily detectable. We model the spatial and temporal distribution of sources and the resulting distribution of fluxes with a Monte Carlo approach. The decision tree that we have trained on simulated data is able to discriminate with very high significance between the null hypothesis of a smooth distribution of sources and the scenario with a stochastic distribution of individual sources. We suggest that this cosmic-ray energy-dependent injection time (CREDIT) scenario be considered in experimental searches to identify individual SNRs as cosmic-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Search for GeV-PeV neutrinos from nova T Coronae Borealis with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The widely anticipated outburst of recurrent nova T Coronae Borealis (T CrB), which is near the end of its 80-year cycle, provides an excellent opportunity to search for neutrinos from novae. Novae are an energetic class of transients, which have been studied for hundreds of years. Because many of them are located nearby, novae provide an excellent astrophysical laboratory to study shock-powered emission in our own backyard. Several recent novae have previously been detected in GeV gamma rays, and the 2021 outburst of RS Ophiuchi was detected up to TeV energies, with evidence for a hadronic origin of the observed emission. Previous searches for GeV-TeV neutrinos from novae, predicted to occur alongside their gamma-ray emission, have been performed using data from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory. However, no significant neutrino signals from novae have yet been observed. We present plans for follow-up of T CrB in real time with IceCube, using datasets spanning GeV to PeV neutrino energies. Due to its closer distance and higher optical flux, which has been well measured in two historical eruptions, the expected neutrino signal from T CrB is several times stronger than that from RS Ophiuchi. Furthermore, T CrB is located in the Northern sky at a declination where IceCube's sensitivity is an additional factor of a few better than at the location of RS Ophiuchi, which is beneficial to this search.</description>

      <title>Results from IceCube Follow-up of Nearby Supernova SN2023ixf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae are of particular interest in multi-messenger astronomy due to their potential to accelerate cosmic rays and produce high-energy neutrinos. One such supernova is the recent SN2023ixf located in M101 (the Pinwheel Galaxy). It is the closest (6.4 Mpc) and brightest (B band magnitude 10.8) core-collapse supernova in nearly a decade. This supernova likely had a progenitor surrounded by dense circumstellar material which, during the supernova, may have produced neutrinos when ejecta collided with the material. I will present results of a follow-up of this supernova using data collected from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory located at the South Pole. We obtain results consistent with background expectations with time-integrated energy flux ($E^2 dN/dE$) upper limits of 0.35 GeV/cm$^2$ for a 32-day time window and 0.44 GeV/cm$^2$ for a 4-day time window, both at 90% confidence level for an $E^{-2}$ power law. These correspond to values of $2.7 \times 10^{48}$ erg for the 32-day time window and $3.5 \times 10^{48}$ erg for the 4-day time window at the supernova.</description>

      <title>IceCube population constraints on neutrino emission by Fermi-LAT detected active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray-bright active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been one of the most promising source classes of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. The first evidence of an IceCube point source was a blazar detected by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT), TXS ~0506+056. Previous analyses have ruled out GeV-bright blazars as the predominant contributor to the high-energy astrophysical neutrino flux under simple correlation assumptions about the relationship between the fluxes of gamma rays and neutrinos. We present results from a more general and more sensitive search for correlation between neutrinos and GeV-selected AGN using improvements in the IceCube statistical methods and 13 years of data. We detect no correlation and set stringent constraints on neutrino emission by populations of GeV-detected AGN. These include constraints on the neutrino emission from subclasses of GeV-detected AGN, including BL Lacs, flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQ) and non-blazar AGN, using stacking analyses testing a variety of hypothesized relationships between neutrino and gamma-ray flux. We also present results from an analysis that is sensitive to a wider range of relationships between the gamma-ray and neutrino signal.</description>

      <title>Kilohertz Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Full Spectrum Analyses and High-density Constraints on Neutron Star Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate Bayesian analyses of the complete gravitational-wave spectrum of binary neutron star mergers events with the next-generation detector Einstein Telescope. Our mock analyses are performed for 20 different signals using the TEOBResumSPA_NRPMw waveform that models gravitational-waves from the inspiral to the postmerger phase. They are employed to validate a pipeline for neutron star's extreme matter constraints with prospective detections and under minimal hypotheses on the equation of state. The proposed analysis stack delivers inferences for the mass-radius curve, the mass dependence of the quadrupolar tidal polarizability parameter, the neutron star's maximum density, the maximum mass and the relative radius, and the pressure-density relation itself. We show that a single event at a signal-to-noise ratio close to the minimum threshold for postmerger detection is sufficient to tightly constrain all the above relations as well as quantities like the maximum mass (maximum density) to precision of ${\sim}6$% (${\sim}10$%) at 90% credibility level. We also revisit inferences of prompt black hole formation with full spectrum signals and find that the latter can be robustly identified, even when the postmerger is not detectable due to a low signal-to-noise ratio. New results on the impact of the initial signal frequency and of the detector configuration (triangular vs. two-L) on the source's parameters estimation are also reported. An improvement of approximately one order of magnitude in the precision of the chirp mass and mass ratio can be achieved by lowering the initial frequency from 20 Hz to 2 Hz. The two-L configuration shows instead significant improvements on the inference of the source declination, due to geographical separation of the two detectors.</description>

      <title>A flexible, GPU-accelerated approach for the joint characterization of LISA instrumental noise and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: LISA data analysis represents one of the most challenging tasks ahead for the future of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. Characterizing the instrument's noise properties while fitting for all the other detectable sources is a key requirement of any robust inference pipeline. Noise estimation will also play a crucial role in searches and parameter estimation of cosmological and astrophysical stochastic signals. Previous studies have tackled this topic by assuming perfect knowledge of the spectral shape of the instrumental noise and of different possible types of GW Stochastic Backgrounds (SGWBs), usually resorting to parametrized templates. Recently, various works that employ template-agnostic methods have been presented. In this work, we take an additional step further, introducing flexible spectral shapes in both the instrumental noise and the stochastic signals. We account for the lack of knowledge of the exact shape of the individual contributions to the overall power spectral density by using splines to represent arbitrary perturbations of the noise and signal spectral densities. We implement a data-driven Reversible Jump MCMC algorithm to fit different components simultaneously and to infer the level of flexibility required under different scenarios. We test this approach on simulated LISA data produced under different assumptions. We investigate the impact of this increased flexibility on the reconstruction of both the injected signal and the noise level, and we discuss the prospects for claiming a successful SGWB detection.</description>

      <title>Optical detection of the X-ray flash in the very fast nova V1674 Her: Optical contribution of the irradiated accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V1674 Her is one of the fastest and brightest novae, characterized by dense optical photometry in the pre-maximum phase, a rise from $g=17$ to 7 mag, in one-fourth of a day. We present a composite theoretical $V$ light curve model of its early rising phase starting from a quiescent brightness of $g=19.2$ mag. Our light curve model consists of a hot and bright white dwarf (WD) and irradiated accretion disk and companion star. We found that the earliest optical detection of ASAS-SN $g$ band brightness of $g=17.0$ at $t=0.014$ day from the onset of thermonuclear runaway can be explained with the irradiated accretion disk and companion star in the X-ray flash phase of a $1.35 ~M_\odot$ WD. This is the first detection in optical of an X-ray flash phase of a nova. Optically thick winds emerge from the WD photosphere at $t=0.04$ day, and optical flux is dominated by free-free emission from optically-thin ejecta just outside the WD photosphere. Our free-free emission model $V$ light curve reasonably reproduces the dense $g$ light curve of Evryscope that spans from $g=14.8$ (at 0.078 day) to $g=7.1$ (at 0.279 day), including a sudden change of slope in the $g$ light curve from slow to rapid rise at $g=14.3$ on day $0.1$. There is no indication of shocking power during the rising phase from $g=14.8$ to 7.1.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of transient phenomena such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs), stellar flares, novae, and supernovae, alongside novel cosmic messengers like high-energy neutrinos and gravitational waves, has transformed astrophysics in recent years. Maximizing the discovery potential of multi-messenger and multi-wavelength follow-up observations, as well as serendipitous detections, requires a tool that rapidly compiles and contextualizes relevant information for each new event. We present Astro-COLIBRI, an advanced platform designed to meet this challenge.
  Astro-COLIBRI integrates a public RESTful API, real-time databases, a cloud-based alert system, and user-friendly clients (a website and mobile apps for iOS and Android). It processes astronomical alerts from multiple streams in real time, filtering them based on user-defined criteria and placing them in their multi-wavelength and multi-messenger context. The platform offers intuitive data visualization, a quick summary of relevant event properties, and an assessment of observing conditions at numerous observatories worldwide.
  We here describe its architecture, data resources, and main functionalities. We highlight the automatic collection of photometric data from a variety of large scale optical surveys, a recently added feature that significantly improves the capabilities of the Astro-COLIBRI platform.</description>

      <title>Calculation of the exposure of GRANDProto300 to cosmic rays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GRANDProto300 is one of the prototype experiments of the Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection. It will feature about 300 radio antenna detectors in Xiaodushang in Dunhuang, China, covering a total geometrical area of about 200 km$^2$. A main scientific goal of GRANDProto300 is the study of cosmic rays in the transition region ($10^{17}\, {\rm eV} &lt; E &lt; 10^{18.5}\, {\rm eV}$). Our study calculates the exposure of GRANDProto300 to cosmic rays and estimates the number of cosmic-ray events to be detected during a fixed observation period. The trigger efficiency reaches 50, 80, and 90% at $10^{17.5}$, $10^{17.9}$, and $10^{18.3}\, {\rm eV}$, respectively. The exposure of GRANDProto300 is 50 km$^2$ day sr at around $10^{17.5}$ eV, and the expected number of observed cosmic rays with energies above $10^{17}$ eV and zenith angles above 65$^{\circ}$ is about 130 events per day. GRANDProto300 will be able to measure the cosmic-ray energy spectrum in $10^{17.2}\, {\rm eV} &lt; E &lt; 10^{19.5}\, {\rm eV}$ through one-year observation, with a statistical precision about five times better than the previous spectral measurement by a mono-fluorescence detector of the Telescope Array Low-Energy Extension. The statistical uncertainty in the measurement of the mean depth of the air-shower maximum $X_{\rm max}$ is about five times better than the previous measurements using radio detectors at $10^{17.5}$ eV; systematic uncertainties should be a dominant contribution limiting our interpretation of the chemical composition of cosmic rays in the transition region.</description>

      <title>Denoising radio pulses from air showers using machine-learning methods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06688v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Giant Radio Array for Neutrino Detection (GRAND) aims to detect radio signals from extensive air showers (EAS) caused by ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic particles. Galactic, hardware-like, and anthropogenic noise are expected to contaminate these signals. To address this problem, we propose training a supervised convolutional network known as an encoder-decoder. This network is used to learn a coded representation of the data and remove specific features from it. This denoiser is trained using high-fidelity air shower simulations specifically tailored to replicate the characteristics of signals detected by GRAND. In this contribution, we describe our machine-learning model and report initial results demonstrating the sensitivity enhancement resulting from our denoising algorithm when applied to realistically simulated GRAND signals with varying signal-to-noise ratios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06695v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: GRANDProto300 (GP300) is a prototype array of the GRAND experiment, designed to validate the technique of autonomous radio-detection of astroparticles by detecting cosmic rays with energies between 10$^{17}$-10$^{18.5}$ eV. This observation will further enable the study of the Galactic-to-extragalactic source transition region. Since November 2024, 46 out of 300 antennas have been operational and collecting data stably. We present our cosmic-ray search pipeline, which involves several filtering steps: (1) coincidence search for signals triggering multiple antennas within a time window, (2) directional reconstruction of events, (3) exclusion of clustered (in time and space) noise events, (4) polarization cut, (5) selection based on the size of the footprint, and (6) other more arbitrary cuts in this preliminary stage, including visual cuts. The efficiency of the pipeline is evaluated and applied to the first batch of data, yielding a set of cosmic-ray candidate events, which we present.</description>

      <title>Signal Model and Energy Reconstruction for the Radio Detection of Inclined Air Showers in the 50-200 MHz Frequency Band</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06698v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The radio emission of cosmic-ray air-showers changes significantly depending on parameters like signal frequency, magnetic field configuration and observing altitude. We use CoREAS simulations to adapt an existing signal model for the radio emission of inclined showers in the 30-80 MHz frequency band to the wide 50-200 MHz band. Our model uses a parametrisation of the charge excess fraction to isolate the geomagnetic emission component. We reconstruct the geomagnetic radiation energy by fitting a lateral distribution function, provided by the model, to the geomagnetic energy fluence distribution of the shower. After we correct for the shower geometry and air density, we correlate the radiation energy with the electromagnetic energy of the shower.
  We show that the method intrinsic energy resolutions &lt; 5% for the sites of the Pierre Auger Observatory and GRANDProto300. For GRANDProto300, we test the reconstruction with simulations of a realistic, sparse antenna grid and with added noise, and find an energy resolution of &lt; 10% with negligible bias. We do a similar study for a much larger array of 10, 000 km2 with 1 km antenna spacing. We find an intrinsic energy resolution of &lt; 10%.</description>

Abstract: A relativistic mean-field model with a crossing term of isovector-scalar and isoscalar mesons, the Cracow crossing terms (CCT) model, has previously been shown to be capable of explaining the light and compact object HESS J1731-347. Here, the model is supplemented with a correct treatment of the phase transition. Applying the thermodynamically consistent Gibbs conditions shows that a mixed-phase system occurs in the core of the neutron star over a wide range of densities, extending up to the neutron star crust, leading to an intriguing stellar structure with a thick and massive crust.</description>

      <title>Measuring cosmic baryon density with FRB and GW data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dispersion measure (DM) analysis of extragalactic fast radio bursts (FRBs) has accounted for all cosmic baryons but remains limited by systematic uncertainties from various parameter degeneracies. We show that the prominent degeneracy between the baryon density ($\Omega_{\rm b}$) and the Hubble constant ($H_0$) can be disentangled through an independent $H_0$ value uniquely inferred from the absolute luminosity distance measurements of gravitational-wave (GW) standard sirens. By combining $104$ localized FRBs with $47$ GW events, we obtain a robust, late-Universe measurement of \ob $=0.0488\pm0.0064$ ($1\sigma$), in concordance with early-Universe observations of CMB + BBN. Notably, incorporating GW data helps not only avoid biases induced by the $H_0$ tension, but also mitigate those from the parameters of diffuse baryon fraction and DM distribution models. Although the current precision ($\sim 13\%$) is limited by sample size, the growing detections of both FRBs and GWs will make their synergy a powerful probe of low-redshift cosmology.</description>

      <title>Electric-Field Reconstruction for Radio Detection of Inclined Air Showers in Three Polarizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate reconstruction of the electric field produced by extensive air showers is essential for the radio-detection technique, as the key parameters of interest of the primary particles that generated the showers are the amplitude, polarization, frequency spectrum, and energy fluence carried by the electric field at each receiving radio antenna. Conventional electric-field reconstruction methods primarily focus on antennas with two horizontal polarizations. In this work, we introduce an analytic $\chi^2$ minimization method that is applicable to both two and three polarizations. This solution has been verified for simple and realistic antenna responses, with a particular focus on inclined air showers. Our method achieves standard deviations better than 4\% and 6\% for the estimation of the Hilbert peak envelope amplitude of the electric field and the energy fluence, respectively, with an antenna-response-dependent bias. Additionally, we have studied the dependence of the method with arrival direction showing that it has a good performance in the zenith range from 63$^\circ$ up to 80$^\circ$. This work also demonstrates that incorporating vertically polarized antennas enhances the precision of the reconstruction, leading to a more accurate and reliable electric-field estimation for inclined air showers.</description>

      <title>Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V: Pioneering Panoptic Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sloan Digital Sky Survey-V (SDSS-V) is pioneering panoptic spectroscopy: it is the first all-sky, multi-epoch, optical-to-infrared spectroscopic survey. SDSS-V is mapping the sky with multi-object spectroscopy (MOS) at telescopes in both hemispheres (the 2.5-m Sloan Foundation Telescope at Apache Point Observatory and the 100-inch du Pont Telescope at Las Campanas Observatory), where 500 zonal robotic fiber positioners feed light from a wide-field focal plane to an optical (R$\sim 2000$, 500 fibers) and a near-infrared (R$\sim 22,000$, 300 fibers) spectrograph. In addition to these MOS capabilities, the survey is pioneering ultra wide-field ($\sim$ 4000~deg$^2$) integral field spectroscopy enabled by a new dedicated facility (LVM-I) at Las Campanas Observatory, where an integral field spectrograph (IFS) with 1801 lenslet-coupled fibers arranged in a 0.5 degree diameter hexagon feeds multiple R$\sim$4000 optical spectrographs that cover 3600-9800 angstroms. SDSS-V's hardware and multi-year survey strategy are designed to decode the chemo-dynamical history of the Milky Way Galaxy and tackle fundamental open issues in stellar physics in its Milky Way Mapper program, trace the growth physics of supermassive black holes in its Black Hole Mapper program, and understand the self-regulation mechanisms and the chemical enrichment of galactic ecosystems at the energy-injection scale in its Local Volume Mapper program. The survey is well-timed to multiply the scientific output from major all-sky space missions. The SDSS-V MOS programs began robotic operations in 2021; IFS observations began in 2023 with the completion of the LVM-I facility. SDSS-V builds upon decades of heritage of SDSS's pioneering advances in data analysis, collaboration spirit, infrastructure, and product deliverables in astronomy.</description>

      <title>Early Warning From Eccentric Compact Binaries: Template Initialization And Sub-dominant Mode Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.07021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Early warning of gravitational waves (GWs) is essential for multi-messenger observations of binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star merger events. In this study, we investigate early warning prospects from eccentric compact binaries, whose mergers are expected to comprise a significant fraction of detected GW events in the future. Eccentric binaries exhibit oscillatory frequency evolution, causing GW frequencies to recur multiple times through their coalescence. Consequently, generating eccentric waveform templates for early warning requires specification of initial conditions. While the standard approach involves initiating waveform generation when the orbit-averaged frequency enters the detector band, we compare this with an alternative approach that uses the periastron frequency as the starting point. Our analysis shows that initializing at the periastron frequency yields an improved signal-to-noise ratio and sky localization. Additionally, including subdominant modes alongside the dominant $(2,2)$ mode leads to further improvements in sky localization. We explore the parameter space of primary mass $m_1 \in [1.4, 15] \, M_\odot$, spin $\chi_1 \in [0, 0.8]$, and eccentricity $e \leq 0.4$ across three detector configurations: O5, Voyager, and 3G. We find that in the O5 (Voyager) configuration, including eccentricity and subdominant modes, the sky localization area can be reduced by $2-80\% (2-85\%)$ at 1000 sq. deg. with increasing eccentricity from $e_5 = 0.1$ to $e_5 = 0.4$, yielding up to $41$ seconds (1 minute) of extra early warning time. For NSBH systems, subdominant modes contribute up to $70$ $(94)\%$ reduction for O5 (Voyager) scenario. In the 3G detector scenario, the sky area reduction due to eccentricity reaches $80\%$ (from $e_{2.5} = 0.1$ to $e_{2.5} = 0.4$) at 100 sq. deg., and subdominant modes enhance the reduction up to $98\%$ for NSBH systems.</description>

      <title>An Intermediate Luminosity GRB 210210A: The early onset of the external forward shock in the X-ray?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have analyzed the prompt and afterglow characteristics of the intermediate luminosity burst ``GRB 210210A". Our prompt emission analysis indicates that GRB 210210A is among the softest long GRBs detected by the Swift-BAT. The time-integrated prompt emission spectrum of GRB 210210A is aptly described by a power law function with an exponential cutoff. The spectral peak energy (E$_{p,z}$) in rest-frame and the E$_{\rm \gamma, iso}$ for this GRB marginally satisfy the 2$\sigma$ Amati correlation, a common feature observed in low/intermediate luminosity GRBs. Notably, an early bump is observed in the Swift-XRT light curve (a rare feature); the optical afterglow light curve, on the other hand, appears to follow a power law decay. However, due to the lack of sufficient early optical observations, we cannot completely rule out the possibility of an early bump in the optical light curve. For the bump observed in the early X-ray light curve, we calculated parameters such as peak time, rise time, decay time, and bulk Lorentz factor ($\Gamma_{0}$ $\sim$ 156), which perfectly satisfy the correlation between the parameters of the onset of the afterglow in GRBs. Both the optical and X-ray (including our observations) light curves exhibit a chromatic break in the late afterglow. Based on the prompt and afterglow parameters, we confirm that the intermediate luminosity GRB 210210A favors a collapsar scenario and is possibly powered by a magnetar.</description>

      <title>Learning from core-collapse supernova remnants on the explosion mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I estimate some typical properties of the jittering jets explosion mechanism (JJEM) to distinguish it from competing supernova explosion models. From the imprints of jittering jets in the outskirts of some CCSN remnants, I estimate the half-opening angles of jittering jets that shape CCSN remnants to be ~1-10 degrees. I also estimate that intermittent accretion disks around the newly born neutron star (NS) can launch jets after they live for only several times their orbital period around the NS. To operate, the JJEM requires intermittent accretion disks that launch jets to amplify the magnetic fields in a dynamo, and the magnetic fields to reconnect and release their energy rapidly. I estimate the width of magnetic field reconnection zones to be ~0.005r~0.1km near the surface of the NS. This width requires a numerical resolution several times smaller than the resolution of present CCSN simulations. I argue, therefore, that existing simulations of the CCSN explosion mechanism are still far from correctly simulating CCSN explosions.</description>

      <title>Constraints on fast radio burst population from the first CHIME/FRB catalog with the Hierarchical Bayesian Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15530v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) have emerged as one of the most dynamic areas of research in astronomy and cosmology. Despite increasing number of FRBs have been reported, the exact origin of FRBs remains elusive. Investigating the intrinsic redshift distributions of FRBs could provide valuable insights into their possible origins and enhance the power of FRBs as a cosmological probe. In this paper, we propose a hierarchical Bayesian inference approach combining with several viable models to investigate the redshift distribution of the CHIME/FRB catalog 1. By utilizing this method, we aim to uncover the underlying patterns and characteristics of the FRB population, i.e. intrinsic redshift distribution of FRB. Taking uncertainties within the observational data and selection effects into consideration, we obtained that the redshift distribution of FRBs is significantly delayed with respect to that of the star formation history.</description>

      <title>Search for Extremely-High-Energy Neutrinos and First Constraints on the Ultrahigh-Energy Cosmic-Ray Proton Fraction with IceCube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01963v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a search for the diffuse extremely-high-energy neutrino flux using $12.6$ years of IceCube data. The nonobservation of neutrinos with energies well above $10 \, \mathrm{PeV}$ constrains the all-flavor neutrino flux at $10^{18} \, \mathrm{eV}$ to a level of $E^2 \Phi_{\nu_e + \nu_\mu + \nu_\tau} \simeq 10^{-8} \, \mathrm{GeV} \, \mathrm{cm}^{-2} \, \mathrm{s}^{-1} \, \mathrm{sr}^{-1}$, the most stringent limit to date. Using these data, we constrain the proton fraction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) above $\simeq 30 \, \mathrm{EeV}$ to be $\lesssim 70\,$% (at $90\,$% CL) if the cosmological evolution of the sources is comparable to or stronger than the star formation rate. This is the first result to disfavor the ``proton-only" hypothesis for UHECRs in this evolution regime using neutrino data. This result complements direct air-shower measurements by being insensitive to uncertainties associated with hadronic interaction models. We also evaluate the tension between IceCube's nonobservation and the $\sim 200 \, \mathrm{PeV}$ KM3NeT neutrino candidate (KM3-230213A), finding it to be $\sim 2.9 \sigma$ based on a joint-livetime fit between neutrino datasets.</description>

      <title>Leaking Outside the Box: Kinetic Turbulence with Cosmic-Ray Escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03820v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study particle acceleration in strongly turbulent pair plasmas using novel 3D Particle-in-Cell simulations, featuring particle injection from an external heat bath and diffusive escape. We demonstrate the formation of steady-state, nonthermal particle distributions with maximum energies reaching the Hillas limit. The steady state is characterized by the equilibration of plasma kinetic and magnetic pressures, which imposes upper limits on the acceleration rate. With growing cold plasma magnetization $\sigma_0$, nonthermal power-law spectra become harder, and the fraction of energy channeled into escaping cosmic rays increases. At $\sigma_0 \gtrsim 1$, the escaping cosmic rays amount to more than 50% of the dissipated energy. Our method allows for kinetic studies of particle acceleration under steady-state conditions, with applications to a variety of astrophysical systems.</description>

      <title>Inferring kilonova ejecta photospheric properties from early blackbody spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.04700v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present simple analytic corrections to the standard blackbody fitting used for early kilonova emission. We consider a spherical, relativistically expanding shell that radiates thermally at a single temperature in its own rest frame. Due to relativistic effects, including Doppler boosting, time delay, and temperature evolution -- the observed temperature is smeared across different polar angles by approximately $\sim10\%$. While the observed spectrum remains roughly consistent with a single-temperature blackbody, neglecting relativistic effects leads to significant systematic inaccuracies: the inferred photospheric velocity and temperature are overestimated by up to $\sim50\%$ for mildly relativistic velocities. By applying our analytic corrections, these deviations are reduced to within $10\%$, even in cases where the photosphere is receding and cooling is considered. Applying our corrections to observed kilonovae (AT2017gfo and the thermal component of GRB211211A) reveals that standard blackbody fitting overestimated the inferred velocities and temperatures by $10\%-40\%$, such deviations can alter the inferred formation of heavy elements.</description>

      <title>Joint Radiative and Kinematic Modelling of X-ray Binary Ejecta: Energy Estimate and Reverse Shock Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10804v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black hole X-ray binaries in outburst launch discrete, large-scale jet ejections which can propagate to parsec scales. The kinematics of these ejecta appear to be well described by relativistic blast wave models original devised for gamma-ray burst afterglows. In previous kinematic-only modelling, a crucial degeneracy prevented the initial ejecta energy and the interstellar medium density from being accurately determined. In this work, we present the first joint Bayesian modelling of the radiation and kinematics of a large-scale jet ejection from the X-ray binary MAXI J1535-571. We demonstrate that a reverse shock powers the bright, early ejecta emission. The joint model breaks the energetic degeneracy, and we find the ejecta has an initial energy of $E_{0} \sim 3 \times 10^{43} \, {\rm erg}$, and propagates into a low density interstellar medium of $n_{\rm ism} \sim 4 \times 10^{-5} \, {\rm cm^{-3}}$. The ejecta is consistent with being launched perpendicular to the disc and could be powered by an efficient conversion of available accretion power alone. This work lays the foundation for future parameter estimation studies using all available data of X-ray binary jet ejecta.</description>

      <title>Dependence of postmerger properties on the thermal heating efficiency in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically perform numerical-relativity simulations for equal-mass binary neutron star mergers for the models varying the thermal index $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ with three different equations of state (EOSs) of the neutron stars (NSs), which are consistent with current multimessenger observational data and state-of-the-art theoretical calculations, and two different binary total mass ($m_0=2.7\ \text{and}\ 2.9~M_\odot$). By varying the value of $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ within the hybrid EOS framework, we investigate the thermal effects on the merger dynamics, gravitational waves (GWs), and the dynamical mass ejection process. We find that the choice of the constant $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ can change the outcome of the remnant for specific EOSs and $m_0$. We also show that the dynamical ejecta mass is affected by the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ value in a different way for different EOSs: for a stiff EOS the ejecta mass is high when $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ is small, while for softer EOSs the largest ejecta is achieved when $\Gamma_{\rm th} = 1.3$--$1.4$. While the inspiral motion does not depend on the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ value, the postmerger phase evolution is highly affected by that. We show that the dominant peak frequency $f_2$ of the postmerger GW spectrum monotonically decreases as the $\Gamma_{\rm th}$ increases. We find that the universal relations between NS macroscopic properties and postmerger GW frequencies are subject to non-negligible thermal uncertainties, which can obscure the universal relation between the tidal deformability and $f_2$.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Clues from Amaterasu: Blazar-Driven Ultrahigh-Energy Cosmic Rays?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16019</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The detection of the Amaterasu event of energy 244 EeV by the Telescope Array, one of the most energetic ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs; $E\gtrsim0.1$ EeV) observed to date, invites scrutiny of its potential source. We investigate whether the nearby blazar PKS~1717+177 at redshift $z=0.137$, located within $2.5^\circ$ of the reconstructed arrival direction, could explain the event under a proton-primary hypothesis. Using a one-zone jet model, we fit the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution of the source, incorporating both leptonic and hadronic cascade emissions from photohadronic interactions inside the jet. Our model supports a cosmic-ray origin of the very-high-energy ($\varepsilon_\gamma\gtrsim 100$ GeV) $\gamma$-ray flux and predicts a subdominant neutrino flux, one order of magnitude lower than from TXS~0506+056. Under Lorentz invariance violation, UHECRs escaping the blazar jet above a specific energy can propagate unattenuated over hundreds of Mpc due to an increase in energy loss length for certain parameter choices. In such a scenario, the Amaterasu event can have a plausible origin from this blazar. Our analysis indicates negligible deflection in the Galactic magnetic field, implying a strong extragalactic magnetic field is required. Our findings provide a compelling multimessenger framework linking UHECRs, $\gamma$-rays, and neutrinos and motivate targeted searches by current and future high-energy neutrino telescopes during increased $\gamma$-ray or X-ray activity of this blazar.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Zoom: Multiscale GRMHD Modeling of Black Hole Accretion and Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16802v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a ``cyclic zoom'' method to capture the dynamics of accretion flows onto black holes across a vast range of spatial and temporal scales in general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations. In this method, we cyclically zoom out (derefine) and zoom in (refine) the simulation domain while using a central mask region containing a careful treatment of the coarsened fluid variables to preserve the small-scale physics, in particular the magnetic field dynamics. The method can accelerate GRMHD simulations by $\gtrsim 10^5$ times for problems with large-scale separation. We demonstrate the validity of the technique using a series of tests, including spherically symmetric Bondi accretion, the Blandford-Znajek monopole, magnetized turbulent Bondi accretion, accretion of a magnetized rotating torus, and the long-term evolution of an accreting torus about both Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. As applications, we simulate Bondi and rotating torus accretion onto black holes from galactic scales, covering an extremely large dynamic range. In Bondi accretion, the accretion rate is suppressed relative to the Bondi rate by $\sim(10r_\mathrm{g}/r_\mathrm{B})^{1/2}$ with a feedback power of $\sim 0.01 \dot{M} c^2$ for vanishing spin, and $\sim 0.1 \dot{M} c^2$ for spin $a\approx0.9$. In the long-term evolution of a rotating torus, the accretion rate decreases with time as $\dot{M}\propto t^{-2}$ on timescales much longer than the viscous timescale, demonstrating that our method can capture not only quasi-steady problems but also secular evolution. Our new method likewise holds significant promise for applications to many other problems that need to cover vast spatial and temporal scales.</description>

      <title>EP250108a/SN 2025kg: A Jet-Driven Stellar Explosion Interacting With Circumstellar Material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17516v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present optical, radio, and X-ray observations of EP250108a/SN 2025kg, a broad-line Type Ic supernova (SN Ic-BL) accompanying an Einstein Probe (EP) fast X-ray transient (FXT) at $z=0.176$. EP250108a/SN 2025kg possesses a double-peaked optical light curve and its spectrum transitions from a blue underlying continuum to a typical SN Ic-BL spectrum over time. We fit a radioactive decay model to the second peak of the optical light curve and find SN parameters that are consistent with the SNe Ic-BL population, while its X-ray and radio properties are consistent with those of low-luminosity GRB (LLGRB) 060218/SN 2006aj. We explore three scenarios to understand the system's multi-wavelength emission -- (a) SN ejecta interacting with an extended circumstellar medium (CSM), (b) the shocked cocoon of a collapsar-driven jet choked in its stellar envelope, and (c) the shocked cocoon of a collapsar-driven jet choked in an extended CSM. Models (b) and (c) can explain the optical light curve and are also consistent with the radio and X-ray observations. We favor model (c) because it can self-consistently explain both the X-ray prompt emission and first optical peak, but we do not rule out model (b). From the properties of the first peak in model (c), we find evidence that EP250108a/SN 2025kg interacts with an extended CSM, and infer an envelope mass $M_{\rm e} \sim 0.1\,\rm M_\odot$ and radius $R_{\rm e} \sim 4 \times 10^{13}$ cm. EP250108a/SN 2025kg's multi-wavelength properties make it a close analog to LLGRB 060218/SN 2006aj, and highlight the power of early follow-up observations in mapping the environments of massive stars prior to core collapse.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux over six seasons using cascade events from the Baikal-GVD expanding telescope</title>

Abstract: We present an updated measurement of the diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux using Baikal-GVD cascade data collected between April 2018 to March 2024. In this period, the detector grew from 15% to 55% of its baseline cubic kilometer configuration. The diffuse astrophysical neutrino flux is detected with a statistical significance of 5.1 $\sigma$. Assuming a single power law model of the astrophysical neutrino flux with identical contribution from each neutrino flavor, the following best-fit parameter values are found: the spectral index $\gamma_{astro}$ = 2.64$^{+0.09}_{-0.11}$ and the flux normalization $\phi_{astro}$ = 4.42$^{+2.31}_{-1.29}\times10^{-18} \text{GeV}^{-1}\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ per one flavor at 100 TeV. These results are broadly consistent with IceCube measurements.</description>

      <title>A mechanism-independent methodology for modeling {\gamma}-ray phaseograms of pulsars in the framework of north-south symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03349v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fermi-LAT observations revealed that each GeV phase-folded light-curve (aka. phaseogram) of the Crab, Geminga, Dragonfly and Vela pulsars consists of two pulses (P1 &amp; P2) and a "Bridge" between them. There is clearly a "bump" at the Bridge phase of Vela's pulse profiles, that could also be regarded as the third pulse (P3). Differently, the Crab's, Geminga's &amp; Dragonfly's Bridges relatively resemble a "valley floor". Despite such an apparent difference, it is interesting to investigate whether their Bridge emissions are still within the same general picture as Vela's. Assuming the north-south symmetry, we would expect the fourth component (Bridge2/P4) to exist as well. However, such a hypothetical Bridge2/P4 is not intuitively identified on $\gamma$-ray phaseograms of the Crab, Geminga, Dragonfly and Vela pulsars. It is also intriguing to hint at the rationale for the non-discovery of Bridge2/P4. Our prototypical toy model is free of assumptions on emission regions or radiation mechanisms. Instead, it assumes a north-south symmetric geometry and one circularly symmetric beam per hemisphere, while taking into account Doppler shifts (the most innovative element), time delays and energy-dependent beam shapes. Tentative compatibility of our fitting results with wind models is reported. Notably, for the Crab pulsar, we found a preliminary qualitative correlation between our model predictions and the IXPE results on X-ray polarisation. The softer $\gamma$-ray pulsation of the Geminga pulsar is found to span over its full phase. Prompted by systematic evaluations, we outline some potential improvements for our toy model.</description>

      <title>Localisation and host galaxy identification of new Fast Radio Bursts with MeerKAT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurately localising fast radio bursts (FRBs) is essential for understanding their birth environments and for their use as cosmological probes. Recent advances in radio interferometry, particularly with MeerKAT, have enabled the localisation of individual bursts with arcsecond precision. In this work, we present the localisation of 15 apparently non-repeating FRBs detected with MeerKAT. Two of the FRBs, discovered in 2022, were localised in 8 second images from the projects which MeerTRAP was commensal to, while eight were localised using the transient buffer pipeline, and another one through SeeKAT, all with arcsecond precision. Four additional FRBs lacked TB triggers and sufficient signal, limiting their localisation only to arcminute precision. For nine of the FRBs in our sample, we identify host galaxies with greater than 90% confidence, while two FRBs have ambiguous associations with two host galaxy candidates. We measured spectroscopic redshifts for six host galaxies, ranging from 0.33 to 0.85, demonstrating MeerKAT's sensitivity to high redshift FRBs. For galaxies with sufficient photometric coverage, we performed spectral energy those of known FRB hosts. This work represents one of the largest uniform samples of well-localised distant FRBs to date, laying the groundwork for using MeerKAT FRBs as cosmological probes and understand how FRB hosts evolve at high redshift.</description>

Abstract: Measurement of gravitational waves can provide precision tests of the nature of black holes and compact objects. In this work, we test Giddings' non-violent non-locality proposal, which posits that quantum information is transferred via a nonlocal interaction that generates metric perturbations around black holes. In contrast to firewalls, these quantum fluctuations would be spread out over a larger distance range -- up to a Schwarzschild radius away. In this letter, we model the modification to the gravitational waveform from non-violent non-locality. We modify the nonspinning EOBNRv2 effective one body waveform to include metric perturbations that are due to a random Gaussian process. We find that the waveform exhibits random deviations which are particularly important in the late inspiral-plunge phase. We find an optimal dephasing parameter for detecting this effect with a principal component analysis. This is particularly intriguing because it predicts random phase deviations across different gravitational wave events, providing theoretical support for hierarchical tests of general relativity. We estimate the constraint on the perturbations in non-violent non-locality with events for the LIGO-Virgo network and for a third-generation network.</description>

      <title>Non-adiabatic dynamics of eccentric black-hole binaries in post-Newtonian theory</title>

Abstract: Eccentric black-hole binaries are among the most awaited sources of gravitational waves, yet their dynamics lack a consistent framework that provides a detailed and physically robust evolutionary description due to gauge issues. We present a new set of non-orbit-averaged equations, free from radiation-reaction gauge ambiguities, that accurately describe the evolution of orbital elements for eccentric, non-spinning black-hole binaries. We derive these equations by mapping the Keplerian orbital elements to a new set of characteristic parameters using energy and angular momentum definitions combined with near-identity transformations. The resulting framework is valid for arbitrary eccentricities, including parabolic and hyperbolic limits. Using this framework, we demonstrate the strictly observable effects of the non-adiabatic emission of gravitational waves -- characteristic of eccentric binaries -- on the orbital parameters. Furthermore, we assess the regime of validity of the widely used orbit-averaged equations first derived by Peters in 1964. Importantly, their breakdown becomes evident at the first pericenter passage, implying that the validity of the orbit-averaged approximation cannot be inferred solely from binary initial conditions. The formalism we introduce, accurate up to 2.5 post-Newtonian order, aims to provide a robust tool for making reliable astrophysical predictions and accurately interpreting current and future gravitational wave data, paving the way for deeper insights into the dynamics of eccentric black hole binaries.</description>

      <title>Transfer Learning for Transient Classification: From Simulations to Real Data and ZTF to LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning has become essential for automated classification of astronomical transients, but current approaches face significant limitations: classifiers trained on simulations struggle with real data, models developed for one survey cannot be easily applied to another, and new surveys require prohibitively large amounts of labelled training data. These challenges are particularly pressing as we approach the era of the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), where existing classification models will need to be retrained using LSST observations. We demonstrate that transfer learning can overcome these challenges by repurposing existing models trained on either simulations or data from other surveys. Starting with a model trained on simulated Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) light curves, we show that transfer learning reduces the amount of labelled real ZTF transients needed by 95% while maintaining equivalent performance to models trained from scratch. Similarly, when adapting ZTF models for LSST simulations, transfer learning achieves 94% of the baseline performance while requiring only 30% of the training data. These findings have significant implications for the early operations of LSST, suggesting that reliable automated classification will be possible soon after the survey begins, rather than waiting months or years to accumulate sufficient training data.</description>

Abstract: Neutron stars are compact, relativistic bodies that host several extremes of modern physics. An exciting development in recent years has been the opportunity to probe this exotic physics by observing compact-binary coalescences using sensitive gravitational-wave and electromagnetic instruments. To maximise the science inferred from these measurements, we require models that accurately represent the physics. In this study, we consider the post-Newtonian approximation to general relativity for the modelling of neutron-star dynamics, with a particular view to model dynamical tides at the late stages of binary inspiral. We develop the post-Newtonian perturbation equations for a non-rotating star and show that the perturbation problem is Hermitian and therefore derives from a fundamental Lagrangian. Establishing this Lagrangian system leads to a conserved symplectic product and canonical energy for the perturbations. We determine the orthogonality condition for the post-Newtonian oscillation modes, which in turn forms the foundation of a mode-sum representation often used for dynamical tides. Finally, we demonstrate that the perturbation formulation is unique.</description>

      <title>Extended Emission Line Region in a Post-Starburst Galaxy Hosting Tidal Disruption Event AT2019qiz and Quasi-periodic Eruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the extended emission line region (EELR) in the host galaxy of the tidal disruption event (TDE) AT2019qiz, utilizing VLT/MUSE integral-field spectroscopy. The high spatial-resolution data reveal a bi-conical emission structure approximately $3.7~\mathrm{kpc}$ in scale within the galactic center, characterized by a prominent [OIII] line in the nucleus and significant [NII] line emission extending into the EELR. Spectral analysis of the EELR indicates line ratios consistent with Seyfert ionization in the center and LINER-type ionization in the outer diffuse region, suggesting ionization from galactic nuclear activity. The required ionizing luminosity, estimated from the H$\rm{\alpha}$ and H$\rm{\beta}$ luminosities based on the photoionization and recombination balance assumption, is $10^{41.8}$ $\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for all spaxels classified as active galactic nucleus (AGN), and $10^{40.7}$ $\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$ for spaxels in the central $0.9~\mathrm{kpc}$ Seyfert region. However, the current bolometric luminosity of the nucleus $L_{\text{bol}} \leq 10^{40.8}\,\mathrm{erg\,s^{-1}}$, estimated from quiescent-state soft X-ray observations, is insufficient to ionize the entire EELR, implying a recently faded AGN or a delayed response to historical activity. Stellar population analysis reveals a post-starburst characteristic in the EELR, and the gas kinematics show disturbances and non-circular components compared to the stellar kinematics. Notably, the recent detection of quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) in the X-ray light curve of AT2019qiz confirms the TDE-QPE association. Our findings provide direct evidence for an AGN-like EELR in the host galaxy of the nearest TDE with QPE detection, offering new insights into the complex interplay between TDEs, QPEs, AGN activity, and host galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>Interface modes in inspiralling neutron stars: A gravitational-wave probe of first-order phase transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06181v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At the extreme densities in neutron stars, a phase transition to deconfined quark matter is anticipated. Yet masses, radii and tidal deformabilities offer only indirect measures of a first-order phase transition, requiring many detections to resolve or being ineffective observables if the discontinuity exists at lower densities. We report on a smoking-gun gravitational-wave signature of a first-order transition: the resonant tidal excitation of an interface mode. Using relativistic perturbation theory with an equation-of-state family informed by chiral effective field theory, we show that such a resonance may be detectable with next-generation interferometers and possibly already with LIGO A+ for sufficiently loud events.</description>

      <title>Approximating neutron-star radii using gravitational-wave only measurements with symbolic regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves emitted by binary neutron-star inspirals carry information on components' masses and tidal deformabilities, but not directly radii, which are measured by electromagnetic observations of neutron stars. To improve the multi-messenger astronomy studies of neutron stars, an expression for neutron-star radii as a function of gravitational-wave only data would be advantageous, as it would allow to compare information from two different channels. In order to do so, a symbolic regression method, pySR, is trained on TOV solutions to piecewise polytropic EOS input to discover an approximate symbolic expression for the neutron-star radius as a function of gravitational-wave measurements only. The approximation is tested on piecewise polytropic EOS NS data, as well as on NS sequences based on selected realistic (non-polytropic) dense-matter theory EOSs, achieving consistent agreement between the ground truth values and the symbolic approximation for a broad range of NS parameters covering current astrophysical observations, with average radii differences of few hundred meters. Additionally, the approximation is applied to the GW170817 gravitational-wave mass and tidal deformability posteriors, and compared to reported inferred radius distributions.</description>

      <title>Fresh look at the diffuse ALP background from supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protoneutron stars, highly compact objects formed in the core of exploding supernovae (SNe), are powerful sources of axion-like particles (ALPs). In the SN core, ALPs are dominantly produced via nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung and pion conversion, resulting in an energetic ALP spectrum peaked at energies $\mathcal{O}(100)\,\rm MeV$. In this work, we revisit the diffuse ALP background, produced from all past core-collapse supernovae, and update the constraints derived from Fermi-LAT observations. Assuming the maximum ALP-nucleon coupling allowed by the SN 1987A cooling, we set the upper limit $g_{a \gamma \gamma} \lesssim 2 \times 10^{-13}\,\rm GeV^{-1}$ for ALP mass $m_a\lesssim 10^{-10}\,\rm eV$, which is approximately a factor of two improvement with respect to the existing bounds. On the other hand, for $m_a \gtrsim 10^{-10}\,\rm eV$, we find that including pion conversion strengthens the bound on $g_{a\gamma \gamma}$, approximately by a factor of two compared to the constraint obtained from bremsstrahlung alone. Additionally, we present a sensitivity study for future experiments such as AMEGO-X, e-ASTROGAM, GRAMS-balloon, GRAMS-satellite, and MAST. We find that the expected constraint from MAST would be comparable to Fermi-LAT bound. However, SN 1987A constraint remains one order of magnitude stronger as compared to the bound derived from the current and future gamma-ray telescopes.</description>

      <title>Stellar distributions around supermassive black holes in gas-rich nuclear star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stellar distribution around supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in gas-rich nuclear star clusters (NSCs). NSCs could contain vast amounts of gas, which contribute significantly to shaping the stellar distribution, typically altering the stellar density cusp from the usual Bahcall \&amp; Wolf 1976 solution and consequently affecting the dynamics in the NSC. The dense gaseous environment in NSCs gives rise to dynamical phenomena that are otherwise rare in other gas-free environments. Here we extend the derivation introduced in Bahcall \&amp; Wolf 1976 to include an additional energy dissipation term associated with gas drag. We examine the effect of different forms of gas drag on the stellar density distribution. Finally, we discuss implications on the rates of tidal disruption events and other transients triggered by stellar interactions in gas-rich galactic nuclei.</description>

      <title>Optical appearance of Schwarzschild black holes with optically thin and thick accretion disks at various inclination angles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22891v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we systematically investigate the optical appearance of a Schwarzschild black hole illuminated by three geometrically thin accretion disk models under varying observational inclination angles. Based on the geometric relationship between the black hole and observer, we first divide the accretion disk into co-side and counter-side semi-disks. We then analyze light ray trajectories, and calculate the total number of orbits and transfer functions for both semi-disks. The results reveal distinct inclination-dependence of lensed regions on different semi-disks: as inclination increases, the lensed region contracts for the counter-side semi-disk while expanding for the co-side one. Furthermore, through explicit specification of the emission profiles of the three models, we present optical images for both optically thin and thick disk scenarios at different inclinations. The results demonstrate that: (i) the bright rings in all three models become progressively compressed and deviate from circularity as inclination increases; (ii) for thick disks, partial rings are obscured and the overall intensity is lower than thin disks. These results may advance our understanding of general black hole imaging processes and provide a new approach to test gravitational theories through optical morphology studies.</description>
