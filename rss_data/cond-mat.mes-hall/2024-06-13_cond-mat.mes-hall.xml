      <title>Interface-induced magnetization in altermagnets and antiferromagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets is a class of antiferromagnetic materials which has electron bands with lifted spin degeneracy in momentum space but vanishing net magnetization and no stray magnetic fields. Because of these properties, altermagnets have attracted much attention for potential use in spintronics. We here show that despite the absence of bulk magnetization, the itinerant electrons in altermagnets can generate a magnetization close to edges and vacuum interfaces. We find that surface-induced magnetization can also occur for conventional antiferromagnets with spin-degenerate bands, where the magnetization from the itinerant electrons originates from a subtle yet nonvanishing redistribution of the probability density on the unit cell level. An intuitive explanation of this effect in a phenomenological model is provided. In the altermagnetic case, the induced magnetization has a different spatial dependence than in the antiferromagnetic case due to the anisotropy of the spin-polarized Fermi surfaces, causing the edge-induced Friedel oscillations of the spin-up and spin-down electron densities to have different periods. We employ both a low-energy effective continuum model and lattice tight-binding calculations. Our results have implications for the usage of altermagnets and antiferromagnets in nanoscale spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Bound State Geometry in High-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is generally believed that the non-Hermitian effect (NHSE), due to its non-reciprocal nature, creates barriers for the appearance of impurity bound states. In this paper, we find that in two and higher dimensions, the presence of geometry-dependent skin effect eliminates this barrier such that even an infinitesimal impurity potential can confine bound states in this type of non-Hermitian systems. By examining bound states around Bloch saddle points, we find that non-Hermiticity can disrupt the isotropy of bound states, resulting in concave dumbbell-shaped bound states. Our work reveals a geometry transition of bound state between concavity and convexity in high-dimensional non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Materials for Quantum Technologies: a Roadmap for Spin and Topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This Roadmap provides an overview of the critical role of materials in exploiting spin and topology for next-generation quantum technologies including computing, sensing, information storage and networking devices. We explore the key materials systems that support spin and topological phenomena and discuss their figures of merit. Spin and topology-based quantum technologies have several advantages over their classical, charged-based counterparts, including non-volatility, faster data processing speeds, higher integration densities and lower power consumption. We discuss the main challenges facing the field, identify strategies to overcome them, and provide a realistic outlook on future possibilities of spin-based and topological materials in quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Bottlenecks in Impedance Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Impedance spectroscopy is vital for material characterization and assessing electrochemical device performance. It provides real-time analysis of dynamic processes such as electrode kinetics, electrons, holes or ion transport, and interfacial or defect driven phenomena. However, the technique is sensitive to experimental conditions, introducing potential variability in results. The intricate interplay of transient effects within the realm of spectral impedance analyses introduces a layer of complexity that may impede straightforward interpretations. This demands a nuanced approach for refining analytical methodologies and ensuring the fidelity of impedance characterization once the dynamic contributions of transient ingredients cannot be disentangled from the underlying steady-state characteristics. While inherent systematic errors impose a practical limit (accuracy floor) on achievable measurement accuracy, this paper offers qualitative and quantitative insights into how specific procedures affect this limit. Only by effectively addressing these errors can we push beyond this constraint.</description>

      <title>Coherent Erbium Spin Defects in Colloidal Nanocrystal Hosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate nearly a microsecond of spin coherence in Er3+ ions doped in cerium dioxide nanocrystal hosts, despite a large gyromagnetic ratio and nanometric proximity of the spin defect to the nanocrystal surface. The long spin coherence is enabled by reducing the dopant density below the instantaneous diffusion limit in a nuclear spin-free host material, reaching the limit of a single erbium spin defect per nanocrystal. We observe a large Orbach energy in a highly symmetric cubic site, further protecting the coherence in a qubit that would otherwise rapidly decohere. Spatially correlated electron spectroscopy measurements reveal the presence of Ce3+ at the nanocrystal surface that likely acts as extraneous paramagnetic spin noise. Even with these factors, defect-embedded nanocrystal hosts show tremendous promise for quantum sensing and quantum communication applications, with multiple avenues, including core-shell fabrication, redox tuning of oxygen vacancies, and organic surfactant modification, available to further enhance their spin coherence and functionality in the future.</description>

      <title>How to accurately measure the mobility and viscosity of two-dimensional carriers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, a hydrodynamic behavior of ultrahigh mobility viscous two-dimensional electron gas in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well was intensively studied based on relevant negative magnetoresistance (NMR) data. The two-dimensional Gurzhi model with(without) simplification combined with extra assumptions on electron-electron collisions rate often lead to a certain agreement with experiment. We provide ab initio analysis of the NMR data[Q. Shi et al, Phys. Rev. B. 89, 201301(R) (2014)] and demonstrate exceptional agreement with the uncut Gurzhi model attracting a single fitting parameter of the effective stream width. Our approach allows one to identify the intrinsic carrier mobility higher than that deduced by conventional methods. The NMR data analysis is proposed for powerful tool for two-dimensional viscometry.</description>

      <title>A general solution for the response of materials under radiation and tilted magnetic field: semi-classical regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Berry curvature dipole is well-known to cause Hall conductivity. This study expands on previous results to demonstrate how two- and three-dimensional materials react under a tilted magnetic field in the linear and nonlinear regimes. We show how the Hall effect has a quantum origin by deriving the general form of intrinsic and extrinsic currents in materials under a tilted magnetic field. Our focus is on determining the linear and nonlinear response of two-dimensional materials. We also demonstrate that as the result of the perpendicular component of the magnetic field a classic-quantum current can occur in two-dimensional materials and topological crystalline insulators in second harmonic generation and ratchet responses. The findings of this research may provide insight into the transport characteristics of materials in the semi-classical regime and initiate a new chapter in linear and nonlinear Hall effects.</description>

      <title>Hofstadter spectrum in a semiconductor moir\'e lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Hofstadter spectrum of a twisted $\mathrm{WSe_2/MoSe_2}$ heterobilayer has been observed in experiment [C. R. Kometter, et al. Nat.Phys.19, 1861 (2023)], but the origin of Hofstadter states remains unclear. Here, we present a comprehensive theoretical interpretation of the observed Hofstadter states by calculating its accurate Hofstadter spectrum. We point out that the valley Zeeman effect, a unique feature of the transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) materials, plays a crucial role in determining the shape of the Hofstadter spectrum, due to the narrow bandwidth of the moir\'e bands. This is distinct from the graphene-based moir\'e systems. We further predict that the Hofstadter spectrum of the moir\'e flat band, which was not observed in experiment, can be observed in the same system with a larger twist angle $2^\circ\lesssim\theta \lesssim 3^\circ$. Our theory paves the way for further studies of the interplay between the Hofstadter states and correlated insulting states in such moir\'e lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Bright electrically contacted circular Bragg grating resonators with deterministically integrated quantum dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cavity-enhanced emission of electrically controlled semiconductor quantum dots is essential in developing bright quantum devices for real-world quantum photonic applications. Combining the circular Bragg grating (CBG) approach with a PIN-diode structure, we propose and implement an innovative concept for ridge-based electrically-contacted CBG resonators. Through fine-tuning of device parameters in numerical simulations and deterministic nanoprocessing, we produced electrically controlled single quantum dot CBG resonators with excellent electro-optical emission properties. These include multiple wavelength-tunable emission lines and a photon extraction efficiency (PEE) of up to (30.4$\pm$3.4)%, where refined numerical optimization based on experimental findings suggests a substantial improvement, promising PEE &gt;50%. Additionally, the developed quantum light sources yield single-photon purity reaching (98.8$\pm$0.2)% [post-selected: (99.5$\pm$0.3)%] and a photon indistinguishability of (25.8$\pm$2.1)% [post-selected: (92.8$\pm$4.8)%]. Our results pave the way for high-performance quantum devices with combined cavity enhancement and deterministic charge-environment controls, advancing the development of photonic quantum information systems such as complex quantum repeater networks.</description>

      <title>Beyond Attraction: A Novel Approach to Repulsive Casimir-Lifshitz Forces using Controllable Offstoichiometry in Gapped Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We uncover a novel physical mechanism that enables a switch between attractive and repulsive Casimir forces when a Teflon surface interacts with a new form of quantum material (i.e., gapped metal) surface across different liquid media. We demonstrate the discovery of a zero-frequency Casimir effect, which, for the first time, reveals the potential for quantum switching within nanometer distances-a scale previously thought to be unattainable. Hence, our results introduce a new method to induce phase (stoichiometry)-controlled attraction-repulsion transitions and achieving quantum levitation in a liquid medium by tuning the liquid environment. This study thus not only advances our understanding of quantum forces at the nanoscale via their correlation to dielectric properties of involved materials but also opens up exciting possibilities for their manipulation in novel ways, forming the basis towards innovative advancements in nanoscale technology.</description>

      <title>Two-tone spectroscopy of high-frequency quantum circuits with a Josephson emitter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform two-tone spectroscopy on quantum circuits, where high-frequency radiation is generated by a voltage-biased superconductor-normal-superconductor Josephson junction and detection is carried out by an ancillary microwave resonator. We implement this protocol on two different systems, a transmon qubit and a $\lambda/4$ resonator. We demonstrate that this two-tone Josephson spectroscopy operates well into the millimeter-wave band, reaching frequencies larger than 80 GHz, and is well-suited for probing highly coherent quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Massive 1D Dirac Line, Solitons and Reversible Manipulation on the Surface of a Prototype Obstructed Atomic Insulator, Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topologically trivial insulators can be classified into atomic insulators (AIs) and obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) depending on whether the Wannier charge centers are localized or not at spatial positions occupied by atoms. An OAI can possess unusual properties such as surface states along certain crystalline surfaces, which advantageously appear in materials with much larger bulk energy gap than topological insulators, making them more attractive for potential applications. In this work, we show that a well-known crystal, silicon (Si) is a model OAI, which naturally explains some of Si's unusual properties such as its famous (111) surface states. On this surface, using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we reveal sharp quasi-1D massive Dirac line dispersions; we also observe, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), topological solitons at the interface of the two atomic chains. Remarkably, we show that the different chain domains can be reversibly switched at the nanometer scale, suggesting the application potential in ultra-high density storage devices.</description>

      <title>Anomalous Nernst Effect in Ferromagnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a three-dimensional Dirac semimetal the time reversal symmetry (TRS) or the inversion symmetry (IS) is not broken. With either of these symmetries broken, the Dirac points in the three-dimensional band structure split up into pairs of so-called Weyl points. The ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals (FMWSM), such as Co3Sn2S2, feature pairs of Weyl points characterized by the opposite chiralities. In this communication we study FMWSM based on TRS broken continuum and lattice Hamiltonians. The latter one is more realistic and represents Co3Sn2S2. These models include all essential ingredients leading to the formation of a pair of Weyl nodes and tilted Weyl cones. Our analysis shows a large anomalous Nernst conductivity which is unlocked due to the divergent Berry curvature - a local manifestation of the geometric properties of electronic wavefunctions - at Weyl points.</description>

      <title>Interfacial Dynamics and Catalytic Behavior of Single Ni Atom Site</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08146v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single-atom catalysts (SACs) have garnered significant interest due to their ability to reduce metal particles to the atomic scale, enabling finely tunable local environments and enhanced catalytic properties in terms of reactivity and selectivity. Despite this potential, their application has largely been confined to small-molecule transformations as metal-catalyzed reaction. In this study, we present a diverse single-atom nickel (Ni) catalyst established via a nanoporous carbon (NPC) supported practice. This catalyst represents a breakthrough by achieving the bond formation between carbon and nitrogen and interfacial dynamics in the SAC. The present first principle-based density functional simulations establish the reaction dynamics and catalytic behaviour of such SAC. This dynamic nature comprises an exclusive nitrogen intercalated site showing excellent base effects. This base quickly tunes the interfacial atmosphere, enabling dynamic movement of adatoms into the NPC species, significantly changing the reaction path in Ni SACs due to superior steric effects. The research demonstrates that SACs can extend the capabilities of catalytic systems to include a wider range of complex reactions, offering substantial promise for the development of new, efficient synthetic methods for creating value-added molecular products.</description>

      <title>Impact of environmental interaction on bias induced circular current in a ring nanojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The specific role of environmental interaction on bias driven circular current in a ring nanojunction is explored, for the first time to the best of our concern, within a tight-binding framework based on wave-guide theory. The environmental interaction is implemented through disorder in backbone sites where these sites are directly coupled to parent lattice sites of the ring via single bonds. In absence of backbone disorder circular current becomes zero for a lengthwise symmetric nanojunction, while it increases with disorder which is quite unusual, and after reaching a maximum it eventually drops to zero in the limit of high disorder. The effects of ring-electrode interface configuration, ring-backbone coupling, different types of backbone disorder and system temperature are critically investigated to make the present analysis comprehensive. All the studied results are valid for a broad range of physical parameters, giving us confidence that the outcomes of this theoretical work can be verified in a laboratory.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion blinking from the conical phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the transition between skyrmionic and non-topological states has been widely explored as a bit operation for information transport and storage in spintronic devices, the ultrafast dynamics of such transitions remains challenging to observe and understand. Here, we utilize spin-dynamics simulations and harmonic transition state theory (HTST) to provide an in-depth analysis of the nucleation of skyrmionic states in helimagnets. We reveal a persistent blinking (creation-annihilation) phenomenon of these topological states under specific conditions near the phase boundary between skyrmion and conical states. Through a minimum-energy path analysis, we elucidate that this blinking behavior is favored by the formation of chiral bobber (CB) surface states and that the collapse of CBs differs from that of skyrmions in thin films due to their different oscillation modes. We further employ HTST to estimate the typical blinking time as a function of the applied magnetic field and temperature. Finally, we illustrate the practical use of skyrmion blinking for controlled probabilistic computing, exemplified by a skyrmion-based random-number generator.</description>

      <title>Chiral edge transport along domain walls in magnetic topological insulator nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall insulators are topologically characterized by non-zero integer Chern numbers, the sign of which depends on the direction of the exchange field that breaks time-reversal symmetry. This feature allows the manipulation of the conducting chiral edge states present at the interface of two magnetic domains with opposite magnetization and opposite Chern numbers. Motivated by this broad understanding, the present study investigates the quantum transport properties of a magnetized $Bi_2Se_3$ topological insulator nanoribbon with a domain wall oriented either parallel or perpendicular to the transport direction. Employing an atomistic tight-binding model and a non-equilibrium Green's function formalism, we calculate the quantum conductance and explore the nature of the edge states. We elucidate the conditions leading to exact conductance quantization and identify the origin of deviations from this behavior. Our analysis shows that although the conductance is quantized in the presence of the horizontal domain wall, the quantization is absent in the perpendicular domain wall case. Furthermore, the investigation of the spin character of the edge modes confirms that the conductance in the horizontal domain wall configuration is spin polarized. This finding underscores the potential of our system as a simple three dimensional spin-filter device.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tunable and Enhanced Nonlinearity of Moir\'e Exciton-Polaritons in Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory for nonlinear optical response of moir\'e exciton-polaritons in bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Our theory allows to study the tunnel-coupled intralayer and interlayer excitonic modes for a wide range of twist angles ($\theta$), external electric field, and light-matter coupling, providing insights into the hybridization regime inaccessible before. Specifically, we account for the Umklapp scattering processes of two exciton-polaritons responsible for enhanced nonlinearity, and show that it is crucial for describing interactions at strong hybridization. We reveal a regime of attractive nonlinearity for moir\'e polaritons, stemming from the anisotropic Coulomb interactions, which can explain some of experimental features of optical response in TMD bilayers. Furthermore, within our theory we demonstrate that the attractive nonlinearity can be tuned into repulsive by applying an external electric field. Our findings show that nonlinear moir\'e polaritons offer a controllable platform nonlinear polaritonic devices.</description>

      <title>Cooling of nuclear spin systems in semiconductor structures due to dynamic polarization by strongly localized electrons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of cooling the spins of lattice nuclei in semiconductor structures by dynamic polarization with optically oriented electrons. Our consideration is not restricted to short spin correlation times of electrons. Therefore, it applies not only to electrons weakly bound to shallow donors, but also to electrons localized in quantum dots or deep impurity centers. The main result of the theory is that, in order to polarize nuclear spins efficiently with strongly localized electrons, one should apply external magnetic fields by far exceeding the local field of nuclear spin-spin interaction.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field and topological chirality from Umklapp scattering in twisted graphite</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spinless systems exhibit unique topological characteristics compared to spinful ones, stemming from their distinct algebra. Without chiral interactions typically linked to spin, an intriguing yet unexplored interplay between topological and structural chirality may be anticipated. Here we show examples of spinless topological chirality solely from structural chirality in two types of twisted graphite. In a 3D helical structure, we find a chiral Weyl semimetal phase where bulk topology and chiral surface states are both determined by the screw direction. And in a 3D periodic structure formed with alternating twisting angle signs, a higher-order Dirac semimetal with chiral hinge states is discovered. Underlying these novel topological states is the Umklapp scattering that captures the chirality of the twisted interfaces, leading effectively to a sign-flipped chiral interlayer hopping, thereby introducing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge field that alters the symmetry algebra. Our findings point to a new pathway for engineering topological chirality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Semi-Dirac materials in 2D present an anisotropic dispersion relation, linear along one direction and quadratic along the perpendicular one. This study explores the topological properties and the influence of disorder in a 2D semi-Dirac Hamiltonian. Anisotropic edge states appear only in one direction. Their topological protection can be rigorously founded on the Zak phase of the one-dimensional reduction of the semi-Dirac Hamiltonian, parametrically depending on one of the momenta. In general, only a single value of the momentum is topologically protected so these systems can be considered as high order momentum topological insulators. We explore the dependence on the disorder of the edge states and the robustness of the topological protection in these materials. We also explore the consequences of the high order topological protection in momentum space for the transport properties in a two-terminal configuration.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a connection between the electromagnetic Hall response and band topological invariants in hyperbolic Chern insulators by deriving a hyperbolic analog of the Thouless-Kohmoto-Nightingale-den Nijs (TKNN) formula. By generalizing the Kubo formula to hyperbolic lattices, we show that the Hall conductivity is quantized to $-e^2C_{ij}/h$, where $C_{ij}$ is the first Chern number. Through a flux-threading argument, we provide an interpretation of the Chern number as a topological invariant in hyperbolic band theory. We demonstrate that, although it receives contributions from both Abelian and non-Abelian Bloch states, the Chern number can be calculated solely from Abelian states, resulting in a tremendous simplification of the topological band theory. Finally, we verify our results numerically by computing various Chern numbers in the hyperbolic Haldane model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07628v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aging in a single crystal spin glass ($\mathrm{Cu}_{0.92}\mathrm{Mn}_{0.08}$) has been measured using ac susceptibility techniques over a temperature range of $0.3 - 0.8 \, T_g$. In these studies, traditional aging experiments (or ``quench'' aging protocols) are compared to aging curves constructed from finite-cooling-rate curves. By comparing the growth rates of spin glass order between the two types of aging curves, it is determined that quantitative comparisons between protocols which are taken by quenching and protocols using a finite cooling rate are not possible without a deeper understanding of the interplay between aging and rejuvenation. We then demonstrate that the data presented indicate that rejuvenation, rather than cumulative aging, is the cause for the discrepancies between the two growth rates.</description>

      <title>Low-power threshold optical bistability enabled by hydrodynamic Kerr nonlinearity of free-carriers in heavily doped semiconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07750v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate nanoscale optical bistability at an exceptionally low power threshold of 1 mW by leveraging Kerr-type hydrodynamic nonlinearities due to the heavily doped semiconductor's free carriers. This high nonlinearity is enabled by a strong coupling between metallic nanopatch surface plasmons and longitudinal bulk plasmons (LBP) that arise in heavily doped semiconductors due to the nonlocality. Through the coupling, an efficient, near-unity conversion of far-field energy into LBP states could be achieved. These findings offer a viable approach to experimentally probe LBPs and lay the groundwork for developing efficient and ultrafast all-optical nonlinear devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that spin-singlet $s$-wave multi-band superconductors have a topological phase protected by rotation symmetry and time-reversal symmetry without spin-orbit coupling in two and three dimensions. This topological phase, an example of a representation-protected topological phase, has a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index and is stable as long as the bands at the Fermi energy are formed by a doublet of orbital states with finite angular momenta. In the limit of weak superconducting pair potential, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index gives a Fermi-surface formula and is related to the winding number of three-dimensional strong topological superconductors of class CI. We present a model of a topological $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductor that has gapless surface states with a quadratic dispersion and suggest a connection with iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Emergence of non-uniform strain induced exciton species in homo- and heterobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Full control of excitons in 2D materials is an important step to exploit them for applications. Straintronics is one method that can be used to effectively control the movement of excitons. Unfortunately, the effects of non-uniform strain in 2D materials are not yet well understood theoretically, although these strain fields can be present in experiments in the form of wrinkles, bubbles, and folds, or even explicitly applied to 2D materials through pre-patterned surfaces. The effects of these non-uniform strain fields on multilayers are even less studied due to the sheer size of these systems. In the present investigation, we study wrinkles that form in homo- and heterobilayers of 2D transition metal dichalcogenides using density functional theory. We show that the non-uniform strain leads to the formation of interlayer excitons in homobilayers of $ \mathrm WSe_2 $ and to exciton localization in heterobilayers of $ \mathrm WSe_2$-$ \mathrm MoSe_2$. Our results also reveal that the spin angular momentum is changed due to the mixing of in- and out-of-plane states which can explain the brightening of the formerly dark excitonic states under strain. Our results will pave the way towards a full understanding of the strain-control of excitons in 2D materials.</description>

      <title>Linear stability theory and molecular simulations of nanofilm dewetting with disjoining pressure, strong liquid-solid slip, and thermal fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The dewetting of thin nanofilms is significantly impacted by thermal fluctuations, liquid-solid slip, and disjoining pressure, which can be described by lubrication equations augmented by appropriately scaled noise terms, known as stochastic lubrication equations. Here molecular dynamics simulations along with a newly proposed slip-generating method are adopted to study the instability of nanofilms with arbitrary slip. These simulations show that strong-slip dewetting is distinct from weak-slip dewetting by faster growth of perturbations and fewer droplets after dewetting, which can not be predicted by the existing stochastic lubrication equation. A new stochastic lubrication equation considering the strong slip boundary condition is thus derived using a long-wave approximation to the equations of fluctuating hydrodynamics. The linear stability analysis of this equation, i.e., surface spectrum, agrees well with molecular simulations. Interestingly, strong slip can break down the usual Stokes limits adopted in weak-slip dewetting and bring the inertia into effect. The evolution of the standard deviation of the film height $W^2(t)={\overline{h^2}-{\overline{h}}^2}$ at the initial stage of the strong-slip dewetting is found to be $W\sim t^{1/4}$ in contrast to $W\sim t^{1/8}$ for the weak-slip dewetting.</description>

      <title>Designing metasurface optical interfaces for solid-state qubits using many-body adjoint shape optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08212v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general strategy for the inverse design of metasurfaces composed of elementary shapes. We use it to design a structure that collects and collimates light from nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond. Such metasurfaces constitute scalable optical interfaces for solid-state qubits, enabling efficient photon coupling into optical fibers and eliminating free-space collection optics. The many-body shape optimization strategy is a practical alternative to topology optimization that explicitly enforces material and fabrication constraints throughout the optimization, while still achieving high performance. The metasurface is easily adaptable to other solid-state qubits, and the optimization method is broadly applicable to fabrication-constrained photonic design problems.</description>

      <title>Protected gap closing and reopening in topological-insulator Josephson junctions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the seminal proposal by Fu and Kane, the superconducting proximity effect was predicted to transform the surface state of a topological insulator (TI) into a topological superconductor, forming a nonchiral 1D Majorana state within a linear Josephson junction on the TI surface. The hallmark of this 1D Majorana state is a robust gap closing as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$ across the junction, which alternates in and out of the topological phase. These topological phase-transitions occur at $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$ with integer $n$, leading to a $4\pi$-periodicity of the ground state. While the $4\pi$-periodicity has been indirectly inferred in the AC Josephson effect, the direct observation of the 1D Majorana state in a TI Josephson junction has remained contentious. Here, we report the direct observation of topological phase-transitions in a TI Josephson junction, where the local density of states is probed via tunnel contacts and $\varphi$ is controlled by a flux loop. The observed transitions are independent of the chemical potential, reinforcing their topological origin. Under an applied perpendicular magnetic field, Josephson vortices form, making $\varphi$ position-dependent. In this case, the gap closing occurs locally at the Josephson vortex cores where $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$, which we also observe. Our findings provide direct confirmation of the Fu-Kane proposal and robust evidence for the emergence of topological superconductivity in a TI Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>Visualization of atomic structures on faceted and non-flat surfaces by difference-of-gaussians approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detailed analysis of scanning probe microscopy (SPM) data acquired for tilted and non-flat surfaces is usually complicated due to presence of large number of surface areas tilted by large/variable angles relative to the scanning plane. As a consequence, standard methods of elimination of global/local slope by a plane subtraction or numerical differentiation seems to be ineffective. We demonstrate that simple difference-of-gaussians procedure provides us output data corresponding to a projection of considered surface onto scanning plane without undesirable modifications of contrast. This method allows us to minimize small-scale noise, finite slopes of SPM image along both fast and slow scanning directions and eliminate surface rippling. This method can be applied both for fast 'on-the-fly' visualization of experimental data and more detailed analysis, including high precision determination of lattice parameters and angles between translations vectors in different surface domains. In order to estimate geometrical distortions related to the difference-of-gaussians approach, we compare this method with direct image rotation in 3D space.</description>

Abstract: We study angular momentum radiation from electrically-biased chiral single molecular junctions using the nonequilibrium Green's function method. Using single helical chains as examples, we make connections between the ability of a chiral molecule to emit photons with angular momentum to the geometrical factors of the molecule. We point out that the mechanism studied here does not involve the magnetic moment. Rather, it relies on inelastic transitions between scattering states originated from two electrodes with different chiral properties and chemical potentials. The required time-reversal symmetry breaking is provided by nonequilibrium electron transport. Our work sheds light on the relationship between geometrical and optoelectrical chiral properties at single molecular limit.</description>

      <title>Interacting Local Topological Markers: A one-particle density matrix approach for characterizing the topology of interacting and disordered states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While topology is a property of a quantum state itself, most existing methods for characterizing the topology of interacting phases of matter require direct knowledge of the underlying Hamiltonian. We offer an alternative by utilizing the one-particle density matrix formalism to extend the concept of the Chern, chiral, and Chern-Simons markers to include interactions. The one-particle density matrix of a free-fermion state is a projector onto the occupied bands, defining a Brillouin zone bundle of the given topological class. This is no longer the case in the interacting limit, but as long as the one-particle density matrix is gapped, its spectrum can be adiabatically flattened, connecting it to a topologically equivalent projector. The corresponding topological markers thus characterize the topology of the interacting phase. Importantly, the one-particle density matrix is defined in terms of a given state alone, making the local markers numerically favorable, and providing a valuable tool for characterizing topology of interacting systems when only the state itself is available. To demonstrate the practical use of the markers we use the chiral marker to identify the topology of midspectrum eigenstates of the Ising-Majorana chain across the transition between the ergodic and many-body localized phases. We also apply the chiral marker to random states with a known topology, and compare it with the entanglement spectrum degeneracy.</description>

Focusing on the effect of the field gradient on double-dot singlet-triplet qubits, we present two adaptive Bayesian schemes to estimate the magnitude of the gradient by a series of free induction decay experiments. We concentrate on reducing the computational overhead, with a real-time implementation of the schemes in mind. We show how it is possible to achieve a significant improvement of estimation accuracy compared to more traditional estimation methods. We include an analysis of the effects of dephasing and the drift of the gradient itself.</description>

      <title>Spin pumping in an altermagnet/normal metal bilayer</title>

Abstract: Altermagnetism is a subclass of antiferromagnetism that features spin-polarized electron bands of a non-relativistic origin despite the absence of a net magnetiation in the material. We here theoretically study spin pumping from an altermagnetic insulator into a normal metal. The symmetry properties of the lattice and spin order of the altermagnet alters the magnon dispersion compared to a conventional square lattice antiferromagnet. We find that for a homogeneous magnetic field, the spin pumping current is the same as that of a regular antiferromagnet. If, however the magnetic field becomes spatially dependent, we predict that the altermagnetic order leaves a unique fingerprint on the spin pumping behaviour when the orientation of the spatial modulation does not align with the high-symmetry paths of magnon degeneracy in the altermagnet. This demonstrates that altermagnets can be used for THz spin pumping purposes with novel behaviour, distinguishing them from their regular antiferromagnet counterparts.</description>

Abstract: Modern hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junction arrays are a promising platform for analog quantum simulations. Their controllable and non-sinusoidal energy/phase relation opens the path to implement nontrivial interactions and study the emergence of exotic quantum phase transitions. Here, we propose the analysis of an array of hybrid Josephson junctions defining a 2-leg ladder geometry for the quantum simulation of the tricritical Ising phase transition. This transition provides the paradigmatic example of minimal conformal models beyond Ising criticality and its excitations are intimately related with Fibonacci non-Abelian anyons and topological order in two dimensions. We study this superconducting system and its thermodynamic phases based on bosonization and matrix-product-states techniques. Its effective continuous description in terms of a three-frequency sine-Gordon quantum field theory suggests the presence of the targeted tricritical point and the numerical simulations confirm this picture. Our results indicate which experimental observables can be adopted in realistic devices to probe the physics and the phase transitions of the model. Additionally, our proposal provides a useful one-dimensional building block to design exotic topological order in two-dimensional scalable Josephson junction arrays.</description>

      <title>Controlled Interlayer Exciton Ionization in an Electrostatic Trap in Atomically Thin Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12941v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Atomically thin semiconductor heterostructures provide a two-dimensional (2D) device platform for creating high densities of cold, controllable excitons. Interlayer excitons (IEs), bound electrons and holes localized to separate 2D quantum well layers, have permanent out-of-plane dipole moments and long lifetimes, allowing their spatial distribution to be tuned on demand. Here, we employ electrostatic gates to trap IEs and control their density. By electrically modulating the IE Stark shift, electron-hole pair concentrations above $2\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ can be achieved. At this high IE density, we observe an exponentially increasing linewidth broadening indicative of an IE ionization transition, independent of the trap depth. This runaway threshold remains constant at low temperatures, but increases above 20 K, consistent with the quantum dissociation of a degenerate IE gas. Our demonstration of the IE ionization in a tunable electrostatic trap represents an important step towards the realization of dipolar exciton condensates in solid-state optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Distance dependence of the energy transfer mechanism in WS$_2$-graphene heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.02716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on the mechanism of energy transfer in van der Waals heterostructures of the two-dimensional semiconductor WS$_2$ and graphene with varying interlayer distances, achieved through spacer layers of hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). We record photoluminescence and reflection spectra at interlayer distances between 0.5 nm and 5.8 nm (0-16 hBN layers). We find that the energy transfer is dominated by states outside the light cone, indicative of a F\"orster transfer process, with an additional contribution from a Dexter process at 0.5 nm interlayer distance. We find that the measured dependence of the luminescence intensity on interlayer distances above 1 nm can be quantitatively described using recently reported values of the F\"orster transfer rates of thermalized charge carriers. At smaller interlayer distances, the experimentally observed transfer rates exceed the predictions and furthermore depend on excess energy as well as on excitation density. Since the transfer probability of the F\"orster mechanism depends on the momentum of electron-hole pairs, we conclude that at these distances, the transfer is driven by non-thermalized charge carrier distributions.</description>

      <title>Role of Coulomb interaction in the valley photogalvanic effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a theory of Coulomb interaction-related contribution to the photogalvanic current of the carriers of charge in two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric Dirac materials possessing a nontrivial structure of valleys and exposed to an external electromagnetic field. The valley photogalvanic effect occurs here due to the trigonal warping of electrons and holes' dispersions in a given valley of the monolayer. We study the low-frequency limit of the external field: The field frequency is smaller than the temperature $T$, and the electron-electron and electron-hole scattering times are much larger than the electron-impurity and hole-impurity scattering times. In this regime, we employ the Boltzmann transport equations and show that electron-hole scattering dominates electron-electron scattering in intrinsic semiconductors. A Coulomb electron-hole interaction-related contribution to the valley photogalvanic current can reduce the value of the bare photogalvanic current as electron and hole currents flow in opposite directions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.07541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distorted phases of monolayer 1T-MoS$_2$ have distinct electronic properties, with potential applications in optoelectronics, catalysis, and batteries. We theoretically investigate the use of Ni-doping to generate distorted 1T phases, and find not only the ones usually reported but also two further phases (${3} \times {3}$ and ${4} \times {4}$), depending on the concentration and the substitutional or adatom doping site. Corresponding pristine phases are stable after dopant removal, which might offer a potential route to experimental synthesis. We find large ferroelectric polarizations, most notably in ${3} \times {3}$ which -- compared to the recently measured 1T$''$ -- has 100 times greater ferroelectric polarization, a lower energy, and a larger bandgap. Doped phases include exotic multiferroic semimetals, ferromagnetic polar metals, and improper ferroelectrics with only in-plane polarization switchable. The pristine phases have unusual multiple gaps in the conduction bands, with possible applications for intermediate band solar cells, transparent conductors, and nonlinear optics.</description>

Abstract: The continuous scaling of semiconductor-based technologies to micron and sub-micron regimes has resulted in higher device density and lower power dissipation. Many physical phenomena such as self-heating or current leakage become significant at such scales, and mapping current densities to reveal these features is decisive for the development of modern electronics. However, advanced non-invasive technologies either offer low sensitivity or poor spatial resolution and are limited to two-dimensional spatial mapping. Here we use near-surface nitrogen-vacancy centres in diamond to probe Oersted fields created by current flowing within a multi-layered integrated circuit in pre-development. We show the reconstruction of the three-dimensional components of the current density with a magnitude down to about $\approx 10 \,\rm \mu A / \mu m^2$ and sub-micron spatial resolution at room temperature. We also report the localisation of currents in different layers and observe anomalous current flow in an electronic chip. Our method provides, therefore a decisive step toward three-dimensional current mapping in technologically relevant nanoscale electronics chips.</description>

      <title>When Superconductivity Crosses Over: From BCS to BEC</title>

Abstract: New developments in superconductivity, particularly through unexpected and often astonishing forms of superconducting materials, continue to excite the community and stimulate theory. It is now becoming clear that there are two distinct platforms for superconductivity: natural and synthetic materials. The study of these artificial materials has greatly expanded in the last decade or so, with the discoveries of new forms of superfluidity in artificial heterostructures and the exploitation of proximitization. Natural superconductors continue to surprise through the Fe-based pnictides and chalcogenides, and nickelates as well as others. It is the goal of this review to present this two-pronged investigation into superconductors, with a focus on those that we have come to understand belong somewhere between the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) regimes. We characterize in detail the nature of this "crossover" superconductivity, which is to be distinguished from crossover superfluidity in atomic Fermi gases. In the process, we address the multiple ways of promoting a system out of the BCS and into the BCS-BEC crossover regime within the context of concrete experimental realizations. These involve natural materials, such as organic conductors, as well as artificial, mostly two-dimensional materials, such as magic-angle twisted bilayer and trilayer graphene, or gate-controlled devices, as well as one-layer and interfacial superconducting films. This work should be viewed as a celebration of BCS theory by showing that even though this theory was initially implemented with the special case of weak correlations in mind, it can in a very natural way be extended to treat the case of these more exotic strongly correlated superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.02746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An effective time-dependent Hamiltonian can be implemented by making a quantum system fly through an inhomogeneous potential, realizing, for example, a quantum gate on its internal degrees of freedom. However, flying systems have a spatial spread that will generically entangle the internal and spatial degrees of freedom, leading to decoherence in the internal state dynamics, even in the absence of any external reservoir. We provide formulas valid at all times for the dynamics, fidelity, and change of entropy for ballistic particles with small spatial spreads, quantified by $\Delta x$. This non-Markovian decoherence can be significant for ballistic flying qubits (scaling as $\Delta x^2$) but usually not for flying qubits carried by a moving potential well (scaling as $\Delta x^6$). We also discuss a method to completely counteract this decoherence for a ballistic qubit later measured.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08643v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a ready-to-use symmetry invariant expansion form of the eight-band k.p Hamiltonian for inorganic and organic metal halide perovskites (CsPbX$_3$ and MAPbX$_3$ with $X = \{$Cl, Br, I$\}$). We use the k.p model to calculate the electronic band structures for perovskite materials of cubic and pseudo-cubic phase. In order to find respective parameters, the band structures of considered materials were obtained within state-of-the-art density functional theory and used next as targets to adjust the k.p bands and determine the values of k.p parameters. The calculated band structures were used to obtain the material gain for bulk crystals (CsPbCl$_3$, CsPbBr$_3$, CsPbI$_3$, MAPbCl$_3$, MAPbBr$_3$ and MAPbI$_3$) which is compared with the material gain in well-established III-V semiconductors. It was found that for these perovskites a positive material gain appears at lower carrier density than for the reference materials (GaAs and InP). We demonstrate that from the point of view of the electronic band structure, the studied perovskites are very promising gain medium for lasers.</description>

Abstract: We provide sufficient conditions such that the time evolution of a mesoscopic tight-binding open system with a local Hartree-Fock non-linearity converges to a self-consistent non-equilibrium steady state, which is independent of the initial condition from the "small sample". We also show that the steady charge current intensities are given by Landauer-B\"uttiker-like formulas, and make the connection with the case of weakly self-interacting many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Visualizing uniform lattice-scale pair density wave in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05693v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Typical BCS superconductors are microscopically homogeneous in real space governed by the coherent Cooper pairs with high phase stiffness of superfluid density, which is characterized by a coherence length. However, a periodic oscillation of superconducting order parameter may develop driven by breaking the time-reversal or translational invariance. To date, such modulated orders were specific to each material systems, with a periodicity much larger than the lattice constant. Here we report the direct observation of a uniform lattice-scale pair density wave (PDW) in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films, enforced by peculiar interfacial structure of crystal symmetries breaking. Our spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy unravels a spatial modulation of Cooper-pairing gap within a single unit-cell, depending on inequivalent atomic sites. Prominent periodic variation of superfluid density is visualized via Josephson current by a superconducting tip, indicating a real-space oscillation of phase stiffness. Such a lattice-scale superconducting modulation, which coexists with a larger length scale of PDW order, indicates the lattice-scale variation of both pairing strength and phase stiffness. Our findings provide new insights into the intertwined density-wave orders of quasiparticle character in correlated electronic systems, and provoke future studies on the unconventional pairing interaction and phase stiffness in the two-dimensional limit.</description>
