      <title>Observations of Uranus at High Phase Angle as Seen by New Horizons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present flux measurements of Uranus observed at phase angles of 43.9{\deg}, 44.0{\deg}, and 52.4{\deg} by the Multispectral Visible Imaging Camera (MVIC) on the New Horizons spacecraft during 2023, 2010, and 2019, respectively. New Horizons imaged Uranus at a distance of about 24-70 AU (2023) in four color filters, with bandpasses of 400-550 nm, 540-700 nm, 780-975 nm, and 860-910 nm. High-phase-angle observations are of interest for studying the energy balance of Uranus, constraining the atmospheric scattering behavior, and understanding the planet as an analog for ice giant exoplanets. The new observations from New Horizons provide access to a wider wavelength range and different season compared to previous observations from both Voyager spacecraft. We performed aperture photometry on the New Horizons observations of Uranus to obtain its brightness in each photometric band. The photometry suggests that Uranus may be darker than predicted by a Lambertian phase curve in the Blue and Red filters. Comparison to simultaneous low-phase Hubble WFC3 and ground-based community-led observations indicates a lack of large-scale features at full-phase that would introduce variation in the rotational light curve. The New Horizons reflectance in the Blue (492 nm) and Red (624 nm) filters does not exhibit statistically significant variation and is consistent with the expected error bars. These results place new constraints on the atmospheric model of Uranus and its reflectivity. The observations are analogous to those from future exoplanet direct-imaging missions, which will capture unresolved images of exoplanets at partial phases. These results will serve as a "ground-truth" with which to interpret exo-ice giant data.</description>

      <title>A Planet Candidate Orbiting near the Hot Jupiter TOI-2818 b Inferred through Transit Timing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TOI-2818 b is a hot Jupiter orbiting a slightly evolved G-type star on a 4.04-day orbit that shows transit timing variations (TTVs) suggestive of a decreasing orbital period. In the most recent year of TESS observations, transits were observed $\sim$8 minutes earlier than expected for a constant period. The implied orbital decay rate is $1.35 \pm 0.25$ s yr$^{-1}$, too fast to be explained by tidal dissipation even considering the evolved nature of the host star. Radial velocity monitoring rules out the possibility that the apparent change in period is due to a steady acceleration of the star by a long-period companion. Apsidal precession due to the tidal distortion of the planet is also physically implausible. The most plausible explanation for the TTVs appears to be gravitational perturbations from a hitherto undetected planet with mass $\lesssim$$10\,M_\oplus$ that is in (or near) a mean-motion resonance with the hot Jupiter. Such a planet could be responsible for the observed TTVs while avoiding detection with the available radial velocity and transit data.</description>

      <title>Probabilities of collisions of bodies ejected from forming Earth with the terrestrial planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The motion of bodies ejected from the Earth was studied, and the probabilities of collisions of such bodies with the present terrestrial planets were calculated. The dependences of these probabilities on velocities, angles and points of ejection of bodies were studied. These dependences can be used in the models with different distributions of ejected material. On average, about a half and less than 10\% of initial ejected bodies remained moving in elliptical orbits in the Solar System after 10 and 100 Myr, respectively. A few ejected bodies collided with planets after 250 Myr. As dynamical lifetimes of bodies ejected from the Earth can reach hundreds of million years, a few percent of bodies ejected at the Chicxulub and Popigai events about 36-65 Myr ago can still move in the zone of the terrestrial planets and have small chances to collide with planets, including the Earth. The fraction of ejected bodies that collided with the Earth was greater for smaller ejection velocity. The fractions of bodies delivered to the Earth and Venus probably did not differ much for these planets and were about 0.2-0.3 each. Such obtained results testify in favour of that the upper layers of the Earth and Venus can contain similar material. The fractions of bodies ejected from the Earth that collided with Mercury and Mars did not exceed 0.08 and 0.025, respectively. The fractions of bodies collided with Jupiter were of the order of 0.001. In most calculations the fraction of bodies collided with the Sun was between 0.2 and 0.5. Depending on parameters of ejection, the fraction of bodies ejected into hyperbolic orbits could vary from 0 to 1. Small fractions of material ejected from the Earth can be found on other terrestrial planets and Jupiter, as the ejected bodies could collide with these planets. Bodies ejected from the Earth could deliver organic material to other celestial objects, e.g. to Mars.</description>

      <title>The OASES Project: Exploring the Outer Solar System through Stellar Occultation with Amateur-Class Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exploration of kilometre-sized trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) is one of the ultimate goals in the search for the origin and evolution of the Solar System. However, such exploration is challenging because these small bodies are too faint to be directly detected. One potential avenue for detecting and investigating small and faint TNOs is the monitoring of stellar occultation events. This paper reviews the concept and methodology of monitoring observations of stellar occultations by small, unidentified TNOs, focusing on our observational programme, Organized Autotelescopes for Serendipitous Event Survey (OASES). OASES aims to detect and investigate stellar occultations by unidentified TNOs using multiple amateur-sized telescopes equipped with commercial Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) cameras. Through the monitoring observations conducted so far, OASES has found one possible occultation event by a kilometre-sized TNO. The paper also discusses future developments of the OASES project and deliberates on the potential of movie observations in expanding the frontiers of outer Solar System research.

      <title>A new pathway to SO$_2$: Revealing the NUV driven sulfur chemistry in hot gas giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Photochemistry is a key process driving planetary atmospheres away from local thermodynamic equilibrium. Recent observations of the H$_2$ dominated atmospheres of hot gas giants have detected SO$_2$ as one of the major products of this process. Aims. We investigate which chemical pathways lead to the formation of SO$_2$ in an atmosphere, and we investigate which part of the flux from the host star is necessary to initiate SO$_2$ production. Methods. We use the publicly available S-N-C-H-O photochemical network in the VULCAN chemical kinetics code to compute the disequilibrium chemistry of an exoplanetary atmosphere. Results. We find that there are two distinct chemical pathways that lead to the formation of SO$_2$. The formation of SO$_2$ at higher pressures is initiated by stellar flux &gt;200 nm, whereas the formation of SO$_2$ at lower pressures is initiated by stellar flux &lt;200 nm. In deeper layers of the atmosphere, OH is provided by the hydrogen abstraction of H$_2$O, and sulfur is provided by the photodissociation of SH and S$_2$, which leads to a positive feedback cycle that liberates sulfur from the stable H$_2$S molecule. In higher layers of the atmosphere, OH is provided by the photodissociation of H$_2$O, and sulfur can be liberated from H$_2$S by either photodissociation of SH and S$_2$, or by the hydrogen abstraction of SH. Conclusions. We conclude that the stellar flux in the 200-350 nm wavelength range as well as the ratio of NUV/UV radiation are important parameters determining the observability of SO$_2$. In addition we find that there is a diversity of chemical pathways to the formation of SO$_2$. This is crucial for the interpretation of SO$_2$ detections and derived elemental abundance ratios and overall metallicities.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms and timing of carbonaceous chondrite delivery to the Earth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nucleosynthetic isotope signatures of meteorites and the bulk silicate Earth (BSE) indicate that Earth consists of a mixture of "carbonaceous" (CC) and "non-carbonaceous" (NC) materials. We show that the fration of CC material recorded in the isotopic composition of the BSE varies for different elements, and depends on the element's tendency to partition into metal and its volatility. The observed behaviour indicates that the majority of material accreted to the Earth was NC-dominated, but that CC-dominated material enriched in moderately-volatile elements by a factor of ~10 was delivered during the last ~2-10% of Earth's acccretion. The late delivery of CC material to Earth contrasts with dynamical evidence for the early implantation of CC objects into the inner solar system during the growth and migration of the giant planets. This, together with the NC-dominated nature of both Earth's late veneer and bulk Mars, suggests that material scattered inwards had the bulk of its mass concentrated in a few, large CC embryos rather than in smaller planetesimals. We propose that Earth accreted a few of these CC embryos while Mars did not, and that at least one of the CC embryos impacted Earth relatively late (when accretion was 90-90% complete). This scenario is consistent with the subsequent Moon-formign impact of a large NC body, as long as this impact did not re-homogenize the entire Earth's mantle.</description>

      <title>MAUVE: An Ultraviolet Astrophysics Probe Mission Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the mission concept "Mission to Analyze the UltraViolet universE" (MAUVE), a wide-field spectrometer and imager conceived during the inaugural NASA Astrophysics Mission Design School. MAUVE responds to the 2023 Announcement of Opportunity for Probe-class missions, with a budget cap of \$1 billion, and would hypothetically launch in 2031. However, the formulation of MAUVE was an educational exercise and the mission is not being developed further. The Principal Investigator-led science of MAUVE aligns with the priorities outlined in the 2020 Astrophysics Decadal Survey, enabling new characterizations of exoplanet atmospheres, the early-time light curves of some of the universe's most explosive transients, and the poorly-understood extragalactic background light. Because the Principal Investigator science occupies 30% of the observing time available during the mission's 5 yr lifespan, we provide an observing plan that would allow for 70% of the observing time to be used for General Observer programs, with community-solicited proposals. The onboard detector (THISTLE) claims significant heritage from the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph on Hubble, but extends its wavelength range down to the extreme UV. We note that MAUVE would be the first satellite in decades with the ability to access this regime of the electromagnetic spectrum. MAUVE has a field of view of 900" x 900"  a photometric sensitivity extending to $m_{UV}\leq 24$, and a resolving power of $R\sim1000$. This paper provides full science and mission traceability matrices for this concept, and also outlines cost and scheduling timelines aimed at enabling a within-budget mission and an on-time launch.</description>

      <title>Extending the Dark Matter Reach of Water Cherenkov Detectors using Jupiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose the first method for water Cherenkov detectors to constrain GeV-scale dark matter (DM) below the solar evaporation mass. While previous efforts have highlighted the Sun and Earth as DM capture targets, we demonstrate that Jupiter is a viable target. Jupiter's unique characteristics, such as its lower core temperature and significant gravitational potential, allow it to capture and retain light DM more effectively than the Sun, particularly in the mass range below 4 GeV where direct detection sensitivity diminishes. Our calculations provide the first bounds on GeV-scale annihilating DM within Jupiter, showing that these bounds surpass current solar limits and direct detection results.</description>

      <title>The Role of Metallicity in the Chemical Evolution of Star-Forming Regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interstellar chemistry in low-metallicity environments is crucial to unveil physical and chemical processes in the past Galaxy or those in high-redshift galaxies, where the metallicity was significantly lower compared to the present-day solar neighborhood. This is also important for the understanding of the diversity of the chemical evolution in various regions of our Galaxy. Nearby low-metallicity laboratories, such as the outskirts of our Galaxy, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds, and the other gas-rich dwarf galaxies in the Local Group, will provide important insights for this purpose. In the last decade, there has been great progress in astrochemical studies of interstellar molecules in low-metallicity star-forming regions. Do molecular abundances simply scale with the metallicity? If not, which processes govern the chemistry in the low-metallicity interstellar medium? In this proceeding, I will discuss the role of metallicity in the chemical evolution of star-forming regions based on recent observations of interstellar molecules in low-metallicity environments.</description>

      <title>A Compact, Coherent Representation of Stellar Surface Variation in the Spectral Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-varying inhomogeneities on stellar surfaces constitute one of the largest sources of radial velocity (RV) error for planet detection and characterization. We show that stellar variations, because they manifest on coherent, rotating surfaces, give rise to changes that are complex but useably compact and coherent in the spectral domain. Methods for disentangling stellar signals in RV measurements benefit from modeling the full domain of spectral pixels. We simulate spectra of spotted stars using starry and construct a simple spectrum projection space that is sensitive to the orientation and size of stellar surface features. Regressing measured RVs in this projection space reduces RV scatter by 60-80% while preserving planet shifts. We note that stellar surface variability signals do not manifest in spectral changes that are purely orthogonal to a Doppler shift or exclusively asymmetric in line profiles; enforcing orthogonality or focusing exclusively on asymmetric features will not make use of all the information present in the spectra. We conclude with a discussion of existing and possible implementations on real data based on the presented compact, coherent framework for stellar signal mitigation.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Binary Planets within Star Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop analytical tools and perform three-body simulations to investigate the orbital evolution and dynamical stability of binary planets within star clusters. Our analytical results show that the orbital stability of a planetary-mass binary against passing stars is mainly related to its orbital period. Critical flybys, defined as stellar encounters with energy kicks comparable to the binary binding energy, can efficiently produce a wide range of semimajor axes ($a$) and eccentricities ($e$) from a dominant population of primordially tight JuMBOs. The critical flyby criterion we derived offers an improvement over the commonly used tidal radius criterion, particularly in high-speed stellar encounters. Applying our results to the recently discovered Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs) by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), our simulations suggest that to match the observed $\sim$9% wide binary fraction, an initial semimajor axis of $a_0 \sim$ 10-20 au and a density-weighted residence time of $\chi \gtrsim 10^4$ Myr pc$^{-3}$ are favored. These results imply that the JWST JuMBOs probably formed as tight binaries near the cluster core.</description>

      <title>An extremely low-density exoplanet spins slow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07977v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present constraints on the shape of Kepler-51d, which is a super-puff with a mass $\sim6\,M_\oplus$ and a radius $\sim9\,R_\oplus$, based on detailed modeling of the transit light curve from JWST NIRSpec. The projected shape of this extremely low-density planet is consistent with being spherical, and a projected oblateness $f_\perp&gt;0.2$ can be excluded regardless of the spin obliquity angles. If this is taken as the limit on the true shape of the planet, Kepler-51d is rotating at $\lesssim 50\%$ of its break-up spin rate, or its rotation period is $\gtrsim 33\,$hr. In the more plausible situation that the planetary spin is aligned with its orbital direction to within $30^\circ$, then its oblateness is $&lt;0.08$, which corresponds to a dimensionless spin rate $\lesssim30\%$ of the break-up rotation and a dimensional rotation period $\gtrsim 53\,$hr. This seems to contradict the theoretical expectation that planets with such low masses may be spinning near break-up. We point out the usefulness of the stellar mean density and the orbital eccentricity in constraining the shape of the transiting planet, so planets with well-characterized host and orbital parameters are preferred in the detection of planetary oblateness with the JWST transit method.</description>

Abstract: Accretion of protoplanetary discs (PPDs) could be driven by MHD disc winds rather than turbulent viscosity. With a dynamical prescription for angular momentum transport induced by disc winds, we perform 2D simulations of PPDs to systematically investigate the rate and direction of planet migration in a windy disc. We find that the the strength of disc winds influences the corotation region similarly to the "desaturation" effect of viscosity. The magnitude and direction of torque depend sensitively on the hierarchy between the radial advection timescale across the horseshoe due to disc wind $\tau_{\rm dw}$, the horsehoe libration timescale $\tau_{\rm lib}$ and U-turn timescale $\tau_{\rm U-turn}$. Initially, as wind strength increases and the advection timescale shortens, a non-linear horseshoe drag emerges when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm lib}$, which tends to drive strong outward migration. Subsequently, the drag becomes linear and planets typically still migrate inward when $\tau_{\rm dw} \lesssim \tau_{\rm U-turn} \sim \tau_{\rm lib}h$, where $h$ is the disc aspect ratio. For a planet with mass ratio of $\sim 10^{-5}$, the zone of outward migration sandwiched between inner and outer inward migration zones corresponds to $\sim $ 10-100 au in a PPD with accretion rates between $10^{-8}$ and $10^{-7}$ $M_\odot \text{yr}^{-1}$.</description>
