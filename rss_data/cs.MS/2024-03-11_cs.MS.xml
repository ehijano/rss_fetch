      <title>Sphractal: Estimating the Fractal Dimension of Surfaces Computed from Precise Atomic Coordinates via Box-Counting Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fractal dimension of a surface allows its degree of roughness to be characterized quantitatively. However, limited effort is attempted to calculate the fractal dimension of surfaces computed from precisely known atomic coordinates from computational biomolecular and nanomaterial studies. This work proposes methods to estimate the fractal dimension of the surface of any 3D object composed of spheres, by representing the surface as either a voxelized point cloud or a mathematically exact surface, and computing its box-counting dimension. Sphractal is published as a Python package that provides these functionalities, and its utility is demonstrated on a set of simulated palladium nanoparticle data.</description>

      <title>Efficient Implementation of Interior-Point Methods for Quantum Relative Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum Relative Entropy (QRE) programming is a recently popular and challenging class of convex optimization problems with significant applications in quantum computing and quantum information theory. We are interested in modern interior point (IP) methods based on optimal self-concordant barriers for the QRE cone. A range of theoretical and numerical challenges associated with such barrier functions and the QRE cones have hindered the scalability of IP methods. To address these challenges, we propose a series of numerical and linear algebraic techniques and heuristics aimed at enhancing the efficiency of gradient and Hessian computations for the self-concordant barrier function, solving linear systems, and performing matrix-vector products. We also introduce and deliberate about some interesting concepts related to QRE such as symmetric quantum relative entropy (SQRE). We also introduce a two-phase method for performing facial reduction that can significantly improve the performance of QRE programming. Our new techniques have been implemented in the latest version (DDS 2.2) of the software package DDS. In addition to handling QRE constraints, DDS accepts any combination of several other conic and non-conic convex constraints. Our comprehensive numerical experiments encompass several parts including 1) a comparison of DDS 2.2 with Hypatia for the nearest correlation matrix problem, 2) using DDS for combining QRE constraints with various other constraint types, and 3) calculating the key rate for quantum key distribution (QKD) channels and presenting results for several QKD protocols.</description>
