      <title>On spider diffusions having a spinning measure selected from their own local time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is to give several results related to Walsh's spider diffusions living on a star-shaped network that have a spinning measure selected from the own local time of the motion at the vertex (cf.[17]). We prove the corresponding It\^o's formula and give some global trajectory properties such as $L^1$-approximation of the local time and the Markov property. Regarding the behavior of the process at the vertex, we show that that the distribution of the process is non atomic at the junction point and we characterize the instantaneous scattering distribution along some ray with the aid of the probability coefficients of diffraction. We obtain also a Feynmann-Kac representation for linear parabolic systems posed on star-shaped networks that where introduced in [18] possessing a so-called local-time Kirchhoff's boundary condition.</description>

      <title>Two-type continuous-state branching processes in varying environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A basic class of two-type continuous-state branching processes in varying environments are constructed by solving the backward equation determining the cumulant semigroup. The parameters of the process are allowed to be c\`adl\`ag in time and the difficulty brought about by the bottlenecks are overcome by introducing a suitable moment condition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a generalized Derrida-Retaux model on a Galton-Watson tree with a geometric offspring distribution. For a class of recursive systems, including the Derrida-Retaux model with either a geometric or exponential initial distribution, we characterize the critical curve using an involution-type equation and prove that the free energy satisfies the Derrida-Retaux conjecture.</description>

      <title>A two-size Wright-Fisher Model: asymptotic Analysis via Uniform Renewal Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03056v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a population with two types of individuals, distinguished by the resources required for reproduction: type-$0$ (small) individuals need a fractional resource unit of size $\vartheta \in (0,1)$, while type-$1$ (large) individuals require $1$ unit. The total available resource per generation is $R$. To form a new generation, individuals are sampled one by one, and if enough resources remain, they reproduce, adding their offspring to the next generation. The probability of sampling an individual whose offspring is small is $\rho_{R}(x)$, where $x$ is the proportion of small individuals in the current generation. This discrete-time stochastic model is called the two-size Wright-Fisher model, where the function $\rho_{R}$ can represent mutation and/or frequency-dependent selection. We show that on the evolutionary time scale, i.e. accelerating time by a factor $R$, the frequency process of type-$0$ individuals converges to the solution of a Wright-Fisher-type SDE. The drift term of that SDE accounts for the bias introduced by the function $\rho_R$ and the consumption strategy, the latter also inducing an additional multiplicative factor in the diffusion term. To prove this, the dynamics within each generation are viewed as a renewal process, with the population size corresponding to the first passage time $\tau(R)$ above level $R$. The proof relies on methods from renewal theory, in particular a uniform version of Blackwell's renewal theorem for binary, non-arithmetic random variables, established via $\varepsilon$-coupling.</description>

      <title>A Note on Exact State Visit Probabilities in Two-State Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we derive the exact probability that a specific state in a two-state Markov chain is visited exactly $k$ times after $N$ transitions. We provide a closed-form solution for $\mathbb{P}(N_l = k \mid N)$, considering initial state probabilities and transition dynamics. The solution corrects and extends prior incomplete results, offering a rigorous framework for enumerating state transitions. Numerical simulations validate the derived expressions, demonstrating their applicability in stochastic modeling.</description>

      <title>Poisson Hypothesis and large-population limit for networks of spiking neurons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study mean-field descriptions for spatially-extended networks of linear (leaky) and quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons with stochastic spiking times. We consider large-population limits of continuous-time Galves-L\"ocherbach (GL) networks with linear and quadratic intrinsic dynamics. We prove that that the Poisson Hypothesis holds for the replica-mean-field limit of these networks, that is, in a suitably-defined limit, neurons are independent with interaction times replaced by independent time-inhomogeneous Poisson processes with intensities depending on the mean firing rates, extending known results to networks with quadratic intrinsic dynamics and resets. Proving that the Poisson Hypothesis holds opens up the possibility of studying the large-population limit in these networks. We prove this limit to be a well-posed neural field model, subject to stochastic resets.</description>

      <title>On the probability of n equidistant points in high-dimensional lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider $n$ $d$-dimensional vectors with iid entries from a lattice distribution $X$. We show that the probability that all distances between them are equal is asymptotically \[ C_n\cdot\frac{1}{d^{(m-1)/2}} \quad \text{for} \quad d \to \infty \quad \text{and} \quad m = \binom{n}{2}, \] with an explicit constant in terms of the first 4 moments of $X$. Moreover, we generalise this result to encompass all finitely supported $X$, as well as under different distances. Our method relies on the relatively rarely used multidimensional local limit theorem and an analysis of the lattice on $\mathbb{Z}^{\binom{n}{2}}$ spanned by the image of the \emph{overlapping} map \[ H : \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^{\binom{n}{2}}, \quad (v_1, \dots, v_n) \mapsto \Bigl( \mathbf{1}_{\{v_i \neq v_j\}} \Bigr)_{1 \le i &lt; j \le n}. \]</description>

      <title>Early Stopping in Contextual Bandits and Inferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bandit algorithms sequentially accumulate data using adaptive sampling policies, offering flexibility for real-world applications. However, excessive sampling can be costly, motivating the devolopment of early stopping methods and reliable post-experiment conditional inferences. This paper studies early stopping methods in linear contextual bandits, including both pre-determined and online stopping rules, to minimize in-experiment regrets while accounting for sampling costs. We propose stopping rules based on the Opportunity Cost and Threshold Method, utilizing the variances of unbiased or consistent online estimators to quantify the upper regret bounds of learned optimal policy. The study focuses on batched settings for stability, selecting a weighed combination of batched estimators as the online estimator and deriving its asymptotic distribution. Online statistical inferences are performed based on the selected estimator, conditional on the realized stopping time. Our proposed method provides a systematic approach to minimize in-experiment regret and conduct robust post-experiment inferences, facilitating decision-making in future applications.</description>

      <title>Homogenization of the stochastic double-porosity model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02847v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work is devoted to the homogenization of elliptic equations in high-contrast media in the so-called `double-porosity' resonant regime, for which we solve two open problems of the literature in the random setting. First, we prove qualitative homogenization under very weak conditions, that cover the case of inclusions that are not uniformly bounded or separated. Second, under stronger assumptions, we provide sharp error estimates for the two-scale expansion.</description>

      <title>Data denoising with self consistency, variance maximization, and the Kantorovich dominance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new framework for data denoising, partially inspired by martingale optimal transport. For a given noisy distribution (the data), our approach involves finding the closest distribution to it among all distributions which 1) have a particular prescribed structure (expressed by requiring they lie in a particular domain), and 2) are self-consistent with the data. We show that this amounts to maximizing the variance among measures in the domain which are dominated in convex order by the data. For particular choices of the domain, this problem and a relaxed version of it, in which the self-consistency condition is removed, are intimately related to various classical approaches to denoising. We prove that our general problem has certain desirable features: solutions exist under mild assumptions, have certain robustness properties, and, for very simple domains, coincide with solutions to the relaxed problem.
  We also introduce a novel relationship between distributions, termed Kantorovich dominance, which retains certain aspects of the convex order while being a weaker, more robust, and easier-to-verify condition. Building on this, we propose and analyze a new denoising problem by substituting the convex order in the previously described framework with Kantorovich dominance. We demonstrate that this revised problem shares some characteristics with the full convex order problem but offers enhanced stability, greater computational efficiency, and, in specific domains, more meaningful solutions. Finally, we present simple numerical examples illustrating solutions for both the full convex order problem and the Kantorovich dominance problem.</description>

      <title>Three topological phases of the elliptic Ginibre ensembles with a point charge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the complex and symplectic elliptic Ginibre matrices of size $(c+1)N \times (c+1)N$, conditioned to have a deterministic eigenvalue at $ p \in \mathbb{R} $ with multiplicity $ c N $. We show that their limiting spectrum is either simply connected, doubly connected, or composed of two disjoint simply connected components. Moreover, denoting by $\tau \in [0,1]$ the non-Hermiticity parameter, we explicitly characterise the regions in the parameter space $ (p, c, \tau) $ where each topological type emerges. For cases where the droplet is either simply or doubly connected, we provide an explicit description of the limiting spectrum and the corresponding electrostatic energies. As an application, we derive the asymptotic behaviour of the moments of the characteristic polynomial for elliptic Ginibre matrices in the exponentially varying regime.</description>

      <title>Signature Reconstruction from Randomized Signatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlled ordinary differential equations driven by continuous bounded variation curves can be considered a continuous time analogue of recurrent neural networks for the construction of expressive features of the input curves. We ask up to which extent well known signature features of such curves can be reconstructed from controlled ordinary differential equations with (untrained) random vector fields. The answer turns out to be algebraically involved, but essentially the number of signature features, which can be reconstructed from the non-linear flow of the controlled ordinary differential equation, is exponential in its hidden dimension, when the vector fields are chosen to be neural with depth two. Moreover, we characterize a general linear independence condition on arbitrary vector fields, under which the signature features up to some fixed order can always be reconstructed. Algebraically speaking this complements in a quantitative manner several well known results from the theory of Lie algebras of vector fields and puts them in a context of machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce multilevel Picard (MLP) approximations for McKean-Vlasov stochastic differential equations (SDEs) with nonconstant diffusion coefficient. Under standard Lipschitz assumptions on the coefficients, we show that the MLP algorithm approximates the solution of the SDE in the $L^2$-sense without the curse of dimensionality. The latter means that its computational cost grows at most polynomially in both the dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed error tolerance. In two numerical experiments, we demonstrate its applicability by approximating McKean-Vlasov SDEs in dimensions up to 10000.</description>

      <title>New technique for parameter estimation and improved fits to experimental data for a set of compound Poisson distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compound Poisson distributions have been employed by many authors to fit experimental data, typically via the method of moments or maximum likelihood estimation. We propose a new technique and apply it to several sets of published data. It yields better fits than those obtained by the original authors for a set of widely employed compound Poisson distributions (in some cases, significantly better). The technique employs the power spectrum (the absolute square of the characteristic function). The new idea is suggested as a useful addition to the tools for parameter estimation of compound Poisson distributions.</description>

      <title>Is In-Context Universality Enough? MLPs are Also Universal In-Context</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03327v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of transformers is often linked to their ability to perform in-context learning. Recent work shows that transformers are universal in context, capable of approximating any real-valued continuous function of a context (a probability measure over $\mathcal{X}\subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$) and a query $x\in \mathcal{X}$. This raises the question: Does in-context universality explain their advantage over classical models? We answer this in the negative by proving that MLPs with trainable activation functions are also universal in-context. This suggests the transformer's success is likely due to other factors like inductive bias or training stability.</description>

      <title>The Performance Of The Unadjusted Langevin Algorithm Without Smoothness Assumptions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.03458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the problem of sampling from distributions whose densities are not necessarily smooth nor log-concave. We propose a simple Langevin-based algorithm that does not rely on popular but computationally challenging techniques, such as the Moreau Yosida envelope or Gaussian smoothing. We derive non-asymptotic guarantees for the convergence of the algorithm to the target distribution in Wasserstein distances. Non asymptotic bounds are also provided for the performance of the algorithm as an optimizer, specifically for the solution of associated excess risk optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Long time Hurst regularity of fractional SDEs and their ergodic means</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.06648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.06648v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fractional Brownian motion can be considered as a Gaussian field indexed by $(t,H)\in {\mathbb{R}_{+}\times (0,1)}$, where $H$ is the Hurst parameter. On compact time intervals, it is known to be almost surely jointly H\"older continuous in time and Lipschitz continuous in $H$. First, we extend this result to the whole time interval $\mathbb{R}_{+}$ and consider both simple and rectangular increments. Then we consider SDEs driven by fractional Brownian motion with contractive drift. The solutions and their ergodic means are proven to be almost surely H\"older continuous in $H$, uniformly in time. This result is used in a separate work for statistical applications. We also deduce a sensibility result of the invariant measure in $H$.
  The proofs are based on variance estimates of the increments of the fractional Brownian motion and fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes, multiparameter versions of the Garsia-Rodemich-Rumsey lemma and a combinatorial argument to estimate the expectation of a product of Gaussian variables.</description>

      <title>Self-switching random walks on Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs feel the phase transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study random walks on Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs in which, every time the random walk returns to the starting point, first an edge probability is independently sampled according to a priori measure $\mu$, and then an Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graph is sampled according to that edge probability. When the edge probability $p$ does not depend on the size of the graph $n$ (dense case), we show that the proportion of time the random walk spends on different values of $p$ -- {\it occupation measure} -- converges to the a priori measure $\mu$ as $n$ goes to infinity. More interestingly, when $p=\lambda/n$ (sparse case), we show that the occupation measure converges to a limiting measure with a density that is a function of the survival probability of a Poisson branching process. This limiting measure is supported on the supercritial values for the Erd\"os-R\'enyi random graphs, showing that self-witching random walks can detect the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Entropy-cost type Propagation of Chaos for Mean Field Particle System with Bounded Measurable Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.02825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.02825v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the quantitative entropy-cost type propagation of chaos for mean field interacting particle system is obtained, where the interaction is only assumed to be bounded measurable and the initial distribution of a single particle converges to that of the corresponding McKean-Vlasov SDEs in $L^1$-transportation cost $\W_1^\Psi$ induced by some cost function $\Psi$. The mean field interacting particle system with common noise is also investigated and the quantitative entropy-cost type conditional propagation of chaos is established. The results weaken the initial assumption of the existing entropy-entropy type propagation of chaos in some sense.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.11863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove anomalous-diffusion scaling for a one-dimensional stochastic kinetic dynamics, in which the stochastic drift is driven by an exogenous Bessel noise, and also includes endogenous volatility which is permitted to have arbitrary dependence with the exogenous noise. We identify the superdiffusive scaling exponent for the model, and prove a weak convergence result on the corresponding scale. We show how our result extends to admit, as exogenous noise processes, not only Bessel processes but more general processes satisfying certain asymptotic conditions.</description>

      <title>The Limiting Spectral Distribution of Various Matrix Ensembles Under the Anticommutator Operation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Inspired by the quantization of classical quantities and Rankin Selberg convolution, we study the anticommutator operation $\{\cdot, \cdot\}$, where $\{A,B\} = AB + BA$, applied to real symmetric random matrix ensembles including Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE), the palindromic Toeplitz ensemble (PTE), the $k$-checkerboard ensemble, and the block $k$-circulant ensemble ($k$-BCE). Using combinatorial and topological techniques related to non-crossing and free matching properties of GOE and PTE, we obtain closed-form formulae for the moments of the limiting spectral distributions of $\{$GOE, GOE$\}$, $\{$PTE, PTE$\}$, $\{$GOE, PTE$\}$ and establish the corresponding limiting spectral distributions with generating functions and convolution. On the other hand, $\{$GOE, $k$-checkerboard$\}$ and $\{$$k$-checkerboard, $j$-checkerboard$\}$ exhibit entirely different spectral behavior than the other anticommutator ensembles: while the spectrum of $\{$GOE, $k$-checkerboard$\}$ consists of 1 bulk regime of size $\Theta(N)$ and 1 blip regime of size $\Theta(N^{3/2})$, the spectrum of $\{$$k$-checkerboard, $j$-checkerboard$\}$ consists of 1 bulk regime of size $\Theta(N)$, 2 intermediary blip regimes of size $\Theta(N^{3/2})$, and 1 largest blip regime of size $\Theta(N^2)$. In both cases, with the appropriate weight function, we are able to isolate the largest regime for other regime(s) and analyze its moments and convergence results via combinatorics. We end with numerical computation of lower even moments of $\{$GOE, $k$-BCE$\}$ and $\{$$k$-BCE, $k$-BCE$\}$ based on genus expansion and discussion on the challenge with analyzing the intermediary blip regimes of $\{$$k$-checkerboard, $j$-checkerboard$\}$.</description>

      <title>Multilevel Picard approximation algorithm for semilinear partial integro-differential equations and its complexity analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09639v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce a multilevel Picard approximation algorithm for semilinear parabolic partial integro-differential equations (PIDEs). We prove that the numerical approximation scheme converges to the unique viscosity solution of the PIDE under consideration. To that end, we derive a Feynman-Kac representation for the unique viscosity solution of the semilinear PIDE, extending the classical Feynman-Kac representation for linear PIDEs. Furthermore, we show that the algorithm does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality, i.e. the computational complexity of the algorithm is bounded polynomially in the dimension $d$ and the reciprocal of the prescribed accuracy $\varepsilon$. We also provide a numerical example in up to 10'000 dimensions to demonstrate its applicability.</description>

      <title>A simple algorithm for output range analysis for deep neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02700v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for the output range estimation problem in Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) by integrating a Simulated Annealing (SA) algorithm tailored to operate within constrained domains and ensure convergence towards global optima. The method effectively addresses the challenges posed by the lack of local geometric information and the high non-linearity inherent to DNNs, making it applicable to a wide variety of architectures, with a special focus on Residual Networks (ResNets) due to their practical importance. Unlike existing methods, our algorithm imposes minimal assumptions on the internal architecture of neural networks, thereby extending its usability to complex models. Theoretical analysis guarantees convergence, while extensive empirical evaluations-including optimization tests involving functions with multiple local minima-demonstrate the robustness of our algorithm in navigating non-convex response surfaces. The experimental results highlight the algorithm's efficiency in accurately estimating DNN output ranges, even in scenarios characterized by high non-linearity and complex constraints. For reproducibility, Python codes and datasets used in the experiments are publicly available through our GitHub repository.</description>

Abstract: We provide a very elementary proof of a classical extremality result due to Sidorenko (Discrete Math. 131.1-3, 1994), which states that among all connected graphs $G$ on $k$ vertices, the $k$-vertex star maximises the number of graph homomorphisms of $G$ into any graph $H$.</description>

      <title>$S$-transform in Finite Free Probability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09337v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a simplified explanation of why free fractional convolution corresponds to the differentiation of polynomials, by finding how the finite free cumulants of a polynomial behave under differentiation. This approach allows us to understand the limiting behaviour of the coefficients $\widetilde{\mathsf{e}}_k(p_d)$ of $p_d$ when the degree $d$ tends to infinity and the empirical root distribution of $p_d$ has a limiting distribution $\mu$ on $[0,\infty)$. Specifically, we relate the asymptotic behaviour of the ratio of consecutive coefficients to Voiculescu's $S$-transform of $\mu$. This prompts us to define a new notion of finite $S$-transform, which converges to Voiculescu's $S$-transform in the large $d$ limit. It also satisfies several analogous properties to those of the $S$-transform in free probability, including multiplicativity and monotonicity. This new insight has several applications that strengthen the connection between free and finite free probability. Most notably, we generalize the approximation of $\boxtimes_d$ to $\boxtimes$ and prove a finite approximation of the Tucci--Haagerup--M\"oller limit theorem in free probability, conjectured by two of the authors. We also provide finite analogues of the free multiplicative Poisson law, the free max-convolution powers and some free stable laws.</description>

      <title>Random permutations acting on $k$--tuples have near--optimal spectral gap for $k=\mathrm{poly}(n)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We extend Friedman's theorem to show that, for any fixed $r$, the random $2r$--regular Schreier graphs depicting the action of $r$ random permutations of $[n]$ on $k_{n}$--tuples of distinct elements in $[n]$ are a.a.s. weakly Ramanujan, for any $k_{n}\leq n^{\frac{1}{12}-\epsilon}.$ Previously this was known only for $k$--tuples where $k$ is fixed. In fact, we prove the stronger result of strong convergence of random matrices in irreducible representations of $S_{n}$ of quasi--exponential dimension.
  We also give a new bound for the expected stable irreducible character of a random permutation obtained via a word map, showing that $\mathbb{E}\left[\chi^{\mu}\left(w(\sigma_{1},\dots,\sigma_{r})\right)\right]=O\left(n^{-k}\right)$, where $k$ is the number of boxes outside the first row of the Young diagram $\mu,$ solving one aspect of a conjecture of Hanany and Puder. We obtain this bound using an extension of Wise's $w$--cycle conjecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02275v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper serves as a user's guide to sampling strategies for sliced optimal transport. We provide reminders and additional regularity results on the Sliced Wasserstein distance. We detail the construction methods, generation time complexity, theoretical guarantees, and conditions for each strategy. Additionally, we provide insights into their suitability for sliced optimal transport in theory. Extensive experiments on both simulated and real-world data offer a representative comparison of the strategies, culminating in practical recommendations for their best usage.</description>
