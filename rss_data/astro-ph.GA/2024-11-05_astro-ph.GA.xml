      <title>A Wideband Chemical Survey of Massive Star-forming Regions at Subarcsecond Resolution with the Submillimeter Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive star-forming regions exhibit a rich chemistry with complex gas distributions, especially on small scales. While surveys have yielded constraints on typical gas conditions, they often have coarse spatial resolution and limited bandwidths. Thus, to establish an interpretative framework for these efforts, detailed observations that simultaneously provide high sensitivity, spatial resolution, and large bandwidths for a subset of diverse sources are needed. Here, we present wideband (32 GHz) Submillimeter Array observations of four high-mass star-forming regions (G28.20-0.05, G20.08-0.14 N, G35.58-0.03, W33 Main) at subarcsecond resolution, where we detect and spatially-resolve 100s of lines from over 60 molecules, including many complex organic molecules (COMs). The chemical richness of our sample is consistent with an evolutionary sequence from the line-rich hot cores and HC HII regions of G28.20-0.05 and G20.08-0.14 N to the more chemically-modest UC HII regions in G35.58-0.03, followed by the molecule-poor HII region W33 Main. We detect lines across a range of excitation conditions (Eu=20 to &gt;800 K) and from numerous isotopologues, which enables robust estimates of gas properties. We derive nearly constant COM column density ratios that agree with literature values in other low- and high-mass protostellar cores, supporting the idea that COM abundances are set during the pre-stellar phase. In all regions, we identify spatial offsets among different molecular families, due to a combination of source physical structure and chemistry. In particular, we find potential evidence of carbon grain sublimation in G28.20-0.05 and identify an elemental oxygen gradient and rich sulfur-chemistry in G35.58-0.03. Overall, these results demonstrate that the SMA's wide bandwidth is a powerful tool to untangle the complex molecular gas structures associated with massive star formation.</description>

      <title>A High-Resolution Far-Infrared Survey to Probe Black Hole-Galaxy Co-Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Far-infrared (FIR) surveys are critical to probing the co-evolution of black holes and galaxies, since of order half the light from accreting black holes and active star formation is emitted in the rest-frame infrared over $0.5\lesssim z \lesssim 10$. For deep fields with areas of 1 deg$^2$ or less, like the legacy surveys GOODS, COSMOS, and CANDELS, source crowding means that sub-arcsecond resolution is essential. In this paper we show with a simulation of the FIR sky that measurements made with a small telescope (2 m) at low angular resolution yield biased results, and we demonstrate the scientific value of a space mission that would offer sub-arcsecond resolution. We envisage a facility that would provide high-resolution imaging and spectroscopy over the wavelength range $25-400\,\mu$m, and we present predictions for an extragalactic survey covering $0.5\,\hbox{deg}^2$. Such a survey is expected to detect tens of thousands of star-forming galaxies and thousands of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), in multiple FIR lines (e.g. [CII], [OI], [CI]) and continuum. At the longest wavelengths (200-400$\,\mu$m), it would probe beyond the reionization epoch, up to $z\sim 7$-8. A combination of spectral resolution, line sensitivity, and broad spectral coverage would allow us to learn about the physical conditions (temperature, density, metallicity) characterizing the interstellar medium of galaxies over the past $\sim 12$ billion years and to investigate galaxy-AGN co-evolution.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Mechanisms Behind the Distribution of Galactic Metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolution and distribution of metals within galaxies are critical for understanding galactic evolution and star formation processes, but the mechanisms responsible for shaping this distribution remain uncertain. In this study we carry out high-resolution simulations of an isolated Milky Way-like galaxy, including a star-by-star treatment of both feedback and element injection. We include seven key isotopes of observational and physical interest, and which are distributed across different nucleosynthetic channels. After running the simulations to statistical steady state, we examine the spatial and temporal statistics of the metal distributions and their fluctuations. We show that these statistics reflect a mixture properties dependent on the large-scale structure of the galaxy and those that vary depending on the particular nucleosynthetic channel that dominates production of a particular isotope. The former ensure that different elements are highly-correlated with one another even if they have different nucleosynthetic origins, and their spatial correlations vary together in time. The latter means that the small variations between elements that are present naturally break them into nucleosynthetic familiars, with elements that originate from different channels correlating better with each other than with elements with different origins. Our findings suggest both challenges and opportunities for ongoing efforts to use chemical measurements of gas and stars to unravel the history and physics of galaxy assembly.</description>

      <title>Constraining the excitation of molecular gas in Two Quasar-Starburst Systems at $z \sim 6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array observations of CO(8-7), (9-8), and (10-9) lines, as well as the underlying continuum for two far-infrared luminous quasars: SDSS J2054-0005 at $\rm z=6.0389$ and SDSS J0129-0035 at $\rm z=5.7788$. Both quasars were previously detected in CO (2-1) and (6-5) transitions, making them candidates for studying the CO Spectral Line Energy Distribution (SLED) of quasars at $z \sim 6$. Utilizing the radiative transfer code CLOUDY, we fit the CO SLED with two heating mechanisms, including the photo-dissociation region (PDR) and X-ray-dominated region (XDR) for both objects. The CO SLEDs can be fitted by either a dense PDR component with an extremely strong far-ultraviolet radiation field (gas density $ n_{\rm H} \sim 10^6 \, \rm cm^{-3}$ and field strength $G_0 \gtrsim 10^6$) or a two-component model including a PDR and an XDR. However, the line ratios, including \tir and previous \cii and \ci measurements, argue against a very high PDR radiation field strength. Thus, the results prefer a PDR+XDR origin for the CO SLED. The excitation of the high-J CO lines in both objects is likely dominated by the central AGN. We then check the CO (9-8)-to-(6-5) line luminosity ratio $r_{96}$ for all $z \sim 6$ quasars with available CO SLEDs (seven in total) and find that there are no clear correlations between $r_{96}$ and both \fir and the AGN UV luminosities. This further demonstrates the complexity of the CO excitation powered by both the AGN and nuclear star formation in these young quasar host galaxies.</description>

      <title>Euclid: The $r_{\rm b}$-$M_\ast$ relation as a function of redshift. I. The $5 \times 10^9 M_\odot$ black hole in NGC 1272</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core ellipticals, massive
  early-type galaxies have an almost constant inner surface brightness
  profile. The size of the core region correlates with
  the mass of the finally merged black hole.
  Here we report the first
  Euclid-based dynamical mass determination of a supermassive black
  hole. We study the centre of NGC 1272, the
  second most luminous elliptical galaxy in the Perseus cluster,
  combining the Euclid VIS photometry coming from the Early Release
  Observations of the Perseus cluster with VIRUS spectroscopic
  observations at the Hobby-Eberly Telescope.
  The core of NGC 1272 is detected
  on the Euclid VIS image. Its size is
  $1.29\pm 0.07''$ or 0.45 kpc, determined by
  fitting PSF-convolved core-S\'ersic and Nuker-law functions. The
  two-dimensional stellar kinematics of the galaxy is measured from
  the VIRUS spectra by deriving optimally regularized non-parametric
  line-of-sight velocity distributions. Dynamical models of the
  galaxy are constructed using our axisymmetric and triaxial
  Schwarzschild codes.
  We measure a black hole mass of $(5\pm3) \times 10^9 M_\odot$,
  in line with the expectation from the
  $M_{\rm BH}$-$r_{\rm b}$ correlation, but eight times larger than
  predicted by the $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma$ correlation (at $1.8\sigma$ significance).
  The core size, rather than the velocity dispersion, allows one to
  select galaxies harboring the most massive black holes. The
  spatial resolution, wide area coverage, and depth of the \Euclid
  (Wide and Deep) surveys allow us to find cores of passive galaxies
  larger than 2 kpc up to redshift 1.</description>

      <title>The first identification of Lyman $\alpha$ Changing-look Quasars at high-redshift in DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01949v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two cases of Ly$\alpha$ changing-look (CL) quasars (J1306 and J1512) along with two additional candidates (J1511 and J1602), all discovered serendipitously at $z &gt;2$ through the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). It is the first time to capture CL events in Ly$\alpha$ at high redshift, which is crucial for understanding underlying mechanisms driving the CL phenomenon and the evolution of high-redshift quasars and galaxies. The variability of all four sources is confirmed by the significant change of amplitude in the $r$ band ($|r_{\rm DESI}-r_{\rm SDSS}| &gt;0.5 \ \rm mag$). We find that the accretion rate in the dim state for these CL objects corresponds to a relatively low value ($\mathscr{\dot M} \approx 2\times10^{-3}$), which suggests that the inner region of the accretion disk might be in transition between the Advection Dominated Accretion Flow ($\mathscr{\dot M}&lt;10^{-3}\sim 10^{-2}$) and the canonical accretion disk (optically thick, geometrically thin). However, unlike in C {\sc iv} CL quasars in which broad Ly$\alpha$ remained, the broad C {\sc iv} may still persist after a CL event occurs in Ly$\alpha$, making the physical origin of the CL and ionization mechanism event more puzzling and interesting.</description>

      <title>The JCMT BISTRO Survey: The Magnetic Fields of the IC 348 Star-forming Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present 850 $\mu$m polarization observations of the IC 348 star-forming region in the Perseus molecular cloud as part of the B-fields In STar-forming Region Observation (BISTRO) survey. We study the magnetic properties of two cores (HH 211 MMS and IC 348 MMS) and a filamentary structure of IC 348. We find that the overall field tends to be more perpendicular than parallel to the filamentary structure of the region. The polarization fraction decreases with intensity, and we estimate the trend by power-law and the mean of the Rice distribution fittings. The power indices for the cores are much smaller than 1, indicative of possible grain growth to micron size in the cores. We also measure the magnetic field strengths of the two cores and the filamentary area separately by applying the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi method and its alternative version for compressed medium. The estimated mass-to-flux ratios are 0.45-2.20 and 0.63-2.76 for HH 211 MMS and IC 348 MMS, respectively, while the ratios for the filament is 0.33-1.50. This result may suggest that the transition from subcritical to supercritical conditions occurs at the core scale ($\sim$ 0.05 pc) in the region. In addition, we study the energy balance of the cores and find that the relative strength of turbulence to the magnetic field tends to be stronger for IC 348 MMS than HH 211 MMS. The result could potentially explain the different configurations inside the two cores: a single protostellar system in HH 211 MMS and multiple protostars in IC 348 MMS.</description>

      <title>Radio Continuum Halos of 7 Nearby Large Galaxies using uGMRT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of deep radio observations of 7 nearby large galaxies observed using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) 0.3-0.5 GHz receivers with an angular resolution of $\sim$10 arcsec. The achieved sensitivities of these observations range from $\approx$15 to 50 $\mu$Jy/beam which is $\approx$3-4 factor lower than the previous observations at these frequencies. For 2 galaxies (NGC3344 and NGC3627) with moderate inclination angles, significant diffuse emissions are seen for the first time. Detected radio halos in the vertical direction are significantly larger in our 0.4 GHz maps than compared to the observations at $\sim$1.5 GHz for 4 nearly edge-on galaxies - NGC3623, NGC4096, NGC4594, and NGC4631. For these 4 galaxies, significantly larger halos are also detected along the galaxy disk. For NGC3623 and NGC4594, we could detect elongated radio disks which was not seen before. We also present new uGMRT images of NGC3344 and NGC3623 at 1.3 GHz and a new VLA image of NGC3627 at 1.5 GHz. We fitted an exponential function to the flux densities along different cross-cuts and found a significantly wider distribution at 0.4 GHz uGMRT images than compared to the high-frequency images at $\sim$1.5 GHz. Using maps at 0.144, 0.4, and $\sim$1.5 GHz, we made spectral index maps of the 7 sample galaxies and found steepening of the spectrum up to a value of $\sim$ -1.5 in the halo regions of the galaxies.</description>

      <title>Obscured star clusters in the Inner Milky Way. How many massive young clusters are still awaiting detection?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims. Our goal is twofold. First, to detect new clusters we apply the newest methods for the detection of clustering with the best available wide-field sky surveys in the mid-infrared because they are the least affected by extinction. Second, we address the question of cluster detection's completeness, for now limiting it to the most massive star clusters.
  Methods. This search is based on the mid-infrared Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE), to minimize the effect of dust extinction. The search Ordering Points To Identify the Clustering Structure (OPTICS) clustering algorithm is applied to identify clusters, after excluding the bluest, presumably foreground sources, to improve the cluster-to-field contrast. The success rate for cluster identification is estimated with a semi-empirical simulation that adds clusters, based on the real objects, to the point source catalog, to be recovered later with the same search algorithm that was used in the search for new cluster candidates. As a first step, this is limited to the most massive star clusters with a total mass of 104 $M_\odot$.
  Results. Our automated search, combined with inspection of the color-magnitude diagrams and images yielded 659 cluster candidates; 106 of these appear to have been previously identified, suggesting that a large hidden population of star clusters still exists in the inner Milky Way. However, the search for the simulated supermassive clusters achieves a recovery rate of 70 to 95%, depending on the distance and extinction toward them.
  Conclusions. The new candidates, if confirmed, indicate that the Milky Way still harbors a sizeable population of still unknown clusters. However, they must be objects of modest richness, because our simulation indicates that there is no substantial hidden population of supermassive clusters in the central region of our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Semi-empirical calibration of the oxygen abundance for LINER galaxies based on SDSS-IV MaNGA -- The case for strong and weak AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a semi-empirical calibration between the oxygen abundance and the $N2$ emission-line ratio for Low Ionization Nuclear Emission Regions (LINERs). This relation was derived by comparing the optical spectroscopic data of 118 nuclear spaxels classified as LINERs using three different BPT diagrams from the Mapping Nearby Galaxies survey (MaNGA) and sub-classified as weak (wAGN, 84 objects) and strong (sAGN, 34 objects) AGN (active galactic nucleus) from the WHAN diagnostic diagram and photoionization model results obtained with the {\sc cloudy} code assuming gas accretion into a black hole (representing an AGN). We found that our wAGN LINERs exhibit an oxygen abundance in the range of $8.50 \lesssim \mathrm{12+\log(O/H)} \lesssim 8.90 $, with an average value of $\mathrm{12+\log(O/H)}=8.68$, while our sAGN LINERs exhibit an oxygen abundance in the range of $8.51 \lesssim \: \mathrm{12+\log(O/H)} \: \lesssim \: 8.81 $, with an average value of $\mathrm{12+\log(O/H)}=8.65$. Our abundance estimations are in good agreement with those derived for another two different samples one of them with 463 Seyfert 2 objects and the other with 43 LINERs galaxies ionized by post-AGB stars, showing that the assumptions of our models are likely suitable for wAGN and sAGN LINERs. A relation between the equivalent width of the observed H$\alpha$ emission-line and the estimated ionization parameter provided by models was obtained. Our results also suggest that LINERs does not show a clear correlation between oxygen abundances and the stellar mass of the hosting galaxies.</description>

Abstract: Variations in scaling behavior in the flux and emissions of gravitational lensed quasars can provide valuable information about the dynamics within the sources and their cosmological evolution with time. Here, we study the multifractal behavior of the light curves of 14 lensed quasars with multiple images in the $r$ band, with redshift ranging from 0.657 to 2.730, in the search for potential differences in nonlinearity between the signals of the quasar multiple images. Among these lensed systems, nine present two images, two present three images, and three present four images. To this end, we apply the wavelet transform-based multifractal analysis formalism called Wavelet Transform Modulus Maxima (WTMM). We identify strong multifractal signatures in the light curves of the images of all analyzed lensed quasar systems, independently of the number of images, with a significant difference between the degree of multifractality of all the images and combinations. We have also searched for a possible connection between the degree of multifractality and the characteristic parameters related to the quasar source and the lensing galaxy. These parameters include the Einstein ring radius and the accretion disk size and the characteristic timescales related to microlensing variability. The analysis reveals some apparent trends, pointing to a decrease in the degree of multifractality with the increase of the quasar's source size and timescale. Using a larger sample and following a similar approach, the present study confirms a previous finding for the quasar Q0957+561.</description>

      <title>HYPERION: broad-band X-ray-to-near-infrared emission of Quasars in the first billion years of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We aim at characterizing the X-ray-to-optical/near-infrared broad-band emission of luminous QSOs in the first Gyr of cosmic evolution to understand whether they exhibit differences compared to the lower-\textit{z} QSO population. Our goal is also to provide for these objects a reliable and uniform catalog of SED fitting derivable properties such as bolometric and monochromatic luminosities, Eddington ratios, dust extinction, strength of the hot dust emission. We characterize the X-ray/UV emission of each QSO using average SEDs from luminous Type 1 sources and calculate bolometric and monochromatic luminosities. Finally we construct a mean SED extending from the X-rays to the NIR bands. We find that the UV-optical emission of these QSOs can be modelled with templates of $z\sim$2 luminous QSOs. We observe that the bolometric luminosities derived adopting some bolometric corrections at 3000 \AA\ ($BC_{3000\text{\AA}}$) largely used in the literature are slightly overestimated by 0.13 dex as they also include reprocessed IR emission. We estimate a revised value, i.e. $BC_{3000\text{\AA}}=3.3 $ which can be used for deriving $L_\text{bol}$ in \textit{z} $\geq$ 6 QSOs. A sub-sample of 11 QSOs is provided with rest-frame NIR photometry, showing a broad range of hot dust emission strength, with two sources exhibiting low levels of emission. Despite potential observational biases arising from non-uniform photometric coverage and selection biases, we produce a X-ray-to-NIR mean SED for QSOs at \textit{z} $\gtrsim$ 6, revealing a good match with templates of lower-redshift, luminous QSOs up to the UV-optical range, with a slightly enhanced contribution from hot dust in the NIR.</description>

      <title>The twisted jets and magnetic fields of the extended radio galaxy 4C 70.19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The appearance of the jets and lobes of some radio galaxies makes it difficult to assign them to a known class of objects. This is often due to the activity of the central engine and/or interactions with the environment, as well as projection effects. We analyse the radio data for an apparently asymmetric radio source 4C70.19, which is associated with the giant elliptical galaxy NGC6048. The source shows distorted radio jets and lobes, one of which bends by 180 degrees. The aim of our study is to explain the nature of the observed distortions. We used LOFAR, Effelsberg, and VLA radio data in a wide range of frequencies. At high frequencies, we also used radio polarimetry to study the properties of the magnetic fields. Additionally, we made use of optical, infra-red, and X-ray data. Polarisation data suggest shearing of the magnetic fields at points where the jets bend. The low-frequency LOFAR map at 145 MHz, as well as the sensitive single-dish Effelsberg map at 8.35 GHz, reveal previously undetected diffuse emission around the source. The rotation measure (RM) derived from the polarimetric data allowed us to estimate the density of the medium surrounding the source, which agrees with typical densities of the intergalactic medium or the outer parts of insterstellar halos. We propose that the southern jet is bent in the same manner as the northern one, but that it is inclined to the sky plane. Both these bends are likely caused by the orbital motion within the galaxy group, as well as interactions with the intergalactic medium. Our analyses suggest that, despite its complex morphology, 4C70.19 seems to be intrinsically symmetric with a physical extent of up to 600 kpc, and that the diffuse emission detected in our high-sensitivity maps is related to radio plumes that are expanding behind the source.</description>

      <title>Morphologies of galaxies within voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we investigate the effects of the environment on the evolution of void galaxies. In particular, we study their morphology and explore its dependence with their location within the void where the galaxies reside, as well as with properties of the void, such as void size or galaxy number-density. The sample of void galaxies that we use in this study is based on the catalogue of cosmic voids and void galaxies in the SDSS-DR7. Since we are interested into study the morphology of void galaxies, we select galaxies in the redshift range 0.005$\leq$z$\leq$0.080, and use the public galaxy morphologies for SDSS with Deep Learning algorithms to divide the sample between early- and late-type void galaxies. We analyse the fraction of galaxies of each morphology type as a function of the void-centric distance, the size of the voids, and the density of galaxies in each void. There is a higher abundance of late-type galaxies with respect to early-type galaxies within voids, which remains nearly constant from the inner to the outer part of the voids. We do not find any dependence of the fraction of early- and late-type galaxies with respect to the size of the voids or the number-density of galaxies in the voids. Galaxies in voids follow the morphology-density relation, in the sense that the majority of the galaxies in voids (the most under-dense large-scale environments) are late-type galaxies. However, we find no difference between voids with lower or higher volume number-density of galaxies: the fraction of early- and late-type galaxies do not depend on the density of the voids. The physical processes responsible for the evolution from late towards earlier types (such as external environmental quenching) are not sufficiently effective in voids or so slow (internal secular quenching) that their contributions do not appear in the morphology-density relation.</description>

      <title>Static Microlensing: Concept, Method and Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02161v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel microlensing event search method that differs from either the traditional time domain method, astrometric microlensing, or the parallax microlensing method. Our method assumes that stars with nearly identical "genes" - normalized Spectral Energy Distributions (SED) bear the same luminosity within the intrinsic scatter due to stellar properties. Given a sample of stars with similar normalized SEDs, the outliers in luminosity distribution can be considered microlensing events by excluding other possible variations. In this case, we can select microlensing events from archive data rather than time domain monitoring the sky, which we describe as static microlensing. Following this concept, we collect the data from Gaia DR3 and SDSS DR16 from the northern galactic cap at high galactic latitudes. This area is not preferable for normal microlensing search due to the low stellar density and, therefore, low discovery rate. By applying a similarity search algorithm, we find 5 microlensing candidates in the Galactic halo.</description>

      <title>The counter-rotating stellar core of NGC 4494</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Kinematically decoupled cores (KDCs) are often found in the centers of early-type galaxies.
  Aims. We aim to investigate the kinematics, structure, and stellar populations of the KDC residing in the early-type galaxy NGC 4494 to understand its formation.
  Methods. We used long-slit spectroscopic data obtained with the FORS2 instrument on the VLT to measure the stellar kinematics and stellar populations. We performed a spectroscopic decomposition to disentangle the properties of the KDC from those of the host galaxy and construct models of the observed rotation curve.
  Results. The rotation curve is characterized by two symmetric dips at |R|=6", where the rotation velocity drops to zero. Contrary to previous studies that explained the decoupled structure as a rapidly co-rotating disk, our analysis clearly shows that it is a counter-rotating component. A counter-rotating core is indeed needed to reproduce the observed dip in the velocity curve. The properties of the stellar populations of the decoupled core and the main galaxy are very similar: old stars (12-13 Gyr) with slightly super-solar metallicities (0&lt;[Z/H]&lt;0.15 dex) and alpha-enhanced (0 &lt;[alpha/Fe]&lt; 0.15 dex).
  Conclusions. Our results indicate that the counter-rotating component is a disk of about 1 kpc in diameter that is obscured by dust in the central 0.12 kpc. The properties of its stellar populations suggest that it formed from the same material as the main stellar body of the host galaxy. This could have happened via internal processes such as the precession of a pre-existing rotating core, or, alternatively, via gas accretion in retrograde orbits followed by star formation. In the latter scenario, the accretion event occurred almost simultaneously with the formation of the galaxy, using material that had the same composition as the gas from which the stars in the main body of the galaxy were formed.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the disky second generation of stars in globular clusters on cosmological timescale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02303v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Many Milky Way globular clusters (GCs) host multiple stellar populations, challenging the traditional view of GCs as single-population systems. It has been suggested that second-generation stars could form in a disk from gas lost by first-generation stars or from external accreted gas. Aims. We investigate how the introduction of a second stellar generation affects mass loss, internal mixing, and rotational properties of GCs in a time-varying Galactic tidal field and different orbital configurations. Methods. We conducted direct N-body simulations of GCs on three types of orbits derived from the observed Milky Way GCs. We evolved the clusters for 8 Gyr in the time-varying Galactic potential of the IllustrisTNG-100 cosmological simulation. After 2 Gyr, we introduced a second stellar generation, comprising 5% of the initial mass of the first generation, as a flattened disk of stars. For comparison, we ran control simulations using a static Galactic potential and isolated clusters. Results. We present the mass loss, structural evolution, and kinematic properties of GCs with two stellar generations, focusing on tidal mass, half-mass radii, velocity distributions, and angular momentum. Conclusions. Our results show that the mass loss of GCs depends primarily on their orbital parameters, with tighter orbits leading to higher mass loss. The Galaxy's growth resulted in tighter orbits, meaning GCs lost less mass than if its mass had always been constant. The initially flattened second-generation disk became nearly spherical within one relaxation time. However, whether its distinct rotational signature was retained depends on the orbit: for the long radial orbit, it vanished quickly; for the tube orbit, it lasted several Gyr; but for the circular orbit, rotation persisted until the present day</description>

      <title>Virgo Filaments IV: Using WISE to Measure the Modification of Star-Forming Disks in the Extended Regions Around the Virgo Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent theoretical work and targeted observational studies suggest that filaments are sites of galaxy preprocessing. The aim of the WISESize project is to directly probe galaxies over the full range of environments to quantify and characterize extrinsic galaxy quenching in the local Universe. In this paper, we use GALFIT to measure the infrared 12$\mu$m ($R_{12}$) and 3.4$\mu$m ($R_{3.4}$) effective radii of 603 late-type galaxies in and surrounding the Virgo cluster. We find that Virgo cluster galaxies show smaller star-forming disks relative to their field counterparts at the $2.5\sigma$ level, while filament galaxies show smaller star-forming disks to almost $1.5\sigma$. Our data, therefore, show that cluster galaxies experience significant effects on their star-forming disks prior to their final quenching period. There is also tentative support for the hypothesis that galaxies are preprocessed in filamentary regions surrounding clusters. On the other hand, galaxies belonging to rich groups and poor groups do not differ significantly from those in the field. We additionally find hints of a positive correlation between stellar mass and size ratio for both rich group and filament galaxies, though the uncertainties on these data are consistent with no correlation. We compare our size measurements with the predictions from two variants of a state-of-the-art semi-analytic model (SAM), one which includes starvation and the other incorporating both starvation and ram-pressure stripping (RPS). Our data appear to disfavor the SAM, which includes RPS for the rich group, filament, and cluster samples, which contributes to improved constraints for general models of galaxy quenching.</description>

      <title>POSYDON Version 2: Population Synthesis with Detailed Binary-Evolution Simulations across a Cosmological Range of Metallicities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether considering rare astrophysical events on cosmological scales or unresolved stellar populations, accurate models must account for the integrated contribution from the entire history of star formation upon which that population is built. Here, we describe the second version of POSYDON, an open-source binary population synthesis code based on extensive grids of detailed binary evolution models computed using the MESA code, which follows both stars' structures as a binary system evolves through its complete evolution from the zero-age main sequence, through multiple phases of mass transfer and supernovae, to their death as compact objects. To generate synthetic binary populations, POSYDON uses advanced methods to interpolate between our large, densely spaced grids of simulated binaries. In our updated version of POSYDON, we account for the evolution of stellar binaries across a cosmological range of metallicities, extending from $10^{-4}\,Z_{\odot}$ to $2\,Z_{\odot}$, including grids specifically focused on the Small and Large Magellanic Clouds ($0.2\,Z_{\odot}$ and $0.45\,Z_{\odot}$). In addition to describing our model grids and detailing our methodology, we outline several improvements to POSYDON. These include the incorporation of single stars in stellar populations, a treatment for stellar mergers, and a careful modeling of "reverse-mass transferring" binaries, in which an once-accreting star later becomes a donor star. Our simulations are focused on binaries with at least one high-mass component, such as those that host neutron stars and black holes, and we provide post-processing methods to account for the cosmological evolution of metallicity and star formation as well as rate calculations for gravitational wave events, gamma-ray bursts, and other transients.</description>

      <title>Astronomical outreach and education in marginalised and indigenous communities: astronomy as a tool for social development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The way we look at the sky is connected to the cosmological paradigm embraced by the society we live in. On the other hand, several astronomical concepts reinforce the idea of a common humanity. Yet, scientific outreach is frequenty reaching out only to a specific part of the world population, often excluding people living in extreme social vulnerability, victims of violence and prejudice, fighting for their lives and for the right of living according to their traditions. We present two outreach projects, developed in Brazil, funded by the Office of Astronomy for Development (OAD) of the International Astronomical Union (IAU), i.e. 'Under Other Skies' and 'OruMbya', which tackle the importance of ethno-astronomy, and the collaboration with leaders and cultural agents of marginalised communities. We also describe an educational project born in the favela of Cantagalo Pav\~ao Pava\~azinho (PPG), in Rio de Janeiro, during the COVID19 pandemic, which started a collaboration with local educators and artists to offer classes of astronomy and English language to children in the favela</description>

      <title>$\texttt{bayes_spec}$: A Bayesian Spectral Line Modeling Framework for Astrophysics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ is a Bayesian spectral line modeling framework for astrophysics. Given a user-defined model and a spectral line dataset, $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ enables inference of the model parameters through different numerical techniques, such as Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) methods, implemented in the PyMC probabilistic programming library. The API for $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ is designed to support astrophysical researchers who wish to ``fit'' arbitrary, user-defined models, such as simple spectral line profile models or complicated physical models that include a full physical treatment of radiative transfer. These models are ``cloud-based'', meaning that the spectral line data are decomposed into a series of discrete clouds with parameters defined by the user's model. Importantly, $\texttt{bayes_spec}$ provides algorithms to determine the optimal number of clouds for a given model and dataset.</description>

Abstract: We report the results of a spectroscopic survey of candidate T subdwarfs identified by the Backyard Worlds: Planet 9 program. Near-infrared spectra of 31 sources with red $J-W2$ colors and large $J$-band reduced proper motions show varying signatures of subsolar metallicity, including strong collision-induced H$_2$ absorption, obscured methane and water features, and weak K I absorption. These metallicity signatures are supported by spectral model fits and 3D velocities, indicating thick disk and halo population membership for several sources. We identify three new metal-poor T subdwarfs ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.5), CWISE J062316.19+071505.6, WISEA J152443.14$-$262001.8, and CWISE J211250.11-052925.2; and 19 new "mild" subdwarfs with modest metal deficiency ([M/H] $\lesssim$ $-$0.25). We also identify three metal-rich brown dwarfs with thick disk kinematics. We provide kinematic evidence that the extreme L subdwarf 2MASS J053253.46+824646.5 and the mild T subdwarf CWISE J113010.07+313944.7 may be part of the Thamnos population, while the T subdwarf CWISE J155349.96+693355.2 may be part of the Helmi stream. We define a metallicity classification system for T dwarfs that adds mild subdwarfs (d/sdT), subdwarfs (sdT), and extreme subdwarfs (esdT) to the existing dwarf sequence. We also define a metallicity spectral index that correlates with metallicities inferred from spectral model fits and iron abundances from stellar primaries of benchmark T dwarf companions. This expansion of the T dwarf classification system supports investigations of ancient, metal-poor brown dwarfs now being uncovered in deep imaging and spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength variability of the blazar AO 0235+164</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the multiwavelength (MW) variability of the blazar AO 0235+164 based on the radio-to-$\gamma$-ray data covering a long time period from 1997 to 2023. The radio data are represented by the 1-22 GHz measurements from the RATAN-600 radio telescope, the 5 and 8 GHz data from the RT-32 telescopes, and the 37 GHz data from the RT-22 telescope. The optical measurements in the $R$-band were collected with the 1-m Zeiss-1000 and 0.5-m AS-500/2 telescopes. Additionally we used the archive data at 230~GHz from the SMA and the $\gamma$-ray data in the 0.1-100 GeV band from the Fermi-LAT point source 4FGL-DR2 catalogue. The variability properties during four epochs containing major flares and one epoch of relatively low activity were analysed. A significant correlation ($\geq\!2\sigma$) between the radio, optical, and $\gamma$-ray bands is found for all these periods with time delays from 0 to 1.7 yrs. The relation between time delay and frequency is described by a linear law with a negative slope of -10 day/GHz. The discovered properties of MW variability for the low activity period and for flaring states suggest that the mechanisms dominating the radio-$\gamma$-ray variations are not substantially different. The detected quasi-periodic oscillations of about 6 and 2 years are tentative, as the time span of the observations includes fewer than 4 full cycles for the radio and optical data and only about 3 cycles for the Fermi-LAT data. The physical parameters of the radio jet were obtained using the Hedgehog model applied to the average radio spectrum of AO 0235+164 in the range 0.1-300 GHz. The effectiveness of replacing electrons with protons in the synchrotron radio emission of relativistic jets is shown for describing the nature of blazars and the generation of high energy neutrinos.</description>

      <title>A new sample of super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) stars from the Zwicky Transient Facility survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01534v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magnetic chemically peculiar Ap stars exhibit an extreme spread of rotational velocities, the reason of which is not well understood. Ap stars with rotational periods of 50 days or longer are know as super-slowly rotating Ap (ssrAp) stars. Photometrically variable Ap stars are commonly termed alpha2 Canum Venaticorum (ACV) variables. Our study aims at enlarging the sample of known ssrAp stars using data from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey to enable more robust and significant statistical studies of these objects. Using selection criteria based on the known characteristics of ACV variables, candidate stars were gleaned from the ZTF catalogues of periodic and suspected variable stars and from ZTF raw data. ssrAp stars were identified from this list via their characteristic photometric properties, Delta a photometry, and spectral classification. The final sample consists of 70 new ssrAp stars, which mostly exhibit rotational periods between 50 and 200 days. The object with the longest period has a rotational period of 2551.7 days. We present astrophysical parameters and a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram for the complete sample of known ssrAp stars. With very few exceptions, the ssrAp stars are grouped in the middle of the main sequence with ages in excess of 150 Myr. ZTF J021309.72+582827.7 was identified as a possible binary star harbouring an Ap star and a cool component, possibly shrouded in dust. With our study, we enlarge the sample of known ssrAp stars by about 150%, paving the way for more in-depth statistical studies.</description>

      <title>Multiple Components of the Outflow in the Protostellar System HH 212: Outer Outflow Shell, Rotating Wind, Shocked Wind, and Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 7 observations of the CO (J=3-2) line emission of the protostellar system HH 212 at $\sim$24 au spatial resolution and compare them to those of the SiO (J=8-7) and SO (J=8-7) line emission reported in the literature. We find that the CO line traces four distinct regions: (1) an outer outflow shell, (2) a rotating wind region between the SiO and CO shells, (3) the shocked and wide-angle inner X-wind inside a SiO shell, and (4) the jet. The origin of the CO outer outflow shell could be associated with the entrained material of the envelope, or an extended disk wind. The rotating wind, which is shocked, is launched from a radius of 9-15 au, slightly exterior to that of the previously detected SO shell, which marks the boundary where the wide-angle X-wind is interacting with and shocking the disk wind. Additionally, the SO is found to be mixed with the CO emission within the thick and extended rotating wind region. The large scale CO shocked wind coexists with the SO emission near the upper portion of the inner shocked region converged on top of the inner SiO knots. The CO jet is traced by a chain of knots with roughly equal interval, exhibiting quasi-periodicity, as reported in other jets in the literature.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Hubble constant with scattering in host galaxies of fast radio bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring the Hubble constant (H$_0$) is one of the most important missions in astronomy. Nevertheless, recent studies exhibit differences between the employed methods. Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are coherent radio transients with large dispersion measures (DM) with a duration of milliseconds. DM$_{\rm IGM}$, DM in the intergalactic medium (IGM), could open a new avenue for probing H$_0$. However, it has been challenging to separate DM contributions from different components (i.e., the IGM and the host galaxy plasma), and this hampers the accurate measurements of DM$_{\rm IGM}$ and hence H$_0$. We adopted a method to overcome this problem by using the temporal scattering of the FRB pulses due to the propagation effect through the host galaxy plasma (scattering time). The scattering-inferred DM in a host galaxy improves the estimate of DM$_{\rm IGM}$, which in turn leads to a better constraint on H$_0$. In previous studies, a certain value or distribution has conventionally been assumed of the dispersion measure in host galaxies (DM$_{\rm h}$). We compared this method with ours by generating 100 mock FRBs, and we found that our method reduces the systematic (statistical) error of H$_0$ by 9.1% (1%) compared to the previous method. We applied our method to 30 localized FRB sources with both scattering and spectroscopic redshift measurements to constrain H$_0$. Our result is H$_0$=74$_{-7.2}^{+7.5}$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, where the central value prefers the value obtained from local measurements over the cosmic microwave background. We also measured DM$_{\rm h}$ with a median value of $103^{+68}_{-48}$ pc cm$^{-3}$. The reduction in systematic error is comparable to the Hubble tension ($\sim10$%). Combined with the fact that more localized FRBs will become available, our result indicates that our method can be used to address the Hubble tension using future FRB samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We find ourselves on the brink of an exciting era in observational astrophysics, driven by groundbreaking facilities like JWST, Euclid, Rubin, Roman, SKA, or ELT. Simultaneously, computational astrophysics has shown significant strides, yielding highly realistic galaxy formation simulations, thanks to both hardware and software enhancements. Bridging the gap between simulations and observations has become paramount for meaningful comparisons. We introduce py-ananke, a Python pipeline designed to generate synthetic resolved stellar surveys from cosmological simulations, adaptable to various instruments. Building upon its predecessor, ananke by Sanderson et al. 2020 (arXiv:1806.10564), which produced Gaia DR2 mock star surveys, the py-ananke package offers a user-friendly "plug &amp; play" experience. The pipeline employs cutting-edge phase-space density estimation and initial mass function sampling to convert particle data into synthetic stars, while interpolating pre-computed stellar isochrone tracks for photometry. Additionally, it includes modules for estimating interstellar reddening, dust-induced extinctions, and for quantifying errors through dedicated modeling approaches. py-ananke promises to serve as a vital bridge between computational astrophysics and observational astronomy, facilitating preparations and making scientific predictions for the next generation of telescopes.</description>

      <title>Probing Chemical Enrichment in Extremely Metal-Poor Galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The chemical composition of galaxies offers vital insights into their formation and evolution. A key aspect of this study is the correlation between helium abundance (He/H) and metallicity, which is instrumental in estimating the primordial helium produced during Big Bang nucleosynthesis. We investigate the chemical enrichment history of low-metallicity galaxies, with a particular focus on extremely metal-poor galaxies (EMPGs), using one-zone models. Our one-zone model, employing the Limongi &amp; Chieffi (2018) yield, aligns well with observed high He/H ratios at low metallicities and successfully reproduces Fe/O ratios similar to those found in EMPGs. In contrast, the Nomoto et al. (2013) yield does not fully match the high Fe/O ratios observed in EMPGs. Furthermore, we explored models incorporating supermassive stars (SMS) as Pop III stars and intermittent star formation, both of which produced higher He/H ratios than the standard one-zone model. A model calculation that incorporates SMS yields effectively explain young galaxies (&lt; $10^8$ years) with metallicities $(\mathrm{O/H}) \times 10^5 &lt; 20$ and $\mathrm{He/H} &gt; 0.085$. Notably, the model, where the outer envelope of the SMS's CO core is completely ejected, achieves $\mathrm{He/H} &gt; 0.12$, aligning with the properties of high-$z$ galaxies recently discovered by JWST. Additionally, these models predict high N/O, consistent with JWST observations in the early universe.</description>

Abstract: Dating the ages and weighting the stellar populations in galaxies are essential steps when studying galaxy formation through cosmic times. Evolutionary population synthesis models with different input physics are used for this purpose. Moreover, the contribution from the thermally pulsing asymptotic giant branch (TP-AGB) stellar phase, which peaks for intermediate-age 0.6-2 Gyr, has been debated for decades. Here we report the detection of strong cool-star signatures in the rest-frame near-infrared spectra of three young (~1Gyr), massive (~10^10Msun) quiescent galaxies at large look-back time, z=1-2, using JWST/NIRSpec. The coexistence of oxygen- and carbon-type absorption features, spectral edges and features from rare species, such as vanadium and possibly zirconium, reveal a strong contribution from TP-AGB stars. Population synthesis models with a significant TP-AGB contribution reproduce the observations better than those with a weak TP-AGB, which are commonly used. These findings call for revisions of published stellar population fitting results, as they point to populations with lower masses and younger ages and have further implications for cosmic dust production and chemical enrichment. New generations of improved models are needed, informed by these and future observations.</description>

      <title>The coherent magnetic field of the Milky Way halo, Local Bubble and Fan Region</title>

Abstract: Recent catalog of Faraday rotation measures (RM) of extragalactic sources together with the synchrotron polarization data from WMAP and Planck provides us with a wealth of information on magnetic fields of the Galaxy. However, the integral character of these observables together with our position inside the Galaxy makes the inference of the coherent Galactic magnetic field (GMF) complicated and ambiguous. We combine several phenomenological components of the GMF -- the spiral arms, the toroidal halo, the X-shaped field and the field of the Local Bubble -- to construct a new model of the regular GMF outside the thin disk. To have control over the relative contributions of the RM and polarization data to the fit we pay special attention to the estimation of errors in data bins. To this end we develop a systematic method which is uniformly applicable to different data sets. This method takes into account individual measurement errors, the variance in the bin as well as fluctuations in the data at angular scales larger than the bin size. This leads to decrease of the errors and, as a result, to better sensitivity of the data to the model content. We cross checked the stability of our method with the new LOFAR data. We found that the four components listed above are sufficient to fit both the RM and polarization data over the whole sky with only a small fraction masked out. Moreover, we have achieved several important improvements compared to previous approaches. Due to account of our location inside of the Local Bubble our model does not require introduction of striated fields. For the first time we showed that the Fan Region can be modeled as a Galactic-scale feature. The pitch angle of the magnetic field in our fit converged to the value around 20 degrees. Interestingly, with value is very close to the direction of the arms inferred recently from Gaia data on upper main sequence stars.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are widely observed in various astronomical contexts, yet much remains unknown about their significance across different systems and cosmic epochs. Our current knowledge of the evolution of magnetic fields is limited by scarce observations in the distant Universe, where galaxies have recently been found to be more evolved than most model predictions. To address this gap, we conducted rest-frame 131 um full-polarisation observations of dust emission in a strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxy, SPT0346-52, at z=5.6, when the Universe was only 1 Gyr old. Dust grains can become aligned with local magnetic fields, resulting in the emission of linearly polarised thermal infrared radiation. Our observations have revealed a median polarisation level of $0.9\pm0.2$ percent with a variation of $\pm0.4$ percent across the 3 kpc extention, indicating the presence of large-scale ordered magnetic fields. The polarised dust emission is patchy, offset from the total dust emission and mostly overlaps with the [C II] emission at a velocity of about -150 km/s. The bimodal distribution of field orientations, their spatial distribution, and the connection with the cold gas kinematics further emphasise the complexity of the magnetic environment in this galaxy and the potential role of mergers in shaping its magnetic fields. Such early formation of ordered galactic magnetic fields also suggests that both small-scale and large-scale dynamos could be efficient in early galaxies. Continued observations of magnetic fields in early galaxies, as well as expanding surveys to a wider galaxy population, are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the prevalence and impact of magnetic fields in the evolving Universe.</description>

Abstract: Current galaxy formation simulations often approximate star-formation, necessitating models of star-forming regions to produce observables. In the first paper of the series, we introduced TODDLERS, a time-resolved model of UV-mm emission from star-forming regions implemented in the radiative transfer code SKIRT. This work uses SKIRT-TODDLERS to produce synthetic observations, demonstrating its potential through observables related to star-formation and comparing results with existing models in SKIRT. We calculate broadband and line emission maps for 30 Milky Way-like galaxies from the Auriga simulation at z=0. Analyzing FUV and IR data, we calculate kpc-resolved IR correction factors (k_IR), quantifying the ratio of FUV luminosity absorbed by dust to reprocessed IR luminosity. We use IR maps to calculate kpc-scale MIR (8 micron / 24 micron) and FIR (70 micron / 500 micron) colors. H alpha and H beta line maps are used to study the Balmer decrement and dust correction. We also verify the fidelity of our model FIR fine structure lines as SFR indicators. We find that the Auriga integrated UV-mm SEDs show higher FUV/NUV attenuation and lower 24 micron emission when using TODDLERS instead of the existing models in SKIRT, alleviating tensions with observations. The light-weighted mean k_IR increases with aperture and inclination, while its correlation with kpc-resolved sSFR is weaker than literature values. Kpc-scale MIR-FIR colors agree excellently with local observations, with anti-correlation degree varying by galaxy morphology. The Balmer decrement effectively corrects for dust, with attenuation law varying with dust amount. H alpha emission attenuation levels are comparable to high-density regions in state-of-the-art simulations. FIR fine-structure line emission-based luminosity-SFR relations align with global observations, [CII] showing best agreement.</description>

      <title>Ammonium hydrosulfide (NH4SH) as a potentially significant sulfur sink in interstellar ices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02860v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sulfur is depleted with respect to its cosmic standard abundance in dense star-forming regions. It has been suggested that this depletion is caused by the freeze-out of sulfur on interstellar dust grains, but the observed abundances and upper limits of sulfur-bearing ices remain too low to account for all of the missing sulfur. Toward the same environments, a strong absorption feature at 6.85 $\mu$m is observed, but its long-standing assignment to the NH4+ cation remains tentative. We investigate the plausibility of NH4SH salt serving as a sulfur reservoir and a carrier of the 6.85 $\mu$m band in interstellar ices by characterizing its IR signatures and apparent band strengths in water-rich laboratory ice mixtures and using this laboratory data to constrain NH4SH abundances in observations of 4 protostars and 2 cold dense clouds. The observed 6.85 $\mu$m feature is fit well with the laboratory NH4SH:H2O ice spectra. NH4+ column densities obtained from the 6.85 $\mu$m band range from 8-23% with respect to H2O toward the sample of protostars and dense clouds. The redshift of the 6.85 $\mu$m feature correlates with higher abundances of NH4+ with respect to H2O in both the laboratory data presented here and observational data of dense clouds and protostars. The apparent band strength of the SH- feature is likely too low for the feature to be detectable in the spectrally busy 3.9 $\mu$m region, but the 5.3 $\mu$m NH4+ $\nu_{4}$ + SH- R combination mode may be an alternative means of detection. Its tentative assignment adds to mounting evidence supporting the presence of NH4+ salts in ices and is the first tentative observation of the SH- anion toward interstellar ices. If the majority ($\gtrsim$80-85%) of the NH4+ cations quantified toward the investigated sources in this work are bound to SH- anions, then NH4SH salts could account for up to 17-18% of their sulfur budgets.</description>

      <title>The MAGPI Survey: Insights into the Lyman-alpha line widths and the size of ionized bubbles at the edge of cosmic reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17684v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic properties of 22 Lyman-alpha emitters(LAEs) at z=5.5-6.6 with Lyman-alpha(Lya) luminosity log($L_{Lya}$[$ergs^{-1}$])=42.4-43.5, obtained using VLT/MUSE as part of the Middle Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral Field Spectroscopy(MAGPI) survey. Additionally, we incorporate broad-band photometric data from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam(HSC) for 17 LAEs in our sample. The HSC-y band magnitudes show that our LAEs are UV-bright, with rest-frame absolute UV magnitudes -19.7 &lt; $M_{UV}$ &lt; -23.3. We find that the Lya line width increases with luminosity, and this trend becomes more prominent at z &gt; 6 where Lya lines become significantly broadened (&gt; 260 $kms^{-1}$) at luminosities log($L_{Lya}$[$ergs^{-1}$]) &gt; 43. This broadening is consistent with previous studies, suggesting that these sources are located inside larger ionized bubbles. We observe a slightly elevated ionizing photon production efficiency estimated for LAEs at z &gt; 6, indicating that younger galaxies could be producing more ionizing photons per UV luminosity. A tentative anti-correlation between ionizing photon production efficiency and Lya rest-frame equivalent width is noticed, which could indicate a time delay between production and escape of ionizing photon primarily due to supernovae activity. Furthermore, we find a positive correlation between bubble radius and Lya line width, which again suggests that large ionized bubbles are created around these LAEs, allowing them to self-shield from the scattering effects of the intergalactic medium (IGM). We also detect two closely separated LAEs at z=6.046 (projected spatial separation is 15.92 kpc). The size of their respective bubbles suggests that they likely sit inside a common large ionized region. Such a closely-separated LAE pair increases the size of ionized bubble, potentially allowing a boosted transmission of Lya through neutral IGM. (Abridged)</description>

      <title>Joint Modeling of Quasar Variability and Accretion Disk Reprocessing using Latent Stochastic Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18423v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quasars are bright active galactic nuclei powered by the accretion of matter around supermassive black holes at the center of galaxies. Their stochastic brightness variability depends on the physical properties of the accretion disk and black hole. The upcoming Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) is expected to observe tens of millions of quasars, so there is a need for efficient techniques like machine learning that can handle the large volume of data. Quasar variability is believed to be driven by an X-ray corona, which is reprocessed by the accretion disk and emitted as UV/optical variability. We are the first to introduce an auto-differentiable simulation of the accretion disk and reprocessing. We use the simulation as a direct component of our neural network to jointly model the driving variability and reprocessing to fit simulated LSST 10-year quasar light curves. The driving variability is reconstructed using a latent stochastic differential equation, a physically motivated, generative deep learning method that can model continuous-time stochastic dynamics. By embedding these physical processes into our network, we achieve a model that is more robust and interpretable. We also use transformers to scale our model to tens of millions of parameters. We demonstrate how our model outperforms a Gaussian process regression baseline and can infer accretion disk parameters and time delays between wavebands, even for out-of-distribution driving signals. Our approach provides a powerful and scalable framework that can be adapted to solve other inverse problems in multivariate time series with irregular sampling.</description>

      <title>First Detection of Molecular Gas in the Giant Low Surface Brightness Galaxy Malin 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22230v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After over three decades of unsuccessful attempts, we report the first detection of molecular gas emission in Malin 1, the largest spiral galaxy observed to date, and one of the most iconic giant low surface brightness galaxies. Using ALMA, we detect significant $^{12}$CO(J=1-0) emission in the galaxy's central region and tentatively identify CO emission across three regions on the disc. These observations allow for a better estimate of the H$_2$ mass and molecular gas mass surface density, both of which are remarkably low given the galaxy's scale. By integrating data on its HI mass, we derive a very low molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratio. Overall, our results highlight the minimal presence of molecular gas in Malin 1, contrasting sharply with its extensive, homogeneous atomic gas reservoir. For the first time, we position Malin 1 on the Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) diagram, where it falls below the main sequence for normal spirals, consistent with previous upper limits but now with more accurate figures. These findings are crucial for constraining our understanding of star formation processes in environments characterized by extremely low molecular gas densities and for refining models of galaxy formation, thereby improving predictions concerning the formation, evolution, and distribution of these giant, elusive galaxies.</description>

      <title>Proton Acceleration in Low-beta Magnetic Reconnection with Energetic Particle Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12276v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection regions in space and astrophysics are known as active particle acceleration sites. There is ample evidence showing that energetic particles can take a substantial amount of converted energy during magnetic reconnection. However, there has been a lack of studies understanding the backreaction of energetic particles at magnetohydrodynamical scales in magnetic reconnection. To address this, we have developed a new computational method to explore the feedback by non-thermal energetic particles. This approach considers the backreaction from these energetic particles by incorporating their pressure into Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations. The pressure of the energetic particles is evaluated from their distribution evolved through Parker's transport equation, solved using stochastic differential equations (SDE), so we coin the name MHD-SDE. Applying this method to low-beta magnetic reconnection simulations, we find that reconnection is capable of accelerating a large fraction of energetic particles that contain a substantial amount of energy. When the feedback from these particles is included, their pressure suppresses the compression structures generated by magnetic reconnection, thereby mediating particle energization. Consequently, the feedback from energetic particles results in a steeper power-law energy spectrum. These findings suggest that feedback from non-thermal energetic particles plays a crucial role in magnetic reconnection and particle acceleration.</description>

      <title>Quantitative spectroscopy of multiple OB stars: I. The quadruple system HD 37061 at the centre of Messier 43</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The majority of massive stars are located in binary or multiple star systems. Compared to single stars, these objects pose additional challenges to quantitative analyses based on model atmospheres. In particular, little information is currently available on the chemical composition of such systems. The members of the quadruple star system HD 37061, which excites the H II region Messier 43 in Orion, are fully characterised. Accurate and precise abundances for all elements with lines traceable in the optical spectrum are derived for the first time. A hybrid non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) approach, using line-blanketed hydrostatic model atmospheres computed with the ATLAS12 code in combination with non-LTE line-formation calculations with DETAIL and SURFACE, was employed. A high-resolution composite spectrum was analysed for the atmospheric parameters and elemental abundances of the individual stars. Fundamental stellar parameters were derived based on stellar evolution tracks, and the interstellar reddening was characterised. We determined the fundamental parameters and chemical abundances for three stars in the HD 37061 system. The fourth and faintest star in the system shows no distinct spectral features, as a result of its fast rotation. However, this star has noticeable effects on the continuum. The derived element abundances and determined ages of the individual stars are consistent with each other, and the abundances coincide with the cosmic abundance standard. We find an excellent agreement between our spectroscopic distance and the Gaia Data Release 3 parallax distance.</description>
