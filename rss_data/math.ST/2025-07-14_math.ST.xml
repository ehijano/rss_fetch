      <title>Testen statistischer Funktionale f\"ur Zweistichprobenprobleme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08373</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of testing statistical functionals is developed for non-parametric two-sample problems. For differentiable real-valued statistical functionals, some tests for the one-sided and two-sided cases are proposed and studied. The asymptotic power function is computed along implicit alternatives and hypotheses and compared with upper bounds for the power functions of tests for limit experiments. It is shown that the proposed tests are locally asymptotically most powerful under weak assumptions. For some important test problems, the distribution-free asymptotic optimal tests are developed. Among other things, the products and sums of von Mises functionals and the Wilcoxon functional are treated. We pay special attention to the computability of the tests.</description>

      <title>Effective regions and kernels in continuous sparse regularisation, with application to sketched mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08444v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper advances the general theory of continuous sparse regularisation on measures with the Beurling-LASSO (BLASSO). This TV-regularized convex program on the space of measures allows to recover a sparse measure using a noisy observation from an appropriate measurement operator. While previous works have uncovered the central role played by this operator and its associated kernel in order to get estimation error bounds, the latter requires a technical local positive curvature (LPC) assumption to be verified on a case-by-case basis. In practice, this yields only few LPC-kernels for which this condition is proved. At the heart of our contribution lies the kernel switch, which uncouples the model kernel from the LPC assumption: it enables to leverage any known LPC-kernel as a pivot kernel to prove error bounds, provided embedding conditions are verified between the model and pivot RKHS. We increment the list of LPC-kernels, proving that the "sinc-4" kernel, used for signal recovery and mixture problems, does satisfy the LPC assumption. Furthermore, we also show that the BLASSO localisation error around the true support decreases with the noise level, leading to effective near regions. This improves on known results where this error is fixed with some parameters depending on the model kernel. We illustrate the interest of our results in the case of translation-invariant mixture model estimation, using bandlimiting smoothing and sketching techniques to reduce the computational burden of BLASSO.</description>

      <title>Mallows Model with Learned Distance Metrics: Sampling and Maximum Likelihood Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \textit{Mallows model} is a widely-used probabilistic framework for learning from ranking data, with applications ranging from recommendation systems and voting to aligning language models with human preferences~\cite{chen2024mallows, kleinberg2021algorithmic, rafailov2024direct}. Under this model, observed rankings are noisy perturbations of a central ranking $\sigma$, with likelihood decaying exponentially in distance from $\sigma$, i.e, $P (\pi) \propto \exp\big(-\beta \cdot d(\pi, \sigma)\big),$ where $\beta &gt; 0$ controls dispersion and $d$ is a distance function.
  Existing methods mainly focus on fixed distances (such as Kendall's $\tau$ distance), with no principled approach to learning the distance metric directly from data. In practice, however, rankings naturally vary by context; for instance, in some sports we regularly see long-range swaps (a low-rank team beating a high-rank one), while in others such events are rare. Motivated by this, we propose a generalization of Mallows model that learns the distance metric directly from data. Specifically, we focus on $L_\alpha$ distances: $d_\alpha(\pi,\sigma):=\sum_{i=1} |\pi(i)-\sigma(i)|^\alpha$.
  For any $\alpha\geq 1$ and $\beta&gt;0$, we develop a Fully Polynomial-Time Approximation Scheme (FPTAS) to efficiently generate samples that are $\epsilon$- close (in total variation distance) to the true distribution. Even in the special cases of $L_1$ and $L_2$, this generalizes prior results that required vanishing dispersion ($\beta\to0$). Using this sampling algorithm, we propose an efficient Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) algorithm that jointly estimates the central ranking, the dispersion parameter, and the optimal distance metric. We prove strong consistency results for our estimators (for any values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$), and we validate our approach empirically using datasets from sports rankings.</description>

      <title>Total/dual correlation/coherence, redundancy/synergy, complexity, and O-information for real and complex valued multivariate data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Firstly, assuming Gaussianity, equations for the following information theory measures are presented: total correlation/coherence (TC), dual total correlation/coherence (DTC), O-information, TSE complexity, and the redundancy-synergy index (RSI). Since these measures are functions of the covariance matrix "S" and its inverse "S^-1", the associated Wishart and inverse-Wishart distributions are of note. The DTC is shown here to be the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence for the inverse-Wishart pair "(S^-1)" and its diagonal matrix "diag(S^-1)", shedding light on its interpretation as a measure of "total partial correlation", -lndetP, with test hypothesis H0: P=I, where "P" is the standardized inverse covariance (i.e. P=(D^-1/2)(S^-1)(D^-1/2), with D=diag(S^-1)). The second aim of this paper introduces a generalization of all these measures for structured groups of variables. For instance, consider three or more groups, each consisting of three or more variables, with predominant redundancy within each group, but with synergistic interactions between groups. O-information will miss the between group synergy (since redundancy occurs more often in the system). In contrast, the structured O-information measure presented here will correctly report predominant synergy between groups. This is a relevant generalization towards structured multivariate information measures. A third aim is the presentation of a framework for quantifying the contribution of "connections" between variables, to the system's TC, DTC, O-information, and TSE complexity. A fourth aim is to present a generalization of the redundancy-synergy index for quantifying the contribution of a group of variables to the system's redundancy-synergy balance. Finally, it is shown that the expressions derived here directly apply to data from several other elliptical distributions. All program codes, data files, and executables are available.</description>

      <title>Sharp Phase Transitions in Estimation with Low-Degree Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14407v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-dimensional planted problems, such as finding a hidden dense subgraph within a random graph, often exhibit a gap between statistical and computational feasibility. While recovering the hidden structure may be statistically possible, it is conjectured to be computationally intractable in certain parameter regimes. A powerful approach to understanding this hardness involves proving lower bounds on the efficacy of low-degree polynomial algorithms. We introduce new techniques for establishing such lower bounds, leading to novel results across diverse settings: planted submatrix, planted dense subgraph, the spiked Wigner model, and the stochastic block model. Notably, our results address the estimation task -- whereas most prior work is limited to hypothesis testing -- and capture sharp phase transitions such as the "BBP" transition in the spiked Wigner model (named for Baik, Ben Arous, and P\'{e}ch\'{e}) and the Kesten-Stigum threshold in the stochastic block model. Existing work on estimation either falls short of achieving these sharp thresholds or is limited to polynomials of very low (constant or logarithmic) degree. In contrast, our results rule out estimation with polynomials of degree $n^{\delta}$ where $n$ is the dimension and $\delta &gt; 0$ is a constant, and in some cases we pin down the optimal constant $\delta$. Our work resolves open problems posed by Hopkins &amp; Steurer (2017) and Schramm &amp; Wein (2022), and provides rigorous support within the low-degree framework for conjectures by Abbe &amp; Sandon (2018) and Lelarge &amp; Miolane (2019).</description>

      <title>Asymmetric canonical correlation analysis of Riemannian and high-dimensional data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical model for the integrative analysis of Riemannian-valued functional data and high-dimensional data. We apply this model to explore the dependence structure between each subject's dynamic functional connectivity -- represented by a temporally indexed collection of positive definite covariance matrices -- and high-dimensional data representing lifestyle, demographic, and psychometric measures. Specifically, we employ a reformulation of canonical correlation analysis that enables efficient control of the complexity of the functional canonical directions using tangent space sieve approximations. Additionally, we enforce an interpretable group structure on the high-dimensional canonical directions via a sparsity-promoting penalty. The proposed method shows improved empirical performance over alternative approaches and comes with theoretical guarantees. Its application to data from the Human Connectome Project reveals a dominant mode of covariation between dynamic functional connectivity and lifestyle, demographic, and psychometric measures. This mode aligns with results from static connectivity studies but reveals a unique temporal non-stationary pattern that such studies fail to capture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10394v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A polytrope is a tropical polyhedron that is also classically convex. We study the tropical combinatorial types of polytropes associated to weighted directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). This family of polytropes arises in algebraic statistics when describing the model class of max-linear Bayesian networks. We show how the edge weights of a network directly relate to the facet structure of the corresponding polytrope. We also give a classification of polytropes from weighted DAGs at different levels of equivalence. These results give insight on the statistical problem of identifiability for a max-linear Bayesian network.</description>

      <title>Hyperdeterminantal Total Positivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03000v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given positive integer $m$, the concept of hyperdeterminantal total positivity is defined for a kernel $K\colon {\mathbb R}^{2m} \to {\mathbb R}$, thereby generalizing the classical concept of total positivity. Extending the fundamental example, $K(x,y) = \exp(xy)$, $x, y \in \mathbb{R}$, of a classical totally positive kernel, the hyperdeterminantal total positivity property of the kernel $K(x_1,\dots,x_{2m}) = \exp(x_1\cdots x_{2m})$, $x_1,\dots,x_{2m} \in \mathbb{R}$ is established. By applying Matsumoto's hyperdeterminantal Binet-Cauchy formula, we derive a generalization of Karlin's basic composition formula; then we use the generalized composition formula to construct several examples of hyperdeterminantal totally positive kernels. Further generalizations of hyperdeterminantal total positivity by means of the theory of finite reflection groups are described and some open problems are posed.</description>

      <title>Blind free deconvolution over one-parameter sparse families via eigenmatrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note considers the blind free deconvolution problems of sparse spectral measures from one-parameter families. These problems pose significant challenges since they involve nonlinear sparse recovery. The main technical tool is the eigenmatrix method for solving unstructured sparse recovery problems. The key idea is to turn the nonlinear inverse problem into a linear inverse problem by leveraging the R-transform for free addition and the S-transform for free product. The resulting linear problem is solved with the eigenmatrix method tailored to the domain of the parametric family. Numerical results are provided for both the additive and multiplicative free deconvolutions.</description>

      <title>Tropical Fr\'echet Means</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05322v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fr\'echet mean is a key measure of central tendency as a barycenter for a given set of points in a general metric space. It is computed by solving an optimization problem and is a fundamental quantity in statistics. In this paper, we study Fr\'echet means in tropical geometry -- a piecewise linear, combinatorial, and polyhedral variant of algebraic geometry that has gained prominence in applications. A key property of Fr\'echet means is that uniqueness is generally not guaranteed, which is true in tropical settings. In solving the tropical Fr\'echet mean optimization problem, we obtain a geometric characterization of the collection of all Fr\'echet means in a general tropical space as a tropically and classically convex polytope. Furthermore, we prove that a certificate of positivity for finitely many quadratic polynomials in $\mathbb{R}[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ always exists, given that their quadratic homogeneous components are sums of squares. We propose an algorithm to symbolically compute the Fr\'echet mean polytope based on our exact quadratic optimization result and study its complexity.</description>

      <title>Algorithmic contiguity from low-degree conjecture and applications in correlated random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09832v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, assuming a natural strengthening of the low-degree conjecture, we provide evidence of computational hardness for two problems: (1) the (partial) matching recovery problem in the sparse correlated Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graphs $\mathcal G(n,q;\rho)$ when the edge-density $q=n^{-1+o(1)}$ and the correlation $\rho&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{DDL23+}; (2) the detection problem between the correlated sparse stochastic block model $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda}{n};k,\epsilon;s)$ and a pair of independent stochastic block models $\mathcal S(n,\tfrac{\lambda s}{n};k,\epsilon)$ when $\epsilon^2 \lambda s&lt;1$ lies below the Kesten-Stigum (KS) threshold and $s&lt;\sqrt{\alpha}$ lies below the Otter's threshold, solving a remaining problem in \cite{CDGL24+}.
  One of the main ingredient in our proof is to derive certain forms of \emph{algorithmic contiguity} between two probability measures based on bounds on their low-degree advantage. To be more precise, consider the high-dimensional hypothesis testing problem between two probability measures $\mathbb{P}$ and $\mathbb{Q}$ based on the sample $\mathsf Y$. We show that if the low-degree advantage $\mathsf{Adv}_{\leq D} \big( \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{P}}{\mathrm{d}\mathbb{Q}} \big)=O(1)$, then (assuming the low-degree conjecture) there is no efficient algorithm $\mathcal A$ such that $\mathbb{Q}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=0)=1-o(1)$ and $\mathbb{P}(\mathcal A(\mathsf Y)=1)=\Omega(1)$. This framework provides a useful tool for performing reductions between different inference tasks.</description>
