      <title>Semiparametric Estimation of Individual Coefficients in a Dyadic Link Formation Model Lacking Observable Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dyadic network formation models have wide applicability in economic research, yet are difficult to estimate in the presence of individual specific effects and in the absence of distributional assumptions regarding the model noise component. The availability of (continuously distributed) individual or link characteristics generally facilitates estimation. Yet, while data on social networks has recently become more abundant, the characteristics of the entities involved in the link may not be measured. Adapting the procedure of \citet{KS}, I propose to use network data alone in a semiparametric estimation of the individual fixed effect coefficients, which carry the interpretation of the individual relative popularity. This entails the possibility to anticipate how a new-coming individual will connect in a pre-existing group. The estimator, needed for its fast convergence, fails to implement the monotonicity assumption regarding the model noise component, thereby potentially reversing the order if the fixed effect coefficients. This and other numerical issues can be conveniently tackled by my novel, data-driven way of normalising the fixed effects, which proves to outperform a conventional standardisation in many cases. I demonstrate that the normalised coefficients converge both at the same rate and to the same limiting distribution as if the true error distribution was known. The cost of semiparametric estimation is thus purely computational, while the potential benefits are large whenever the errors have a strongly convex or strongly concave distribution.</description>

      <title>Difference-in-Differences for Health Policy and Practice: A Review of Modern Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Difference-in-differences (DiD) is the most popular observational causal inference method in health policy, employed to evaluate the real-world impact of policies and programs. To estimate treatment effects, DiD relies on the "parallel trends assumption", that on average treatment and comparison groups would have had parallel trajectories in the absence of an intervention. Historically, DiD has been considered broadly applicable and straightforward to implement, but recent years have seen rapid advancements in DiD methods. This paper reviews and synthesizes these innovations for medical and health policy researchers. We focus on four topics: (1) assessing the parallel trends assumption in health policy contexts; (2) relaxing the parallel trends assumption when appropriate; (3) employing estimators to account for staggered treatment timing; and (4) conducting robust inference for analyses in which normal-based clustered standard errors are inappropriate. For each, we explain challenges and common pitfalls in traditional DiD and modern methods available to address these issues.</description>

      <title>Robust and Efficient Estimation of Potential Outcome Means under Random Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.01800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.01800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study efficiency improvements in randomized experiments for estimating a vector of potential outcome means using regression adjustment (RA) when there are more than two treatment levels. We show that linear RA which estimates separate slopes for each assignment level is never worse, asymptotically, than using the subsample averages. We also show that separate RA improves over pooled RA except in the obvious case where slope parameters in the linear projections are identical across the different assignment levels. We further characterize the class of nonlinear RA methods that preserve consistency of the potential outcome means despite arbitrary misspecification of the conditional mean functions. Finally, we apply these regression adjustment techniques to efficiently estimate the lower bound mean willingness to pay for an oil spill prevention program in California.</description>

      <title>Statistical Inference and A/B Testing in Fisher Markets and Paced Auctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate the study of statistical inference and A/B testing for two market equilibrium models: linear Fisher market (LFM) equilibrium and first-price pacing equilibrium (FPPE). LFM arises from fair resource allocation systems such as allocation of food to food banks and notification opportunities to different types of notifications. For LFM, we assume that the data observed is captured by the classical finite-dimensional Fisher market equilibrium, and its steady-state behavior is modeled by a continuous limit Fisher market. The second type of equilibrium we study, FPPE, arises from internet advertising where advertisers are constrained by budgets and advertising opportunities are sold via first-price auctions. For platforms that use pacing-based methods to smooth out the spending of advertisers, FPPE provides a hindsight-optimal configuration of the pacing method. We propose a statistical framework for the FPPE model, in which a continuous limit FPPE models the steady-state behavior of the auction platform, and a finite FPPE provides the data to estimate primitives of the limit FPPE. Both LFM and FPPE have an Eisenberg-Gale convex program characterization, the pillar upon which we derive our statistical theory. We start by deriving basic convergence results for the finite market to the limit market. We then derive asymptotic distributions, and construct confidence intervals. Furthermore, we establish the asymptotic local minimax optimality of estimation based on finite markets. We then show that the theory can be used for conducting statistically valid A/B testing on auction platforms. Synthetic and semi-synthetic experiments verify the validity and practicality of our theory.</description>
