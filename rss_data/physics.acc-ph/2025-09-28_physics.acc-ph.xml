      <title>From Concept to Reality: Additive Manufacturing in Particle Accelerator and Storage Ring R&amp;D at GSI and for FAIR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: State-of-the-art additive manufacturing technologies are not only finding ever-wider applications in everyday life, but also assuming an increasingly important role in scientific research. This kind of advanced manufacturing method eliminates many of the constraints of conventional processes in fabricating components with complex external shapes or intricate internal structures, thereby providing enhanced flexibility for the design and realization of a new generation of more efficient particle accelerators and storage rings. The RACERS team initiated by the Stochastic Cooling Group at GSI, Germany, is worldwide one of the first teams working on this topic. Based on the metal 3D-printing technology, two novel accelerating structures and one efficient cooling plate for a future stochastic cooling system are under development at GSI and for the FAIR project, respectively. Some successful experience as well as learnt lessons will be presented.</description>

      <title>Challenges and Optimization of Mu2e Proton Target Design with Radiative Cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mu2e experiment at Fermilab will search for the charged lepton flavour violating process of coherent neutrinoless muon-to-electron conversion in the presence of an aluminum nucleus. The muons are produced by an 8 GeV proton beam from the Fermilab Booster striking a production target to create hadrons that decay to muons. The production target design space is strongly constrained by a required one-year operating lifetime and the need for radiative cooling in a vacuum. Uncertainties in the lifetime of the existing baseline design - a monolithic, segmented tungsten (WL10) target - are large, particularly due to unknown effects of radiation damage at the very high proton fluences expected in the experiment. We have begun evaluating a new design utilizing Inconel 718. Here, we present an engineering analysis of a prototype modular design. specifically thermal management, structural stability, fatigue lifetime, and fabrication changes. The results approve a promising new target design for the Mu2e experiment.</description>

      <title>Plasma acceleration of polarized particle beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin-polarized particle beams are of interest for applications like deep-inelastic scattering, e.g. to gain further understanding of the proton's nuclear structure. With the advent of high-intensity laser facilities, laser-plasma-based accelerators offer a promising alternative to standard radiofrequency-based accelerators, as they can shorten the required acceleration length significantly. However, in the scope of spin-polarized particles, they bring unique challenges. This paper reviews the developments in the field of spin-polarized particles, focusing on the interaction of laser pulses and high-energy particle beams with plasma. The relevant scaling laws for spin-dependent effects in laser-plasma interaction, as well as acceleration schemes for polarized leptons, ions, and gamma quanta, are discussed.</description>
