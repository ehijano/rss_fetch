      <title>On the H-atom abstractions from C1-C4 alcohols, aldehydes, and ethers by NO2: ab initio and comprehensive kinetic modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As crucial additives and intermediate, alcohols, ethers, and aldehydes play a significant role in the combustion process. However, the chemistry of NOXhydrocarbon interactions and the rate rules governing these interactions remain largely unexplored in this combustion system. To address this gap, this study provides a comprehensive investigation of H-atom abstraction by NO2 from C1-C4 alcohols, aldehydes and ethers that leads to the formation of 3 HNO2 isomers (i.e., transHONO, HNO2, and cisHONO), encompassing 9 hydrocarbons and 45 reactions. Utilizing the DLPNO CCSD(T)cc pVDZ M06 2X 6 311g d,p method, the electronic structures, single point energies, C H bond dissociation energies and 1 D hindered rotor potentials of the reactants, transition states, complexes and products in each reaction are computed. Adding these H atom abstractions to the chemical kinetic model improves the model reactivity and advances the ignition, as indicated by the reduction in ignition delay time for species that initially lacked these reactions. Further sensitivity and flux analyses highlight the crucial role of H atom abstraction by NO2. The findings underscore the importance of accurately incorporating these kinetic parameters into newly developed chemical models for alcohols, aldehydes, and ethers. Additionally, the study highlights the need for future experimental efforts to investigate the effects of NO2 on the combustion systems of these compounds.</description>

      <title>OVB analysis of chemical bonding in three-membered ring systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of the four three-ring systems ethene, disilene, silirane, and disilirane by addition of methylene and silylene to the double bond in ethene, disilene, and silaethene, as well as the elimination of the methylene analogs from the three-rings, was studied with CAS(4,4) wave functions in both $C_{2v}$ and $C_s$ symmetry. To reveal charge and spin redistribution during these reactions the CAS(4,4) wave functions were analyzed using the OVB method (orthogonal valence bond). The potential energy curves, different internal coordinates, and the results of the OVB analysis show, that frequently the addition and elimination reactions follow differen minimum energy paths, because they are diabatic reactions. In these cases, there are no energy barriers corresponding to saddle points on the potential energy surfaces but there is an energy increase during one diabatic reaction, then the system jumps to the other diabatic state and the energy decreases. This happens for reactions in $C_{2v}$ symmetry, as soon as the system can change to the lower symmetry, the diabatic states combine to an adiabatic and the reaction follow the single minimum energy path.</description>

      <title>NEP-MB-pol: A unified machine-learned framework for fast and accurate prediction of water's thermodynamic and transport properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Water's unique hydrogen-bonding network and anomalous properties present significant challenges for accurately modeling its structural, thermodynamic, and transport behavior across varied conditions. Although machine-learned potentials have advanced the prediction of individual properties, a unified computational framework capable of simultaneously capturing water's complex and subtle properties with high accuracy has remained elusive. Here, we address this challenge by introducing NEP-MB-pol, a highly accurate and efficient neuroevolution potential trained on extensive MB-pol reference data with coupled-cluster-level accuracy, combined with path-integral molecular dynamics and quantum-correction techniques to incorporate nuclear quantum effects. This NEP-MB-pol framework reproduces experimentally measured structural, thermodynamic, and transport properties of water across a broad temperature range, achieving simultaneous, fast, and accurate prediction of self-diffusion coefficient, viscosity, and thermal conductivity. Our approach provides a unified and robust tool for exploring thermodynamic and transport properties of water under diverse conditions, with significant potential for broader applications across research fields.</description>

      <title>Hidden nonlinear optical susceptibilities in linear polaritonic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear spectra of molecular polaritons formed by $N$ molecules coupled to a microcavity photon mode are usually well described by classical linear optics, raising the question of where the expected nonlinear effects in these strongly coupled systems are. In this work, we derive a general expression for the polaritonic linear spectra that reveal previously overlooked finite-size quantum corrections due to vacuum-mediated molecular Raman processes. Using a $1/N$ expansion, we demonstrate that these nonlinearities are suppressed in typical low-Q cavities due to an emergent timescale separation in polariton dynamics yet manifest in high-Q single-mode cavities where the photon loss is comparable to the single-molecule light-matter coupling strength.</description>

      <title>A Sinking Approach to Explore Arbitrary Areas in Free Energy Landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To address the time-scale limitations in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, numerous enhanced sampling methods have been developed to expedite the exploration of complex free energy landscapes. A commonly employed approach accelerates the sampling of degrees of freedom associated with predefined collective variables (CVs), which typically tends to traverse the entire CV range. However, in many scenarios, the focus of interest is on specific regions within the CV space. In this paper, we introduce a novel "sinking" approach that enables enhanced sampling of arbitrary areas within the CV space. We begin by proposing a gridded convolutional approximation that productively replicates the effects of metadynamics, a powerful CV-based enhanced sampling technique. Building on this, we present the SinkMeta method, which "sinks" the interior bias potential to create a restraining potential "cliff" at the grid edges. This technique can confine the exploration of CVs in MD simulations to a predefined area. Our experimental results demonstrate that SinkMeta requires minimal sampling steps to estimate the free energy landscape for CV subspaces of various shapes and dimensions, including irregular two-dimensional regions and one-dimensional pathways between metastable states. We believe that SinkMeta will pioneer a new paradigm for sampling partial phase spaces, especially offering an efficient and flexible solution for sampling minimum free energy paths in high-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <title>Diffusive dynamics of charge regulated macro-ion solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Onsager's variational principle is generalized to address the diffusive dynamics of an electrolyte solution composed of charge-regulated macro-ions and counterions. The free energy entering the Rayleighian corresponds to the Poisson-Boltzmann theory augmented by the charge-regulation mechanism. The dynamical equations obtained by minimizing the Rayleighian include the classical Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations, the Debye-Falkenhagen equation, and their modifications in the presence of charge regulation. By analyzing the steady state, we show that the charge regulation has an important impact on the non-equilibrium macro-ion spatial distribution and their effective charge, deviating significantly from their equilibrium values. Our model, based on Onsager's variational principle offers a unified approach to the diffusive dynamics of electrolytes containing components that undergo various charge association/dissociation processes.</description>

      <title>Simulating real-time molecular electron dynamics efficiently using the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Compared to ground state electronic structure optimizations, accurate simulations of molecular real-time electron dynamics are usually much more difficult to perform. To simulate electron dynamics, the time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TDDMRG) has been shown to offer an attractive compromise between accuracy and cost. However, many simulation parameters significantly affect the quality and efficiency of a TDDMRG simulation. So far, it is unclear whether common wisdom from ground state DMRG carries over to the TDDMRG, and a guideline on how to choose these parameters is missing. Here, in order to establish such a guideline, we investigate the convergence behavior of the main TDDMRG simulation parameters, such as time integrator, the choice of orbitals, and the choice of matrix-product-state representation for complex-valued non-singlet states. In addition, we propose a method to select orbitals that are tailored to optimize the dynamics. Lastly, we showcase the TDDMRG by applying it to charge migration ionization dynamics in furfural, where we reveal a rapid conversion from an ionized state with a $\sigma$ character to one with a $\pi$ character within less than a femtosecond.</description>

      <title>Scattering of CO from Vacant-MoSe$_2$ with O Adsorbates: Is CO$_2$ Formed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations, based on density functional theory that also accounts for van der Waals interactions, we study the oxidation of gas phase CO on MoSe$_2$ with a Se vacancy and oxygen coverage of 0.125~ML. In the equilibrium configuration, one of the O atoms is adsorbed on the vacancy and the other one atop one Se atom. Recombination of the CO molecule with the second of these O atoms to form CO$_2$ is a highly exothermic reaction, with an energy gain of around 3~eV. The likeliness of the CO oxidation reaction on this surface is next examined by calculating hundreds of AIMD trajectories for incidence energies that suffice to overcome the energy barriers in the entrance channel of the CO oxidative recombination. In spite of it, no CO$_2$ formation event is obtained. In most of the calculated trajectories the incoming CO molecule is directly reflected and in some cases, mainly at low energies, the molecules remain trapped at the surface but without reacting. As important conclusion, our AIMD simulations show that the recombination of CO molecules with adsorbed O atoms is a very unlikely reaction in this system, despite its large exothermicity.</description>

      <title>Determining minimum energy conical intersections by enveloping the seam: exploring ground and excited state intersections in coupled cluster theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08207v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Minimum energy conical intersections can be used to rationalize photochemical processes. In this Letter, we examine an algorithm to locate these structures that does not require the evaluation of nonadiabatic coupling vectors, showing that it minimizes the energy on hypersurfaces that envelop the intersection seam. By constraining the states to be separated by a small non-zero energy difference, the algorithm ensures that numerical artifacts and convergence problems of coupled cluster theory at conical intersections are not encountered during the optimization. In this way, we demonstrate for various systems that minimum energy conical intersections with the ground state are well described by the coupled cluster singles and doubles model, suggesting that coupled cluster theory may in some cases provide a good description of relaxation to the ground state in nonadiabatic dynamics simulations.</description>

      <title>Understanding failures in electronic structure methods arising from the geometric phase effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08209v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that intermediate normalization of the electronic wave function, where a constant component is enforced, will lead to an asymptotic discontinuity at one point along any path that encloses a ground state conical intersection. For some electronic structure methods, this gives rise to severe global artifacts in the ground and excited state potential energy surfaces. We investigate how this affects two electronic structure methods: coupled cluster theory and M{\o}ller-Plesset perturbation theory. The analysis suggests that intermediate normalization is problematic not only in near-degenerate regions, such as in the vicinity of conical intersections. In particular, since problems will occur for any path that encloses a ground state intersection, the affected methods can unexpectedly break down in regions of internal coordinate space that are normally considered within their range of validity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.08751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coupled cluster theory in the standard formulation is unable to correctly describe conical intersections among states of the same symmetry. This limitation has restricted the practical application of an otherwise highly accurate electronic structure model, particularly in nonadiabatic dynamics. Recently, the intersection problem among the excited states was fully characterized and resolved. However, intersections with the ground state remain an open challenge, and addressing this problem is our objective here. We present a generalized coupled cluster framework that correctly accounts for the geometric phase effect and avoids bifurcations of the solutions to the ground state equations. Several applications are presented that demonstrate the correct description of ground state conical intersections. We also propose how the framework can be used for other electronic-structure methods.</description>

      <title>Chemistry Beyond Exact Solutions on a Quantum-Centric Supercomputer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05068v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A universal quantum computer can be used as a simulator capable of predicting properties of diverse quantum systems. Electronic structure problems in chemistry offer practical use cases around the hundred-qubit mark. This appears promising since current quantum processors have reached these sizes. However, mapping these use cases onto quantum computers yields deep circuits, and for pre-fault-tolerant quantum processors, the large number of measurements to estimate molecular energies leads to prohibitive runtimes. As a result, realistic chemistry is out of reach of current quantum computers in isolation. A natural question is whether classical distributed computation can relieve quantum processors from parsing all but a core, intrinsically quantum component of a chemistry workflow. Here, we incorporate quantum computations of chemistry in a quantum-centric supercomputing architecture, using up to 6400 nodes of the supercomputer Fugaku to assist a quantum computer with a Heron superconducting processor. We simulate the N$_2$ triple bond breaking in a correlation-consistent cc-pVDZ basis set, and the active-space electronic structure of [2Fe-2S] and [4Fe-4S] clusters, using 58, 45 and 77 qubits respectively, with quantum circuits of up to 10570 (3590 2-qubit) quantum gates. We obtain our results using a class of quantum circuits that approximates molecular eigenstates, and a hybrid estimator. The estimator processes quantum samples, produces upper bounds to the ground-state energy and wavefunctions supported on a polynomial number of states. This guarantees an unconditional quality metric for quantum advantage, certifiable by classical computers at polynomial cost. For current error rates, our results show that classical distributed computing coupled to quantum computers can produce good approximate solutions for practical problems beyond sizes amenable to exact diagonalization.</description>

      <title>Predicting electronic screening for fast Koopmans spectral functional calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15205v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Koopmans spectral functionals are a powerful extension of Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (DFT) that enable the prediction of spectral properties with state-of-the-art accuracy. The success of these functionals relies on capturing the effects of electronic screening through scalar, orbital-dependent parameters. These parameters have to be computed for every calculation, making Koopmans spectral functionals more expensive than their DFT counterparts. In this work, we present a machine-learning model that -- with minimal training -- can predict these screening parameters directly from orbital densities calculated at the DFT level. We show on two prototypical use cases that using the screening parameters predicted by this model, instead of those calculated from linear response, leads to orbital energies that differ by less than 20 meV on average. Since this approach dramatically reduces run-times with minimal loss of accuracy, it will enable the application of Koopmans spectral functionals to classes of problems that previously would have been prohibitively expensive, such as the prediction of temperature-dependent spectral properties. More broadly, this work demonstrates that measuring violations of piecewise linearity (i.e. curvature in total energies with respect to occupancies) can be done efficiently by combining frozen-orbital approximations and machine learning.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytical model of optothermal fluidics in a confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10837v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the semi-analytical solution of the temperature and flow fields of a fluid confined in a narrow space between two parallel plates. The temperature increase is triggered by photothermal effects of fluids and/or boundaries due to the absorption of a focused Gaussian beam irradiated perpendicular to the fluid film, and then the temperature variation induces the flow fields through a buoyancy force and/or thermo-osmotic slip. The semi-analytical solution to this optothermal fluidic system is validated by comparing with the results of numerical simulation, and is applied to typical optothermal fluidic problems. In particular, the optothermal trap of nanoparticles observed in our previous experiment [T. Tsuji, et al., Electrophoresis, 42, 2401 (2021)] is investigated in terms of thermophoretic force and flow drag that are obtained semi-analytically. The semi-analytical solution can be shared through open-source codes that are available to researchers without the background of fluid mechanics.</description>

Abstract: Rare event sampling in dynamical systems is a fundamental problem arising in the natural sciences, which poses significant computational challenges due to an exponentially large space of trajectories. For settings where the dynamical system of interest follows a Brownian motion with known drift, the question of conditioning the process to reach a given endpoint or desired rare event is definitively answered by Doob's h-transform. However, the naive estimation of this transform is infeasible, as it requires simulating sufficiently many forward trajectories to estimate rare event probabilities. In this work, we propose a variational formulation of Doob's h-transform as an optimization problem over trajectories between a given initial point and the desired ending point. To solve this optimization, we propose a simulation-free training objective with a model parameterization that imposes the desired boundary conditions by design. Our approach significantly reduces the search space over trajectories and avoids expensive trajectory simulation and inefficient importance sampling estimators which are required in existing methods. We demonstrate the ability of our method to find feasible transition paths on real-world molecular simulation and protein folding tasks.</description>
