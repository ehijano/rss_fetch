      <title>Learning to Control Unknown Strongly Monotone Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider $N$ players each with a $d$-dimensional action set. Each of the players' utility functions includes their reward function and a linear term for each dimension, with coefficients that are controlled by the manager. We assume that the game is strongly monotone, so if each player runs gradient descent, the dynamics converge to a unique Nash equilibrium (NE). The NE is typically inefficient in terms of global performance. The resulting global performance of the system can be improved by imposing $K$-dimensional linear constraints on the NE. We therefore want the manager to pick the controlled coefficients that impose the desired constraint on the NE. However, this requires knowing the players' reward functions and their action sets. Obtaining this game structure information is infeasible in a large-scale network and violates the users' privacy. To overcome this, we propose a simple algorithm that learns to shift the NE of the game to meet the linear constraints by adjusting the controlled coefficients online. Our algorithm only requires the linear constraints violation as feedback and does not need to know the reward functions or the action sets. We prove that our algorithm, which is based on two time-scale stochastic approximation, guarantees convergence with probability 1 to the set of NE that meet target linear constraints. We then provide a mean square convergence rate of $O(t^{-1/4})$ for our algorithm. This is the first such bound for two time-scale stochastic approximation where the slower time-scale is a fixed point iteration with a non-expansive mapping. We demonstrate how our scheme can be applied to optimizing a global quadratic cost at NE and load balancing in resource allocation games. We provide simulations of our algorithm for these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Identification of LFT Structured Descriptor Systems with Slow and Non-uniform Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time domain identification is studied in this paper for parameters of a continuous-time multi-input multi-output descriptor system, with these parameters affecting system matrices through a linear fractional transformation. Sampling is permitted to be slow and non-uniform, and there are no necessities to satisfy the Nyquist frequency. This model can be used to described the behaviors of a networked dynamic system, and the obtained results can be straightforwardly applied to a state-space model. An explicit formula is obtained respectively for the transient and steady-state response of the system stimulated by an arbitrary signal. Some relations have been derived between the system steady-state response and its transfer function matrix. A parametric estimation algorithm is suggested.</description>

      <title>Multi-Agent Training for Pommerman: Curriculum Learning and Population-based Self-Play Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pommerman is a multi-agent environment that has received considerable attention from researchers in recent years. This environment is an ideal benchmark for multi-agent training, providing a battleground for two teams with communication capabilities among allied agents. Pommerman presents significant challenges for model-free reinforcement learning due to delayed action effects, sparse rewards, and false positives, where opponent players can lose due to their own mistakes. This study introduces a system designed to train multi-agent systems to play Pommerman using a combination of curriculum learning and population-based self-play. We also tackle two challenging problems when deploying the multi-agent training system for competitive games: sparse reward and suitable matchmaking mechanism. Specifically, we propose an adaptive annealing factor based on agents' performance to adjust the dense exploration reward during training dynamically. Additionally, we implement a matchmaking mechanism utilizing the Elo rating system to pair agents effectively. Our experimental results demonstrate that our trained agent can outperform top learning agents without requiring communication among allied agents.</description>

      <title>Emergent Crowd Grouping via Heuristic Self-Organization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling crowds has many important applications in games and computer animation. Inspired by the emergent following effect in real-life crowd scenarios, in this work, we develop a method for implicitly grouping moving agents. We achieve this by analyzing local information around each agent and rotating its preferred velocity accordingly. Each agent could automatically form an implicit group with its neighboring agents that have similar directions. In contrast to an explicit group, there are no strict boundaries for an implicit group. If an agent's direction deviates from its group as a result of positional changes, it will autonomously exit the group or join another implicitly formed neighboring group. This implicit grouping is autonomously emergent among agents rather than deliberately controlled by the algorithm. The proposed method is compared with many crowd simulation models, and the experimental results indicate that our approach achieves the lowest congestion levels in some classic scenarios. In addition, we demonstrate that adjusting the preferred velocity of agents can actually reduce the dissimilarity between their actual velocity and the original preferred velocity. Our work is available online.</description>

      <title>Online Learning of Temporal Dependencies for Sustainable Foraging Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sustainable foraging problem is a dynamic environment testbed for exploring the forms of agent cognition in dealing with social dilemmas in a multi-agent setting. The agents need to resist the temptation of individual rewards through foraging and choose the collective long-term goal of sustainability. We investigate methods of online learning in Neuro-Evolution and Deep Recurrent Q-Networks to enable agents to attempt the problem one-shot as is often required by wicked social problems. We further explore if learning temporal dependencies with Long Short-Term Memory may be able to aid the agents in developing sustainable foraging strategies in the long term. It was found that the integration of Long Short-Term Memory assisted agents in developing sustainable strategies for a single agent, however failed to assist agents in managing the social dilemma that arises in the multi-agent scenario.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Task Offloading and Load-Balancing for Mobile Edge Computing in Dense Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of decentralized task offloading and load-balancing in a dense network with numerous devices and a set of edge servers. Solving this problem optimally is complicated due to the unknown network information and random task sizes. The shared network resources also influence the users' decisions and resource distribution. Our solution combines the mean field multi-agent multi-armed bandit (MAB) game with a load-balancing technique that adjusts the servers' rewards to achieve a target population profile despite the distributed user decision-making. Numerical results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach and the convergence to the target load distribution.</description>

      <title>Visual Reasoning and Multi-Agent Approach in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs): Solving TSP and mTSP Combinatorial Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) harness comprehensive knowledge spanning text, images, and audio to adeptly tackle complex problems, including zero-shot in-context learning scenarios. This study explores the ability of MLLMs in visually solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and Multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP) using images that portray point distributions on a two-dimensional plane. We introduce a novel approach employing multiple specialized agents within the MLLM framework, each dedicated to optimizing solutions for these combinatorial challenges. Our experimental investigation includes rigorous evaluations across zero-shot settings and introduces innovative multi-agent zero-shot in-context scenarios. The results demonstrated that both multi-agent models. Multi-Agent 1, which includes the Initializer, Critic, and Scorer agents, and Multi-Agent 2, which comprises only the Initializer and Critic agents; significantly improved solution quality for TSP and mTSP problems. Multi-Agent 1 excelled in environments requiring detailed route refinement and evaluation, providing a robust framework for sophisticated optimizations. In contrast, Multi-Agent 2, focusing on iterative refinements by the Initializer and Critic, proved effective for rapid decision-making scenarios. These experiments yield promising outcomes, showcasing the robust visual reasoning capabilities of MLLMs in addressing diverse combinatorial problems. The findings underscore the potential of MLLMs as powerful tools in computational optimization, offering insights that could inspire further advancements in this promising field.

      <title>C-MASS: Combinatorial Mobility-Aware Sensor Scheduling for Collaborative Perception with Second-Order Topology Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collaborative Perception (CP) has been a promising solution to address occlusions in the traffic environment by sharing sensor data among collaborative vehicles (CoV) via vehicle-to-everything (V2X) network. With limited wireless bandwidth, CP necessitates task-oriented and receiver-aware sensor scheduling to prioritize important and complementary sensor data. However, due to vehicular mobility, it is challenging and costly to obtain the up-to-date perception topology, i.e., whether a combination of CoVs can jointly detect an object. In this paper, we propose a combinatorial mobility-aware sensor scheduling (C-MASS) framework for CP with minimal communication overhead. Specifically, detections are replayed with sensor data from individual CoVs and pairs of CoVs to maintain an empirical perception topology up to the second order, which approximately represents the complete perception topology. A hybrid greedy algorithm is then proposed to solve a variant of the budgeted maximum coverage problem with a worst-case performance guarantee. The C-MASS scheduling algorithm adapts the greedy algorithm by incorporating the topological uncertainty and the unexplored time of CoVs to balance exploration and exploitation, addressing the mobility challenge. Extensive numerical experiments demonstrate the near-optimality of the proposed C-MASS framework in both edge-assisted and distributed CP configurations. The weighted recall improvements over object-level CP are 5.8% and 4.2%, respectively. Compared to distance-based and area-based greedy heuristics, the gaps to the offline optimal solutions are reduced by up to 75% and 71%, respectively.</description>

      <title>On the Complexity of Learning to Cooperate with Populations of Socially Rational Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificially intelligent agents deployed in the real-world will require the ability to reliably \textit{cooperate} with humans (as well as other, heterogeneous AI agents). To provide formal guarantees of successful cooperation, we must make some assumptions about how partner agents could plausibly behave. Any realistic set of assumptions must account for the fact that other agents may be just as adaptable as our agent is. In this work, we consider the problem of cooperating with a \textit{population} of agents in a finitely-repeated, two player general-sum matrix game with private utilities. Two natural assumptions in such settings are that: 1) all agents in the population are individually rational learners, and 2) when any two members of the population are paired together, with high-probability they will achieve at least the same utility as they would under some Pareto efficient equilibrium strategy. Our results first show that these assumptions alone are insufficient to ensure \textit{zero-shot} cooperation with members of the target population. We therefore consider the problem of \textit{learning} a strategy for cooperating with such a population using prior observations its members interacting with one another. We provide upper and lower bounds on the number of samples needed to learn an effective cooperation strategy. Most importantly, we show that these bounds can be much stronger than those arising from a "naive'' reduction of the problem to one of imitation learning.</description>

      <title>CAMON: Cooperative Agents for Multi-Object Navigation with LLM-based Conversations</title>

Abstract: Visual navigation tasks are critical for household service robots. As these tasks become increasingly complex, effective communication and collaboration among multiple robots become imperative to ensure successful completion. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable comprehension and planning abilities in the context of embodied agents. However, their application in household scenarios, specifically in the use of multiple agents collaborating to complete complex navigation tasks through communication, remains unexplored. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework for decentralized multi-agent navigation, leveraging LLM-enabled communication and collaboration. By designing the communication-triggered dynamic leadership organization structure, we achieve faster team consensus with fewer communication instances, leading to better navigation effectiveness and collaborative exploration efficiency. With the proposed novel communication scheme, our framework promises to be conflict-free and robust in multi-object navigation tasks, even when there is a surge in team size.</description>

      <title>Guarding a Target Area from a Heterogeneous Group of Cooperative Attackers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00762v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a multi-agent target guarding problem in which a single defender seeks to capture multiple attackers aiming to reach a high-value target area. In contrast to previous studies, the attackers herein are assumed to be heterogeneous in the sense that they have not only different speeds but also different weights representing their respective degrees of importance (e.g., the amount of allocated resources). The objective of the attacker team is to jointly minimize the weighted sum of their final levels of proximity to the target area, whereas the defender aims to maximize the same value. Using geometric arguments, we construct candidate equilibrium control policies that require the solution of a (possibly nonconvex) optimization problem. Subsequently, we validate the optimality of the candidate control policies using parametric optimization techniques. Lastly, we provide numerical examples to illustrate how cooperative behaviors emerge within the attacker team due to their heterogeneity.</description>

      <title>IBSEN: Director-Actor Agent Collaboration for Controllable and Interactive Drama Script Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models have demonstrated their capabilities in storyline creation and human-like character role-playing. Current language model agents mainly focus on reasonable behaviors from the level of individuals, and their behaviors might be hard to constraint on the level of the whole storyline. In this paper we introduce IBSEN, a director-actor coordinate agent framework that generates drama scripts and makes the plot played by agents more controllable. The director agent writes plot outlines that the user desires to see, instructs the actor agents to role-play their characters, and reschedules the plot when human players participate in the scenario to ensure the plot is progressing towards the objective. To evaluate the framework, we create a novel drama plot that involves several actor agents and check the interactions between them under the instruction of the director agent. Evaluation results show that our framework could generate complete, diverse drama scripts from only a rough outline of plot objectives, meanwhile maintaining the characteristics of characters in the drama. Our codes and prompts are available at https://github.com/OpenDFM/ibsen.</description>

      <title>Active Sensing Strategy: Multi-Modal, Multi-Robot Source Localization and Mapping in Real-World Settings with Fixed One-Way Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01308v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a state-machine model for a multi-modal, multi-robot environmental sensing algorithm tailored to dynamic real-world settings. The algorithm uniquely combines two exploration strategies for gas source localization and mapping: (1) an initial exploration phase using multi-robot coverage path planning with variable formations for early gas field indication; and (2) a subsequent active sensing phase employing multi-robot swarms for precise field estimation. The state machine governs the transition between these two phases. During exploration, a coverage path maximizes the visited area while measuring gas concentration and estimating the initial gas field at predefined sample times. In the active sensing phase, mobile robots in a swarm collaborate to select the next measurement point, ensuring coordinated and efficient sensing. System validation involves hardware-in-the-loop experiments and real-time tests with a radio source emulating a gas field. The approach is benchmarked against state-of-the-art single-mode active sensing and gas source localization techniques. Evaluation highlights the multi-modal switching approach's ability to expedite convergence, navigate obstacles in dynamic environments, and significantly enhance gas source location accuracy. The findings show a 43% reduction in turnaround time, a 50% increase in estimation accuracy, and improved robustness of multi-robot environmental sensing in cluttered scenarios without collisions, surpassing the performance of conventional active sensing strategies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.20041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Autonomous agents driven by Large Language Models (LLMs) offer enormous potential for automation. Early proof of this technology can be found in various demonstrations of agents solving complex tasks, interacting with external systems to augment their knowledge, and triggering actions. In particular, workflows involving multiple agents solving complex tasks in a collaborative fashion exemplify their capacity to operate in less strict and less well-defined environments. Thus, a multi-agent approach has great potential for serving as a backbone in many industrial applications, ranging from complex knowledge retrieval systems to next generation robotic process automation. Given the reasoning abilities within the current generation of LLMs, complex processes require a multi-step approach that includes a plan of well-defined and modular tasks. Depending on the level of complexity, these tasks can be executed either by a single agent or a group of agents. In this work, we focus on designing a flexible agent engineering framework with careful attention to planning and execution, capable of handling complex use case applications across various domains. The proposed framework provides reliability in industrial applications and presents techniques to ensure a scalable, flexible, and collaborative workflow for multiple autonomous agents working together towards solving tasks.</description>

      <title>Escaping Arrow's Theorem: The Advantage-Standard Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2108.01134v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is an extensive literature in social choice theory studying the consequences of weakening the assumptions of Arrow's Impossibility Theorem. Much of this literature suggests that there is no escape from Arrow-style impossibility theorems, while remaining in an ordinal preference setting, unless one drastically violates the Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA). In this paper, we present a more positive outlook. We propose a model of comparing candidates in elections, which we call the Advantage-Standard (AS) model. The requirement that a collective choice rule (CCR) be representable by the AS model captures a key insight of IIA but is weaker than IIA; yet it is stronger than what is known in the literature as weak IIA (two profiles alike on $x,y$ cannot have opposite strict social preferences on $x$ and $y$). In addition to motivating violations of IIA, the AS model makes intelligible violations of another Arrovian assumption: the negative transitivity of the strict social preference relation $P$. While previous literature shows that only weakening IIA to weak IIA or only weakening negative transitivity of $P$ to acyclicity still leads to impossibility theorems, we show that jointly weakening IIA to AS representability and weakening negative transitivity of $P$ leads to no such impossibility theorems. Indeed, we show that several appealing CCRs are AS representable, including even transitive CCRs.</description>

      <title>An Axiomatic Characterization of Split Cycle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.12503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.12503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A number of rules for resolving majority cycles in elections have been proposed in the literature. Recently, Holliday and Pacuit (Journal of Theoretical Politics 33 (2021) 475-524) axiomatically characterized the class of rules refined by one such cycle-resolving rule, dubbed Split Cycle: in each majority cycle, discard the majority preferences with the smallest majority margin. They showed that any rule satisfying five standard axioms plus a weakening of Arrow's Independence of Irrelevant Alternatives (IIA), called Coherent IIA, is refined by Split Cycle. In this paper, we go further and show that Split Cycle is the only rule satisfying the axioms of Holliday and Pacuit together with two additional axioms, which characterize the class of rules that refine Split Cycle: Coherent Defeat and Positive Involvement in Defeat. Coherent Defeat states that any majority preference not occurring in a cycle is retained, while Positive Involvement in Defeat is closely related to the well-known axiom of Positive Involvement (as in J. Perez, Social Choice and Welfare 18 (2001) 601-616). We characterize Split Cycle not only as a collective choice rule but also as a social choice correspondence, over both profiles of linear ballots and profiles of ballots allowing ties.</description>

      <title>Scalable Multi-Robot Motion Planning Using Guidance-Informed Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.10176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.10176v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a multi-robot planning framework that leverages guidance about the problem to efficiently search the planning space. This guidance captures when coordination between robots is necessary, allowing us to decompose the intractably large multi-robot search space while limiting risk of inter-robot conflicts by composing relevant robot groups together while planning. Our framework additionally supports planning with kinodynamic constraints through our conflict resolution structure. This structure also improves the scalability of our approach by eliminating unnecessary work during the construction of motion solutions. We also provide an application of this framework to multiple mobile robot motion planning in congested environments using topological guidance. Our previous work has explored using topological guidance, which utilizes information about the robots' environment, in these multi-robot settings where a high degree of coordination is required of the full robot group. In real-world scenarios, this high level of coordination is not always necessary and results in excessive computational overhead. Here, we leverage our novel framework to achieve a significant improvement in scalability and show that our method efficiently finds paths for robot teams up to an order of magnitude larger than existing state-of-the-art methods in congested settings with narrow passages in the environment.</description>

      <title>A Grassroots Architecture to Supplant Global Digital Platforms by a Global Digital Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13468v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an architectural alternative to global digital platforms termed grassroots, designed to serve the social, economic, civic, and political needs of local digital communities, as well as their federation. Grassroots platforms may offer local communities an alternative to global digital platforms while operating solely on the smartphones of their members, forsaking any global resources other than the network itself. Such communities may form digital economies without initial capital or external credit, exercise sovereign democratic governance, and federate, ultimately resulting in the grassroots formation of a global digital democracy.</description>
