      <title>Lattice QCD Determination of the Collins-Soper Kernel in the Continuum and Physical Mass Limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Collins-Soper (CS) kernel governs the rapidity evolution of transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) parton distributions, a cornerstone for QCD factorization and linking nucleon structure data across scales. Its nonperturbative behavior at large transverse separations ($b_{\perp}$) remains weakly constrained due to phenomenological model dependencies. We present a first-principles determination of the CS kernel at the continuum limit and physical pion mass from lattice QCD in the large-momentum effective theory framework. Using (2+1)-flavor configurations (lattice spacings $a =(0.052-0.105$) fm, and pion mass $m_{\pi} \approx (136, 230, 300, 320)$ MeV), we simulating the nonlocal equal-time correlation function and extract the quasi-TMD wave functions. Taking into account systematic improvements including hypercubic smearing, nonperturbative renormalization, and a $b_{\perp}$-unexpanded matching kernel, we obtain the CS kernel at the continuum, chiral, and infinite-momentum limits. Our results are determined up to $b_{\perp} \sim 1$ fm, with controllable uncertainties, and agree with perturbative QCD at small $b_{\perp}$ and global TMD phenomenological extractions. We conduct a global analysis integrated with phenomenological fits and demonstrate the impact of our results on such fits. This work yields the most precise nonperturbative constraint on the CS kernel's long-distance behavior from Lattice QCD, which not only bridges Lattice QCD, perturbation theory, and nucleon structure experiments for TMD studies, but also boosts the utility of our constraint for future global TMD analyses.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Mass Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years tantalizing signs for a novel phase have been reported that is chirally symmetric but nevertheless exhibits massive bound states. The necessary condition for such a phase, referred to as Symmetric Mass Generation (SMG), is the cancellation of all (continuous and discrete) 't~Hooft anomalies. In 3+1 dimensions this occurs in systems containing a multiple of 16 massless Weyl fermions. SMG was originally discovered in lower dimensional condensed matter systems. We present results investigating four dimensional field theories with gauge group SU(3). Our findings suggest that SU(3) with $N_f=8$ fundamental fermions exhibits an SMG phase not only on the lattice but also in the infinite cutoff continuum limit. If confirmed, SMG could provide a new UV completion of the standard model and give rise to new scenarios for beyond standard model physics.</description>

      <title>Speed of sound exceeding the conformal bound in dense QCD-like theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the phase structure and the equation of state (EoS) for dense two-color QCD at low temperatures using the lattice Monte Carlo simulations. A rich phase structure below the pseudo-critical temperature $T_c$ as a function of quark chemical potential has been revealed. In a high-density regime, we can see a superfluid phase, where the diquark condensate takes a non-zero expectation value. We have newly found that the speed of sound exceeds the conformal bound, which is the value of the relativistic free theory. This talk is based on Refs.~\cite{Iida:2022hyy, Iida:2024irv, Itou:2025vcy}.</description>

      <title>Pion photoproduction of nucleon excited states with Hamiltonian effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past few years, Hamiltonian effective field theory has been successfully applied to studies of nucleon and hyperon excited states. By discretizing the Hamiltonian in a finite volume, one can obtain the energy spectrum and compare it with the results calculated from lattice QCD. Through the analysis of experimental data, Hamiltonian effective field theory provides a framework that connects the finite-volume spectra from lattice QCD to infinite-volume scattering observables. The model independence of the approach is well preserved under the combined constraints from lattice QCD and experimental data. Building on these developments, recent works have attempted to extend HEFT to electromagnetic processes. Meanwhile, lattice QCD has also gradually advanced into the study of electromagnetic interactions. The combination of these analyses will undoubtedly deepen our understanding of light resonances.</description>

      <title>Collapse of Axion Domain Wall Induced by Helical Primordial Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stable domain wall (DW) must decay to avoid overclose the Universe. A commonly used solution is to slightly break the PQ symmetry by introducing a bias term in the potential. In this work, we propose an alternative, symmetry-preserving mechanism: coupling the axion field to a helical primordial magnetic field (PMF) via the Chern-Simons term. Using three-dimensional lattice simulations, we evolve the DW network and demonstrate that it can successfully drive DW decay. Our quantitative results further show that the correlation length of the PMF plays a crucial role in determining the decay rate of the DW network and the resulting axion and gravitational wave radiation.</description>

      <title>Perturbative determination of $\mathcal{O}(am)$ improvement on the QCD running coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00463v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the perturbative results of the discretization errors proportional to the quark mass ($\mathcal{O}(a m)$) on the QCD running coupling within lattice perturbation theory. Our analysis involves calculating the 2-loop renormalization factor $Z_g$ using improved lattice actions for the $SU(N_c)$ gauge group and $N_f$ multiplets of fermions with a finite quark mass. We employ the background field method to compute $Z_g$, by calculating quantum corrections on both the background and quantum gluon propagator, respecting the $\mathcal{O}(a)$ improvement. This allows us to evaluate the perturbative $\mathcal{O}(a m)$ lattice errors which affect the determination of the running coupling. Eliminating these $\mathcal{O}(a m)$ effects is crucial for the nonperturbative studies of precision determinations of the strong coupling constant using lattice field theory.</description>

      <title>Finite-length flux tube in the dual Ginzburg-Landau theory on the dual lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The dual Ginzburg-Landau (DGL) theory is one of the nonperturbative effective field theories of quantum chromodynamics (QCD). The DGL theory describes the QCD vacuum as a dual superconductor and possesses electric flux-tube solutions via the dual Meissner effect, which applies to the quark confinement mechanism. We demonstrate a powerful numerical method for solving the field equations in the DGL theory with U(1) dual gauge symmetry. An essential aspect of our method is to formulate the DGL theory on the dual lattice, which enables us to investigate any system composed of finite-length flux tubes in a systematic manner. Taking full advantage of the dual lattice formulation, we investigate the finite-length flux-tube solution corresponding to the quark-antiquark system in detail, which exposes the significant terminal effects absent in the infinitely long flux-tube solution. We also study the flux-tube interaction in the two-flux-tube and multiflux-tube systems, providing new insights into the nonperturbative properties of QCD.</description>

      <title>Precision determination of nucleon iso-vector scalar and tensor charges at the physical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02326v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a high precision calculation of the isospin vector charge $g_{S,T}$ of the nucleon using recently proposed ``blending" method which provides a high-precision stochastic estimate of the all-to-all fermion propagator. By combining the current-involved interpolation operator, which can efficiently cancel the major excited state contaminations, we can extract high-precision $g_S$ and $g_T$ directly at the physical pion mass. Using 15 $N_f=2+1$ lattice ensembles which cover 5 lattice spacing, 5 combinations with the same quark masses and lattice spacing but multiple volumes, including three at the physical pion mass, we report so far most precise lattice QCD prediction $g_T^{\rm QCD} = 1.0256[78]_{\rm tot}(58)_{\rm stat} (17)_{a} (44)_{\rm FV} (01)_\chi (22)_{\rm ex} (05)_{\rm re}$ and $g_S^{\rm QCD} = 1.107[46]_{\rm tot}(32)_{\rm stat} ( 04)_{a} (29)_{\rm FV} (01)_\chi (13)_{\rm ex} (08)_{\rm re}$ at $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ 2~GeV, with the systematic uncertainties from continuum, infinite volume, chiral extrapolations, excited state contamination and also renormalization.</description>

      <title>Decoding spin-parity quantum numbers and decay widths of double $J/\psi$ exotic states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive helicity amplitudes for the fully charmed tetraquark states decays into vector meson pair under two types of models, where the one is from quark model and the other one is from diquark model. The decay angular distributions have been given by the cascade decays $T_{4c}\to J/\psi(D_{(s)}^*)+J/\psi(\bar{D}_{(s)}^*)$ along with $J/\psi\to \mu^++\mu^-$ or $D_{(s)}^*\to D_{(s)}+\pi$, showing that spin-0 and spin-2 states can be distinguished. We also find that the spin-0 state decay to $J/\psi$-pair exhibits a higher degree of quantum entanglement than that in spin-2 state decays. These findings will assist in experimentally differentiating various spin-parity states, determining decay widths and unveiling undiscovered hadronic states within existing structures, thereby shedding light on the internal properties of double $J/\psi$ exotic states.</description>

      <title>Susceptibilities of rotating quark matter in Fourier-Bessel basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00494v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze various two-point correlation functions of fermionic bilinears in a rotating finite-size cylinder at finite temperatures, with a focus on susceptibility functions. Due to the noninvariance of radial translation, the susceptibility functions are constructed using the Dirac propagator in the Fourier-Bessel basis instead of the plane-wave basis. As a specific model to demonstrate the susceptibility functions in an interacting theory, we employ the two-flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. We show that the incompatibility between the mean-field analysis and the Fourier-Bessel basis is evaded under the local density approximation, and derive the resummation formulas of susceptibilities with the help of a Ward-Takahashi identity. The resulting formulation reveals the rotational effects on meson, baryon number, and topological susceptibilities, as well as the moment of inertia. Our results may serve a useful benchmark for future lattice QCD simulations in rotating frames.</description>

      <title>Numerical Verification of Perturbative Schwinger-Dyson Resummation on Lattice Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08501v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an approximation to the Schwinger-Dyson (SD) equations of the collective Coulomb field of the large $N$ Homogeneous Electron Fluid. The large $N$ approximation transforms the infinite SD hierarchy into a set of closed, equations for 1 and 2-pt correlators. In this paper, the dynamics of a toy model -- a small, square Euclidean lattice with periodic boundary conditions -- are considered. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo numerical method evaluated the 1 and 2-pt correlation functions on a $2 \times 2$ and $3 \times 3$ lattice. The derived equations are checked with the correlator values, and an agreement at $N \sim 100$ to order $10^{-3}$ was found. The agreement can be further strengthened by increasing runs in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.</description>
