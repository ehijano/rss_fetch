      <title>Non-negative crystalline and Poisson measures in the Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study properties of temperate non-negative purely atomic measures in the Euclidean space such that the distributional Fourier transform of these measures are pure point ones. A connection between these measures and almost periodicity is shown, several forms of the uniqueness theorem are proved. We also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for a measure with positive integer masses on the real line to correspond the zero set of an absolutely convergent Dirichlet series with bounded spectrum.</description>

      <title>Locally solid convergence structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While there is a well developed theory of locally solid topologies, many important convergences in vector lattice theory are not topological. Yet they share many properties with locally solid topologies. Building upon the theory of convergence structures, we develop a theory of locally solid convergences, which generalize locally solid topologies but also includes many important non-topological convergences on a vector lattice. We consider some natural modifications of such structures: unbounded, bounded, and Choquet. We also study some specific convergences in vector lattices from the perspective of locally solid convergence structures.</description>

      <title>Universal properties of spaces of generalized functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By means of several examples, we motivate that universal properties are the simplest way to solve a given mathematical problem, explaining in this way why they appear everywhere in mathematics. In particular, we present the co-universal property of Schwartz distributions, as the simplest way to have derivatives of continuous functions, Colombeau algebra as the simplest quotient algebra where representatives of zero are infinitesimal, and generalized smooth functions as the universal way to associate set-theoretical maps of non-Archimedean numbers defined by nets of smooth functions (e.g. regularizations of distributions) and having arbitrary derivatives. Each one of these properties yields a characterization up to isomorphisms of the corresponding space. The paper requires only the notions of category, functor, natural transformation and Schwartz's distributions, and introduces the notion of universal solution using a simple and non-abstract language.</description>

      <title>Fractional maximal operators on weighted variable Lebesgue spaces over the spaces of homogeneous type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $(X,d,\mu)$ is a space of homogeneous type, we establish a new class of fractional-type variable weights $A_{p(\cdot), q(\cdot)}(X)$. Then, we get the new weighted strong-type and weak-type characterizations for fractional maximal operators $M_\eta$ on weighted variable Lebesgue spaces over $(X,d,\mu)$. This study generalizes the results by Cruz-Uribe-Fiorenza-Neugebauer (2012), Bernardis-Dalmasso-Pradolini (2014), Cruz-Uribe-Shukla (2018), and Cruz-Uribe-Cummings (2022).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.15671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we answer positively to two conjectures proposed by Nieraeth (2023) about the maximal operator on rescaled Banach function spaces. We also obtain a new criterion saying when the maximal operator bounded on a Banach function space $X$ is also bounded on the associate space $X'$.</description>

      <title>Local convergence rates for Wasserstein gradient flows and McKean-Vlasov equations with multiple stationary solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-linear versions of log-Sobolev inequalities, that link a free energy to its dissipation along the corresponding Wasserstein gradient flow (i.e. corresponds to Polyak-Lojasiewicz inequalities in this context), are known to provide global exponential long-time convergence to the free energy minimizers, and have been shown to hold in various contexts. However they cannot hold when the free energy admits critical points which are not global minimizers, which is for instance the case of the granular media equation in a double-well potential with quadratic attractive interaction at low temperature. This work addresses such cases, extending the general arguments when a log-Sobolev inequality only holds locally and, as an example, establishing such local inequalities for the granular media equation with quadratic interaction either in the one-dimensional symmetric double-well case or in higher dimension in the low temperature regime. The method provides quantitative convergence rates for initial conditions in a Wasserstein ball around the stationary solutions. The same analysis is carried out for the kinetic counterpart of the gradient flow, i.e. the corresponding Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. The local exponential convergence to stationary solutions for the mean-field equations, both elliptic and kinetic, is shown to induce for the corresponding particle systems a fast (i.e. uniform in the number or particles) decay of the particle system free energy toward the level of the non-linear limit.</description>

      <title>Coorbit theory of warped time-frequency systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.01342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.01342v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Warped time-frequency systems have recently been introduced as a class of structured continuous frames for functions on the real line. Herein, we generalize this framework to the setting of functions of arbitrary dimensionality. After showing that the basic properties of warped time-frequency representations carry over to higher dimensions, we determine conditions on the warping function which guarantee that the associated Gramian is well-localized, so that associated families of coorbit spaces can be constructed. We then show that discrete Banach frame decompositions for these coorbit spaces can be obtained by sampling the continuous warped time-frequency systems. In particular, this implies that sparsity of a given function $f$ in the discrete warped time-frequency dictionary is equivalent to membership of $f$ in the coorbit space. We put special emphasis on the case of radial warping functions, for which the relevant assumptions simplify considerably.</description>

      <title>The harmonic oscillator on the Moyal-Groenewold plane: an approach via Lie groups and twisted Weyl tuples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06143v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the functional calculus of the harmonic oscillator on each Moyal-Groenewold plane, the noncommutative phase space which is a fundamental object in quantum mechanics. Specifically, we show that the harmonic oscillator admits a bounded $\mathrm{H}^\infty(\Sigma_\omega)$ functional calculus for any angle $0 &lt; \omega &lt; \frac{\pi}{2}$ and even a bounded H\"ormander functional calculus on the associated noncommutative $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces, where $\Sigma_\omega=\{ z \in \mathbb{C}^*: |\arg z| &lt;\omega \}$. To achieve these results, we develop a connection with the theory of 2-step nilpotent Lie groups by introducing a notion of twisted Weyl tuple and connecting it to some semigroups of operators previously investigated by Robinson via group representations. Along the way, we demonstrate that $\mathrm{L}^p$-square-max decompositions lead to new insights between noncommutative ergodic theory and $R$-boundedness, and we prove a twisted transference principle, which is of independent interest. Our approach accommodate the presence of a constant magnetic field and they are indeed new even in the framework of magnetic Weyl calculus on classical $\mathrm{L}^p$-spaces. Our results contribute to the understanding of functional calculi on noncommutative spaces and have implications for the maximal regularity of the most basic evolution equations associated to the harmonic oscillator.</description>

      <title>The generalized polar decomposition, the weak complementarity and the parallel sum for adjointable operators on Hilbert $C^*$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper deals mainly with some aspects of the adjointable operators on Hilbert $C^*$-modules. A new tool called the generalized polar decomposition for each adjointable operator is introduced and clarified. As an application, the general theory of the weakly complementable operators is set up in the framework of Hilbert $C^*$-modules. It is proved that there exists an operator equation which has a unique solution, whereas this unique solution fails to be the reduced solution. Some investigations are also carried out in the Hilbert space case. It is proved that there exist a closed subspace $M$ of certain Hilbert space $K$ and an operator $T\in \mathbb{B}(K)$ such that $T$ is $(M,M)$-weakly complementable, whereas $T$ fails to be $(M,M)$-complementable. The solvability of the equation $$A:B=X^*AX+(I-X)^*B(I-X) \quad (X\in\mathbb{B}(H))$$ is also dealt with in the Hilbert space case, where $A,B\in \mathbb{B}(H)$ are two general positive operators, and $A:B$ denotes their parallel sum. Among other things, it is shown that there exist certain positive operators $A$ and $B$ on the Hilbert space $\ell^2(\mathbb{N})\oplus \ell^2(\mathbb{N})$ such that the above equation has no solution.</description>

      <title>The alternating simultaneous Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke algorithm for finding the best approximation pair for two disjoint intersections of convex sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.09600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.09600v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given two nonempty and disjoint intersections of closed and convex subsets, we look for a best approximation pair relative to them, i.e., a pair of points, one in each intersection, attaining the minimum distance between the disjoint intersections. We propose an iterative process based on projections onto the subsets which generate the intersections. The process is inspired by the Halpern-Lions-Wittmann-Bauschke algorithm and the classical alternating process of Cheney and Goldstein, and its advantage is that there is no need to project onto the intersections themselves, a task which can be rather demanding. We prove that under certain conditions the two interlaced subsequences converge to a best approximation pair. These conditions hold, in particular, when the space is Euclidean and the subsets which generate the intersections are compact and strictly convex. Our result extends the one of Aharoni, Censor and Jiang ["Finding a best approximation pair of points for two polyhedra", Computational Optimization and Applications 71 (2018), 509--523] who considered the case of finite-dimensional polyhedra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove an extrapolation of compactness theorem for operators on Banach function spaces satisfying certain convexity and concavity conditions. In particular, we show that the boundedness of an operator $T$ in the weighted Lebesgue scale and the compactness of $T$ in the unweighted Lebesgue scale yields compactness of $T$ on a very general class of Banach function spaces. As our main new tool, we prove various characterizations of the boundedness of the Hardy-Littlewood maximal operator on such spaces and their associate spaces, using a novel sparse self-improvement technique. We apply our main results to prove compactness of the commutators of singular integral operators and pointwise multiplication by functions of vanishing mean oscillation on, for example, weighted variable Lebesgue spaces.</description>

We also explain the relationship of this approach to related recent and less recent developments such as Eldan's stochastic localisation and the F\"ollmer process, the Bou\'e--Dupuis variational formula and the Barashkov--Gubinelli approach, the transportation of measure perspective, and the classical analogues of these ideas for Hamilton--Jacobi equations which arise in mean-field limits.</description>
