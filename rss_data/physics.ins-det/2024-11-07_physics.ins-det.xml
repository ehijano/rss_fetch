      <title>An Integrated Framework for Uncertainty Quantification in High Temperature Gas Cooled Reactors using the HCP Time-dependent Multiphysics code and Dakota toolkit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High Temperature Reactor Code Package provides sophisticated modeling and simulation capabilities for high temperature gas cooled reactors like the HTR-200 Modul. However, HCP currently lacks integrated methods for uncertainty quantification and sensitivity analysis. This work aims to couple HCP with the DAKOTA toolkit to enable UQ workflows for quantifying how different uncertainties impact HTGR system performance. DAKOTA offers state of the art sampling and analysis methods that will be linked to the HCP time-dependent multiphysics environment. Key input parameters related to manufacturing variability, boundary and initial conditions, and material properties will be defined as uncertain in this study. Both steady state and time-dependent multiphysics simulations will be analyzed to understand the relative importance of uncertainties across different physics phenomena. Output metrics of interest can include anything measured by the HCP code. Results show the HTR-200 Modul design's robustness to input uncertainties related to inlet gas temperature, U-235 enrichment, graphite density, inlet mass flow rate, and reactor power. A pressurized loss of forced cooling transient was simulated against uncertainty in the inlet gas temperature. Results show the maximum fuel temperature is within design limits with a relatively big safety margin even when considering uncertainty in the boundary conditions of the reactor. Future work will expand the analysis to more HCP physics modules and nuclear data uncertainties. By leveraging UQ and sensitivity analysis with the linked HCP/DAKOTA environment, this work will provide valuable new insights into the expected performance variability of HTR systems during normal and off-normal conditions. The framework developed here will aid uncertainty management activities by gas-cooled reactor developers, researchers, and regulators.</description>

      <title>The Systematics and Operational Studies (SOS) Apparatus as a testbed for nEDM@SNS experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nEDM experiment at the SNS (nEDM@SNS) is the first measurement of the neutron EDM to directly measure the precession frequency of the neutron spin due to magnetic and electric fields. Previous measurements have inferred the precession frequency by measuring the residual polarization of neutrons after a long period of free precession. This difference provides independent information on potential unknown systematic uncertainties compared to previous and on-going measurements. It is precisely because nEDM@SNS is using a number of novel techniques, that it is essential to perform detailed studies of these techniques in order to optimize the statistical sensitivity and minimize the systematic uncertainty. The Systematic and Operational Studies Apparatus (SOSA) was one of the main efforts of nEDM@SNS collaboration, concentrated on development of a cryogenic test-bed for learning precise manipulation of spins and studing systematic effects of the proposed new technique. The test bed does not need an electric field but designed to have full NMR capability to the same level as nEDM@SNS.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Enabled Measurements of Astrophysical (p,n) Reactions with the SECAR Recoil Separator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthesis of heavy elements in supernovae is affected by low-energy (n,p) and (p,n) reactions on unstable nuclei, yet experimental data on such reaction rates are scarce. The SECAR (SEparator for CApture Reactions) recoil separator at FRIB (Facility for Rare Isotope Beams) was originally designed to measure astrophysical reactions that change the mass of a nucleus significantly. We used a novel approach that integrates machine learning with ion-optical simulations to find an ion-optical solution for the separator that enables the measurement of (p,n) reactions, despite the reaction leaving the mass of the nucleus nearly unchanged. A new measurement of the $^{58}$Fe(p,n)$^{58}$Co reaction in inverse kinematics with a 3.66$\pm$0.12 MeV/nucleon $^{58}$Fe beam (corresponding to 3.69$\pm$0.12 MeV proton energy in normal kinematics) yielded a cross-section of 20.3$\pm$6.3 mb and served as a benchmark for the new technique demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving the required performance criteria. This novel approach marks a significant advancement in experimental nuclear astrophysics, as it paves the way for studying astrophysically important (p,n) reactions on unstable nuclei produced at FRIB.</description>

      <title>Functional Verification for Endcap Concentrator ASICs in the High-Granularity Calorimeter Upgrade of CMS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The High-Granularity Calorimeter (HGCAL) of CMS will undergo a major upgrade during Long-Shutdown 3. The Endcap Concentrator (ECON) ASICs represent key elements in the readout chain, processing trigger (ECON-T) and data (ECON-D) streams from the HGCROC to the lpGBT. The ECONs will operate in a radiation environment with a High-Energy Hadron (HEH) flux of $3\cdot10^{6} cm^{-2}s^{-1}$.
  This contribution describes the Universal Verification Methodology (UVM)-based functional verification of the ECON ASICs focusing on the re-use of existing components to manage the complexity of the verification environment.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Energy Resolution and Particle Identification via Chromatic Calorimetry: A Concept Validation Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03685v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In particle physics, homogeneous calorimeters are used to measure the energy of particles as they interact with the detector material. Although not as precise as trackers or muon detectors, these calorimeters provide valuable insights into the properties of particles by analyzing their energy deposition patterns. Recent advances in material science, notably in nanomaterial scintillators with tunable emission bandwidths, have led to the proposal of the chromatic calorimetry concept. This proposed concept aims to track electromagnetic or hadronic shower progression within a module, enhancing particle identification and energy resolution by layering scintillators with different emission wavelengths. The idea is to use the emission spectra of the inorganic scintillators to reconstruct the shower progression. Our study validates this proposed concept using inorganic scintillators strategically stacked by decreasing emission wavelength. Using electrons and pions with up to 100 GeV, we achieved analytical discrimination and longitudinal shower measurement. This proof of concept underscores chromatic calorimetry's potential for broader applications.</description>

      <title>Performances of a radial TPC for the detection of neutrinoless double beta decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To search for $\beta\beta0\nu$ decay with unprecedented sensitivity, the R2D2 collaboration is developing a radial time projection chamber with a fiducial mass of half a ton of 136Xe at high pressure. The various approaches implemented to eliminate the radioactive background are presented in terms of detector design, topological recognition of interactions, and event energy reconstruction. The developed tools allow for the disentangling of the sought-after signal from the background, and the projected sensitivity after ten years of data taking yields a half-life limit exceeding $10^{27}$ years, along with a constraint on the effective neutrino mass $m_{\beta\beta}$, sufficient to exclude the inverted mass hierarchy region.</description>

      <title>X-ray Single-Pixel Imaging with MPGD-based detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray imaging is an invaluable tool for noninvasive analysis in many fields ranging from basic science to medicine and security. The development of low-dose large area imaging solutions still represents an important challenge for various applications. One solution to the imaging of large areas lies in the development of novel computational imaging systems that can overcome the limitations imposed by hardware, relying instead on numerical processing power. The single-pixel detector, depending on the application, may offer a competitive edge over conventional cameras (being a cheaper alternative to the multi-pixelated solutions). In addition, the single-pixel detector can be used to achieve improved detection efficiency, faster timing response, and good spatial resolution with low radiation dose. Moreover, this technique enables detectors to image through diffuse mediums, increasing the image quality at significant depths, solving the depth penetration issues of other imaging methods. In this work, we explore the application of single-pixel imaging techniques to produce two-dimensional images with high temporal resolution (only if the process is reproducible and the conditions are static), using only a single detector (bucket detector). The setup, based on the application of Hadamard patterns, showed promising results, proving the ability of the system to acquire images using thin PLA based masks (up to 5 mm thickness). Both simulation, using GEANT 4, and experimental setup, based on a time projection chamber (TPC), used in this work to demonstrate this technique will be reported here along with the first results.</description>

      <title>Characterization of newly developed large area SiC sensors for the NUMEN experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: First prototypes of large area, p-n junction, silicon carbide (SiC) detectors have been produced as part of an ongoing programme to develop a new particle identification wall for the focal plane detector of the MAGNEX magnetic spectrometer, in preparation for future NUMEN experimental campaigns. First characterizations of sensors from two wafers obtained with epitaxial silicon carbide growth and with different doping concentration are presented. Current (I-V) and capacitance (C-V) characteristics are investigated in order to determine the full depletion voltage and the doping profile. Radioactive {\alpha}-sources are used to measure the energy resolution and estimate the depletion depth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03478v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Verification is a critical aspect of designing front-end (FE) readout ASICs for High-Energy Physics (HEP) experiments. These ASICs share several similar functional features, resulting in similar verification objectives, which can be addressed using comparable verification strategies. This contribution presents a set of re-usable verification components for addressing common verification tasks, such as clock generation, reset handling, configuration, as well as hit and fault injections. The components were developed as part of the CHIPS initiative and they have been successfully used in the verification of multiple HEP ASICs.</description>

      <title>Beyond the EPICS: comprehensive Python IOC development with QueueIOC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Architectural deficiencies in EPICS lead to inefficiency in the development and application of EPICS input/output controllers (IOCs). An unintrusive solution is replacing EPICS IOCs with more maintainable and flexible Python IOCs, only reusing the Channel Access (CA) protocol of EPICS. After a digression about GUI development inspired by EPICS operator interfaces (OPIs), the structural similarity between standalone GUI backends, the Mamba backend, EPICS IOCs and other server programs is analysed. By combining the caproto library and event loops like those in these server programs, the QueueIOC framework for Python IOCs is created, which has the potential to systematically replace most EPICS IOCs currently used. Examples are first given for workalikes of StreamDevice and asyn; examples for seq-like applications include monochromators, motor anti-bumping and motor multiplexing. Also shown is software to use with the ~/iocBoot convention which addresses some issues with a similar solution based on procServ, along with a workalike of procServControl. A QueueIOC-based framework for detector integration, which overcomes areaDetector's limitations in performance and architecture, is presented in an accompanying paper.</description>

      <title>Method to Reduce Noise for Measurement of $^7$Be and $^8$B Solar Neutrinos on Gallium-71</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10157v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gallium solar neutrino experiments have historically used radiochemical counting to determine the event rate. A detector which directly measures the ejected electron and de-excitation gamma could reduce background counting rates by way of a double-pulse technique. We find this reduction could be as large as 10 orders of magnitude in a 100 ton detector. In this process, the detector measures the excited nuclear final state of the germanium after an electron neutrino interacts with gallium nucleus through the charged-current interaction. This results in a loss of approximately 90\% of the total neutrino signal, but higher energy processes are less suppressed. The neutrinos resulting from this higher energy selection are predominantly from the {}$^8$B and {}$^7$Be solar neutrino fluxes.</description>

      <title>Search for reactor-produced millicharged particles with Skipper-CCDs at the CONNIE and Atucha-II experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Millicharged particles, proposed by various extensions of the standard model, can be created in pairs by high-energy photons within nuclear reactors and can interact electromagnetically with electrons in matter. Recently, the existence of a plasmon peak in the interaction cross-section with silicon in the eV range was highlighted as a promising approach to enhance low-energy sensitivities. The CONNIE and Atucha-II reactor neutrino experiments utilize Skipper-CCD sensors, which enable the detection of interactions in the eV range. We present world-leading limits on the charge of millicharged particles within a mass range spanning six orders of magnitude, derived through a comprehensive analysis and the combination of data from both experiments.</description>

      <title>On the application of components manufactured with stereolithographic 3D printing in high vacuum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08326v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the ultrahigh-vacuum (UHV) compatibility of Formlabs `Clear Resin' via vat photopolymerization (VPP). We report on a method for using VPP additive manufacturing, specifically Formlabs' widely available stereolithographic (SLA) printing using their `Clear Resin' material, to rapidly and cheaply prototype components for use in high-vacuum (HV) environments. We present pump down curves and residual gas analysis to demonstrate the primary vacuum contaminant from freshly printed SLA plastics is water with no evidence of polymers outgassing from the material and thus the vacuum performance can be controlled with simple treatments which do not involve surface sealing. An unbaked vacuum system containing SLA printed components achieved 1.9e-8 mbar base pressure whilst retaining structural integrity and manufacturing accuracy. Outgassing rates in the HV test chamber and preliminary results in a UHV chamber indicate that our method can be extended to achieve ultrahigh-vacuum compatibility. We further report on the effect of atmospheric exposure to components and present evidence to suggest that water re-ad/absorption occurs exclusively on the surface, by showing that the bulk mass changes of the material is irreversible on the timescale investigated (&lt; 2 weeks).</description>
