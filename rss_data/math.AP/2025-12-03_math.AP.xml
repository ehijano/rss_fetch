      <title>Splash-squeeze singularities and analytic breakdown in ideal incompressible MHD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct splash-squeeze singularities for the free boundary ideal incompressible plasma-vacuum system, in which two arcs of the plasma boundary come together to form a smooth, glancing self-intersection. As the interface self-intersects, Sobolev norms remain bounded, although analyticity is necessarily lost. This contrasts classical splash singularities, in which solutions remain analytic up to the time of self-intersection.
  The narrowing gap bounded by these arcs is not occupied by plasma, as squeezing the plasma itself would cause blow-up in Sobolev norms. Instead, the gap represents the region outside the plasma, a vacuum carrying a nontrivial magnetic field. The plasma on either side pinches the field as the gap closes, and, in response, the field flattens to infinite order at the intersection point (and nowhere else), thereby forming an analytic singularity. This gives the first example of analytic breakdown without Sobolev blow-up in a locally well-posed free-boundary incompressible fluid system, and can be viewed as the first rigorous construction of a squeeze-type singularity, in which we study and quantify the precise behavior of an active, incompressible vector field as it is completely pinched off by a free-boundary in finite time.
  The proof combines a magnetically-aligned Lagrangian formulation of ideal MHD together with weighted elliptic estimates in the vacuum that remain uniform as the width of the gap tends to zero. Our framework may provide a starting point for the analysis of squeeze-type singularities in other incompressible fluid models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02229v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to establish a critical point theorem, which is an infinite-dimensional generalization of the classical generalized Mountain Pass Theorem of P. H. Rabinowitz \cite[Theorem 5.3]{Ra}. As application, we obtain the existence of at least one solution to a semilinear elliptic systems with indefinite weights in $\mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behavior of solutions to a singular chemotaxis system in multi-dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02583</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02583v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the optimal large-time behavior of the global solution to a singular chemotaxis system in the whole space $\mathbb{R}^d$ with $d=2,3$. Assuming that the initial data is sufficiently close to an equilibrium state, we first prove the $k$-th order spatial derivative of the global solution converges to its corresponding equilibrium at the optimal rate $(1+t)^{-(\frac{d}{4}+\frac{k}{2})}$, which improve upon the result in [37]. Then, for well-chosen initial data, we also establish lower bounds on the convergence rates, which match those of the heat equation. Our proof relies on a Cole-Hopf type transformation, delicate spectral analysis, the Fourier splitting technique, and energy methods.</description>

      <title>Martingales, laminates and minimal Korn inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Korn's inequalities show that the $L^2$-norm of $\nabla u$ can be controlled by the $L^2$-norm of $\mathrm{Sym}(\nabla u)$, which only has $d(d+1)/2$ components. In [J. Math. Pures Appl. 148 (2021), pp. 199-220] Chipot posed the question of \textit{how many scalar measurements are needed to have a Korn-type control on $\nabla u$} when $u$ is in $H_0^1(\Omega)$ and $H^1(\Omega)$, introducing the minimal numbers $N(d,\Omega)$ and $N'(d,\Omega)$ respectively. He proved general bounds and calculated several low-dimensional values of $N,N'$.
  We reframe Chipot's problem in the language of rank-one convexity and quasiconvexity and obtain a purely algebraic characterisation of when such inequalities hold, which yields the sharp bounds \begin{align*}
  N(d,\Omega)&amp;=2d(1-o(1))\\ N'(d,\Omega)&amp;=2d-1. \end{align*} As a consequence, we recover and streamline several of Chipot's results, we obtain a dimension-optimal Korn inequality and several sharp estimates for the best constant for various Korn-type inequalities. Generalisations to the rectangular case and to general $L^p$ estimates are also considered.\par The central new ingredient of our approach is a systematic connection between laminates and martingales which produces explicit families of laminates realising these bounds. This method is of independent interest in the calculus of variations: for instance, we use it to obtain a new quick and quantitative proof of Ornstein's non-inequality, valid for all first order homogeneous operators in $\mathbb{R}^{2\times 2}$ and for a large class of operators in general dimensions (including Korn's $\frac{\nabla u+\nabla u^t}2$ and $\frac{\nabla u+\nabla u^t}2-\mathrm{div}(u)\frac{\mathrm{Id}}d$).</description>

      <title>Swarming by curvature control in arbitrary dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an interacting particle system proposed in the literature to model fish behavior. In this model, the agents move at constant speed and control the curvature of their trajectory (i.e. the time-derivative of their velocity) so as to align their velocity with that of their neighbors, up to some noise. We provide a novel $n$-dimensional formulation of this model for any $n \geq 3$ and derive its mean-field kinetic formulation using bundle geometry concepts. The target of the paper is the derivation of a fluid model in the hydrodynamic limit. We show that this fluid model is the "self-organized hydrodynamic" (SOH) model already found in earlier work pertaining to the Vicsek model. The derivation is based on the introduction of appropriate "generalized collision invariants" (GCI). The action of the $n$-dimensional orthogonal group is used to reduce the expression of the GCI to a set of two functions satisfying a system of equations which is solved by means of a variational formulation. This leads to explicit formulas for the coefficients of the SOH model in terms of those of the original interacting particle system.</description>

      <title>On the growth properties of interior transmission eigenfunctions near corners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the localization and vanishing of $L^2$ interior transmission eigenfunctions at corners. Past numerical computations suggest that these eigenfunctions localize at non-convex corners. This phenomenon has, however, not been proven theoretically. We show that localization does indeed occur for some eigenfunctions at a non-convex corner.
  We also investigate the vanishing of interior transmission eigenfunctions at a convex corner. We prove that these eigenfunctions vanish at convex corners with reduced smoothness assumptions compared to earlier results.</description>

      <title>The Obukhov--Corrsin spectrum of passive scalar turbulence through anomalous regularization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Obukhov--Corrsin spectrum predicts the distribution of Fourier mass for a passive scalar field advected by a "turbulent" velocity field with spatial regularity $C^\alpha_x$ for $\alpha \in (0,1)$ and subject to a time-stationary forcing. We prove the Obukhov--Corrsin spectrum holds after summing over geometric annuli in Fourier space -- up to logarithmic corrections -- as a consequence of a sharp anomalous regularization result. We then prove this anomalous regularization for a broad class of Kraichnan-type models. The proof of anomalous regularization relies on a Fourier space $\ell^p$ energy equality and a weighted lattice Poincar\'e inequality.</description>

      <title>Ground state solutions of $p$-Laplacian equations with nonnegative potentials on Lattice graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the $p$-Laplacian equation
  $$
  -\Delta_p u + V(x)|u|^{p-2}u = f(x,u)
  $$
  on the lattice graph $\mathbb{Z}^N$ with nonnegative potentials. By employing the Nehari manifold method, we establish the existence of ground state solutions under suitable growth conditions on the nonlinearity $f(x,u)$, provided that the potential $V(x)$ is either periodic or bounded. Moreover, we prove that if $f$ is odd in $u$, then the above equation admits infinitely many geometrically distinct solutions. Finally, we extend these results from $\mathbb{Z}^N$ to the more general setting of Cayley graphs.</description>

      <title>A New Proof of the Abstract Random Tensor Estimate by Deng, Nahmod, and Yue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a new proof of the abstract random tensor estimate, which was established by Deng, Nahmod, and Yue (2022) using the moment method. The key new tool is the direct use of the non-commutative Khintchine inequality with the probabilistic decoupling of the product of Gaussians. We use Hermite and generalized Laguerre-type polynomials allow us to account for pairings in the real and complex-valued Gaussians, respectively, and remove the square-free (tetrahedral) requirement.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization in high-contrast media with random spherical inclusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study spectral properties of partial differential operators modelling composite materials with highly contrasting constituents, comprised of soft spherical inclusions with random radii dispersed in a stiff matrix. Such operators have recently attracted significant interest from the research community, including in the context of stochastic homogenization. In particular, it has been proved that the spectrum of these operators may feature a band-gap structure in the regime where heterogeneities take place on a sufficiently small scale. However, the nature of the limiting (as the small scale tends to zero) spectrum in the above setting is non-classical and not completely understood. In this paper we prove for the first time that Anderson localization occurs near band edges, thus shedding light on the limiting spectral behaviour. Our results rely on recent nontrivial advancements in quantitative unique continuation for PDEs, in combination with assumptions on the model that are standard in the Anderson localization literature, and which we plan to relax in future works.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a multiphase surface $\mathcal{C}_0$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ consisting of a finite number of surfaces passing through the origin , where all 1-dimensional junctions are regular triple junctions in which three planes meet at the same angle and each surface scales down homothetically to a limit curve of finite length. We prove the existence of self-similar expanding solutions of the mean curvature flow on the multiphase surface initially given by $\mathcal{C}_0$. For this initial condition, there are multiple solutions that are combinations of the regular triple junctions and regular quadruple points, where four regular triple junctions meet at an angle of approximately $109.5^{\circ}$.</description>

      <title>Bright and dark breathers on an elliptic wave in the defocusing mKdV equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Breathers on an elliptic wave background consist of nonlinear superpositions of a soliton and a periodic wave, both traveling with different wave speeds and interacting periodically in the space-time. For the defocusing modified Korteweg-de Vries (mKdV) equation, the construction of general breathers has been an open problem since the elliptic wave is related to the elliptic degeneration of the hyperelliptic solutions of genus two. We have found the new representation of eigenfunctions of the Lax operator associated with the elliptic wave, which enables us to solve this open problem and to construct two families of breathers with bright (elevation) and dark (depression) profiles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.03114v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study is devoted to the interpretation and wellposedness of the stochastic NLS model \begin{equation*} (\imath \partial_t-\Delta)u=|u|^2+\dot{B}, \quad u_0=0,\quad \quad t\in \mathbb{R}, \ x\in \mathbb{T}, \end{equation*} where $\dot{B}$ stands for a space-time fractional noise with index $H=(H_0,H_1)$ in a subset of $(0,1)^{2}$. We first establish that in the situation where $0&lt;2H_0+H_1\leq 2$, the equation cannot be interpreted in a (classical) functional sense.\\ \indent Our investigations then focus on the rough regime corresponding to the condition $\frac74&lt;2H_0+H_1\leq 2$. In this specific case, we exhibit an \textit{explicit} renormalization procedure allowing to restore the (local) convergence of the approximated solutions. We follow a pathwise-type approach emphasizing the distinction between the stochastic objects at the core of the dynamics and the general deterministic machinery.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18500v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study linear backward parabolic SPDEs in bounded domains and present new a priori estimates for their weak solutions. Inspired by the seminal work of Y. Hu, J. Ma and J. Yong from 2002 on strong solutions, we establish $L^p$-estimates requiring minimal assumptions on the regularity of the coefficients, the terminal data, and the external force. Our approach relies on direct, constructive, and quantitative arguments, adapted from known methods in the theory of SPDEs to this setting. In particular, we develop a new It\^{o}'s formula for the $L^p$-norm of the backward solution, tailored to this setting and extending the classical result in the $L^2$-framework. This formula is then used to improve further the regularity of the first component of the solution up to $L^\infty$. We also present two applications: a local existence result for a semilinear equation without imposing any growth condition on the nonlinear term, and a novel local controllability result for semilinear backward SPDEs that partially resolves an open problem in the field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06956v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study degenerate quasilinear elliptic equations on Riemannian manifolds and obtain several Liouville theorems. Notably, we provide rigorous proof asserting the nonexistence of positive solutions to the subcritical Lane-Emden-Fowler equations over complete Riemannian manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature. These findings serve as a significant generalization of Gidas and Spruck's pivotal work (Comm. Pure Appl. Math. 34, 525-598, 1981) which focused on the semilinear case, as well as Serrin and Zou's contributions (Acta Math. 189, 79-142, 2002) within the context of Euclidean geometries.</description>

      <title>Exponential stability for an infinite memory wave equation with frictional damping and logarithmic nonlinear terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12726v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article is concerned with the energy decay of an infinite memory wave equation with a logarithmic nonlinear term and a frictional damping term. The problem is formulated in a bounded domain in $\mathbb R^d$ ($d\ge3$) with a smooth boundary, on which we prescribe a mixed boundary condition of the Dirichlet and the acoustic types. We establish an exponential decay result for the energy with a general material density $\rho(x)$ under certain assumptions on the involved coefficients. The proof is based on a contradiction argument, the multiplier method and some microlocal analysis techniques. In addition, if $\rho(x)$ takes a special form, our result even holds without the damping effect, that is, the infinite memory effect alone is strong enough to guarantee the exponential stability of the system.</description>

      <title>Feedback stabilization for a spatial-dependent Sterile Insect Technique model with Allee Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.03898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.03898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work focuses on feedback control strategies for applying the sterile insect technique (SIT) to eliminate pest populations. The presentation is centered on the case of mosquito populations, but most of the results can be extended to other species by adapting the model and selecting appropriate parameter values to describe the reproduction and movement dynamics of the species under consideration. In our study, we address the spatial distribution of the population in a two dimensional bounded domain by extending the temporal SIT model analyzed in [2], thereby obtaining a reaction-diffusion SIT model. After the analysis of the existence and the uniqueness of the solution of this problem, we construct a feedback law that globally asymptotically stabilizes the extinction equilibrium thus yielding a robust strategy to keep the pest population at very low levels in the long term.</description>

      <title>Energy decay of nonlocal viscoelastic equations with nonlinear damping and polynomial nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07350v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the energy decay of a viscoelastic variable coefficient wave equation with nonlocality in time as well as nonlinear damping and polynomial nonlinear terms. Using the Lyapunov method, we establish a polynomial energy decay for the solution under relatively weak assumptions regarding the kernel of the nonlocal term. More specifically, we improve the decay rate of the energy by additionally imposing a certain convexity assumption on the kernel. Several examples are provided to confirm such improvements to faster polynomial or even exponential decays.</description>

      <title>Existence of solutions for time-dependent Signorini-type problems in linearised viscoelasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02619v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we establish the existence of solutions for a model describing the evolution of a linearly viscoelastic body which is constrained to remain confined in a prescribed half-space. The confinement condition under consideration is of Signorini type, and is given over the boundary of the linearly viscoelastic body under consideration. We show that one such variational problem admits solutions and we coin a novel concept of solution which, differently from the available literature, is valid even in the case where the viscoelastic body starts its motion in contact with the obstacle. Additionally, under additional assumptions on the constituting material, we show that when the applied body force is lifted the deformed linearly viscoelastic body returns to its rest position at an exponential rate of decay.</description>

      <title>Inelastic Boltzmann equation under shear heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13960v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the spatially homogeneous inelastic Boltzmann equation for the angular cutoff pseudo-Maxwell molecules with an additional term of linear deformation. We establish the existence of non-Maxwellian self-similar profiles under the assumption of small deformation in the nearly elastic regime, and also obtain weak convergence to these self-similar profiles for global-in-time solutions with initial data that have finite mass and finite $p$-th order moment for any $2&lt;p\leq 4$. Our results confirm the competition between shear heating and inelastic cooling that governs the large time behavior of temperature. Specifically, temperature increases to infinity if shear heating dominates, decreases to zero if inelastic cooling prevails, and converges to a positive constant if the two effects are balanced. In the balanced scenario, the corresponding self-similar profile aligns with the steady solution.</description>

      <title>Existence results for a biofilm free-boundary problem with dominant detachment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00495v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work addresses the existence and uniqueness of a Wanner-Gujer free-boundary problem that models biofilms under conditions of prevailing detachment. This result significantly extends previous findings in both tumor growth modeling and the biofilm modeling field. Besides establishing local existence and uniqueness, we also prove the continuous dependence of the solution on initial and boundary data. Furthermore, global existence is deduced using a combination of invariance regions and energy estimates. The proof for local existence is obtained by utilizing fixed point arguments combined with semigroup theory.</description>

      <title>Stability of parabolic equations in non-cylindrical domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.05783v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the stability of a class of parabolic equations in non-cylindrical domains. We investigate the $L^\infty$-stability of systems for both nondegenerate and degenerate cases. Unlike in cylindrical domains, solutions to such problems may not exhibit exponential decay. An interesting phenomenon observed is that degeneracy has a positive impact on $L^\infty$-norm estimates for solutions to the system.</description>

      <title>Sobolev inequalities for canceling operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07874v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sobolev type inequalities involving homogeneous elliptic canceling differential operators and rearrangement-invariant norms on the Euclidean space are considered. They are characterized via considerably simpler one-dimensional Hardy type inequalities. As a consequence, they are shown to hold exactly for the same norms as their counterparts depending on the standard gradient operator of the same order. The results offered provide a unified framework for the theory of Sobolev embeddings for the elliptic canceling operators. They build upon and incorporate earlier fundamental contributions dealing with the endpoint case of $L^1$-norms. They also include previously available results for the symmetric gradient, a prominent instance of an elliptic canceling operator. In particular, the optimal rearrangement-invariant target norm associated with any given domain norm in a Sobolev inequality for any elliptic canceling operator is exhibited. Its explicit form is detected for specific families of rearrangement-invariant spaces, such as the Orlicz spaces and the Lorentz-Zygmund spaces. Especially relevant instances of inequalities for domain spaces neighboring $L^1$ are singled out.</description>

      <title>Error analysis of an acceleration corrected diffusion approximation of Langevin dynamics with background flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of approximating the Langevin dynamics of inertial particles being transported by a background flow. In particular, we study an acceleration corrected advection-diffusion approximation to the Langevin dynamics, a popular approximation in the study of turbulent transport. We prove error estimates in the averaging regime in which the dimensionless relaxation timescale $\varepsilon$ is the small parameter. We show that for any finite time interval, the approximation error is of order $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon)$ in the strong sense and $\mathcal{O}(\varepsilon^2)$ in the weak sense, whose optimality is checked against computational experiment. Furthermore, we present numerical evidence suggesting that this approximation also captures the long-time behavior of the Langevin dynamics.</description>
