      <title>A quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for arbitrary high-spin Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a universal parameter-free quantum Monte Carlo algorithm for simulating arbitrary high-spin (spin greater than $1/2$) Hamiltonians. This approach extends a previously developed method by the authors for spin-$1/2$ Hamiltonians [Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013281 (2024)]. To demonstrate its applicability and versatility, we apply our method to the spin-$1$ and spin-$3/2$ quantum Heisenberg models on the square lattice. Additionally, we detail how the approach naturally extends to general Hamiltonians involving mixtures of particle species, including bosons and fermions. We have made our program code freely accessible on GitHub.</description>

      <title>Tunable Octdong and Spindle-Torus Fermi Surfaces in Kramers Nodal Line Metals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has recently been proposed that all achiral non-centrosymmetric crystals host so-called Kramers nodal lines, which are doubly degenerate band crossings connecting time-reversal invariant momenta in the Brillouin zone that arise due to spin-orbit coupling. When Kramers nodal lines intersect the Fermi level, they form exotic three-dimensional Fermi surfaces which is certain configurations can be fully described by two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions. These Fermi surfaces are predicted to realize a quantized optical conductivity with multiple quantized levels a large light- and field-induced anomalous Hall effect. However, until now, no Kramers nodal line metal with such unconventional Fermi surfaces has been experimentally observed. Here, we extend the search for Kramers nodal line metals beyond the previously considered case in which the Fermi surfaces enclose a single time-reversal invariant momentum. Using angle-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy measurements and ab-initio calculations, we present evidence that the 3R polytypes of TaS$_2$ and NbS$_2$ are Kramers nodal line metals with open Octdong and Spindle-torus Fermi surfaces, respectively. We show that by reducing the band filling, a transition between these two configurations can be observed. Moreover, our data suggests a naturally occurring size quantization effect of inclusions of 3R-TaS$_2$ in commercially available 2H-TaS$_2$ crystals, which could enable the observation of quantized optical conductivity. Finally, since the open Fermi-surfaces encircle two time-reversal invariant momenta each, we predict a phase transition from a Kramers nodal line metal to a conventional metal by strain or uniaxial pressure. Our work establishes the 3R phase of metallic transition metal dichalcogenides as a tunable platform to explore new phenomena expected from exotic Fermi surfaces in Kramers nodal line metals.</description>

      <title>Interplay of entanglement structures and stabilizer entropy in spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between nonstabilizerness and entanglement is crucial for uncovering the fundamental origins of quantum complexity. Recent studies have proposed entanglement spectral quantities, such as antiflatness of the entanglement spectrum and entanglement capacity, as effective complexity measures, establishing direct connections to stabilizer R\'enyi entropies. In this work, we systematically investigate quantum complexity across a diverse range of spin models, analyzing how entanglement structure and nonstabilizerness serve as distinctive signatures of quantum phases. By studying entanglement spectra and stabilizer entropy measures, we demonstrate that these quantities consistently differentiate between distinct phases of matter. Specifically, we provide a detailed analysis of spin chains including the XXZ model, the transverse-field XY model, its extension with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, as well as the Cluster Ising and Cluster XY models. Our findings reveal that entanglement spectral properties and magic-based measures serve as intertwined, robust indicators of quantum phase transitions, highlighting their significance in characterizing quantum complexity in many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Interaction quench of dipolar bosons in a one-dimensional optical lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A Tonks-Girardeau (TG) gas is a highly correlated quantum state of strongly interacting bosons confined to one dimension, where repulsive interactions make the particles behave like impenetrable fermions. By suddenly tuning these interactions to the attractive regime, it is possible to realize a super-Tonks-Girardeau (sTG) gas -- a highly excited, metastable state of strongly attractive bosons with unique stability properties. Inspired by the sTG quench scenario, we investigate a similar setup but with the inclusion of long-range dipolar interactions, which modify the system away from the TG Mott insulating limit. We simulate an interaction quench on dipolar bosons initially prepared in various states and fillings, using real-space densities, orbital occupations, Glauber correlation functions, and autocorrelation functions to probe post-quench stability. Our results reveal that stability is maintained only at very weak dipolar interaction strengths when starting from a unit-filled TG Mott state. In contrast, all cluster states -- whether unit-filled or doubly-filled -- eventually collapse under attractive interactions. This collapse is not always visible in the density profile but becomes apparent in the autocorrelation function, indicating complex many-body restructuring of the quantum state. Our findings underscore the potential of dipolar interactions to drive novel quantum dynamics and highlight the delicate balance required to stabilize excited states in long-range interacting systems.</description>
