      <title>Surface Tension of a Topological Phase</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metastable phases, in general, are unstable to nucleating droplets of the order defining the global free energy minima. However, whether such a droplet grows or shrinks relies on a competition between the surface tension and bulk energy density. We study the role of coupling a topological fermionic field to a scalar field undergoing such nucleation processes. We find that existence of non-trivial fermionic boundary modes on the nucleating droplets leads to substantial quantum corrections to the surface tension thereby modifying the size of the critical nucleus beyond which unrestricted droplet growth happens. To illustrate the phenomena we devise a minimal model of fermions in a Chern insulating system coupled to a classical Ising field in two spatial dimensions. Using a combination of analytic and numerical methods we conclusively show that topological phases can lead to characteristic quantum surface tension. Apart from material systems, our work has implications on the interplay of physics of statistical classical fields and quantum topological order.</description>

      <title>Statistical prethermalization in randomly kicked many-body classical rotor system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the phenomena of prethermalization in a many-body classical system of rotors under aperiodic drives characterised by waiting time distribution (WTD), where the waiting time is defined as the time between two consecutive kicks. We consider here two types of aperiodic drives: random and quasi-periodic. We observe a short-lived pseudo-thermal regime with algebraic suppression of heating for the random drive where WTD has an infinite tail, as observed for Poisson and binomial kick sequences. On the other hand, quasi-periodic drive characterised by a WTD with a sharp cut-off, observed for Thue-Morse sequence of kick, leads to prethermal region where heating is exponentially suppressed. The kinetic energy growth is analyzed using an average surprise associated with WTD quantifying the randomness of drive. In all of the aperiodic drives we obtain the chaotic heating regime for late time, however, the diffusion constant gets renormalized by the average surprise of WTD in comparison to the periodic case.</description>

      <title>Generalized Path Integral Energy and Heat Capacity Estimators of Quantum Oscillators and Crystals using Harmonic Mapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaginary-time path integral (PI) is a rigorous tool to treat nuclear quantum effects in static properties. However, with its high computational demand, it is crucial to devise precise estimators. We introduce generalized PI estimators for the energy and heat capacity that utilize coordinate mapping. While it can reduce to the standard thermodynamic and centroid virial (CVir) estimators, the formulation can also take advantage of harmonic character of quantum oscillators and crystals to construct a coordinate mapping. This yields harmonically mapped averaging (HMA) estimators, with mappings that decouple (HMAc) or couple (HMAq) the centroid and internal modes. The HMAq is constructed with normal mode coordinates (HMAq-NM) with quadratic scaling of cost or harmonic oscillator staging (HMAq-SG) coordinates with linear scaling. The estimator performance is examined for a 1D anharmonic oscillator and a 3D Lennard-Jones crystal using path integral molecular dynamics (PIMD) simulation. The HMA estimators consistently provide more precise estimates compared to CVir, with the best performance obtained by HMAq-NM, followed by HMAq-SG, and then HMAc. We also examine the effect of anharmonicity (for AO), intrinsic quantumness, and Trotter number. The HMA formulation introduced assumes the availability of forces and Hessian matrix; however, an equally efficient finite difference alternative is possible when these derivatives are inaccessible. The remarkable improvement in precision offered by HMAq estimators provides a framework for efficient PI simulation of more challenging systems, such as those based on \textit{ab initio} calculations.</description>

      <title>Exact Solutions for Small Systems: Urns Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyzed urn models by solving the discrete-time master equation using an expansion in moments. This approach is a viable alternative to conventional methods, such as system-size expansion, allowing for the determination of analytical expressions for the mean and variance in an exact form and thus valid for any system size. In particular, this approach was used to study Bernoulli-Laplace and Ehrenfest urns, for which analytic expressions describing their evolution were found. This approach and the results will contribute to a more comprehensive understanding of stochastic systems and statistical physics for small-sized systems, where the thermodynamic limit cannot be assumed.</description>

      <title>Unexpected Effects of Disorder on Current Fluctuations in the Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore how the disorder impacts the current fluctuations in the symmetric simple exclusion process (SSEP) within a heterogeneous environment. First, we analyze the SSEP with a defect site under the periodic boundary conditions. We derive the exact expression for the second moment of the current and observe deviations from that of the homogeneous system. Notably, the second moment of the current shows asymmetric density dependence around a density of 1/2 and surpassing that of the homogeneous system in the low-density region. Furthermore, based on the finding from the SSEP with a defect site, we present an approximate derivation of the second moment of the current in the SSEP on a quenched random energy landscape using a partial-mean-field approach. The second moment of the current is heavily influenced by the energy landscape, revealing unique effects arising from the interplay between the heterogeneous environment and the many-body system. Our findings provide valuable insights that can be applied to control current fluctuations in systems involving the interactions of many particles, such as biological transport.</description>

      <title>The off-equilibrium Kinetic Ising model: The Metric Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11690v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the critical behavior of the Kinetic Ising model with non-reciprocal nearest neighbors interactions. A finite-size scaling study suggests that the model belongs to the Ising universality class. We characterize the off-equilibrium behavior of the model by measuring the entropy production rate and by studying the coarsening dynamics, which shows a super-diffusive relaxation. A coarse-grained equation of motion is in compelling agreement with the numerical findings. A one-loop renormalization group calculation shows that the model belongs to the Model A universality class.</description>

      <title>Local order metrics for many-particle systems across length scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Formulating order metrics that sensitively quantify the degree of order/disorder in many-particle systems in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ across length scales is an outstanding challenge in physics, chemistry, and materials science. Since an infinite set of $n$-particle correlation functions is required to fully characterize a system, one must settle for a reduced set of structural information, in practice. We initiate a program to use the number variance $\sigma_N^2(R)$ associated with a spherical sampling window of radius $R$ (which encodes pair correlations) and an integral measure derived from it $\Sigma_N(R_i,R_j)$ that depends on two specified radial distances $R_i$ and $R_j$. Across the first three space dimensions ($d = 1,2,3$), we find these metrics can sensitively describe and categorize the degree of order/disorder of 41 different models of antihyperuniform, nonhyperuniform, disordered hyperuniform, and ordered hyperuniform many-particle systems at a specified length scale $R$. Using our local variance metrics, we demonstrate the importance of assessing order/disorder with respect to a specific value of $R$. These order metrics could also aid in the inverse design of structures with prescribed scale-specific degrees of order/disorder that yield desired physical properties. In future work, it would be fruitful to explore the use of higher-order moments [S. Torquato et al., Phys. Rev. X, 11, 021028 (2021)] to devise even more sensitive order metrics.</description>

      <title>Towards a theory of phase transitions in quantum control landscapes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control landscape phase transitions (CLPTs) occur as abrupt changes in the cost function landscape upon varying a control parameter, and can be revealed by non-analytic points in statistical order parameters. A prime example are quantum speed limits (QSL) which mark the onset of controllability as the protocol duration is increased. Here we lay the foundations of an analytical theory for CLPTs by developing Dyson, Magnus, and cumulant expansions for the cost function that capture the behavior of CLPTs with a controlled precision. Using linear and quadratic stability analysis, we reveal that CLPTs can be associated with different types of instabilities of the optimal protocol. This allows us to explicitly relate CLPTs to critical structural rearrangements in the extrema of the control landscape: utilizing path integral methods from statistical field theory, we trace back the critical scaling of the order parameter at the QSL to the topological and geometric properties of the set of optimal protocols, such as the number of connected components and its dimensionality. We verify our predictions by introducing a numerical sampling algorithm designed to explore this optimal set via a homotopic stochastic update rule. We apply this new toolbox explicitly to analyze CLPTs in the single- and two-qubit control problems whose landscapes are analytically tractable, and compare the landscapes for bang-bang and continuous protocols. Our work provides the first steps towards a systematic theory of CLPTs and paves the way for utilizing statistical field theory techniques for generic complex control landscapes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a class of many body chaotic models related to the Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. An emergent symmetry maps the quantum dynamics into a classical stochastic process. Thus we are able to study many dynamical properties at finite N on an arbitrary graph structure. A comprehensive study of operator size growth with or without spatial locality is presented. We will show universal behaviors emerge at large N limit, and compare them with field theory method. We also design simple stochastic processes as an intuitive way of thinking about many-body chaotic behaviors. Other properties including entanglement growth and other variants of this solvable models are discussed.</description>

      <title>Dissecting mode-coupling theory for supercooled liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mode-coupling theory (MCT) of the glass transition ranks among the most successful first-principles kinetic theories to describe glassy dynamics. However, MCT does not fully account for crucial aspects of the dynamics near the glass transition. To facilitate improving the theory, we critically test the approximations inherent in MCT for a supercooled mixture using Brownian dynamics simulations. Although each MCT approximation significantly impacts the predicted dynamics, our findings show that long-time cancellations of errors occur due to static and dynamic approximations of four-point correlation functions, with the validity of these approximations remaining relatively constant across different temperatures. Notably, the MCT form of the memory functional maintains remarkably high accuracy even in the supercooled regime when evaluated with the intermediate scattering function from simulations. The primary discrepancies between theoretical predictions and experimental results arise from the self-consistent nature of the MCT equations, which amplify minor errors in the memory kernel. This suggests that minor corrections to the memory functional could substantially enhance the theory's predictive accuracy.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Theory of the Elastic Shear Modulus and Length-Scale-Dependent Dynamic Re-Entrancy Phenomena in Very Dense Sticky Particle Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We apply the hybrid Projectionless Dynamic Theory (hybrid PDT) formulation of the Elastically Collective Nonlinear Langevin Equation (ECNLE) activated dynamics approach to study dense fluids of sticky spheres with short range attractions. Of special interest is the problem of non-monotonic evolution with attraction strength of the elastic modulus ("re-entrancy") at high packing fractions far beyond the ideal mode coupling theory (MCT) nonergodicity boundary. The dynamic force constraints explicitly treat the bare attractive forces that drive transient physical bond formation, while a projection approximation is employed for the singular hard-sphere potential. The resultant interference between repulsive and attractive forces contribution to the dynamic vertex results in the prediction of localization length and elastic modulus re-entrancy, qualitatively consistent with experiments. The non-monotonic evolution of the alpha time predicted by ECNLE theory with the hybrid PDT approach is explored in depth as a function of packing fraction, attraction strength, and range. Isochronal dynamic arrest boundaries based on activated relaxation display the classic non-monotonic glass melting form. Comparisons of these results with the corresponding predictions of ideal MCT and the ECNLE and NLE activated theories based on projection reveal large qualitative differences. The consequences of stochastic trajectory fluctuations on intra-cage single particle dynamics with variable attraction strengths are also studied. Large dynamical heterogeneity effects in attractive glasses are properly captured. These include a rapidly increasing non-Gaussian parameter with packing fraction and a non-monotonic evolution with attraction strength, in accord with recent simulations. Extension of the microscopic theoretical approach to treat double yielding in attractive glass nonlinear rheology is possible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nodal loop semimetals are topological materials with drumhead surface states characterized by reduced kinetic energy. If the Fermi energy of such a system is near these nondispersive states interaction among charge carriers substantially impacts their electronic structure. The emergence of magnetism in these surface states is one of the possible consequences. Ca3P2 an already synthesized material possesses a remarkably large nodal loop which is situated exactly at the Fermi level of the bulk system. In the present work, we investigate how surface magnetism is impacted by surface reconstruction and lattice termination in finite slabs in this material. We show that a slight deviation from the stoichiometric occupation of Ca sites results in the stabilization of magnetic patterns.</description>

      <title>Phase diagram of a spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladder with a chirality-chirality interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A spin-1/2 Heisenberg model with a chirality-chirality interaction (CCI) on a two-leg ladder offers a minimal setup to study an interplay between spin and chirality degrees of freedom. This model is potentially relevant to understanding the effects of a four-spin ring exchange and a phonon-mediated interaction on a ladder. By applying the Abelian bosonization and two types of spin-chirality duality, we derive a rich phase diagram of this model that includes previously unexplored cases of a ferromagnetic rung exchange $J_\perp&lt;0$ or a negative CCI $K_{\rm ch}&lt;0$. The phase diagram consists of the rung singlet (RS) phase, the Haldane phase, and three non-magnetic ordered phases. Furthermore, the RS and Haldane phases consist of several regions with different dominant correlations in terms of spin, dimer, or chirality. We perform numerical simulations to confirm the predicted phase structure and critical properties.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of operator size distribution in q-local quantum Brownian SYK and spin models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study operator dynamics in Brownian quantum many-body models with $q$-local interactions. The operator dynamics are characterized by the time-dependent size distribution, for which we derive an exact master equation in both the Brownian Majorana Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model and the spin model for general $q$. This equation can be solved numerically for large systems. Additionally, we obtain the analytical size distribution in the large $N$ limit for arbitrary initial conditions and $q$. The distributions for both models take the same form, related to the $\chi$-squared distribution by a change of variable, and strongly depend on the initial condition. For small initial sizes, the operator dynamics are characterized by a broad distribution that narrows as the initial size increases. When the initial operator size is below $q-2$ for the Majorana model or $q-1$ for the spin model, the distribution diverges in the small size limit at all times. The mean size of all operators, which can be directly measured by the out-of-time ordered correlator, grows exponentially during the early time. In the late time regime, the mean size for a single Majorana or Pauli operator for all $q$ decays exponentially as $t e^{-t}$, much slower than all other operators, which decay as $e^{-t}$. At finite $N$, the size distribution exhibits modulo-dependent branching within a symmetry sector for the $q \geq 8$ Majorana model and the $q \geq 4$ spin model. Our results reveal universal features of operator dynamics in $q$-local quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Harmonic Oscillator Staging Coordinates for Efficient Path Integral Simulations of Quantum Oscillators and Crystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Imaginary-time path integral (PI) is a rigorous tool to compute static properties at finite temperatures. However, the stiff PI internal modes poses a sampling challenge. This is commonly tackled using staging coordinates, in which the free particle (FP) term of the PI action is diagonalized. We introduce novel and simple staging coordinates that diagonalize the entire action of the harmonic oscillator (HO) model, rendering it efficiently applicable to systems with harmonic character, such as quantum oscillators and crystals. The method is not applicable to fluids or systems with imaginary modes. Unlike FP staging, the HO staging provides a unique treatment of the centroid mode. We provide implementation schemes for PIMC and PIMD in NVT ensemble. Sampling efficiency is assessed in terms of precision and accuracy of estimating the energy and heat capacity of a one-dimensional HO and an asymmetric anharmonic oscillator (AO). In PIMC, the HO coordinates propose collective moves that perfectly sample the HO contribution, then (for AO) the anharmonic term is sampled using standard Metropolis method. This results in a high acceptance rate and, hence, high precision, in comparison to the FP staging. In PIMD, the HO coordinates prescribe definitions for the fictitious masses, yielding equal frequencies when applied to HO model. This allows for larger time step sizes relative to standard staging, without affecting accuracy or integrator stability. We also present results using normal mode (NM) coordinates, based on both HO and FP models. While staging and NM coordinates show similar performance (for FP or HO), staging is computationally preferable due to its cheaper scaling with Trotter number. The enhanced sampling of HO coordinates open avenues for efficient estimation of nuclear quantum effects in more complex systems with harmonic character, such as real molecular bonds and quantum crystals.</description>

Abstract: We propose an expression for the production of entropy for system described by a stochastic dynamics which is appropriate for the case where the reverse transition rate vanishes but the forward transition is nonzero. The expression is positive defined and based on the inequality $x\ln x-(x-1)\ge0$. The corresponding entropy flux is linear in the probability distribution allowing its calculation as an average. The expression is applied to the one-dimensional contact process at the stationary state. We found that the rate of entropy production per site is finite with a singularity at the critical point with diverging slope.</description>

Abstract: Generative diffusion models apply the concept of Langevin dynamics in physics to machine leaning, attracting a lot of interests from engineering, statistics and physics, but a complete picture about inherent mechanisms is still lacking. In this paper, we provide a transparent physics analysis of diffusion models, formulating the fluctuation theorem, entropy production, equilibrium measure, and Franz-Parisi potential to understand the dynamic process and intrinsic phase transitions. Our analysis is rooted in a path integral representation of both forward and backward dynamics, and in treating the reverse diffusion generative process as a statistical inference, where the time-dependent state variables serve as quenched disorder akin to that in spin glass theory. Our study thus links stochastic thermodynamics, statistical inference and geometry based analysis together to yield a coherent picture about how the generative diffusion models work.</description>

      <title>Apparent delay of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism in quenched open systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.13424v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a new intermediate regime in the quench time, $\tau_{q}$, separating the usual validity of the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) and its breakdown for rapid quenches in open systems under finite quench protocols. It manifests in the power-law scaling of the transition time with $\tau_{q}$ as the system appears to enter the adiabatic regime, even though the ramp is already terminated and the final quench value is held constant. This intermediate regime, which we dub as the delayed KZM, emerges due to the dissipation preventing the system from freezing in the impulse regime. This results in a large delay between the actual time the system undergoes a phase transition and the time inferred from a threshold-based criterion for the order parameter, as done in most experiments. We demonstrate using the open Dicke model and its one-dimensional lattice version that this phenomenon is a generic feature of open systems that can be mapped onto an effective coupled oscillator model. We also show that the phenomenon becomes more prominent near criticality, and its effects on the transition time measurement can be further exacerbated by large threshold values for an order parameter. Due to this, we propose an alternative method for threshold-based criterion which uses the spatio-temporal information, such as the system's defect number, for identifying the transition time.</description>

      <title>Thermal quasi-particle theory</title>

Abstract: The widely used thermal Hartree-Fock (HF) theory is generalized to include the effect of electron correlation while maintaining its quasi-independent-particle framework. An electron-correlated internal energy (or grand potential) is postulated in consultation with the second-order finite-temperature many-body perturbation theory (MBPT), which then dictates the corresponding thermal orbital (quasi-particle) energies in such a way that all fundamental thermodynamic relations are obeyed. The associated density matrix is of a one-electron type, whose diagonal elements take the form of the Fermi-Dirac distribution functions, when the grand potential is minimized. The formulas for the entropy and chemical potential are unchanged from those of Fermi-Dirac or thermal HF theory. The theory thus constitutes a finite-temperature extension of the second-order Dyson self-energy of one-particle many-body Green's function theory and can be viewed as a second-order, diagonal, frequency-independent, thermal inverse Dyson equation. At low temperature, the theory approaches finite-temperature MBPT of the same order, but it may outperform the latter at intermediate temperature by including additional electron-correlation effects through orbital energies. A physical meaning of these thermal orbital energies is proposed (encompassing that of thermal HF orbital energies, which has been elusive) as a finite-temperature version of Janak's theorem.</description>

      <title>Phases of (2+1)D SO(5) non-linear sigma model with a topological term on a sphere: multicritical point and disorder phase</title>

Abstract: Novel critical phenomena beyond the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm have been long sought after. Among many candidate scenarios, the deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) constitutes the most fascinating one, and its lattice model realization has been debated over the past two decades. Here we apply the spherical Landau level regularization upon the exact (2+1)D SO(5) non-linear sigma model with a topological term to study the potential DQCP therein. We perform density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulation with SU(2)$_\mathrm{spin}\times$U(1)$_\mathrm{charge}\times$U(1)$_\mathrm{angular-momentum}$ symmetries explicitly implemented. Using crossing point analysis for the critical properties of the DMRG data, accompanied by quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we accurately obtain the comprehensive phase diagram of the model and find various novel quantum phases, including N\'eel, ferromagnet (FM), valence bond solid (VBS), valley polarized (VP) states and a gapless quantum disordered phase occupying extended area of the phase diagram. The VBS-Disorder and N\'eel-Disorder transitions are continuous with non-Wilson-Fisher exponents. Our results show the VBS and N\'eel states are separated by either a weakly first-order transition or the disordered region with a multicritical point in between, thus opening up more interesting questions on the two-decade long debate on the nature of DQCP.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by the great success of classical generative models in machine learning, enthusiastic exploration of their quantum version has recently started. To depart on this journey, it is important to develop a relevant metric to evaluate the quality of quantum generative models; in the classical case, one such example is the (classical) inception score (cIS). In this paper, as a natural extension of cIS, we propose the quantum inception score (qIS) for quantum generators. Importantly, qIS relates the quality to the Holevo information of the quantum channel that classifies a given dataset. In this context, we show several properties of qIS. First, qIS is greater than or equal to the corresponding cIS, which is defined through projection measurements on the system output. Second, the difference between qIS and cIS arises from the presence of quantum coherence, as characterized by the resource theory of asymmetry. Third, when a set of entangled generators is prepared, there exists a classifying process leading to the further enhancement of qIS. Fourth, we harness the quantum fluctuation theorem to characterize the physical limitation of qIS. Finally, we apply qIS to assess the quality of the one-dimensional spin chain model as a quantum generative model, with the quantum convolutional neural network as a quantum classifier, for the phase classification problem in the quantum many-body physics.</description>

      <title>Exactly Solvable Floquet Dynamics for Conformal Field Theories in Dimensions Greater than Two</title>

Abstract: We find classes of driven conformal field theories (CFT) in d + 1 dimensions with d &gt; 1, whose quench and Floquet dynamics can be computed exactly. The setup is suitable for studying periodic drives, consisting of square pulse protocols for which Hamiltonian evolution takes place with different deformations of the original CFT Hamiltonian in successive time intervals. These deformations are realized by specific combinations of conformal generators with a deformation parameter $\beta$; the $\beta &lt; 1$ ($\beta &gt; 1$) Hamiltonians can be unitarily related to the standard (Luscher-Mack) CFT Hamiltonian. The resulting time evolution can be then calculated by conformal transformations. For $d\leq 3$ we show that the transformations can be obtained in a quaternion formalism. Evolution with such a single Hamiltonian yields qualitatively different time dependences of observables depending on the value of $\beta$, ranging from exponential decays characteristic of heating to oscillations and power law decays. This manifests in the behavior of the fidelity, unequal-time correlator, and the energy density at the end of a single cycle of a square pulse protocol with different hamiltonians in successive time intervals. When the Hamiltonians in a cycle involve generators of a single SU(1, 1) subalgebra we calculate the Floquet Hamiltonian. We show that one can get dynamical phase transitions by varying the time period of a cycle, where the system can go from a non-heating phase which is oscillatory as a function of the time period to a heating phase with an exponentially damped behavior. Our methods can be generalized to other discrete and continuous protocols. We also point out that our results are expected to hold for a broader class of QFTs that possesses an SL(2, C) symmetry with fields that transform as quasi-primaries under this. As an example, we briefly comment on celestial CFTs in this context.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the emergence of quantum state designs in systems with symmetry</title>

Abstract: Quantum state designs, by enabling an efficient sampling of random quantum states, play a quintessential role in devising and benchmarking various quantum protocols with broad applications ranging from circuit designs to black hole physics. Symmetries, on the other hand, are expected to reduce the randomness of a state. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetry on quantum state designs remain an outstanding question. The recently introduced projected ensemble framework generates efficient approximate state $t$-designs by hinging on projective measurements and many-body quantum chaos. In this work, we examine the emergence of state designs from the random generator states exhibiting symmetries. Leveraging on translation symmetry, we analytically establish a sufficient condition for the measurement basis leading to the state $t$-designs. Then, by making use of the trace distance measure, we numerically investigate the convergence to the designs. Subsequently, we inspect the violation of the sufficient condition to identify bases that fail to converge. We further demonstrate the emergence of state designs in a physical system by studying the dynamics of a chaotic tilted field Ising chain with translation symmetry. We find faster convergence of the trace distance during the early time evolution in comparison to the cases when the symmetry is broken. To delineate the general applicability of our results, we extend our analysis to other symmetries. We expect our findings to pave the way for further exploration of deep thermalization and equilibration of closed and open quantum many-body systems.</description>
