      <title>Computing the steady-state probabilities of a tandem queueing system, a Machine Learning approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tandem queueing networks are widely used to model systems where services are provided in sequential stages. In this study, we assume that each station in the tandem system operates under a general renewal process. Additionally, we assume that the arrival process for the first station is governed by a general renewal process, which implies that arrivals at subsequent stations will likely deviate from a renewal pattern.
  This study leverages neural networks (NNs) to approximate the steady-state distribution of the marginal number of customers at each station in the tandem queueing system, based on the external inter-arrival and service time distributions.
  Our approach involves decomposing each station and estimating the departure process by characterizing its first five moments and auto-correlation values, without limiting the analysis to linear or first-lag auto-correlation. We demonstrate that this method outperforms existing models, establishing it as state-of-the-art.
  Furthermore, we present a detailed analysis of the impact of the i^th moments of inter-arrival and service times on steady-state probabilities, showing that the first five moments are nearly sufficient to determine these probabilities. Similarly, we analyze the influence of inter-arrival auto-correlation, revealing that the first two lags of the first- and second-degree polynomial auto-correlation values almost completely determine the steady-state probabilities of a G/GI/1 queue.</description>

      <title>Activated Random Walks on $\mathbb{Z}$ with Critical Particle Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Activated Random Walk (ARW) model is a promising candidate for demonstrating self-organized criticality due to its potential for universality. Recent studies have shown that the ARW model exhibits a well-defined critical density in one dimension, supporting its universality. In this paper, we extend these results by demonstrating that the ARW model on $\mathbb{Z}$, with a single initially active particle and all other particles sleeping, maintains the same critical density. Our findings relax the previous assumption that required all particles to be initially active. This provides further evidence of the ARW model's robustness and universality in depicting self-organized criticality.</description>

      <title>Long Time Behavior of General Markov Additive Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07671v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study general Markov additive processes when the state space of the modulator is a Polish space. Under some regularity assumptions, our main result is the characterization of the long-time behavior of the ordinate in terms of the associated ladder time process and the excursion measure. An important application of Markov additive processes is the Lamperti-Kiu transform, which gives a correspondence between $\mathbb{R}^d\backslash \{0\}$-valued self-similar Markov processes and $S^{d-1}\times \mathbb{R}$-valued Markov additive processes. The asymptotic behavior of the radial distance from the origin of a self-similar Markov process can be characterized by the long-time behavior of the ordinate of the corresponding Markov additive process. We show the applicability of our assumptions on some well-known self-similar Markov processes.</description>

      <title>Energy solutions of singular SPDEs on Hilbert spaces with applications to domains with boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the theory of energy solutions for singular SPDEs, focusing on equations driven by highly irregular noise with bilinear nonlinearities, including scaling critical examples. By introducing Gelfand triples and leveraging infinite-dimensional analysis in Hilbert spaces together with an integration by parts formula under the invariant measure, we largely eliminate the need for Fourier series and chaos expansions. This approach broadens the applicability of energy solutions to a wider class of SPDEs, offering a unified treatment of various domains and boundary conditions. Our examples are motivated by recent work on scaling limits of interacting particle systems.</description>

      <title>On Asymptotic Behavior of Extinction Moment of Critical Bisexual Branching Process in Random Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a critical bisexual branching process in a random environment generated by independent and identically distributed random variables. Assuming that the process starts with a large number of pairs $N$, we prove that its extinction time is of the order $\ln^2 N$. Interestingly, this result is valid for a general class of mating functions. Among them are the functions describing the monogamous and polygamous behavior of couples, as well as the function reducing the bisexual branching process to the simple one.</description>

      <title>Pirogov--Sinai Theory Beyond Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pirogov--Sinai theory is a well-developed method for understanding the low-temperature phase diagram of statistical mechanics models on lattices. Motivated by physical and algorithmic questions beyond the setting of lattices, we develop a combinatorially flexible version of Pirogov--Sinai theory for the hard-core model of independent sets. Our results illustrate that the main conclusions of Pirogov--Sinai theory can be obtained in significantly greater generality than that of $\mathbb Z^{d}$. The main ingredients in our generalization are combinatorial and involve developing appropriate definitions of contours based on the notion of cycle basis connectivity. This is inspired by works of Tim\'{a}r and Georgakopoulos--Panagiotis.</description>

      <title>Central limit theorem for the focusing $\Phi^4$-measure in the infinite volume limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of the focusing $\Phi^4$-measure on the one-dimensional torus, in the infinite volume limit. This measure is the invariant Gibbs measure for the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation. It had previously been shown by Rider that the measure is strongly concentrated around a family of minimizers of the Hamiltonian associated with the measure, known as the soliton manifold. These exhibit increasingly sharp spatial concentration, resulting in a trivial limit to first order. We study the fluctuations around this soliton manifold. Our results show that the scaled field under the Gibbs measure converges to white noise in the limit, identifying the next order fluctuations predicted by Rider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive explicit Bernstein-type and Bennett-type concentration inequalities for matrix-valued supermartingale processes with unbounded observations. Specifically, we assume that the $\psi_{\alpha}$-Orlicz (quasi-)norms of their difference process are bounded for some $\alpha &gt; 0$. As corollaries, we prove an empirical version of Bernstein's inequality and an extension of the bounded differences inequality, also known as McDiarmid's inequality.</description>

      <title>Approximation rates of entropic maps in semidiscrete optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07947v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport offers a computationally tractable approximation to the classical problem. In this note, we study the approximation rate of the entropic optimal transport map (in approaching the Brenier map) when the regularization parameter $\varepsilon$ tends to zero in the semidiscrete setting, where the input measure is absolutely continuous while the output is finitely discrete. Previous work shows that the approximation rate is $O(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ under the $L^2$-norm with respect to the input measure. In this work, we establish faster, $O(\varepsilon^2)$ rates up to polylogarithmic factors, under the dual Lipschitz norm, which is weaker than the $L^2$-norm. For the said dual norm, the $O(\varepsilon^2)$ rate is sharp. As a corollary, we derive a central limit theorem for the entropic estimator for the Brenier map in the dual Lipschitz space when the regularization parameter tends to zero as the sample size increases.</description>

      <title>Last passage percolation in hierarchical environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Last passage percolation (LPP) is a model of a directed metric and a zero-temperature polymer where the main observable is a directed path evolving in a random environment accruing as energy the sum of the random weights along itself. When the environment has light tails and a fast decay of correlation, the fluctuations of LPP are predicted to be explained by the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality theory. However, the KPZ theory is not expected to apply for many natural environments, particularly "critical" ones exhibiting a hierarchical structure often leading to logarithmic correlations.
  In this article, we initiate a novel study of LPP in such hierarchical environments by investigating two particularly interesting examples. The first is an i.i.d. environment but with a power-law distribution with an inverse quadratic tail decay which is conjectured to be the critical point for the validity of the KPZ scaling relation. The second is the Branching Random Walk which is a hierarchical approximation of the two-dimensional Gaussian Free Field. The second example may be viewed as a high-temperature directed version of Liouville Quantum Gravity, which is a model of random geometry driven by the exponential of a logarithmically-correlated field. Due to the underlying fractal structure, LPP in such environments is expected to exhibit logarithmic correction terms with novel critical exponents. While discussions about such critical models appear in the physics literature, precise predictions about exponents seem to be missing. Developing a framework based on multi-scale analysis, we obtain bounds on such exponents and prove almost optimal concentration results in all dimensions for both models. As a byproduct of our analysis we answer a long-standing question of Martin concerning necessary and sufficient conditions for the linear growth of the LPP energy in i.i.d. environments.</description>

      <title>Rapid Mixing at the Uniqueness Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Over the past decades, a fascinating computational phase transition has been identified in sampling from Gibbs distributions. Though, the computational complexity at the critical point remains poorly understood, as previous algorithmic and hardness results all required a constant slack from this threshold.
  In this paper, we resolve this open question at the critical phase transition threshold, thus completing the picture of the computational phase transition. We show that for the hardcore model on graphs with maximum degree $\Delta\ge 3$ at the uniqueness threshold $\lambda = \lambda_c(\Delta)$, the mixing time of Glauber dynamics is upper bounded by a polynomial in $n$, but is not nearly linear in the worst case.
  For the Ising model (either antiferromagnetic or ferromagnetic), we establish similar results. For the Ising model on graphs with maximum degree $\Delta\ge 3$ at the critical temperature $\beta$ where $|\beta| = \beta_c(\Delta)$, with the tree-uniqueness threshold $\beta_c(\Delta)$, we show that the mixing time of Glauber dynamics is upper bounded by $\tilde{O}\left(n^{2 + O(1/\Delta)}\right)$ and lower bounded by $\Omega\left(n^{3/2}\right)$ in the worst case. For the Ising model specified by a critical interaction matrix $J$ with $\left \lVert J \right \rVert_2=1$, we obtain an upper bound $\tilde{O}(n^{3/2})$ for the mixing time, matching the lower bound $\Omega\left(n^{3/2}\right)$ on the complete graph up to a logarithmic factor.
  Our mixing time upper bounds are derived from a new interpretation and analysis of the localization scheme method introduced by Chen and Eldan (2022), applied to the field dynamics for the hardcore model and the proximal sampler for the Ising model. As key steps in both our upper and lower bounds, we establish sub-linear upper and lower bounds for spectral independence at the critical point for worst-case instances.</description>

      <title>Multi-hop Upstream Preemptive Traffic Signal Control with Deep Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traffic signal control is crucial for managing congestion in urban networks. Existing myopic pressure-based control methods focus only on immediate upstream links, leading to suboptimal green time allocation and increased network delays. Effective signal control, however, inherently requires a broader spatial scope, as traffic conditions further upstream can significantly impact traffic at the current location. This paper introduces a novel concept based on the Markov chain theory, namely multi-hop upstream pressure, that generalizes the conventional pressure to account for traffic conditions beyond the immediate upstream links. This farsighted and compact metric informs the deep reinforcement learning agent to preemptively clear the present queues, guiding the agent to optimize signal timings with a broader spatial awareness. Simulations on synthetic and realistic (Toronto) scenarios demonstrate controllers utilizing multi-hop upstream pressure significantly reduce overall network delay by prioritizing traffic movements based on a broader understanding of upstream congestion.</description>

      <title>Reduced Sample Complexity in Scenario-Based Control System Design via Constraint Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The scenario approach is widely used in robust control system design and chance-constrained optimization, maintaining convexity without requiring assumptions about the probability distribution of uncertain parameters. However, the approach can demand large sample sizes, making it intractable for safety-critical applications that require very low levels of constraint violation. To address this challenge, we propose a novel yet simple constraint scaling method, inspired by large deviations theory. Under mild nonparametric conditions on the underlying probability distribution, we show that our method yields an exponential reduction in sample size requirements for bilinear constraints with low violation levels compared to the classical approach, thereby significantly improving computational tractability. Numerical experiments on robust pole assignment problems support our theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>A Theoretical Review of Area Production Rates as Test Statistics for Detecting Nonequilibrium Dynamics in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A stochastic process is at thermodynamic equilibrium if it obeys time-reversal symmetry; forward and reverse time are statistically indistinguishable at steady state. Non-equilibrium processes break time-reversal symmetry by maintaining circulating probability currents. In physical processes, these currents require a continual use and exchange of energy. Accordingly, signatures of non-equilibrium behavior are important markers of energy use in biophysical systems. In this article we consider a particular signature of nonequilibrium behavior: area production rates. These are, the average rate at which a stochastic process traces out signed area in its projections onto coordinate planes. Area production is an example of a linear observable: a path integral over an observed trajectory against a linear vector field. We provide a summary review of area production rates in Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) processes. Then, we show that, given an OU process, a weighted Frobenius norm of the area production rate matrix is the optimal test statistic for detecting nonequilibrium behavior in the sense that its coefficient of variation decays faster in the length of time observed than the coefficient of variation of any other linear observable. We conclude by showing that this test statistic estimates the entropy production rate of the process.</description>

      <title>Node Reliability: Approximation, Upper Bounds, and Applications to Network Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07636v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper discusses the reliability of a graph in which the links are perfectly reliable but the nodes may fail with certain probability p. Calculating graph node reliability is an NP-Hard problem. We introduce an efficient and accurate Monte Carlo method and a stochastic approximation for the node reliability polynomial based solely on the degree distribution. We provide the formulas for the node reliability polynomial of both Erdos-Renyi graphs and Random Geometric graphs. The phase transition in the node reliability of Erdos-Renyi graphs is also discussed. Additionally, we propose two increasingly accurate upper bounds for the node reliability polynomial solely based on the graph's degree distributions. The advantages and disadvantages of these two upper bounds are thoroughly compared. Beyond the computation of node reliability polynomials, we also estimate the number of cut sets and present a solution to the reliability-based network enhancement problem.</description>

Abstract: Existing guarantees for algorithms sampling from nonlogconcave measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$ are generally inexplicit or unscalable. Even for the class of measures with logdensities that have bounded Hessians and are strongly concave outside a Euclidean ball of radius $R$, no available theory is comprehensively satisfactory with respect to both $R$ and $d$. In this paper, it is shown that complete polynomial complexity can in fact be achieved if $R\leq c\sqrt{d}$, whilst an exponential number of point evaluations is generally necessary for any algorithm as soon as $R\geq C\sqrt{d}$ for constants $C&gt;c&gt;0$. A simple importance sampler with tail-matching proposal achieves the former, owing to a blessing of dimensionality. On the other hand, if strong concavity outside a ball is replaced by a distant dissipativity condition, then sampling guarantees must generally scale exponentially with $d$ in all parameter regimes.</description>

      <title>Population growth on a time varying network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a population spreading across a finite number of sites. Individuals can move from one site to the other according to a network (oriented links between the sites) that vary periodically over time. On each site, the population experiences a growth rate which is also periodically time varying. Recently, this kind of models have been extensively studied, using various technical tools to derive precise necessary and sufficient conditions on the parameters of the system (ie the local growth rate on each site, the time period and the strength of migration between the sites) for the population to grow. In the present paper, we take a completely different approach: using elementary comparison results between linear systems, we give sufficient condition for the growth of the population This condition is easy to check and can be applied in a broad class of examples. In particular, in the case when all sites are sinks (ie, in the absence of migration, the population become extinct in each site), we prove that when our condition of growth if satisfied, the population grows when the time period is large and for values of the migration strength that are exponentially small with respect to the time period, which answers positively to a conjecture stated by Katriel.</description>

      <title>Optimization Thresholding Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a simplified model for optimizing a single-asset portfolio in the presence of transaction costs given a signal with a certain autocorrelation and cross-correlation structure. In our setup, the portfolio manager is given two one-parameter controls to influence the construction of the portfolio. The first is a linear filtering parameter that may increase or decrease the level of autocorrelation in the signal. The second is a numerical threshold that determines a symmetric ``no-trade" zone. Portfolio positions are constrained to a single unit long or a single unit short. These constraints allow us to focus on the interplay between the signal filtering mechanism and the hysteresis introduced by the ``no-trade" zone. We then formulate an optimization problem where we aim to minimize the frequency of trades subject to a fixed return level of the portfolio. We show that maintaining a no-trade zone while removing autocorrelation entirely from the signal yields a locally optimal solution. For any given ``no-trade" zone threshold, this locally optimal solution also achieves the maximum attainable return level, and we derive a quantitative lower bound for the amount of improvement in terms of the given threshold and the amount of autocorrelation removed.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic contractivity and the Hilbert metric on probability measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.02413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.02413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper gives a self-contained introduction to the Hilbert projective metric $\mathcal{H}$ and its fundamental properties, with a particular focus on the space of probability measures. We start by defining the Hilbert pseudo-metric on convex cones, focusing mainly on dual formulations of $\mathcal{H}$ . We show that linear operators on convex cones contract in the distance given by the hyperbolic tangent of $\mathcal{H}$, which in particular implies Birkhoff's classical contraction result for $\mathcal{H}$. Turning to spaces of probability measures, where $\mathcal{H}$ is a metric, we analyse the dual formulation of $\mathcal{H}$ in the general setting, and explore the geometry of the probability simplex under $\mathcal{H}$ in the special case of discrete probability measures. Throughout, we compare $\mathcal{H}$ with other distances between probability measures. In particular, we show how convergence in $\mathcal{H}$ implies convergence in total variation, $p$-Wasserstein distance, and any $f$-divergence. Furthermore, we derive a novel sharp bound for the total variation between two probability measures in terms of their Hilbert distance.</description>

      <title>Almost sure approximations and laws of iterated logarithm for signatures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.02665v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We obtain strong invariance principles for normalized multiple iterated sums and integrals of the form $\bbS_N^{(\nu)}(t)=N^{-\nu/2}\sum_{0\leq k_1&lt;...&lt;k_\nu\leq Nt}\xi(k_1)\otimes\cdots\otimes\xi(k_\nu)$, $t\in[0,T]$ and $\bbS_N^{(\nu)}(t)=N^{-\nu/2}\int_{0\leq s_1\leq...\leq s_\nu\leq Nt}\xi(s_1)\otimes\cdots\otimes\xi(s_\nu)ds_1\cdots ds_\nu$, where $\{\xi(k)\}_{-\infty&lt;k&lt;\infty}$ and $\{\xi(s)\}_{-\infty&lt;s&lt;\infty}$ are centered stationary vector processes with some weak dependence properties. These imply also laws of iterated logarithm and an almost sure central limit theorem for such objects. In the continuous time we work both under direct weak dependence assumptions and also within the suspension setup which is more appropriate for applications in dynamical systems. Similar results under substantially more restricted conditions were obtained in \cite{FK} relying heavily on rough paths theory and notations while here we obtain these results in a more direct way which makes them accessible to a wider readership. This is a companion paper of our paper "Limit theorems for signatures" and we consider a similar setup and rely on many result from there.</description>

      <title>Higher-order fractional equations and related time-changed pseudo-processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.13691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Cauchy problems of fractional differential equations in both space and time variables by expressing the solution in terms of ``stochastic composition" of the solutions to two simpler problems. These Cauchy sub-problems respectively concern the space and the time differential operator involved in the main equation. We provide some probabilistic and pseudo-probabilistic applications, where the solution can be interpreted as the pseudo-transition density of a time-changed pseudo-process. To extend our results to higher order time-fractional problems, we introduce pseudo-subordinators as well as its pseudo-inverse. Finally, we present our results in the case of more general differential operators and we interpret the results by means of a linear combination of pseudo-subordinators and its inverse.</description>

      <title>Sum the Probabilities to $m$ and Stop</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07283v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the optimal selection of the $m$th last success in a sequence of $n$ independent Bernoulli trials. We propose a threshold strategy that is $\varepsilon$-optimal under minimal assumptions about the monotonicity of the trials' success probabilities. This new strategy ensures stopping at most one step earlier than the optimal rule. Specifically, the new threshold coincides with the point where the sum of success probabilities in the remaining trials equals $m$. We show that the underperformance of the new rule, in comparison to the optimal one, is of the order $O(n^{-2})$ in the case of a Karamata-Stirling success profile with parameter $\theta &gt; 0$ where $p_k = \theta / (\theta + k - 1)$ for the $k$th trial. We further leverage the classical weak convergence of the number of successes in the trials to a Poisson random variable to derive the asymptotic solution of the stopping problem. Finally, we present illustrative examples highlighting the close performance between the two rules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06974v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-posedness is investigated for distribution dependent stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter $H\in (\ff {\sq 5-1} 2,1)$ and distribution dependent multiplicative noise. To this aim, we introduce a H\"older space of probability measure paths which is a complete metric space under a new metric. Our arguments rely on a mix of contraction mapping principle on the H\"older space and fractional calculus tools. We also establish the large and moderate deviation principles for this type of equations via the weak convergence criteria in the factional Brownian motion setting, which extend previously known results in the additive setting.</description>

Abstract: Andrei Toom, who died in September 2022, contributed some of the most fundamental results on probabilistic cellular automata. We want to acquaint the reader with these and will also try to give the reader a look at the environment in which they were born. Toom was an original and strong personality, and other aspects of his life (education, literature) will also deserve mention.</description>

      <title>Interplay between local and global order controls bifurcations in nonreciprocal systems without a conservation law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We elucidate the generic bifurcation behavior of local and global order in the short-range interacting nonreciprocal Ising model evolving under Glauber dynamics. We show that a critical magnitude of nearest-neighbor correlations within the respective lattices controls the emergence of coherent oscillations of global order as a result of frustration. Local order is maintained during these oscillations, implying non-trivial spatio-temporal correlations. Long-lived states emerge in the strong-interaction regime. The residence time in either of these states eventually diverges, giving rise to ordered non-equilibrium steady states via a saddle-node-infinite-period bifurcation. Our work provides a comprehensive microscopic understanding of collective phenomena in nonreciprocal matter without conservation laws.</description>

      <title>Weak Distributive Laws between Monads of Continuous Valuations and of Non-Deterministic Choice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15977v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that there is weak distributive law of the Smyth hyperspace monad $\mathcal Q_{\mathsf V}$ (resp., the Hoare hyperspace monad $\mathcal H_{\mathsf V}$, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V}$ of quasi-lenses, resp. the monad $\mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ of lenses) over the continuous valuation monad $\mathbf V$, as well as over the subprobability valuation monad $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ and the probability valuation monad $\mathbf V_1$, on the whole category $\mathbf{Top}$ of topological spaces (resp., on certain full subcategories such as the category of locally compact spaces or of stably compact spaces). We show that the resulting weak composite monad is the author's monad of superlinear previsions (resp., sublinear previsions, resp. forks), possibly subnormalized or normalized depending on whether we consider $\mathbf V_{\leq 1}$ or $\mathbf V_1$ instead of $\mathbf V$. As a special case, we obtain a weak distributive law of the monad $\mathcal P\ell^{\mathrm q}_{\mathsf V} \cong \mathcal P\ell_{\mathsf V}$ over the monad of (sub)probability Radon measures $\mathbf R_\bullet$ on the category of stably compact spaces, which specializes further to a weak distributive laws of the Vietoris monad over $\mathbf R_\bullet$. The associated weak composite monad is the monad of (sub)normalized forks.</description>

      <title>Reflected entropy in random tensor networks III: triway cuts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For general random tensor network states at large bond dimension, we prove that the integer R\'enyi reflected entropies (away from phase transitions) are determined by minimal triway cuts through the network. This generalizes the minimal cut description of bipartite entanglement for these states. A natural extrapolation away from integer R\'enyi parameters, suggested by the triway cut problem, implies the holographic conjecture $S_R=2EW$, where $S_R$ is the reflected entropy and $EW$ is the entanglement wedge cross-section. Minimal triway cuts can be formulated as integer programs which cannot be relaxed to find a dual maximal flow/bit-thread description. This sheds light on the gap between the existence of tripartite entanglement in holographic states and the bipartite entanglement structure motivated by bit-threads. In particular, we prove that the Markov gap that measures tripartite entanglement is lower bounded by the integrality gap of the integer program that computes the triway cut.</description>
