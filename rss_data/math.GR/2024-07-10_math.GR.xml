      <title>Classifying prime graphs of finite groups -- a methodical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$, the vertices of the prime graph $\Gamma(G)$ are the primes that divide $|G|$, and two vertices $p$ and $q$ are connected by an edge if and only if there is an element of order $pq$ in $G$. Prime graphs of solvable groups as well as groups whose noncyclic composition factors have order divisible by exactly three distinct primes have been classified in graph-theoretic terms. In this paper, we begin to develop a general theory on the existence of edges in the prime graph of an arbitrary $T$-solvable group, that is, a group whose composition factors are cyclic or isomorphic to a fixed nonabelian simple group $T$. We then apply these results to classify the prime graphs of $T$-solvable groups for, in a suitable sense, most $T$ such that $|T|$ has exactly four prime divisors. We find that these groups almost always have a 3-colorable prime graph complement containing few possible triangles.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a complete rewriting system for twisted right-angled Artin groups. Utilizing the normal form coming from the rewriting system, we provide applications that illustrate differences and similarities with right-angled Artin groups, both at the geometric and algebraic levels.</description>

      <title>Irreducible Unipotent Numerical Monoids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.06319v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our earlier article~\cite{CanSakran} we initiated a study of the complement-finite submonoids of the group of integer points of a unipotent linear algebraic group. In the present article, we continue to develop tools and techniques for analyzing our monoids. In particular, we initiate a theory of ideals for unipotent numerical monoids.</description>

      <title>On the strong domination number of proper enhanced power graphs of finite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The enhanced power graph of a group G is a graph with vertex set G, where two distinct vertices x and y are adjacent if and only if there exists an element w in G such that both x and y are powers of w. To obtain the proper enhanced power graph, we consider the induced subgraph on the set G\D, where D represents the set of dominating vertices in the enhanced power graph. In this paper, we aim to determine the strong domination number of the proper enhanced power graphs of finite nilpotent groups.</description>

      <title>Scott Complexity of Reduced Abelian $p$-Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a reduced abelian $p$-group, we give an upper bound on the Scott complexity of the group in terms of its Ulm invariants. For limit ordinals, we show that this upper bound is tight. This gives an explicit sequence of such groups with arbitrarily high Scott complexity below $\omega_1$. Along the way, we give a largely algebraic characterization of the back-and-forth relations on reduced abelian $p$-groups, making progress on an open problem from the book by Ash and Knight.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic mapping class groups of Cantor manifolds and their finiteness properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.05318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2110.05318v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the infinite family of asymptotic mapping class groups of surfaces of defined by Funar--Kapoudjian and Aramayona--Funar are of type $F_\infty$, thus answering questions of Funar-Kapoudjian-Sergiescu and Aramayona-Vlamis.
  As it turns out, this result is a specific instance of a much more general theorem which allows to deduce that asymptotic mapping class groups of Cantor manifolds, also introduced in this paper, are of type $F_\infty$, provide the underlying manifolds satisfy some general hypotheses.
  As important examples, we will obtain $F_\infty$ asymptotical mapping class groups that contain, respectively, the mapping class group of every compact surface with non-empty boundary, the automorphism group of every free group of finite rank, or infinite families of arithmetic groups.
  In addition, for certain types of manifolds, the homology of our asymptotic mapping class groups coincides with the stable homology of the relevant mapping class groups, as studied by Harer and Hatcher--Wahl.</description>

      <title>The power operation in the Galois cohomology of a reductive group over a number field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07659v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a connected reductive group $G$ over a local or global field $K$, we define a *diamond* (or *power*) operation $$(\xi, n)\mapsto \xi^{\Diamond n}\, \colon\ H^1(K,G)\times {\mathbb Z}\to H^1(K,G)$$ of raising to power $n$ in the Galois cohomology pointed set (this operation is new when $K$ is a number field). We show that this operation has many functorial properties. When $G$ is a torus, the pointed set $H^1(K,G)$ has a natural group structure, and our new operation coincides with the usual power operation $(\xi,n)\mapsto \xi^n$.
  For a cohomology class $\xi$ in $H^1(K,G)$, we define the period ${\rm per}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of $n\ge 1$ such that $\xi^{\Diamond n}=1$, and the index ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ to be the greatest common divisor of the degrees $[L:K]$ of finite separable extensions $L/K$ splitting $\xi$. We show that ${\rm per}(\xi)$ divides ${\rm ind}(\xi)$, but they need not be equal. However, ${\rm per}(\xi)$ and ${\rm ind}(\xi)$ have the same set of prime factors.</description>
