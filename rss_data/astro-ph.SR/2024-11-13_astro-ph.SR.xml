      <title>The formation of multiples in small-$N$ subclusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the relative percentages of binary systems and higher-order multiples that are formed by pure stellar dynamics, within a small subcluster of $N$ stars. The subcluster is intended to represent the fragmentation products of a single isolated core, after most of the residual gas of the natal core has dispersed. Initially the stars have random positions, and masses drawn from a log-normal distribution. For low-mass cores spawning multiple systems with Sun-like primaries, the best fit to the observed percentages of singles, binaries, triples and higher-order systems is obtained if a typical core spawns on average between $N=$ 4.3 and 5.2 stars, specifically a distribution of $N$ with mean $\mu_{_{N}}\sim4.8$ and standard deviation $\sigma_{_N}\sim2.4$. This fit is obtained when $\sim 50\%$ of the subcluster's internal kinetic energy is invested in ordered rotation and $\sim 50\%$ in isotropic Maxwellian velocities. There is little dependence on other factors, for example mass segregation or the rotation law. Whilst such high values of $N$ are at variance with the lower values often quoted (i.e. $N=$ 1 or 2), very similar values ($N=4.3\pm0.4$ and $N=4.5\pm1.9$) have been derived previously by completely independent routes, and seem inescapable when the observed distribution of multiplicities is taken into account.</description>

      <title>Chemical Fingerprints of M Dwarfs: High-Resolution Spectroscopy on 31 M Dwarfs with SPIRou</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the methodology introduced by Jahandar et al. (2024) to determine the effective temperature and chemical abundances of 31 slowly-rotating solar neighborhood M dwarfs (M1-M5) using high-resolution spectra from CFHT/SPIRou. This group includes 10 M dwarfs in binary systems with FGK primaries of known metallicity from optical measurements. By testing our $T_{\rm eff}$ method on various synthetic models, we find a consistent inherent synthetic uncertainty of $\sim$10 K at a signal-to-noise ratio greater than 100. Additionally, we find that our results align with interferometric measurements, showing a consistent residual of $-$29 $\pm$ 31 K. Taking the inherent uncertainties into account, we infer the $T_{\rm eff}$ values of our targets and find an excellent agreement with previous optical and NIR studies. Our high-resolution chemical analysis examines hundreds of absorption lines using $\chi^2$ minimization using PHOENIX-ACES stellar atmosphere models. We present elemental abundances for up to 10 different elements, including refractory elements such as Si, Mg, and Fe, which are important for modelling the interior structure of exoplanets. In binary systems, we find an average [Fe/H] of $-$0.15 $\pm$ 0.08 for M dwarfs, marginally lower than the reported metallicity of $-$0.06 $\pm$ 0.18 for the FGK primaries from Mann et al. (2013a). We also observe slightly sub-solar chemistry for various elements in our non-binary M dwarfs, most notably for O, C, and K abundances. In particular, we find an average metallicity of $-$0.11 $\pm$ 0.16 lower but still consistent with the typical solar metallicity of FGK stars (e.g. [Fe/H] = 0.04 $\pm$ 0.20 from Brewer et al. 2016). This study highlights significant discrepancies in various major M dwarf surveys likely related to differences in the methodologies employed.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Center-to-Limb systematic in normal-mode-coupling measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar meridional circulation, which manifests as poleward flow near the surface, is a relatively weak flow. While meridional circulation has been measured through various local helioseismic techniques, there is a lack of consensus about the nature of the depth profile and location of return flow, owing to its small amplitude and poor signal-to-noise ratio in observations. The measurements are strongly hampered by systematic effects, whose amplitudes are comparable to the signal induced by the flow and modelling them is therefore crucial. The removal of the center-to-limb systematic, which is the largest known feature hampering the inference of meridional flow, has been heuristically performed in helioseismic analyses, but it's effect on global modes is not fully understood or modelled. Here, we propose both a way to model the center-to-limb systematic and a method for estimation of meridional flow using global helioseismic cross-spectral analysis. We demonstrate that the systematic cannot be ignored while modelling the mode-coupling cross-spectral measurement and thus is critical for the inference of meridional circulation. We also show that inclusion of a model for the center-to-limb systematic improves shallow meridional circulation estimates from cross-spectral analysis.</description>

      <title>Characterising high and low accretion states in VY Scl CVs using ZTF and TESS data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: VY Scl binaries are a sub-class of cataclysmic variable (CV) which show extended low states, but do not show outbursts which are seen in other classes of CV. To better determine how often these systems spend in low states and to resolve the state transitions we have analysed ZTF data on eight systems and TESS data on six systems. Half of the sample spent most of the time in a high state; three show a broad range and one spends roughly half the time transitioning between high and low states. Using the ZTF data we explore the colour variation as a function of brightness. In KR Aur, we identify a series of repeating outburst events whose brightness appears to increase over time. Using TESS data we searched for periods other than the orbital. In LN UMa we find evidence for a peak whose period varies between 3-6 d. We outline the current models which aim to explain the observed properties of VY Scl systems which includes disc irradiation and a white dwarf having a significant magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Temperature and density profiles in the corona of main-sequence stars induced by stochastic heating in the chromosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: All but the most massive main-sequence stars are expected to have a rarefied and hot (million-Kelvin) corona like the Sun. How such a hot corona is formed and supported has not been completely understood yet, even in the case of the Sun. Recently, Barbieri et al. (A&amp;A 2024, J. Plasma Phys. 2024) introduced a new model of a confined plasma atmosphere and applied it to the solar case, showing that rapid, intense, intermittent and short-lived heating events in the high chromosphere can drive the coronal plasma into a stationary state with temperature and density profiles similar to those observed in the solar atmosphere. In this paper we apply the model to main-sequence stars, showing that it predicts the presence of a solar-like hot and rarefied corona for all such stars, regardless of their mass. However, the model is not applicable as such to the most massive main-sequence stars, because the latter lack the convective layer generating the magnetic field loop structures supporting a stationary corona, whose existence is assumed by the model. We also discuss the role of stellar mass in determining the shape of the temperature and density profiles.</description>

      <title>Bidirectional propagating brightenings in arch filament systems observed by Solar Orbiter/EUI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Arch filament systems (AFSs) are chromospheric and coronal manifestations of emerging magnetic flux. Using high spatial resolution observations taken at a high cadence by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on board Solar Orbiter, we identified small-scale elongated brightenings within the AFSs. These brightenings appear as bidirectional flows along the threads of AFSs. For our study, we investigated the coordinated observations of the AFSs acquired by the EUI and the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO on 2022 March 4 and 17. We analyzed 15 bidirectional propagating brightenings from EUI 174 {\AA} images. These brightenings reached propagating speeds of 100-150 km/s. The event observed on March 17 exhibits blob-like structures, which may be signatures of plasmoids and due to magnetic reconnection. In this case, we also observed counterparts in the running difference slit-jaw images in the 1400 {\AA} passbands taken by the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Most events show co-temporal intensity variations in all AIA EUV passbands. Together, this implies that these brightenings in the AFSs are dominated by emission from cool plasma with temperatures well below 1 MK. The magnetograms taken by the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI) on board Solar Orbiter show signatures of flux emergence beneath the brightenings. This suggests that the events in the AFSs are triggered by magnetic reconnection that may occur between the newly emerging magnetic flux and the preexisting magnetic field structures in the middle of the AFSs. This would also give a natural explanation for the bidirectional propagation of the brightenings near the apex of the AFSs. The interaction of the preexisting field and the emerging flux may be important for mass and energy transfer within the AFSs.</description>

      <title>Multi-spacecraft observations of the decay phase of solar energetic particle events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context: Parameters of solar energetic particle (SEP) event profiles such as the onset time and peak time have been researched extensively to obtain information on acceleration and transport of SEPs. Corotation of particle-filled magnetic flux tubes with the Sun is generally thought to play a minor role in determining intensity profiles. However recent simulations have suggested that corotation has an effect on SEP decay phases, depending on the location of the observer with respect to the active region (AR) associated with the event. Aims: We aim to determine whether signatures of corotation are present in observations of decay phases of SEP events and study how the parameters of the decay phase depend on the properties of the flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) associated with the events. Methods: We analyse multi-spacecraft observations of SEP intensity profiles from 11 events between 2020 and 2022, using data from SOLO, PSP, STEREO-A, and SOHO. We determine the decay time constant, \tau in 3 energy channels; electrons ~ 1 MeV, protons ~ 25 MeV, and protons ~ 60 MeV. We study the dependence of \tau on the longitudinal separation, \Delta \phi, between source active region (AR) and the spacecraft magnetic footpoint on the Sun.
  Results: Within individual events there is a tendency for the decay time constant to decrease with increasing $\Delta \phi$, in agreement with test particle simulations. The intensity of the associated flare and speed of the associated CMEs have a strong effect on the measured $\tau$ values and are likely the cause of the observed large inter-event variability.
  Conclusions: We conclude that corotation has a significant effect on the decay phase of a solar energetic particle event and should be included in future simulations and interpretations of these events.</description>

      <title>Rising Near-Ultraviolet Spectra in Stellar Megaflares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flares from M-dwarf stars can attain energies up to $10^4$ times larger than solar flares but are generally thought to result from similar processes of magnetic energy release and particle acceleration. Larger heating rates in the low atmosphere are needed to reproduce the shape and strength of the observed continua in stellar flares, which are often simplified to a blackbody model from the optical to the far-ultraviolet (FUV). The near-ultraviolet (NUV) has been woefully undersampled in spectral observations despite this being where the blackbody radiation should peak. We present Hubble Space Telescope NUV spectra in the impulsive phase of a flare with $E_{\rm{TESS}} \approx 7.5 \times 10^{33}$ erg and a flare with $E_{\rm{TESS}} \approx 10^{35}$ erg and the largest NUV flare luminosity observed to date from an M star. The composite NUV spectra are not well represented by a single blackbody that is commonly assumed in the literature. Rather, continuum flux rises toward shorter wavelengths into the FUV, and we calculate that an optical $T=10^4$ K blackbody underestimates the short wavelength NUV flux by a factor of $\approx 6$. We show that rising NUV continuum spectra can be reproduced by collisionally heating the lower atmosphere with beams of $E \gtrsim 10$ MeV protons or $E \gtrsim 500$ keV electrons and flux densities of $10^{13}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$. These are much larger than canonical values describing accelerated particles in solar flares.</description>

      <title>The emergence of the Md-Macc correlation in the MHD wind scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is still much uncertainty around the mechanism that rules the accretion of proto-planetary disks. In the last years, Magnetohydrondynamic (MHD) wind-driven accretion has been proposed as a valid alternative to the more conventional viscous accretion. In particular, winds have been shown to reproduce the observed correlation between the mass of the disk Md and the mass accretion rate onto the central star Macc, but this has been done only for specific conditions. It is not clear whether this implies fine tuning or if it is a general result. We investigate under which conditions the observed correlation between the mass of the disk Md and the mass accretion rate onto the central star Macc can be obtained. We find that, in the absence of a correlation between the initial mass M0 and the initial accretion timescale tacc,0, the slope of the Md-Macc correlation depends on the value of the spread of the initial conditions of masses and lifetimes of disks. Then, we clarify the conditions under which a disk population can be fitted with a single power-law. Moreover, we derive an analytical expression for the spread of log(Md/Macc) valid when the spread of tacc is taken to be constant. In the presence of a correlation between M0 and tacc,0, we derive an analytical expression for the slope of the Md-Macc correlation in the initial conditions of disks and at late times. We conclude that MHD winds can predict the observed values of the slope and the spread of the Md-Macc correlation under a broad range of initial conditions. This is a fundamental expansion of previous works on the MHD paradigm, exploring the establishment of this fundamental correlation beyond specific initial conditions.</description>

      <title>Type IIn Supernovae. I. Uniform Light Curve Characterization and a Bimodality in the Radiated Energy Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the largest uniform study to date of Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn), focusing in this first paper on the multi-band optical light curves of $487$ SNe IIn. The sample, constructed from multiple surveys, extends to $z \approx 0.8$, with the majority of events at $z \lesssim 0.3$. We construct uniform multi-band and bolometric light curves using Gaussian process regression, and determine key observed properties in the rest-frame (e.g., peak luminosity, timescales, radiated energy). We find that SNe IIn span broad ranges in peak luminosity ($\sim 10^{42}-10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$) and timescales ($\sim 20-300$ days above 50% of peak luminosity), but the sample divides into two clear groups in the luminosity-timescale phase-space around the median peak luminosity ($\approx 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$): faint-fast and luminous-slow groups. This leads to a strong bimodality in the radiated energy distribution, with peaks at $\sim 10^{49}$ and $\sim 2\times10^{50}$ erg, with the latter events having a characteristic timescale of $\sim 100$ days, and the former appearing to bifurcate into two branches with timescales of $\sim 40$ and $\sim 70$ days. Therefore, SNe IIn exhibit at least two dominant groupings, and perhaps three, which are likely reflective of different progenitor and/or circumstellar medium formation pathways. We do not find any obvious transition in SN IIn properties at the arbitrary cut-off of $\approx -20$ mag used for the designation "Type II Superluminous Supernovae", and we argue that this classification should be abandoned. The absence of SNe IIn with timescales of $\lesssim 14$ days defines the region occupied by fast transients with evidence for interaction with hydrogen-poor circumstellar medium.</description>

      <title>The impact of the cosmological constant on past and future star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07301v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an extended analytic model for cosmic star formation, with the aim of investigating the impact of cosmological parameters on the star formation history within the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm. Constructing an ensemble of flat $\Lambda$CDM models where the cosmological constant varies between $\Lambda = 0$ and $10^5$ times the observed value, $\Lambda_{\rm obs}$, we find that the fraction of cosmic baryons that are converted into stars over the entire history of the universe peaks at $\sim$27% for $0.01 \lesssim \Lambda/\Lambda_{\rm obs} \lesssim 1$. We explain, from first principles, that the decline of this asymptotic star-formation efficiency for lower and higher values of $\Lambda$ is driven respectively by the astrophysics of star formation, and by the suppression of cosmic structure formation. However, the asymptotic efficiency declines slowly as $\Lambda$ increases, falling below 5% only for $\Lambda&gt;100 \, \Lambda_{\rm obs}$. Making the minimal assumption that the probability of generating observers is proportional to this efficiency, and following Weinberg in adopting a flat prior on $\Lambda$, the median posterior value of $\Lambda$ is $539 \, \Lambda_{\rm obs}$. Furthermore, the probability of observing $\Lambda\leq \Lambda_{\rm obs}$ is only $0.5\%$. Although this work has not considered recollapsing models with $\Lambda&lt;0$, the indication is thus that $\Lambda_{\rm obs}$ appears to be unreasonably small compared to the predictions of the simplest multiverse ensemble. This poses a challenge for anthropic reasoning as a viable explanation for cosmic coincidences and the apparent fine-tuning of the universe: either the approach is invalid, or more parameters than $\Lambda$ alone must vary within the ensemble.</description>

      <title>Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds I. Numerical Modeling and Evolution to Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07349v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fundamental issue in star formation is understanding the precise mechanisms leading to the formation of prestellar cores, and their subsequent gravitationally unstable evolution. To address this question, we carefully construct a suite of turbulent, self-gravitating numerical simulations, and analyze the development and collapse of individual prestellar cores. We show that the numerical requirements for resolving the sonic scale and internal structure of anticipated cores are essentially the same in self-gravitating clouds, calling for the number of cells per dimension to increase quadratically with the cloud's Mach number. In our simulations, we follow evolution of individual cores by tracking the region around each gravitational potential minimum over time. Evolution in nascent cores is towards increasing density and decreasing turbulence, and there is a wide range of critical density for initiating collapse. At given spatial scale the turbulence level also varies widely, and tends to be correlated with density. By directly measuring the radial forces acting within cores, we identify a distinct transition to a state of gravitational runaway. We use our new theory for turbulent equilibrium spheres to predict the onset of each core's collapse. Instability is expected when the critical radius becomes smaller than the tidal radius; we find good agreement with the simulations. Interestingly, the imbalance between gravity and opposing forces is only $\sim 20\%$ during core collapse, meaning that this is a quasi-equilibrium rather than a free-fall process. For most of their evolution, cores exhibit both subsonic contraction and transonic turbulence inherited from core-building flows; supersonic radial velocities accelerated by gravity only appear near the end of the collapse.</description>

      <title>Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds II. Properties of Critical Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07350v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A fraction of the dense cores that form within a turbulent molecular cloud will eventually collapse, leading to star formation. Identifying the physical criteria for cores to become unstable, and analyzing critical core properties, thus constitutes a necessary step toward the complete theory of star formation. To this end, here we quantify the characteristics of an ensemble of ``critical cores'' that are on the verge of collapse. This critical epoch was identified in a companion paper, which followed the dynamical evolution of prestellar cores in numerical simulations of turbulent, self-gravitating clouds. We find that radial profiles of density and turbulent velocity dispersion constructed for individual critical cores are consistent with our new model for turbulent equilibrium spheres (TESs). While there exists a global linewidth--size relation for a cloud with given size and Mach number, the turbulent scaling relations constructed around each core exhibit significant variations, locally regulating the critical density for a core to become unstable. As a result, there is no single density threshold for collapse, but instead cores collapse at a wide range of densities determined by the local sonic scale, modulated by the local gravitational potential environment, with a distribution expected for TESs with a limited range of turbulent velocity dispersion. The critical cores found in our simulations are mostly transonic; we do not find either purely thermal or highly turbulent cores. We find that the core mass function (CMF) of critical cores peaks around the characteristic mass scale associated with the average properties of a turbulent cloud. We highlight the importance of constructing the CMF at the critical time instead of sink particle mass functions, and derive the resolution requirements to unambiguously identify the peak of the CMF.</description>

      <title>Monitoring of DDO68 'Northern Ring' SF regions during years 2016-2023</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07393v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DDO68 is a star-forming (SF) dwarf galaxy residing in a nearby void. Its gas metallicity is among the lowest known in the local Universe, with parameter 12+log(O/H) in the range of 6.96-7.3 dex. Six of its SF regions are located in or near the so-called 'Northern Ring', in which the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images reveal many luminous young stars. We present for these SF regions (Knots) the results of optical monitoring in 35 epochs during the years 2016--2023. The data was acquired with the 6m (BTA) and the 1m telescopes of the Special Astrophysical Observatory and the 2.5m telescope of the MSU Caucasian Mountain Observatory. We complement the above results with the archive data from 10 other telescopes for 11 epochs during the years 1988-2013 and with 3 our BTA observations between 2005 and 2015. Our goal is to search for variability of these Knots and to relate it to the probable light variations of their brightest stars. One of them, DDO68-V1 (in Knot 3), was identified in 2008 with a luminous blue variable (LBV) star, born in the lowest metallicity environments. For Knot 3, variations of its integrated light in the previous epochs reached ~0.8 mag. In the period since 2016, the amplitude of variations of Knot 3 reached ~0.3 mag. For the rest Knots, due to the lower amplitudes, the manifestation of variability is less pronounced. We examine the presence of variability via the criterion chi^{2} and the Robust Median Statistics and discuss the robustness of the detected variations. The variability is detected according to the both criteria in the lightcurves of all Knots with the chi^{2} confidence level of alpha = 0.0005. The peak-to-peak amplitudes of variations are ~0.09, ~0.13, ~0.11, ~0.08 and ~0.16 mag for Knots 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6, respectively. The amplitudes of the related variations of the brightest supergiants in these regions can reach of ~3.0 mag.</description>

      <title>The Mega-MUSCLES Treasury Survey: X-ray to infrared Spectral Energy Distributions of a representative sample of M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07394v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present 5-1x10^7 Angstrom spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for twelve M dwarf stars covering spectral types M0-M8. Our SEDs are provided for community use as a sequel to the Measurements of the Ultraviolet Spectral Characteristics of Low-mass Exoplanetary Systems (MUSCLES) survey. The twelve stars include eight known exoplanet hosts and four stars chosen to fill out key parameter space in spectral type and rotation period. The SEDs are constructed from Hubble Space Telescope ultraviolet spectroscopy and XMM Newton, Chandra and/or Swift X-ray observations and completed with various model data, including Lyman alpha reconstructions, PHOENIX optical models, APEC coronal models and Differential Emission Measure models in the currently-unobservable Extreme Ultraviolet. We provide a complete overview of the Mega-MUSCLES program, including a description of the observations, models, and SED construction. The SEDs are available as MAST High-Level Science Products and we describe the various data products here. We also present ensemble measurements from our sample that are of particular relevance to exoplanet science, including the high-energy fluxes in the habitable zone and the FUV/NUV ratio. Combined with MUSCLES, Mega-MUSCLES provides SEDs covering a wide range of M\,dwarf spectral types and ages such that suitable proxies for any M dwarf planet host of interest may be found in our sample. However, we find that ultraviolet and X-ray fluxes can vary even between stars with similar parameters, such that observations of each exoplanet host star will remain the gold standard for interpreting exoplanet atmosphere observations.</description>

      <title>Nuclear burning in an accretion flow around a stellar-mass black hole embedded within an AGN disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A stellar-mass black hole, embedded within the accretion disk of an active galactic nuclei (AGN), has the potential to accrete gas at a rate that can reach approximately $\sim 10^9$ times the Eddington limit. This study explores the potential for nuclear burning in the rapidly accreting flow towards this black hole and studies how nucleosynthesis affects metal production. Using numerical methods, we have obtained the disk structure while considering nuclear burning and assessed the stability of the disk. In contrast to gas accretion onto the surface of a neutron star or white dwarf, the disk remains stable against the thermal and secular instabilities because advection cooling offsets the nuclear heating effects. The absence of a solid surface for a black hole prevents excessive mass accumulation in the inner disk region. Notably, nuclear fusion predominantly takes place in the inner disk region, resulting in substantial burning of $\rm ^{12}C$ and $\rm ^{3}He$, particularly for black holes around $M = 10\, M_\odot$ with accretion rates exceeding approximately $\sim 10^7$ times the Eddington rate. The ejection of carbon-depleted gas through outflows can lead to an increase in the mass ratio of oxygen or nitrogen to carbon, which may be reflected in observed line ratios such as $\rm N\, V/C\, IV$ and $\rm O\, IV/C\, IV$. Consequently, these elevated spectral line ratios could be interpreted as indications of super-solar metallicity in the broad line region.</description>

      <title>Radio Follow-up Observations of SN 2023ixf by Japanese and Korean VLBIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on radio follow-up observations of the nearby Type II supernova, SN 2023ixf, spanning from 1.7 to 269.9 days after the explosion, conducted using three very long baseline interferometers (VLBIs), which are the Japanese VLBI Network (JVN), the VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA), and the Korean VLBI Network (KVN). In three observation epochs (152.3, 206.1, and 269.9 days), we detected emission at the 6.9 and 8.4 GHz bands, with a flux density of $\sim 5$ mJy. The flux density reached a peak at around 206.1 days, which is longer than the timescale to reach the peak observed in typical Type II supernovae. Based on the analytical model of radio emission, our late-time detections were inferred to be due to the decreasing optical depth. In this case, the mass-loss rate of the progenitor is estimated to have increased from $\sim 10^{-6} - 10^{-5}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ to $\sim 10^{-4}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ between 28 and 6 years before the explosion. Our radio constraints are also consistent with the mass-loss rate to produce a confined circumstellar medium proposed by previous studies, which suggest that the mass-loss rate increased from $\sim 10^{-4}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ to $\gtrsim 10^{-2}\, M_{\odot}\,{\rm yr^{-1}}$ in the last few years before the explosion.</description>

      <title>Non-parametric identification of single-lined binary candidates in young clusters using single-epoch spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Binarity plays a crucial role in star formation and evolution. Consequently, identifying binary stars is essential to deepen our understanding of these processes. We propose a method to investigate the observed radial velocity distribution of massive stars in young clusters with the goal of identifying binary systems. We reconstruct the radial velocity distribution using a three-layers hierarchical Bayesian non-parametric approach: non-parametric methods are data-driven models able to infer arbitrary probability densities under minimal mathematical assumptions. When applying our statistical framework, it is possible to identify variable stars and binary systems because these deviate significantly from the expected intrinsic Gaussian distribution for radial velocities. We test our method with the massive star forming region within the giant H$_\mathrm{II}$ region M17. We are able to confidently identify binaries and variable stars with as little as single-epoch observations. The distinction between variable and binary stars improves significantly when introducing additional epochs.</description>

      <title>Universal non-thermal power-law distribution functions from the self-consistent evolution of collisionless electrostatic plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Distribution functions of collisionless systems are known to show non-thermal power law tails. Interestingly, collisionless plasmas in various physical scenarios, (e.g., the ion population of the solar wind) feature a $v^{-5}$ tail in the velocity ($v$) distribution, whose origin has been a long-standing mystery. We show this power law tail to be a natural outcome of the self-consistent collisionless relaxation of driven electrostatic plasmas. We perform a quasilinear analysis of the perturbed Vlasov-Poisson equations to show that the coarse-grained mean distribution function (DF), $f_0$, follows a quasilinear diffusion equation with a diffusion coefficient $D(v)$ that depends on $v$ through the plasma dielectric constant. If the plasma is isotropically forced on scales much larger than the Debye length with a white noise-like electric field, then $D(v)\sim v^4$ for $\sigma&lt;v&lt;\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$, with $\sigma$ the thermal velocity, $\omega_{\mathrm{P}}$ the plasma frequency and $k$ the maximum wavenumber of the perturbation; the corresponding $f_0$, in the quasi-steady state, develops a $v^{-\left(d+2\right)}$ tail in $d$ dimensions ($v^{-5}$ tail in 3D), while the energy ($E$) distribution develops an $E^{-2}$ tail irrespective of the dimensionality of space. Any redness of the noise only alters the scaling in the high $v$ end. Non-resonant particles moving slower than the phase-velocity of the plasma waves ($\omega_{\mathrm{P}}/k$) experience a Debye-screened electric field, and significantly less (power law suppressed) acceleration than the near-resonant particles. Thus, a Maxwellian DF develops a power law tail. The Maxwellian core ($v&lt;\sigma$) eventually also heats up, but over a much longer timescale than that over which the tail forms. We definitively show that self-consistency (ignored in test-particle treatments) is crucial for the development of the universal $v^{-5}$ tail.</description>

      <title>Examining the rotation of the planet-hosting M dwarf GJ 3942</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on radial velocities, EXORAP photometry, and activity indicators, the HADES team reported a 16.3-day rotation period for the M dwarf GJ 3942. However, an RV--H$\alpha$ magnitude-squared coherence estimate has significant peaks at frequencies 1/16 cycles/day and 1/32 cycles/day. We re-analyze HADES data plus Hipparcos, SuperWASP, and TESS photometry to see whether the rotation period could be 32 days with 16-day harmonic. SuperWASP shows no significant periodicities, while the Hipparcos observing cadence is suboptimal for detecting 16- and 32-day periodicities. Although the average TESS periodogram has peaks at harmonics of 1/16 cycles/day, the harmonic sequence is not fully resolved according to the Rayleigh criterion. The TESS observations suggest a 1/16 cycles/day rotation frequency and a 1/32 cycles/day subharmonic, though resolution makes the TESS rotation detection ambiguous.</description>

      <title>Double Red Giant Branch and Red Clump features of Galactic disc stellar populations with Gaia GSPspec</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01522v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To disentangle the different competing physical processes at play in Galactic evolution, a detailed chrono chemicalkinematical, and dynamical characterisation of the disc bimodality is necessary, including high number statistics. Here we make use of an extremely precise subsample of the Gaia DR3 GSP-Spec catalogue of stellar chemophysical parameters. The selected database is composed of 408 800 stars with a median uncertainty of 10 K, 0.03 and 0.01 dex in Teff , log(g) and [M/H], respectively. The stellar parameter precision allows to break the age-metallicity degeneracy of disc stars. For the first time, the disc bimodality in the Kiel diagramme of giant stars is observed, getting rid of interstellar absortion issues. This bimodality produces double Red Giant Branch sequences and Red Clump features for mono-metallicity populations. A comparison with BaSTI isochrones allows to demonstrate that an age gap is needed to explain the evolutionary sequences separation, in agreement with previous age-metallicity relations obtained using sub-giant stars. A bimodal distribution in the stellar mass-[alpha/Fe] plane is observed at constant metallicity. Finally, a selection of stars with [M/H]=0.45 \pm 0.03 dex shows that the most metal-rich population in the Milky Way disc presents an important proportion of stars with ages in the range 5-13 Gyr. This old, extremely metal-rich population is possibly a mix of migrated stars from the internal Galactic regions, and old disc stars formed before the last major merger of the Milky Way. The Gaia GSP-Spec Kiel diagrammes of disc mono-abundance stellar populations reveal a complex, non linear age-metallicity relation crafted by internal and external processes of Galactic evolution. Their detailed analysis opens new opportunities to reconstruct the puzzle of the Milky Way disc bimodality.</description>

      <title>Relaxation of weakly collisional plasma: continuous spectra, discrete eigenmodes, and the decay of echoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07992v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relaxation of a weakly collisional plasma, which is of fundamental interest to laboratory and astrophysical plasmas, can be described by the Boltzmann-Poisson equations with the Lenard-Bernstein collision operator. We perform a perturbative analysis of these equations, and obtain exact analytic solutions that resolve long-standing controversies regarding the impact of weak collisions on the continuous spectra, discrete Landau eigenmodes, and the decay of plasma echoes. We retain both damping and diffusion terms in the collision operator. We find that the linear response is a temporal convolution of a continuum that depends on the continuous velocities of particles (crucial for the plasma echo) and discrete modes that describe coherent oscillations of the entire system. The discrete modes are exponentially damped over time due to collective effects or wave-particle interactions (Landau damping) as well as collisional dissipation. The continuum is also damped by collisions, but somewhat differently. Up to a collision time, the inverse of the collision frequency $\nu_{\mathrm{c}}$, the continuum decay is driven by the diffusion of particle velocities and occurs cubic exponentially over a timescale $\sim \nu^{-1/3}_{\mathrm{c}}$. After a collision time, however, the continuum decay is driven by the damping of velocities and diffusion of positions, and occurs exponentially over a timescale $\sim \nu_{\mathrm{c}}$. This slow exponential decay damps perturbations the most on scales $\lambda$ comparable to the mean free path $\lambda_{\mathrm{c}}$, but very slowly on larger scales. This establishes local thermal equilibrium, the essence of the fluid limit, and enhances the detectability of the plasma echo. The long-term decay is driven by the discrete modes for $\lambda&lt;\lambda_{\mathrm{c}}$, but, by the slowly decaying continuum and the least damped mode for $\lambda&gt;\lambda_{\mathrm{c}}$.</description>

      <title>[X/Fe] Marks the Spot: Mapping Chemical Azimuthal Variations in the Galactic Disk with APOGEE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical cartography of the Galactic disk provides insights to its structure and assembly history over cosmic time. In this work, we use chemical cartography to explore chemical gradients and azimuthal substructure in the Milky Way disk with giant stars from APOGEE DR17. We confirm the existence of a radial metallicity gradient in the disk of $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$R $\sim -0.066 \pm 0.0004$ dex/kpc and a vertical metallicity gradient of $\Delta$[Fe/H]/$\Delta$Z $\sim -0.164 \pm 0.001$ dex/kpc. We find azimuthal variations ($\pm0.1$ dex) on top of the radial metallicity gradient that have been previously established with other surveys. The APOGEE giants show strong correlations with stellar age and the intensity of azimuthal variations in iron; older stellar populations show the largest deviations from the radial metallicity gradient. Beyond iron, we show that other elements (e.g., Mg, O) display azimuthal variations at the $\pm0.05$ dex-level across the Galactic disk. We illustrate that moving into the orbit-space could help constrain the mechanisms producing these azimuthal metallicity variations. These results suggest that the spiral arms of the Galaxy are not solely responsible for azimuthal metallicity variations and other Galactic processes are at play.</description>

Abstract: This study aims to assess the potential of the upcoming PLATO mission to investigate exoplanet populations around stars in diverse Galactic environments, specifically focusing on the Milky Way thin disk, thick disk, and stellar halo. We aim to quantify PLATOs ability to detect planets in each environment and determine how these observations could constrain planet formation models. Beginning from the all-sky PLATO Input Catalog, we kinematically classify the 2.4 million FGK stars into their respective Galactic components. For the sub-sample of stars in the long-observation LOPS2 and LOPN1 PLATO fields, we estimate planet occurrence rates using the New Generation Planet Population Synthesis (NGPPS) dataset. Combining these estimates with a PLATO detection efficiency model, we predicted the expected planet yields for each Galactic environment during a nominal 2+2 year mission. Based on our analysis, PLATO is likely to detect at least 400 exoplanets around the alpha-enriched thick disk stars. The majority of those planets are expected to be Super-Earths and Sub-Neptunes with radii between 2 and 10 Earth radii and orbital periods between 2 and 50 days, ideal for studying the link between the radius valley and stellar chemistry. For the metal-poor halo, PLATO is likely to detect between 1 and 80 planets with periods between 10 and 50 days, depending on the potential existence of a metallicity threshold for planet formation. The PLATO fields contain more than 3,400 potential target stars with [Fe/H] &lt; -0.6, which will help to improve our understanding of planets around metal-poor stars. We identify a specific target list of 47 (kinematically classified) halo stars in the high-priority, high-SNR PLATO P1 sample, offering prime opportunities in the search for planets in metal-poor environments.</description>

      <title>Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph (GHOST) at Gemini-South: Instrument performance and integration, first science, and next steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05855v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gemini South telescope is now equipped with a new high-resolution spectrograph called GHOST (the Gemini High-resolution Optical SpecTrograph). This instrument provides high-efficiency, high-resolution spectra covering 347-1060 nm in a single exposure of either one or two targets simultaneously, along with precision radial velocity spectroscopy utilizing an internal calibration source. It can operate at a spectral element resolving power of either 76000 or 56000, and can reach a SNR$\sim$5 in a 1hr exposure on a V$\sim$20.8 mag target in median site seeing, and dark skies (per resolution element). GHOST was installed on-site in June 2022, and we report performance after full integration to queue operations in November 2023, in addition to scientific results enabled by the integration observing runs. These results demonstrate the ability to observe a wide variety of bright and faint targets with high efficiency and precision. With GHOST, new avenues to explore high-resolution spectroscopy have opened up to the astronomical community. These are described, along with the planned and potential upgrades to the instrument.</description>

      <title>Origin of Black Hole Spin in Lower-Mass-Gap Black Hole-Neutron Star Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14476v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During the fourth observing run, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration reported the detection of a coalescing compact binary (GW230529$_{-}$181500) with component masses estimated at $2.5-4.5\, M_\odot$ and $1.2-2.0\, M_\odot$ with 90\% credibility. Given the current constraints on the maximum neutron star (NS) mass, this event is most likely a lower-mass-gap (LMG) black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binary. The spin magnitude of the BH, especially when aligned with the orbital angular momentum, is critical in determining whether the NS is tidally disrupted. An LMG BHNS merger with a rapidly spinning BH is an ideal candidate for producing electromagnetic counterparts. However, no such signals have been detected. In this study, we employ a detailed binary evolution model, incorporating new dynamical tide implementations, to explore the origin of BH spin in an LMG BHNS binary. If the NS forms first, the BH progenitor (He-rich star) must begin in orbit shorter than 0.35 days to spin up efficiently, potentially achieving a spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} &gt; 0.3$. Alternatively, if a non-spinning BH (e.g., $M_{\rm BH} = 3.6\, M_\odot$) forms first, it can accrete up to $\sim 0.2\, M_\odot$ via Case BA mass transfer (MT), reaching a spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} \sim 0.18$ under Eddington-limited accretion. With a higher Eddington accretion limit (i.e., 10.0 $\Dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$), the BH can attain a significantly higher spin magnitude of $\chi_{\rm BH} \sim\,0.65$ by accreting approximately $1.0\, M_\odot$ during Case BA MT phase.</description>

      <title>Evolution of Chemistry in the envelope of HOt CorinoS (ECHOS) II. The puzzling chemistry of isomers as revealed by the HNCS/HSCN ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05517</link>

Abstract: The observational detection of some metastable isomers in the interstellar medium with abundances comparable to those of the most stable isomer, or even when the stable isomer is not detected, highlights the importance of non-equilibrium chemistry. This challenges our understanding of the interstellar chemistry. We present a chemical study of isomers through the sulphur isomer pair HNCS and HSCN, since HSCN has been observed in regions where its stable isomer has not been detected, and the observed HNCS/HSCN ratio seems to significantly vary from cold to warm regions. We have used the Nautilus chemical code to model the formation and destruction paths of HNCS and HSCN in different astrochemical scenarios, and the time evolution of the HNCS/HSCN ratio. We have also analysed the influence of the environmental conditions on their chemical abundances. We present an observational detection of the metastable isomer HSCN in the Class I object B1-a, but not of the stable isomer HNCS, despite HNCS lying 3200 K lower in energy than HSCN. Our results show an HNCS/HSCN ratio sensitive to the gas temperature and the evolutionary time, with the highest values obtained at early stages (t&lt;10^4 yr) and low (Tg&lt;20 K) temperatures. The results suggest a different efficiency of the isomerisation processes depending on the source temperature. The progressive decrease of HNCS/HSCN with gas temperature at early evolutionary times indicates that this ratio may be used as a tracer of cold young objects. This work also demonstrates the key role of grain surface chemistry in the formation of the isomer pair HNCS and HSCN in cold regions, and the importance of the ions H2NCS+ and HNCSH+ in warm/hot regions. Since most of the interstellar regions where HSCN is detected are cold regions, a larger sample including sources characterised by high temperatures are needed to corroborate the theoretical results.</description>
