      <title>The Role of Informal Care in Cognitive Outcome and Healthcare Utilization Among Older Adults with Dementia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper examines the relationship between informal caregiving and both cognitive functioning and healthcare utilization among older adults with dementia. Using data from the RAND version of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS), a nationally representative longitudinal panel of U.S. adults over age 50, covering the years 2010 to 2022, I estimate Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) and Instrumental Variables (IV) models to address potential endogeneity in caregiving decisions. The number of children is employed as an instrument for informal care intensity. While OLS estimates suggest a negative association between informal caregiving and cognition, IV estimates show no significant causal effect after controlling for demographic, socioeconomic, and lagged cognition variables. In contrast, IV results indicate that informal care significantly reduces the likelihood of nursing home use, the number of institutional nights, and the probability of institutionalization. No robust causal effects are found for hospital use, doctor visits, or outpatient surgery, although there is some suggestive evidence of a complementary relationship between informal care and home health services. These findings highlight the role of informal caregiving in substituting for institutional care and underscore its importance in long-term care policy for dementia patients. Keywords: Informal Caregiving; Cognitive Decline; Instrumental Variables; Healthcare Utilization: Dementia Patients.</description>

      <title>Predicting Credit Spreads and Ratings with Machine Learning: The Role of Non-Financial Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We build a 167-indicator comprehensive credit risk indicator set, integrating macro, corporate financial, bond-specific indicators, and for the first time, 30 large-scale corporate non-financial indicators. We use seven machine learning models to construct a bond credit spread prediction model, test their spread predictive power and economic mechanisms, and verify their credit rating prediction effectiveness. Results show these models outperform Chinese credit rating agencies in explaining credit spreads. Specially, adding non-financial indicators more than doubles their out-of-sample performance vs. traditional feature-driven models. Mechanism analysis finds non-financial indicators far more important than traditional ones (macro-level, financial, bond features)-seven of the top 10 are non-financial (e.g., corporate governance, property rights nature, information disclosure evaluation), the most stable predictors. Models identify high-risk traits (deteriorating operations, short-term debt, higher financing constraints) via these indicators for spread prediction and risk identification. Finally, we pioneer a credit rating model using predicted spreads (predicted implied rating model), with full/sub-industry models achieving over 75% accuracy, recall, F1. This paper provides valuable guidance for bond default early warning, credit rating, and financial stability.</description>

      <title>Concentration-Based Inference for Evaluating Horizontal Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.12924v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antitrust authorities routinely rely on market concentration measures to assess the potential adverse effects of mergers on consumer welfare. Using a first-order approximation argument with logit and CES demand, I derive the relationship between the welfare effect of a merger on consumer surplus and the change in the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI). My results suggest that merger harm is correlated with the merger-induced change in HHI, and the proportionality coefficient depends on the price responsiveness parameter, market size, and the distribution of market shares within and across the merging firms. I present numerical validation of my formula along with an empirical illustration.</description>

      <title>General Social Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17407v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Useful social science theories predict behavior across settings. However, applying a theory to make predictions in new settings is challenging: rarely can it be done without ad hoc modifications to account for setting-specific factors. We argue that AI agents put in simulations of those novel settings offer an alternative for applying theory, requiring minimal or no modifications. We present an approach for building such "general" agents that use theory-grounded natural language instructions, existing empirical data, and knowledge acquired by the underlying AI during training. To demonstrate the approach in settings where no data from that data-generating process exists--as is often the case in applied prediction problems--we design a heterogeneous population of 883,320 novel games. AI agents are constructed using human data from a small set of conceptually related but structurally distinct "seed" games. In preregistered experiments, on average, agents predict initial human play in a random sample of 1,500 games from the population better than (i) a cognitive hierarchy model, (ii) game-theoretic equilibria, and (iii) out-of-the-box agents. For a small set of separate novel games, these simulations predict responses from a new sample of human subjects better even than the most plausibly relevant published human data.</description>

      <title>Economic Complexity Alignment and Sustainable Development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17919v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Economic complexity has been linked to sustainability outcomes, such as income inequality and greenhouse gas emissions. Yet, it is unclear whether the pursuit of complex and/or related activities naturally aligns with these outcomes, or whether meeting sustainability goals requires policy interventions that pursue unrelated diversification. Here, we exploit multidimensional social and environmental sustainability indicators to quantify the alignment between a country's closest diversification opportunities and sustainability goals. We find that high- and upper-middle-income countries face significantly better environmentally aligned diversification opportunities than poorer economies. This means that, while richer countries enjoy diversification opportunities that align complexity, relatedness and environmental performance, this alignment is weaker for developing economies. These findings underscore the value of evaluating future diversification trajectories through a multidimensional sustainability framework, and emphasise the strategic relevance of unrelated diversification for less developed economies to foster sustainable development.</description>
