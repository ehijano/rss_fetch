      <title>On the Collatz Conjecture: Topological and Ergodic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Collatz function famously related to the Collatz Conjecture under the topological and ergodic perpectives, including an approach with thermodynamic formalism. By introducing a key topology and its Borel $\sigma$-algebra we show that recurrence implies periodicity. Moreover, we estabilsh that the set of periodic orbits is finite if, and only if, every continuous potential possesses some equilibrium state. The uniqueness of periodic orbits is equivalent to the uniqueness of equiilbrium state for every bounded and continuous potential.</description>

      <title>Heteroclinic networks in coupled cell systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A coupled cell system is an ODE system associated with a coupled cell network, where the dimension is determined by the number of cells. A heteroclinic connection is a set of solution trajectories between two equilibria of an ODE system. A realization of a heteroclinic network is an ODE system that exhibits equilibria corresponding to the nodes and heteroclinic connections between them according to the heteroclinic network. This paper investigates the realization of heteroclinic networks within coupled cell systems, focusing on embedding heteroclinic connections in 2D and 3D invariant subspaces. We adapt Field's method of embedding each heteroclinic connection in distinct 2D synchrony subspaces to support multiple connections within the same subspace. Using the concept of book embedding from graph theory, we demonstrate that any heteroclinic network can be realized using a coupled cell system with a number of cells proportional to the network's book-thickness. Additionally, we extend our analysis to 3D synchrony subspaces, allowing for more complex realizations. In this case, the number of cells necessary for a realization is proportional to the number of nodes in the heteroclinic network.</description>

      <title>On semi-openness of fiber-onto extensions of minimal semiflows and quasi-separable maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to finding conditions for a continuous surjection $\phi\colon X\rightarrow Y$ between compact Hausdorff spaces and its induced affine map $\phi_*\colon\mathcal{M}^1(X)\rightarrow\mathcal{M}^1(Y)$ between the regular Borel probability spaces to be semi-open. For that, we mainly prove the following by using the structure theory of extensions of semiflows and inverse limit technique:
  (1) If $\phi$ is an extension of minimal flows, then $\phi$ and $\phi_*$ are both semi-open.
  (2) If $\phi$ is a quasi-separable extension of minimal semiflows with $X$ is $\phi$-fiber-onto, then $\phi$ and $\phi_*$ are both semi-open.
  (3) If $Y$ is metrizable, then $\phi$ is semi-open if and only if $\phi_*$ is semi-open.
  (4) If $\phi$ is quasi almost 1-1, then $\phi$ and $\phi_*$ are both semi-open.</description>

      <title>Complex potentials and holomorphic differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complex potential is a holomorphic function $\Omega:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ whose real and imaginary parts generate a pair of orthogonal foliations, representing the equipotential lines and the streamlines of $\dot{z} = \overline{\Omega'(z)}$. In this work, we generalize the concept of potential to the broader class of dynamical systems of the form $\dot{z} = f(z)$, with $f:\mathbb{C} \to \mathbb{C}$ holomorphic. The resulting potential induces a rectification mapping providing a natural framework for the topological classification of phase portraits of planar polynomial vector fields. The existence of complex potentials serves as a powerful tool in addressing fundamental problems, such as the establishment of bounds for the number of limit cycles in piecewise-smooth systems, and the local configuration of curvature lines around umbilic points, among others.</description>

      <title>Approximating stable translation lengths on fine curve graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the stable translation length of homeomorphisms of a surface acting on the fine nonseparating curve graph and compare it to the stable translation lengths of its finite approximations - mapping classes relative to a finite invariant set - acting on the nonseparating curve graph. We prove that the stable translation length of a homeomorphism with a dense set of periodic points is the supremum of the stable translation lengths of its approximations, and that the stable translation length is preserved under cell-like extensions. We deduce that homotopically triv ial homeomorphisms of the torus have stable translation length which is the supremum of the stable translation lengths of their finite approximations. We show that the supremum is not always a maximum, by proving that the stable translation length of a mapping class acting on the nonseparating curve graph is rational.</description>

      <title>On exponential stability of linear and nonlinear delay differential equations: a review and new results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An extensive overview of existing criteria, as well as some new uniform exponential stability tests are included for a scalar delay equation $$ \dot{x}(t)+ \sum_{j=1}^n a_j(t)x(h_j(t))=0. $$ Both cases of continuous and measurable parameters $h_j$, $a_j$ are explored.
  We apply the global linearisation approach and employ linear results to explore global exponential stability for nonlinear models of the form $$ \dot{x}(t)+\sum_{j=1}^n f_j\left( t,x(h_j(t)) \right) =0. $$ The proofs are based on solution estimations. Further, the Bohl-Perron theorem on exponential dichotomy is instrumental for establishing global exponential stability for nonlinear models. Conclusions are illustrated with numerical examples.</description>

      <title>On average population levels for models with directed diffusion in heterogeneous environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2006 (J. Differential Equ.), Lou proved that, once the intrinsic growth rate $r$ in the logistic model is proportional to the spatially heterogeneous carrying capacity $K$ ($r=K^1$), the total population under the regular diffusion exceeds the total of the carrying capacity. He also conjectured that the dependency of the total population on the diffusion coefficient is unimodal, increasing to its maximum and then decreasing to the asymptote which is the total of the carrying capacity. DeAngelis et al (J. Math. Biol. 2016) argued that the prevalence of the population over the carrying capacity is only observed when the growth rate and the carrying capacity are positively correlated, at least for slow dispersal. Guo et al (J. Math. Biol. 2020) justified that, once $r$ is constant ($r=K^0$), the total population is less than the cumulative carrying capacity. Our paper fills up the gap for when $r=K^{\lambda}$ for any real $\lambda$, disproving an assumption that there is a critical $\lambda^{\ast} \in (0,1)$ at which the tendency of the prevalence of the carrying capacity over the total population size changes, demonstrating instead that the relationship is more complicated. In addition, we explore the dependency of the total population size on the diffusion coefficient when the third parameter of the dispersal strategy $P$ is involved: the diffusion term is $d \Delta(u/P)$, not just $d \Delta u$, for any $\lambda$. We outline some differences from the random diffusion case, in particular, concerning the profile of the total population as a function of the diffusion coefficient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if a recursively presented group admits a (nonempty) subshift of finite type with nonzero Medvedev degree then it fails to have the strong topological Rokhlin property. This result simplifies a known criterion and provides new examples of recursively presented groups without this property.</description>

      <title>Optimal Harvesting of a Stochastic Lotka-Volterra Competition Model with Periodic Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03557</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03557v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper systematically investigates the optimal harvesting of a stochastic Lotka-Volterra competition model with periodic coefficients. Sufficient conditions for the extinction and persistence in the time average of each species are established. Using Khasminskii's stability theory with suitable Lyapunov functions, we establish sufficient conditions to guarantee the existence of positive periodic solutions to the model. Under certain assumptions, the stability in distribution of this model is proved. Then, we obtain the existence of an optimal harvesting policy and provide explicit expressions for the optimal harvesting effort and the maximum sustainable yield. Finally, we demonstrate our key findings numerically using the Euler-Maruyama method implemented in Python.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove quantitative polynomial Wiener-Wintner theorems in a very general setup, including measure-preserving actions of nilpotent Lie groups. Our results apply both to ergodic averages and to averages with singular integral weights. The proof relies on the generalized polynomial Carleson theorem developed in the companion paper by van Doorn, Srivastava, and the authors.</description>

      <title>On Constructions of full-dimensional absolutely normal sets of uniqueness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a class of homogeneous Cantor-Moran measures with all contraction ratios being reciprocal of integers, and prove that they are pointwise absolutely normal. Our approach relies on methods developed by Davenport, Erd{\H{o}}s, and LeVeque \cite{DEL1963} and properties of the order of integers in the multiplicative groups. The construction of these measures differs from the class of pointwise absolutely normal self-similar measures introduced by Hochman and Shmerkin \cite{Hochman2015}, in which dynamical approaches were used.
  As an application, for all gauge functions $\varphi(r)$ with $r/\varphi(r)\to 0$ as $r\to 0$, we obtain a set of uniqueness $K$ with ${\mathcal H}^{\varphi}(K)&gt;0$. Moreover, we show that there exists a pointwise absolutely normal measure $ \mu $ of dimension one fully supported on $K$. The result demonstrates that having a lot of absolutely normal numbers in a Cantor set, even with dimension one, cannot guarantee that it supports a measure with Fourier decay. It also shows that the ${\mathsf{DEL}}$ criterion being satisfied for all integers does not guarantee any Fourier decay nor the supporting set is a set of multiplicity.</description>

      <title>A disease-spread model on hypergraphs with distinct droplet and aerosol transmission modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the spread of an infectious disease, such as one that is caused by a respiratory virus, with two distinct modes of transmission. To do this, we consider a susceptible--infected--susceptible (SIS) disease on a hypergraph, which allows us to incorporate the effects of both dyadic (i.e., pairwise) and polyadic (i.e., group) interactions on disease propagation. This disease can spread either via large droplets through direct social contacts, which we associate with edges (i.e., hyperedges of size 2), or via infected aerosols in the environment through hyperedges of size at least 3 (i.e., polyadic interactions). We derive mean-field approximations of our model for two types of hypergraphs, and we obtain threshold conditions that characterize whether the disease dies out or becomes endemic. Additionally, we numerically simulate our model and a mean-field approximation of it to examine the impact of various factors, such as hyperedge size (when the size is uniform), hyperedge-size distribution (when the sizes are nonuniform), and hyperedge-recovery rates (when the sizes are nonuniform) on the disease dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existence, uniqueness and classification is established for plane waves supported by an irreversible reaction which is a smooth function of local reactant and product concentrations (or prey and predator populations). Rudimentary analytic techniques are used to guarantee a unique plane wave at every wavespeed $V&gt;V_*$ above some threshold. The result readily extends to cutoff reactions, which are zero below some threshold product concentration. These results are not novel, but the method of proof is.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Gamma\subset \mathsf{PSL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ be a lattice and $\rho:\Gamma\to \mathsf{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{R})$ be a maximal representation. We show that $\rho$ satisfies a measurable $(1,1,2)-$hypertransversality condition. With this we define a measurable Gromov product and the Bowen-Margulis-Sullivan measure associated to the unstable Jacobian introduced by Pozzetti, Sambarino and Wienhard. As a main application, we prove a strong entropy rigidity result for $\rho$.</description>

      <title>On generalized Namioka spaces and joint continuity of functions on product of spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A space $X$ is called "a generalized Namioka space" (g.$\mathcal{N}$-space) if for every compact space $Y$ and every separately continuous function $f\colon X\times Y\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$, there exists at least one point $x\in X$ such that $f$ is jointly continuous at each point of $\{x\}\times Y$. We principally prove the following results: (1) $X$ is a g.$\mathcal{N}$-space, if $X$ is a non-meager open subspace of the product of a family of separable spaces or a family of pseudo-metric spaces; (2) if $Y$ is a non-meager space and $X_i$, for each $i\in I$, is a $W$-space of Grunhage with a rich family of non-meager subspaces, then $Y\times \prod_{i\in I}X_i$ is non-meager; and (3) if $X_i$, for each $i\in I$, is a non-meager space with a countable pseudo-base, then $\prod_{i\in I}X_i$ is non-meager and its tail set having the property of Baire is either meager or residual. In particular, if $G$ is a non-meager g.$\mathcal{N}$ right-topological group and $X$ a locally compact regular space, or, if $G$ is a separable first countable non-meager right-topological group and $X$ a countably compact space, then any separately continuous action $G\curvearrowright X$ is jointly continuous.</description>

      <title>The Choreography of Geodesics in SOL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a self-contained geometric description of the geodesic flow in the three-dimensional Lie group $\mathrm{Sol}$, one of Thurston's eight model geometries. The geometry of geodesics is governed by a single invariant $k\in[0,1]$, its modulus. Generic geodesics spiral around an axis, with well-defined amplitude $A(k)$, period $T(k)$, and horizontal drift $H(k)$. We characterize minimal geodesic segments and the cut locus, and obtain an asymptotic estimate showing that distances between points at the same altitude grow logarithmically. This work builds on previous work by Grayson and Coiculescu--Schwartz, but develops an alternative geometric and dynamical viewpoint.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we study the structure of the difference set $E - E$ for subsets $E \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ of positive upper Banach density. In [Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 146 (2018), 3449-3453, Problem 2] Fish asked whether, for every such set $E$, there exists a nonzero integer $k$ such that \[ k \cdot \mathbb{Z} \subseteq \{\, xy : (x,y) \in E - E \,\}. \] Although this question remains open, we establish a relatively weaker form of this conjecture. Specifically, we prove that there exist infinitely many integers $k \in \mathbb{Z}$ and a sequence $\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}$ in $\mathbb{Z}$ such that \[ k \cdot FS(\langle x_n \rangle_{n \in \mathbb{N}}) \subseteq \{\, xy : (x,y) \in E - E \,\}, \] where $FS(\langle x_n \rangle)$ denotes the finite sums set generated by the sequence.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of Generalized Furstenberg Boundaries and Applications to Intermediate Crossed Products</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03952v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a relative boundary theory for actions of discrete groups on compact spaces and use it to derive rigidity results for reduced crossed products. For a discrete group $\Gamma$ acting on a compact space $X$ and a subgroup $H$, we construct a universal boundary over $X$ which is minimal as a $\Gamma$-system and strongly proximal with respect to $H$. When $H\le_c\Gamma$ is commensurated and the $H$-action on $X$ is minimal, we show that this universal boundary agrees, in a canonical $\Gamma$-equivariant way, with the generalized Furstenberg boundary of $(H,X)$, thereby unifying and extending earlier results on relative boundaries.
  As an application, we introduce the notion of an $X$-plump subgroup given a $\Gamma$-space $X$, a generalized version of plumpness tailored to crossed products. Under natural dynamical hypotheses, this leads to new examples of irreducible $C^*$-inclusions. Under additional assumptions, we also show that every intermediate $C^*$-algebra is a crossed product.</description>

      <title>Multi-Dimensional Opinion Formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we propose and investigate a multi-dimensional opinion dynamics model where people are characterised by both opinions and importance weights across these opinions. Opinion changes occur through binary interactions, with a novel coupling mechanism: the change in one topic depends on the weighted similarity across the full opinion vector. We state the kinetic equation for this process and derive its mean-field partial differential equation to describe the overall dynamics. Analytical computations and numerical simulations confirm that this model generates complex stationary states, and we demonstrate that the final opinion structures are critically determined by the peoples' opinion weights.</description>

      <title>Time Reparametrization and Chaotic Dynamics in Conformable $C_0$-Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conformable derivatives provide a fractional-looking calculus that remains local and admits a simple representation through classical derivatives with explicit weights. In this paper we develop a systematic operator-theoretic perspective showing that conformable time evolution is, in essence, a classical $C_0$-semigroup observed through a nonlinear clock. We introduce the conformable time map $\psi(t)=t^\alpha/\alpha$ and prove that every $C_0$--$\alpha$-semigroup $\{T_\alpha(t)\}_{t\ge0}$ can be written as $T_\alpha(t)=T(\psi(t))$ for a uniquely determined classical $C_0$-semigroup $\{T(s)\}_{s\ge0}$, with generators agreeing on a common domain. This correspondence yields a one-to-one transfer of mild solutions and shows that orbit-based linear dynamics are invariant under conformable reparametrization. In particular, $\alpha$-hypercyclicity and $\alpha$--chaos coincide with the usual notions for the associated classical semigroup. As a consequence, we obtain a conformable version of the Desch--Schappacher--Webb spectral criterion for chaos. We also place the analysis in the natural functional setting provided by conformable Lebesgue spaces $L^{p,\alpha}$ and their explicit isometric identification with standard $L^p$ spaces, which allows one to transport estimates and spectral arguments without loss. The results clarify which dynamical phenomena in conformable models are genuinely new and which are inherited from classical semigroup dynamics via a nonlinear change of time.</description>

Abstract: In this work we give a full characterization of sets of multiple polynomial recurrence in Weyl systems, which are ergodic unipotent affine transformations on products of tori and finite abelian groups. In particular, we show that measurable and topological recurrence in Weyl systems coincide. Our analysis also yields a structure theorem for polynomial multicorrelation sequences in Weyl systems. These results stem from an in-depth study of the Weyl complexity of a set of polynomials and the introduction of a new concept: the \textit{Weyl polynomials} generated by a set of polynomials.</description>

      <title>Design of Cycles by Impulsive Feedback: Application to Discrete Dosing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.22417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task of maintaining a predefined level of effect in a dynamical plant by applying periodic control actions often arises in e.g. process control and medicine. When the state variables of the plant represent the concentrations of chemical substances and the control action constitutes an instantaneous introduction of a certain quantity of a chemical or drug, this control setup is referred to as a (discrete) dosing problem. The present paper examines an amplitude- and frequency-modulated impulsive controller that, under stationary conditions, generates a desired sequence of uniform and equidistant control impulses based on continuous measurements of the output of a smooth positive nonlinear time-invariant single-input single-output plant with Wiener structure. The controller design method is based on constructing and stabilizing the fixed point of a discrete map that describes the evolution of the state vector of the continuous plant between successive impulsive control action instants. Stability of the fixed point ensures the existence of a basin of attraction along the stationary trajectory, where the solution of a perturbed closed-loop system converges to the stationary solution. The convergence rate is determined by the slopes of the amplitude and frequency modulation functions of the impulsive controller. The proposed controller is applied to the dosing of the drug \emph{atracurium} in closed-loop neuromuscular blockade, and its performance is evaluated on a database of patient-specific pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic models estimated from clinical data. It is demonstrated that an implementation of the standard regimen as a pulse-modulated feedback controller significantly minimizes the incidence of underdosing events.</description>

      <title>Tipping Point Forecasting in Non-Stationary Dynamics on Function Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.08794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tipping points are abrupt, drastic, and often irreversible changes in the evolution of non-stationary and chaotic dynamical systems. For instance, increased greenhouse gas concentrations are predicted to lead to drastic decreases in low cloud cover, referred to as a climatological tipping point. In this paper, we learn the evolution of such non-stationary dynamical systems using a novel recurrent neural operator (RNO), which learns mappings between function spaces. After training RNO on only the pre-tipping dynamics, we employ it to detect future tipping points using an uncertainty-based approach. In particular, we propose a conformal prediction framework to forecast tipping points by monitoring deviations from physics constraints (such as conserved quantities and partial differential equations), enabling forecasting of these abrupt changes along with a rigorous measure of uncertainty. We illustrate our proposed methodology on non-stationary ordinary and partial differential equations, such as the Lorenz-63 and Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations. We also apply our methods to forecast a climate tipping point in stratocumulus cloud cover and airfoil wake and stall transitions using only limited knowledge of the governing equations. For the latter, we show that our proposed method zero-shot generalizes to forecasting multiple future tipping points under varying Reynolds numbers. In our experiments, we demonstrate that even partial or approximate physics constraints can be used to accurately forecast future tipping points.</description>

      <title>Global Dynamics of Granular Media Equations via Stochastic Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01364v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the rich dynamics of one-dimensional granular media equations with attractive quadratic interactions. Building on the monotone dynamical systems framework developed in an earlier work, we allow for multiplicative noise, in contrast to most existing results restricted to additive noise. Within this framework, we show that, in the one-dimensional setting, invariant measures are totally ordered with respect to the stochastic order. The basins of attraction of the minimal and maximal invariant measures contain unbounded open sets in the 2-Wasserstein space, which is vacant in previous research even for additive noises. Also, our main results address the global convergence to the order interval enclosed by the minimal and maximal invariant measures, and an alternating arrangement of invariant measures in terms of stability (locally attracting) and instability (as the backward limit of a connecting orbit). Our theorems cover a wide range of classical granular media equations, such as double-well and multi-well landscapes. Specific values for the parameter ranges, explicit descriptions of attracting sets and phase diagrams are provided.</description>

Abstract: The problems that we consider in this paper are as follows. Let $A_1, \ldots, A_k$ be square matrices (over reals). Let $W=w(A_1, \ldots, A_k)$ be a random product of $n$ matrices. What is the expected absolute value of the largest (in the absolute value) entry in such a random product? What is the (maximal) Lyapunov exponent for a random matrix product like that? We give a complete answer to the first question. For the second question, we offer a very simple and efficient method to produce an upper bound on the Lyapunov exponent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01868v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a mathematical framework that interprets Transformer attention as an interacting particle system and studies its continuum (mean-field) limits. By idealizing attention on the sphere, we connect Transformer dynamics to Wasserstein gradient flows, synchronization models (Kuramoto), and mean-shift clustering. Central to our results is a global clustering phenomenon whereby tokens cluster asymptotically after long metastable states where they are arranged into multiple clusters. We further analyze a tractable equiangular reduction to obtain exact clustering rates, show how commonly used normalization schemes alter contraction speeds, and identify a phase transition for long-context attention. The results highlight both the mechanisms that drive representation collapse and the regimes that preserve expressive, multi-cluster structure in deep attention architectures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12966v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider random walks on the isometry groups of general metric spaces. Under some mild conditions, we show that if two non-elementary random walks on a discrete subgroup of the isometry group have non-singular stationary measures, then subgroups generated by the random walks are commensurable. This result in particular applies to separable Gromov hyperbolic spaces and Teichm\"uller spaces. As a specific application, we prove singularity between stationary measures associated to random walks on different fiber subgroups of the fundamental group of a hyperbolic 3-manifold fibering over the circle.</description>

      <title>Allostery Beyond Amplification: Temporal Regulation of Signaling Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.01850v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Allostery is a fundamental mechanism of protein regulation and is commonly interpreted as modulating enzymatic activity or product abundance. Here we show that this view is incomplete. Using a stochastic model of allosteric regulation combined with an information-theoretic analysis, we quantify the mutual information between an enzyme's regulatory state and the states of downstream signaling components. Beyond controlling steady-state production levels, allostery also regulates the timing and duration over which information is transmitted. By tuning the temporal operating regime of signaling pathways, allosteric regulation enables distinct dynamical outcomes from identical molecular components, providing a physical mechanism for temporal information flow, signaling specificity, and coordination without changes in metabolic pathways.</description>
