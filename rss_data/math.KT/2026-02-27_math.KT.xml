      <title>Uniformly elliptic boundary value problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study boundary conditions for elliptic operators on non-compact manifolds with boundary via uniform K-homology, a version of K-homology sensitive to the large-scale geometry of the manifold. To that end, we develop the theory of relative uniform K-homology. We show that boundary conditions for uniformly elliptic differential operators define classes in the relative and non-relative uniform K-homology of the manifold, depending on the assumed regularity of the boundary condition. Moreover, we define and study a relative index map on relative uniform K-homology that combines uniform coarse information on the interior with secondary information on the boundary. As an application, we compute that on a spin manifold with product structure and uniformly positive scalar curvature on the boundary the image of the relative uniform K-homology class of the Dirac operator under this relative index map is closely connected to a uniform version of the higher $\rho$-invariant of the boundary. In particular, a delocalized APS-index theorem of Piazza and Schick is proved in the uniform setting.</description>

      <title>Mayer--Vietoris and Twisted \v{C}ech Spectral Sequences for C$^*$-Algebras with Free Quantum Group Coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate a Mayer--Vietoris/\v{C}ech viewpoint on $K$-theory for crossed products by discrete quantum groups, emphasizing how local-to-global gluing data interacts with quantum-group coefficients. Starting from a $G$-equivariant ideal cover and the associated Mayer--Vietoris six-term exact sequence, we package the resulting $K$-theoretic computation into a \v{C}ech-type spectral sequence whose $E^1$-page is explicitly described by iterated intersections. We then introduce a minimal ``twisted'' gluing mechanism controlled by a $\mathbb Z/2$-valued \v{C}ech $2$-cocycle and an involutive automorphism of the coefficient algebra. Under a Kirchberg--UCT hypothesis on the quantum-group crossed-product coefficient, the twist produces a nontrivial differential $d_2$ identified as $\varphi_*-\mathrm{id}$ on coefficient $K$-theory. In a concrete regime where the coefficient $K$-groups are cyclic (e.g.\ order $3$), the differential becomes an isomorphism and forces a $K$-theoretic obstruction to Morita triviality. This yields a conceptual mechanism for producing non-Morita-trivial twisted C$^*$-algebras with quantum-group crossed-product fibers, detected purely by Mayer--Vietoris/\v{C}ech data.</description>

      <title>Noncommutative coarse metric geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.23080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.23080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by coarse geometry and the classical role of Roe algebras as large-scale invariants of proper metric spaces, we show that proper quantum metric spaces as introduced by Latr\'emoli\`ere are noncommutative coarse spaces. This further allows us to develop a bridge between Latr\'emoli\`ere's framework and the W*-metric approach to quantum metric spaces. Furthermore, we construct Roe algebras for locally compact quantum metric spaces and verify that they recover the classical Roe algebras in the commutative case. We furthermore apply this framework to some examples of locally compact quantum metric spaces and show that it leads to the natural conclusion. Finally we use this framework to introduce notions of higher index theory for locally compact quantum metric spaces.</description>
