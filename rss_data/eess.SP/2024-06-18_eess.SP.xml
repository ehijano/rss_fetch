      <title>A Rao-Blackwellized Particle Filter for Superelliptical Extended Target Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10389v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new method to track extended targets of different shapes such as ellipses, rectangles and rhombi. We provide an analytical framework to express these shapes as superelliptical contours and propose a Bayesian filtering scheme that can handle measurements from the contour of the object. The method utilizes the Rao-Blackwellized particle filtering algorithm with novel sensor-object geometry constraints. The success of the algorithm is demonstrated using both simulations and real-data experiments, and the algorithm has been demonstrated to be of high performance in various challenging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communication for Edge Intelligence Enabled Autonomous Driving System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Expected to provide higher transportation efficiency and security, autonomous driving has attracted substantial attentions from both industry and academia. Meanwhile, the emergence of edge intelligence has further introduced significant advancements to this field. However, the crucial demands of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (URLLC) among the vehicles and edge servers have hindered the development of autonomous driving. In this article, we provide a brief overview of edge intelligence enabled autonomous driving system and current vehicle-to-everything (V2X) technologies. Moreover, challenges associated with massive data transmission in autonomous driving are highlighted from three perspectives: multi-modal data transmission and fusion, multi-user collaboration and connection, and multi-task training and execution. To cope with these challenges, we propose to incorporate semantic communication into autonomous driving to achieve highly efficient and task-oriented data transmission. Unlike traditional communications, semantic communication extracts task-relevant semantic feature from multi-sensory data. Specifically, a unified multi-user semantic communication system for transmitting multi-modal data and performing multi-task execution is designed for collaborative data transmission and decision making in autonomous driving. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed system can significantly reduce data transmission volume without compromising task performance, as evidenced by the realization of a cooperative multi-vehicle target classification and detection task.</description>

      <title>Notch Filters without Transient Effects: A Constrained Optimization Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10706</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transient responses are an inherent property of recursive filters due to unknown or incorrectly selected initial conditions. Well-designed stable filters are less affected by transient responses, as the impact of initial conditions diminishes over time. However, applications that require very short data acquisition periods (for example, as short as ten seconds), such as biosignals recorded and processed by wearable technologies, can be significantly impacted by transient effects. But how feasible is it to design filters without transient responses?
  We propose a well-known filter design scheme based on constrained least squares (CLS) optimization to create zero-transient effect notch filters for powerline noise cancellation. We demonstrate that this filter is equivalent to the optimal Wiener smoother in the stationary case. We also discuss its limitations in removing powerline noise with nonstationary amplitude, where a Kalman filter-based formulation can be used instead.</description>

      <title>Linear Inverse Problems Using a Generative Compound Gaussian Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since most inverse problems arising in scientific and engineering applications are ill-posed, prior information about the solution space is incorporated, typically through regularization, to establish a well-posed problem with a unique solution. Often, this prior information is an assumed statistical distribution of the desired inverse problem solution. Recently, due to the unprecedented success of generative adversarial networks (GANs), the generative network from a GAN has been implemented as the prior information in imaging inverse problems. In this paper, we devise a novel iterative algorithm to solve inverse problems in imaging where a dual-structured prior is imposed by combining a GAN prior with the compound Gaussian (CG) class of distributions. A rigorous computational theory for the convergence of the proposed iterative algorithm, which is based upon the alternating direction method of multipliers, is established. Furthermore, elaborate empirical results for the proposed iterative algorithm are presented. By jointly exploiting the powerful CG and GAN classes of image priors, we find, in compressive sensing and tomographic imaging problems, our proposed algorithm outperforms and provides improved generalizability over competitive prior art approaches while avoiding performance saturation issues in previous GAN prior-based methods.</description>

      <title>Integrating sensing and communications: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting digital coding metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless networks are undergoing a transformative shift, driven by the crucial factors of cost effectiveness and sustainability. Digital coding metasurfaces (DCMs) might play a key role in realizing cost-effective digital modulators by harnessing energy embedded in electromagnetic waves traversing through the air. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) optimize power and spectral resources by combining sensing and communication functionalities on a shared hardware platform. This article presents a tutorial-style overview of the applications and advantages of DCMs in ISAC-based networks. Emphasis is placed on the dual-functionality of ISAC, necessitating the design of DCMs with simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) capabilities for comprehensive space control. Additionally, the article explores key signal processing challenges and outlines future research directions stemming from the convergence of ISAC and emerging STAR-DCM technologies.</description>

      <title>Digital Wireless Image Transmission via Distribution Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (JSCC) is emerging as a potential technology to meet the demand for effective data transmission, particularly for image transmission. Nevertheless, most existing advancements only consider analog transmission, where the channel symbols are continuous, making them incompatible with practical digital communication systems. In this work, we address this by involving the modulation process and consider mapping the continuous channel symbols into discrete space. Recognizing the non-uniform distribution of the output channel symbols in existing methods, we propose two effective methods to improve the performance. Firstly, we introduce a uniform modulation scheme, where the distance between two constellations is adjustable to match the non-uniform nature of the distribution. In addition, we further design a non-uniform modulation scheme according to the output distribution. To this end, we first generate the constellations by performing feature clustering on an analog image transmission system, then the generated constellations are employed to modulate the continuous channel symbols. For both schemes, we fine-tune the digital system to alleviate the performance loss caused by modulation. Here, the straight-through estimator (STE) is considered to overcome the non-differentiable nature. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed schemes significantly outperform existing digital image transmission systems.</description>

      <title>Noise reduction in ISAR imaging of UAVs using weighted atomic norm minimization and 2D-ADMM algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of noise on the Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) with sparse apertures is a challenging issue for image reconstruction with high resolution at low Signal-to-Noise Ratios (SNRs). It is well-known that the image resolution is affected by the bandwidth of the transmitted signal and the Coherent Processing Interval (CPI) in two dimensions, range and azimuth, respectively. To reduce the noise effect and thus increase the two-dimensional resolution of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) images, we propose the Fast Reweighted Atomic Norm Denoising (FRAND) algorithm by incorporating the weighted atomic norm minimization. To solve the problem, the Two-Dimensional Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (2D-ADMM) algorithm is developed to speed up the implementation procedure. Assuming sparse apertures for ISAR images of UAVs, we compare the proposed method with the MUltiple SIgnal Classification (MUSIC), Cadzow, and SL0 methods in different SNRs. Simulation results show the superiority of FRAND at low SNRs based on the Mean-Square Error (MSE), Peak Signal-to-Noise ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) criteria.</description>

      <title>Fair Computation Offloading for RSMA-Assisted Mobile Edge Computing Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) provides a flexible transmission framework that can be applied in mobile edge computing (MEC) systems. However, the research work on RSMA-assisted MEC systems is still at the infancy and many design issues remain unsolved, such as the MEC server and channel allocation problem in general multi-server and multi-channel scenarios as well as the user fairness issues. In this regard, we study an RSMA-assisted MEC system with multiple MEC servers, channels and devices, and consider the fairness among devices. A max-min fairness computation offloading problem to maximize the minimum computation offloading rate is investigated. Since the problem is difficult to solve optimally, we develop an efficient algorithm to obtain a suboptimal solution. Particularly, the time allocation and the computing frequency allocation are derived as closed-form functions of the transmit power allocation and the successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding order, while the SIC decoding order is obtained heuristically, and the bisection search and the successive convex approximation methods are employed to optimize the transmit power allocation. For the MEC server and channel allocation problem, we transform it into a hypergraph matching problem and solve it by matching theory. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RSMA-assisted MEC system outperforms current MEC systems under various system setups.</description>

      <title>When NOMA Meets AIGC: Enhanced Wireless Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless federated learning (WFL) enables devices to collaboratively train a global model via local model training, uploading and aggregating. However, WFL faces the data scarcity/heterogeneity problem (i.e., data are limited and unevenly distributed among devices) that degrades the learning performance. In this regard, artificial intelligence generated content (AIGC) can synthesize various types of data to compensate for the insufficient local data. Nevertheless, downloading synthetic data or uploading local models iteratively takes a lot of time, especially for a large amount of devices. To address this issue, we propose to leverage non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to achieve efficient synthetic data and local model transmission. This paper is the first to combine AIGC and NOMA with WFL to maximally enhance the learning performance. For the proposed NOMA+AIGC-enhanced WFL, the problem of jointly optimizing the synthetic data distribution, two-way communication and computation resource allocation to minimize the global learning error is investigated. The problem belongs to NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming, whose optimal solution is intractable to find. We first employ the block coordinate descent method to decouple the complicated-coupled variables, and then resort to our analytical method to derive an efficient low-complexity local optimal solution with partial closed-form results. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of the proposed scheme compared to the existing and benchmark schemes such as the frequency/time division multiple access based AIGC-enhanced schemes.</description>

      <title>Modulo Sampling in Shift-Invariant Spaces: Recovery and Stability Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling shift-invariant (SI) signals with a high dynamic range poses a notable challenge in the domain of analog-to-digital conversion (ADC). It is essential for the ADC's dynamic range to exceed that of the incoming analog signal to ensure no vital information is lost during the conversion process. Modulo sampling, an approach initially explored with bandlimited (BL) signals, offers a promising solution to overcome the constraints of dynamic range. In this paper, we expand on the recent advancements in modulo sampling to encompass a broader range of SI signals. Our proposed strategy incorporates analog preprocessing, including the use of a mixer and a low-pass filter (LPF), to transform the signal into a bandlimited one. This BL signal can be accurately reconstructed from its modulo samples if sampled at slightly above its Nyquist frequency. The recovery of the original SI signal from this BL representation is then achieved through suitable filtering. We also examine the efficacy of this system across various noise conditions. Careful choice of the mixer plays a pivotal role in enhancing the method's reliability, especially with generators prone to instability. Our approach thus broadens the framework of modulo sampling's utility in efficiently recovering SI signals, pushing its boundaries beyond BL signals while sampling only slightly above the rate needed for a SI signal.</description>

      <title>Physics-Informed Deep Learning and Partial Transfer Learning for Bearing Fault Diagnosis in the Presence of Highly Missing Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11023v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the most significant obstacles in bearing fault diagnosis is a lack of labeled data for various fault types. Also, sensor-acquired data frequently lack labels and have a large amount of missing data. This paper tackles these issues by presenting the PTPAI method, which uses a physics-informed deep learning-based technique to generate synthetic labeled data. Labeled synthetic data makes up the source domain, whereas unlabeled data with missing data is present in the target domain. Consequently, imbalanced class problems and partial-set fault diagnosis hurdles emerge. To address these challenges, the RF-Mixup approach is used to handle imbalanced classes. As domain adaptation strategies, the MK-MMSD and CDAN are employed to mitigate the disparity in distribution between synthetic and actual data. Furthermore, the partial-set challenge is tackled by applying weighting methods at the class and instance levels. Experimental outcomes on the CWRU and JNU datasets indicate that the proposed approach effectively addresses these problems.</description>

      <title>Explainable Bayesian Recurrent Neural Smoother to Capture Global State Evolutionary Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11163v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through integrating the evolutionary correlations across global states in the bidirectional recursion, an explainable Bayesian recurrent neural smoother (EBRNS) is proposed for offline data-assisted fixed-interval state smoothing. At first, the proposed model, containing global states in the evolutionary interval, is transformed into an equivalent model with bidirectional memory. This transformation incorporates crucial global state information with support for bi-directional recursive computation. For the transformed model, the joint state-memory-trend Bayesian filtering and smoothing frameworks are derived by introducing the bidirectional memory iteration mechanism and offline data into Bayesian estimation theory. The derived frameworks are implemented using the Gaussian approximation to ensure analytical properties and computational efficiency. Finally, the neural network modules within EBRNS and its two-stage training scheme are designed. Unlike most existing approaches that artificially combine deep learning and model-based estimation, the bidirectional recursion and internal gated structures of EBRNS are naturally derived from Bayesian estimation theory, explainably integrating prior model knowledge, online measurement, and offline data. Experiments on representative real-world datasets demonstrate that the high smoothing accuracy of EBRNS is accompanied by data efficiency and a lightweight parameter scale.</description>

      <title>No Analog Combiner TTD-based Hybrid Precoding for Multi-User Sub-THz Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address the design and optimization of real-world-suitable hybrid precoders for multi-user wideband sub-terahertz (sub-THz) communications. We note that the conventional fully connected true-time delay (TTD)-based architecture is impractical because there is no room for the required large number of analog signal combiners in the circuit board. Additionally, analog signal combiners incur significant signal power loss. These limitations are often overlooked in sub-THz research. To overcome these issues, we study a non-overlapping subarray architecture that eliminates the need for analog combiners. We extend the conventional single-user assumption by formulating an optimization problem to maximize the minimum data rate for simultaneously served users. This complex optimization problem is divided into two sub-problems. The first sub-problem aims to ensure a fair subarray allocation for all users and is solved via a continuous domain relaxation technique. The second sub-problem deals with practical TTD device constraints on range and resolution to maximize the subarray gain and is resolved by shifting to the phase domain. Our simulation results highlight significant performance gain for our real-world-ready TTD-based hybrid precoders.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we consider a pulse-Doppler radar relying on a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) for scanning a given volume; the radar receiver is collocated with the STAR-RIS and aims to detect moving targets and estimate their radial velocity in the presence of clutter. To separate the echoes received from the transmissive and reflective half-spaces, the STAR-RIS superimposes a different slow-time modulation on the pulses redirected in each half-space, while the radar detector employs a decision rule based on a generalized information criterion (GIC). Two scanning policies are introduced, namely, simultaneous and sequential scanning, with different tradeoffs in terms of radial velocity estimation accuracy and complexity of the radar detector.</description>

      <title>Deep-Learning-Based Channel Estimation for Distributed MIMO with 1-bit Radio-Over-Fiber Fronthaul</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of pilot-aided, uplink channel estimation in a distributed massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architecture, in which the access points are connected to a central processing unit via fiber-optical fronthaul links, carrying a two-level-quantized version of the received analog radio-frequency signal. We adapt to this architecture the deep-learning-based channel-estimation algorithm recently proposed by Nguyen et al. (2023), and explore its robustness to the additional signal distortions (beyond 1-bit quantization) introduced in the considered architecture by the automatic gain controllers (AGCs) and by the comparators. These components are used at the access points to generate the two-level analog waveform from the received signal. Via simulation results, we illustrate that the proposed channel-estimation method outperforms significantly the Bussgang linear minimum mean-square error channel estimator, and it is robust against the additional impairments introduced by the AGCs and the comparators.</description>

Abstract: As Extremely Large-Scale Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (XL-MIMO) technology advances and frequency band rises, the near-field effects in communication are intensifying. A concise and accurate near-field XL-MIMO channel model serves as the cornerstone for investigating the near-field effects. However, existing angular domain XL-MIMO channel models under near-field conditions require non-closed-form wave-number domain integrals for computation, which is complicated. To obtain a more succinct channel model, this paper introduces a closed-form approximate expression based on the principle of stationary phase. It was subsequently shown that when the scatterer distance is larger than the array aperture, the closed-form model can be further simplified as a trapezoidal spectrum. We validate the accuracy of the proposed approximation through simulations of power angular spectrum similarity. The results indicate that the proposed approximation can accurately approximate the near-field angular domain channel within the effective Rayleigh distance.</description>

      <title>ESI-GAL: EEG Source Imaging-based Kinemaics Parameter Estimation for Grasp and Lift Task</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Objective: Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals-based motor kinematics prediction (MKP) has been an active area of research to develop brain-computer interface (BCI) systems such as exosuits, prostheses, and rehabilitation devices. However, EEG source imaging (ESI) based kinematics prediction is sparsely explored in the literature. Approach: In this study, pre-movement EEG features are utilized to predict three-dimensional (3D) hand kinematics for the grasp-and-lift motor task. A public dataset, WAY-EEG-GAL, is utilized for MKP analysis. In particular, sensor-domain (EEG data) and source-domain (ESI data) based features from the frontoparietal region are explored for MKP. Deep learning-based models are explored to achieve efficient kinematics decoding. Various time-lagged and window sizes are analyzed for hand kinematics prediction. Subsequently, intra-subject and inter-subject MKP analysis is performed to investigate the subject-specific and subject-independent motor-learning capabilities of the neural decoders. The Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) is used as the performance metric for kinematics trajectory decoding. Main results: The rEEGNet neural decoder achieved the best performance with sensor-domain and source-domain features with the time lag and window size of 100 ms and 450 ms, respectively. The highest mean PCC values of 0.790, 0.795, and 0.637 are achieved using sensor-domain features, while 0.769, 0.777, and 0.647 are achieved using source-domain features in x, y, and z-directions, respectively. Significance: This study explores the feasibility of trajectory prediction using EEG sensor-domain and source-domain EEG features for the grasp-and-lift task. Furthermore, inter-subject trajectory estimation is performed using the proposed deep learning decoder with EEG source domain features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the notion of model-based deep learning in the realm of music information research (MIR). Loosely speaking, we refer to the term model-based deep learning for approaches that combine traditional knowledge-based methods with data-driven techniques, especially those based on deep learning, within a diff erentiable computing framework. In music, prior knowledge for instance related to sound production, music perception or music composition theory can be incorporated into the design of neural networks and associated loss functions. We outline three specifi c scenarios to illustrate the application of model-based deep learning in MIR, demonstrating the implementation of such concepts and their potential.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10422v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose Phoneme Discretized Saliency Maps (PDSM), a discretization algorithm for saliency maps that takes advantage of phoneme boundaries for explainable detection of AI-generated voice. We experimentally show with two different Text-to-Speech systems (i.e., Tacotron2 and Fastspeech2) that the proposed algorithm produces saliency maps that result in more faithful explanations compared to standard posthoc explanation methods. Moreover, by associating the saliency maps to the phoneme representations, this methodology generates explanations that tend to be more understandable than standard saliency maps on magnitude spectrograms.</description>

      <title>Full reference point cloud quality assessment using support vector regression</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Point clouds are a general format for representing realistic 3D objects in diverse 3D applications. Since point clouds have large data sizes, developing efficient point cloud compression methods is crucial. However, excessive compression leads to various distortions, which deteriorates the point cloud quality perceived by end users. Thus, establishing reliable point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) methods is essential as a benchmark to develop efficient compression methods. This paper presents an accurate full-reference point cloud quality assessment (FR-PCQA) method called full-reference quality assessment using support vector regression (FRSVR) for various types of degradations such as compression distortion, Gaussian noise, and down-sampling. The proposed method demonstrates accurate PCQA by integrating five FR-based metrics covering various types of errors (e.g., considering geometric distortion, color distortion, and point count) using support vector regression (SVR). Moreover, the proposed method achieves a superior trade-off between accuracy and calculation speed because it includes only the calculation of these five simple metrics and SVR, which can perform fast prediction. Experimental results with three types of open datasets show that the proposed method is more accurate than conventional FR-PCQA methods. In addition, the proposed method is faster than state-of-the-art methods that utilize complicated features such as curvature and multi-scale features. Thus, the proposed method provides excellent performance in terms of the accuracy of PCQA and processing speed. Our method is available from https://github.com/STAC-USC/FRSVR-PCQA.</description>

      <title>A Novel Joint DRL-Based Utility Optimization for UAV Data Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel joint deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based solution to optimize the utility of an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted communication network. To maximize the number of users served within the constraints of the UAV's limited bandwidth and power resources, we employ deep Q-Networks (DQN) and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) algorithms for optimal resource allocation to ground users with heterogeneous data rate demands. The DQN algorithm dynamically allocates multiple bandwidth resource blocks to different users based on current demand and available resource states. Simultaneously, the DDPG algorithm manages power allocation, continuously adjusting power levels to adapt to varying distances and fading conditions, including Rayleigh fading for non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links and Rician fading for line-of-sight (LoS) links. Our joint DRL-based solution demonstrates an increase of up to 41% in the number of users served compared to scenarios with equal bandwidth and power allocation.</description>

      <title>MMVR: Millimeter-wave Multi-View Radar Dataset and Benchmark for Indoor Perception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compared with an extensive list of automotive radar datasets that support autonomous driving, indoor radar datasets are scarce at a smaller scale in the format of low-resolution radar point clouds and usually under an open-space single-room setting. In this paper, we scale up indoor radar data collection using multi-view high-resolution radar heatmap in a multi-day, multi-room, and multi-subject setting, with an emphasis on the diversity of environment and subjects. Referred to as the millimeter-wave multi-view radar (MMVR) dataset, it consists of $345$K multi-view radar frames collected from $25$ human subjects over $6$ different rooms, $446$K annotated bounding boxes/segmentation instances, and $7.59$ million annotated keypoints to support three major perception tasks of object detection, pose estimation, and instance segmentation, respectively. For each task, we report performance benchmarks under two protocols: a single subject in an open space and multiple subjects in several cluttered rooms with two data splits: random split and cross-environment split over $395$ 1-min data segments. We anticipate that MMVR facilitates indoor radar perception development for indoor vehicle (robot/humanoid) navigation, building energy management, and elderly care for better efficiency, user experience, and safety.</description>

      <title>Fast Fractional Programming for Multi-Cell Integrated Sensing and Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns the coordinate multi-cell beamforming design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). In particular, we assume that each base station (BS) has massive antennas. The optimization objective is to maximize a weighted sum of the data rates (for communications) and the Fisher information (for sensing). We first show that the conventional beamforming method for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, i.e., the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, has a natural extension to the ISAC problem scenario from a fractional programming (FP) perspective. However, the extended WMMSE algorithm requires computing the $N\times N$ matrix inverse extensively, where $N$ is proportional to the antenna array size, so the algorithm becomes quite costly when antennas are massively deployed. To address this issue, we develop a nonhomogeneous bound and use it in conjunction with the FP technique to solve the ISAC beamforming problem without the need to invert any large matrices. It is further shown that the resulting new FP algorithm has an intimate connection with gradient projection, based on which we can accelerate the convergence via Nesterov's gradient extrapolation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11082v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ultimate goal of next generation multiple access (NGMA) is to support massive terminals and facilitate multiple functionalities over the limited radio resources of wireless networks in the most efficient manner possible. However, the random and uncontrollable wireless radio environment is a major obstacle to realizing this NGMA vision. Given the prominent feature of achieving 360{\deg} smart radio environment, simultaneously transmitting and reflecting surfaces (STARS) are emerging as one key enabling technology among the family of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces for NGMA. This paper provides a comprehensive overview of the recent research progress of STARS, focusing on fundamentals, performance analysis, and full-space beamforming design, as well as promising employments of STARS in NGMA. In particular, we first introduce the basics of STARS by elaborating on the foundational principles and operating protocols as well as discussing different STARS categories and prototypes. Moreover, we systematically survey the existing performance analysis and beamforming design for STARS-aided wireless communications in terms of diverse objectives and different mathematical approaches. Given the superiority of STARS, we further discuss advanced STARS applications as well as the attractive interplay between STARS and other emerging techniques to motivate future works for realizing efficient NGMA.</description>

Abstract: Biological entities in nature have developed sophisticated communication methods over millennia to facilitate cooperation. Among these entities, plants are some of the most intricate communicators. They interact with each other through various communication modalities, creating networks that enable the exchange of information and nutrients. In this paper, we explore this collective behavior and its components. We then introduce the concept of agent plants, outlining their architecture and detailing the tasks of each unit. Additionally, we investigate the mycorrhizal fungi-plant symbiosis to extract glucose for energy harvesting. We propose an architecture that converts the chemical energy stored in these glucose molecules into electrical energy. We conduct comprehensive analyses of the proposed architecture to validate its effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Low-probability of Intercept/Detect (LPI/LPD) Secure Communications Using Antenna Arrays Employing Rapid Sidelobe Time Modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an electronically-reconfigurable antenna array offering low probability of intercept/detect (LPI/LPD) and secure communications capabilities simultaneously at the physical layer. This antenna array is designed to provide rapidly time-varying sidelobes and a stationary main lobe. By performing rapid sidelobe time modulation (SLTM), the signal transmitted in the undesired directions (i.e., through sidelobes) undergoes spread-spectrum distortion making it more difficult to be detected, intercepted, and deciphered while the signal transmitted in the desired direction (i.e., through the main lobe) is unaffected. Therefore, the intended receiver would not need additional modifications (i.e. encryption keys) to detect and recover the signal. We describe the operating principles of this SLTM array and validate its spread-spectrum SLTM sequence generation in undesired directions through theory, simulations, and experiments. Using a fabricated SLTM prototype operating at X band, we conducted system-level measurements to demonstrate its LPI/LPD, secure communications, and jamming resilience capabilities. The presented method is a physical layer technique, which can bring LPI/LPD capabilities to existing communications systems by simply replacing their antennas with SLTM arrays. This technique can be used independently or in combination with additional coding and signal-processing techniques to achieve further enhancements in LPI/LPD and secure communications.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Equipped UAV in Emergency Wireless Communications: A New Fading-Shadowing Model and Performance Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Communication infrastructure is often severely disrupted in post-disaster areas, which interrupts communications and impedes rescue. Recently, the technology of reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-equipped-UAV has been investigated as a feasible approach to assist communication under such conditions. However, the channel characteristics in the post-disaster area rapidly change due to the topographical changes caused by secondary disasters and the high mobility of UAVs. In this paper we develop a new fading-shadowing model to fit the path loss caused by the debris. Following this, we derive the exact distribution of the new channel statistics for a small number of RIS elements and the approximate distribution for a large number of RIS elements, respectively. Then, we derive the closed-form expressions for performance analysis, including average capacity (AC), energy efficiency (EE), and outage probability (OP). Based on the above analytical derivations, we maximize the energy efficiency by optimizing the number of RIS elements and the coverage area by optimizing the altitude of the RIS-equipped UAV, respectively. Finally, simulation results validate the accuracy of derived expressions and show insights related to the optimal number of RIS elements and the optimal UAV altitude for emergency wireless communication (EWC).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) is a pivotal technology in communication, offering an alternative path that significantly enhances the link quality in wireless communication environments. In this paper, we propose a RIS-assisted internet of vehicles (IoV) network, considering the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication method. In addition, in order to improve the timeliness of vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) links and the stability of vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) links, we introduce the age of information (AoI) model and the payload transmission probability model. Therefore, with the objective of minimizing the AoI of V2I links and prioritizing transmission of V2V links payload, we construct this optimization problem as an Markov decision process (MDP) problem in which the BS serves as an agent to allocate resources and control phase-shift for the vehicles using the soft actor-critic (SAC) algorithm, which gradually converges and maintains a high stability. A AoI-aware joint vehicular resource allocation and RIS phase-shift control scheme based on SAC algorithm is proposed and simulation results show that its convergence speed, cumulative reward, AoI performance, and payload transmission probability outperforms those of proximal policy optimization (PPO), deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) and stochastic algorithms.</description>

      <title>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface Assisted VEC Based on Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vehicular edge computing (VEC) is an emerging technology that enables vehicles to perform high-intensity tasks by executing tasks locally or offloading them to nearby edge devices. However, obstacles such as buildings may degrade the communications and incur communication interruptions, and thus the vehicle may not meet the requirement for task offloading. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) is introduced to support vehicle communication and provide an alternative communication path. The system performance can be improved by flexibly adjusting the phase-shift of the RIS. For RIS-assisted VEC system where tasks arrive randomly, we design a control scheme that considers offloading power, local power allocation and phase-shift optimization. To solve this non-convex problem, we propose a new deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that employs modified multi-agent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) approach to optimize the power allocation for vehicle users (VUs) and block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to optimize the phase-shift of the RIS. Simulation results show that our proposed scheme outperforms the centralized deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) scheme and random scheme.</description>

      <title>Unleashing OpenTitan's Potential: a Silicon-Ready Embedded Secure Element for Root of Trust and Cryptographic Offloading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid advancement and exploration of open-hardware RISC-V platforms are driving significant changes in sectors like autonomous vehicles, smart-city infrastructure, and medical devices. OpenTitan stands out as a groundbreaking open-source RISC-V design with a comprehensive security toolkit as a standalone system-on-chip (SoC). OpenTitan includes Earl Grey, a fully implemented and silicon-proven SoC, and Darjeeling, announced but not yet fully implemented. Earl Grey targets standalone SoC implementations, while Darjeeling is for integrable implementations. The literature lacks a silicon-ready embedded implementation of an open-source Root of Trust, despite lowRISC's efforts on Darjeeling. We address the limitations of existing implementations by optimizing data transfer latency between memory and cryptographic accelerators to prevent under-utilization and ensure efficient task acceleration. Our contributions include a comprehensive methodology for integrating custom extensions and IPs into the Earl Grey architecture, architectural enhancements for system-level integration, support for varied boot modes, and improved data movement across the platform. These advancements facilitate deploying OpenTitan in broader SoCs, even without specific technology-dependent IPs, providing a deployment-ready research vehicle for the community. We integrated the extended Earl Grey architecture into a reference architecture in a 22nm FDX technology node, benchmarking the enhanced architecture's performance. The results show significant improvements in cryptographic processing speed, achieving up to 2.7x speedup for SHA-256/HMAC and 1.6x for AES accelerators compared to the baseline Earl Grey architecture.</description>

      <title>Pre-Training and Personalized Fine-Tuning via Over-the-Air Federated Meta-Learning: Convergence-Generalization Trade-Offs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For modern artificial intelligence (AI) applications such as large language models (LLMs), the training paradigm has recently shifted to pre-training followed by fine-tuning. Furthermore, owing to dwindling open repositories of data and thanks to efforts to democratize access to AI models, pre-training is expected to increasingly migrate from the current centralized deployments to federated learning (FL) implementations. Meta-learning provides a general framework in which pre-training and fine-tuning can be formalized. Meta-learning-based personalized FL (meta-pFL) moves beyond basic personalization by targeting generalization to new agents and tasks. This paper studies the generalization performance of meta-pFL for a wireless setting in which the agents participating in the pre-training phase, i.e., meta-learning, are connected via a shared wireless channel to the server. Adopting over-the-air computing, we study the trade-off between generalization to new agents and tasks, on the one hand, and convergence, on the other hand. The trade-off arises from the fact that channel impairments may enhance generalization, while degrading convergence. Extensive numerical results validate the theory.</description>

      <title>Low Complexity Lookup Table Aided Soft Output Semidefinite Relaxation based Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling Detector</title>

Abstract: Spectrum scarcity necessitates innovative, spectral-efficient strategies to meet the ever-growing demand for high data rates. Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling emerges as a compelling spectral-efficient transmission method that pushes transmit data symbols beyond the Nyquist limit, offering enhanced spectral efficiency (SE). While FTN signaling maintains SE with the same energy and bandwidth as the Nyquist signaling, it introduces increased complexity, particularly at higher modulation levels. This complexity predominantly arises from the detection process, which seeks to mitigate the intentional intersymbol interference generated by FTN signaling. Another challenge involves the generation of reliable log-likelihood ratios (LLRs) vital for soft channel decoders. In this study, we introduce a lookup table (LUT) aided soft output semidefinite relaxation (soSDR) based sub-optimal FTN detector, which can be extended to higher modulation levels. This detector possesses polynomial computational complexity, given the negligible complexity associated with soft value generation. Our study assesses the performance of this soft output detector against that of the optimal FTN detector, Bahl, Cocke, Jelinek and Raviv (BCJR) algorithm as the benchmark. The likelihood values produced by our LUT aided semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based FTN signaling detector show promising viability in coded scenario.</description>

      <title>Transformers are Provably Optimal In-context Estimators for Wireless Communications</title>

Abstract: Pre-trained transformers exhibit the capability of adapting to new tasks through in-context learning (ICL), where they efficiently utilize a limited set of prompts without explicit model optimization.
  The canonical communication problem of estimating transmitted symbols from received observations can be modelled as an in-context learning problem: Received observations are essentially a noisy function of transmitted symbols, and this function can be represented by an unknown parameter whose statistics depend on an (also unknown) latent context. This problem, which we term in-context estimation (ICE), has significantly greater complexity than the extensively studied linear regression problem.
  The optimal solution to the ICE problem is a non-linear function of the underlying context. In this paper, we prove that, for a subclass of such problems, a single layer softmax attention transformer (SAT) computes the optimal solution of the above estimation problem in the limit of large prompt length. We also prove that the optimal configuration of such transformer is indeed the minimizer of the corresponding training loss. Further, we empirically demonstrate the proficiency of multi-layer transformers in efficiently solving broader in-context estimation problems. Through extensive simulations, we show that solving ICE problems using transformers significantly outperforms standard approaches. Moreover, just with a few context examples, it achieves the same performance as an estimator with perfect knowledge of the latent context.</description>

      <title>Bayes-Optimal Unsupervised Learning for Channel Estimation in Near-Field Holographic MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10438v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Holographic MIMO (HMIMO) is being increasingly recognized as a key enabling technology for 6G wireless systems through the deployment of an extremely large number of antennas within a compact space to fully exploit the potentials of the electromagnetic (EM) channel. Nevertheless, the benefits of HMIMO systems cannot be fully unleashed without an efficient means to estimate the high-dimensional channel, whose distribution becomes increasingly complicated due to the accessibility of the near-field region. In this paper, we address the fundamental challenge of designing a low-complexity Bayes-optimal channel estimator in near-field HMIMO systems operating in unknown EM environments. The core idea is to estimate the HMIMO channels solely based on the Stein's score function of the received pilot signals and an estimated noise level, without relying on priors or supervision that is not feasible in practical deployment. A neural network is trained with the unsupervised denoising score matching objective to learn the parameterized score function. Meanwhile, a principal component analysis (PCA)-based algorithm is proposed to estimate the noise level leveraging the low-rank near-field spatial correlation. Building upon these techniques, we develop a Bayes-optimal score-based channel estimator for fully-digital HMIMO transceivers in a closed form. The optimal score-based estimator is also extended to hybrid analog-digital HMIMO systems by incorporating it into a low-complexity message passing algorithm. The (quasi-) Bayes-optimality of the proposed estimators is validated both in theory and by extensive simulation results. In addition to optimality, it is shown that our proposal is robust to various mismatches and can quickly adapt to dynamic EM environments in an online manner thanks to its unsupervised nature, demonstrating its potential in real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>GAN Based Near-Field Channel Estimation for Extremely Large-Scale MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) is a promising technique to achieve ultra-high spectral efficiency for future 6G communications. The mixed line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) XL-MIMO near-field channel model is adopted to describe the XL-MIMO near-field channel accurately. In this paper, a generative adversarial network (GAN) variant based channel estimation method is proposed for XL-MIMO systems. Specifically, the GAN variant is developed to simultaneously estimate the LoS and NLoS path components of the XL-MIMO channel. The initially estimated channels instead of the received signals are input into the GAN variant as the conditional input to generate the XL-MIMO channels more efficiently. The GAN variant not only learns the mapping from the initially estimated channels to the XL-MIMO channels but also learns an adversarial loss. Moreover, we combine the adversarial loss with a conventional loss function to ensure the correct direction of training the generator. To further enhance the estimation performance, we investigate the impact of the hyper-parameter of the loss function on the performance of our method. Simulation results show that the proposed method outperforms the existing channel estimation approaches in the adopted channel model. In addition, the proposed method surpasses the Cram$\acute{\mathbf{e}}$r-Rao lower bound (CRLB) under low pilot overhead.</description>

      <title>A Decoupled Approach for Composite Sparse-plus-Smooth Penalized Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05204v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a linear inverse problem whose solution is expressed as a sum of two components: one smooth and the other sparse. This problem is addressed by minimizing an objective function with a least squares data-fidelity term and a different regularization term applied to each of the components. Sparsity is promoted with an $\ell_1$ norm, while the smooth component is penalized with an $\ell_2$ norm.
  We characterize the solution set of this composite optimization problem by stating a Representer Theorem. Consequently, we identify that solving the optimization problem can be decoupled by first identifying the sparse solution as a solution of a modified single-variable problem and then deducing the smooth component.
  We illustrate that this decoupled solving method can lead to significant computational speedups in applications, considering the problem of Dirac recovery over a smooth background with two-dimensional partial Fourier measurements.</description>

      <title>Full-Duplex Beyond Self-Interference: The Unlimited Sensing Way</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The success of full-stack full-duplex communication systems depends on how effectively one can achieve digital self-interference cancellation (SIC). Towards this end, in this paper, we consider unlimited sensing framework (USF) enabled full-duplex system. We show that by injecting folding non-linearities in the sensing pipeline, one can not only suppress self-interference but also recover the signal of interest (SoI). This approach leads to novel design of the receiver architecture that is complemented by a modulo-domain channel estimation method. We then demonstrate the advantages of modulo ADC by analyzing the relationship between quantization noise, quantization bits, and dynamic range. Numerical experiments show that the USF enabled receiver structure can achieve up to 40 dB digital SIC by using as few as 4-bits per sample. Our method outperforms the previous approach based on adaptive filters when it comes to SoI reconstruction, detection, and digital SIC performance.</description>

      <title>Degree-of-Freedom of Modulating Information in the Phases of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.13787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2112.13787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the information theoretic limit of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) aided communication scenario in which the RIS and the transmitter either jointly or independently send information to the receiver. The RIS is an emerging technology that uses a large number of passive reflective elements with adjustable phases to intelligently reflect the transmit signal to the intended receiver. While most previous studies of the RIS focus on its ability to beamform and to boost the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), this paper shows that if the information data stream is also available at the RIS and can be modulated through the adjustable phases at the RIS, significant improvement in the {degree-of-freedom} (DoF) of the overall channel is possible. For example, for an RIS system in which the signals are reflected from a transmitter with $M$ antennas to a receiver with $K$ antennas through an RIS with $N$ reflective elements, assuming no direct path between the transmitter and the receiver, joint transmission of the transmitter and the RIS can achieve a DoF of $\min\left(M+\frac{N}{2}-\frac{1}{2},N,K\right)$ as compared to the DoF of $\min(M,K)$ for the conventional multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channel. This result is obtained by establishing a connection between the RIS system and the MIMO channel with phase noise and by using results for characterizing the information dimension under projection. The result is further extended to the case with a direct path between the transmitter and the receiver, and also to the multiple access scenario, in which the transmitter and the RIS send independent information. Finally, this paper proposes a symbol-level precoding approach for modulating data through the phases of the RIS, and provides numerical simulation results to verify the theoretical DoF results.</description>

      <title>TinyAirNet: TinyML Model Transmission for Energy-efficient Image Retrieval from IoT Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.04788v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This letter introduces an energy-efficient pull-based data collection framework for Internet of Things (IoT) devices that use Tiny Machine Learning (TinyML) to interpret data queries. A TinyML model is transmitted from the edge server to the IoT devices. The devices employ the model to facilitate the subsequent semantic queries. This reduces the transmission of irrelevant data, but receiving the ML model and its processing at the IoT devices consume additional energy. We consider the specific instance of image retrieval in a single device scenario and investigate the gain brought by the proposed scheme in terms of energy efficiency and retrieval accuracy, while considering the cost of computation and communication, as well as memory constraints. Numerical evaluation shows that, compared to a baseline scheme, the proposed scheme reaches up to 67% energy reduction under the accuracy constraint when many images are stored. Although focused on image retrieval, our analysis is indicative of a broader set of communication scenarios in which the preemptive transmission of an ML model can increase communication efficiency.</description>

      <title>A Universal Framework for Multiport Network Analysis of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is an emerging paradigm able to control the propagation environment in wireless systems. Most of the research on RIS has been dedicated to system optimization and, with the advent of beyond diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), to RIS architecture design. However, developing general and unified electromagnetic (EM)-consistent models for RIS-aided systems remains an open problem. In this study, we propose a universal framework for the multiport network analysis of RIS-aided systems. With our framework, we model RIS-aided systems and RIS architectures through impedance, admittance, and scattering parameter analysis. Based on these analyses, three equivalent models are derived accounting for the effects of impedance mismatching and mutual coupling. The three models are then simplified by assuming large transmission distances, perfect matching, and no mutual coupling to understand the role of the RIS in the communication model. The derived simplified models are consistent with the typical model used in related literature, although we show that an additional approximation is commonly considered in the literature. We discuss the benefits of each analysis in characterizing and optimizing the RIS and how to select the most suitable parameters according to the needs. Numerical results provide additional evidence of the equivalence of the three analyses.</description>

      <title>On the Ground and in the Sky: A Tutorial on Radio Localization in Ground-Air-Space Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inherent limitations in scaling up ground infrastructure for future wireless networks, combined with decreasing operational costs of aerial and space networks, are driving considerable research interest in multisegment ground-air-space (GAS) networks. In GAS networks, where ground and aerial users share network resources, ubiquitous and accurate user localization becomes indispensable, not only as an end-user service but also as an enabler for location-aware communications. This breaks the convention of having localization as a byproduct in networks primarily designed for communications. To address these imperative localization needs, the design and utilization of ground, aerial, and space anchors require thorough investigation. In this tutorial, we provide an in-depth systemic analysis of the radio localization problem in GAS networks, considering ground and aerial users as targets to be localized. Starting from a survey of the most relevant works, we then define the key characteristics of anchors and targets in GAS networks. Subsequently, we detail localization fundamentals in GAS networks, considering 3D positions, orientations, and velocities. Afterward, we thoroughly analyze radio localization systems in GAS networks, detailing the system model, design aspects, and considerations for each of the three GAS anchors. Preliminary results are presented to provide a quantifiable perspective on key design aspects in GAS-based localization scenarios. We then identify the vital roles 6G enablers are expected to play in radio localization in GAS networks.</description>

      <title>Fast graph-based denoising for point cloud color information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09721v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Point clouds are utilized in various 3D applications such as cross-reality (XR) and realistic 3D displays. In some applications, e.g., for live streaming using a 3D point cloud, real-time point cloud denoising methods are required to enhance the visual quality. However, conventional high-precision denoising methods cannot be executed in real time for large-scale point clouds owing to the complexity of graph constructions with K nearest neighbors and noise level estimation. This paper proposes a fast graph-based denoising (FGBD) for a large-scale point cloud. First, high-speed graph construction is achieved by scanning a point cloud in various directions and searching adjacent neighborhoods on the scanning lines. Second, we propose a fast noise level estimation method using eigenvalues of the covariance matrix on a graph. Finally, we also propose a new low-cost filter selection method to enhance denoising accuracy to compensate for the degradation caused by the acceleration algorithms. In our experiments, we succeeded in reducing the processing time dramatically while maintaining accuracy relative to conventional denoising methods. Denoising was performed at 30fps, with frames containing approximately 1 million points.</description>

      <title>AFS-BM: Enhancing Model Performance through Adaptive Feature Selection with Binary Masking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of feature selection in general machine learning (ML) context, which is one of the most critical subjects in the field. Although, there exist many feature selection methods, however, these methods face challenges such as scalability, managing high-dimensional data, dealing with correlated features, adapting to variable feature importance, and integrating domain knowledge. To this end, we introduce the "Adaptive Feature Selection with Binary Masking" (AFS-BM) which remedies these problems. AFS-BM achieves this by joint optimization for simultaneous feature selection and model training. In particular, we do the joint optimization and binary masking to continuously adapt the set of features and model parameters during the training process. This approach leads to significant improvements in model accuracy and a reduction in computational requirements. We provide an extensive set of experiments where we compare AFS-BM with the established feature selection methods using well-known datasets from real-life competitions. Our results show that AFS-BM makes significant improvement in terms of accuracy and requires significantly less computational complexity. This is due to AFS-BM's ability to dynamically adjust to the changing importance of features during the training process, which an important contribution to the field. We openly share our code for the replicability of our results and to facilitate further research.</description>

      <title>Mixture to Mixture: Leveraging Close-talk Mixtures as Weak-supervision for Speech Separation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09313v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose mixture to mixture (M2M) training, a weakly-supervised neural speech separation algorithm that leverages close-talk mixtures as a weak supervision for training discriminative models to separate far-field mixtures. Our idea is that, for a target speaker, its close-talk mixture has a much higher signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the target speaker than any far-field mixtures, and hence could be utilized to design a weak supervision for separation. To realize this, at each training step we feed a far-field mixture to a deep neural network (DNN) to produce an intermediate estimate for each speaker, and, for each of considered close-talk and far-field microphones, we linearly filter the DNN estimates and optimize a loss so that the filtered estimates of all the speakers can sum up to the mixture captured by each of the considered microphones. Evaluation results on a 2-speaker separation task in simulated reverberant conditions show that M2M can effectively leverage close-talk mixtures as a weak supervision for separating far-field mixtures.</description>

Abstract: Given a sample of i.i.d. high-dimensional centered random vectors, we consider a problem of estimation of their covariance matrix $\Sigma$ with an additional assumption that $\Sigma$ can be represented as a sum of a few Kronecker products of smaller matrices. Under mild conditions, we derive the first non-asymptotic dimension-free high-probability bound on the Frobenius distance between $\Sigma$ and a widely used penalized permuted least squares estimate. Because of the hidden structure, the established rate of convergence is faster than in the standard covariance estimation problem.</description>

      <title>Sim2Real in Reconstructive Spectroscopy: Deep Learning with Augmented Device-Informed Data Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12354v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a deep learning (DL)-based framework, namely Sim2Real, for spectral signal reconstruction in reconstructive spectroscopy, focusing on efficient data sampling and fast inference time. The work focuses on the challenge of reconstructing real-world spectral signals under the extreme setting where only device-informed simulated data are available for training. Such device-informed simulated data are much easier to collect than real-world data but exhibit large distribution shifts from their real-world counterparts. To leverage such simulated data effectively, a hierarchical data augmentation strategy is introduced to mitigate the adverse effects of this domain shift, and a corresponding neural network for the spectral signal reconstruction with our augmented data is designed. Experiments using a real dataset measured from our spectrometer device demonstrate that Sim2Real achieves significant speed-up during the inference while attaining on-par performance with the state-of-the-art optimization-based methods.</description>

      <title>Distributed Maximum Consensus over Noisy Links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18509v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a distributed algorithm, termed noise-robust distributed maximum consensus (RD-MC), for estimating the maximum value within a multi-agent network in the presence of noisy communication links. Our approach entails redefining the maximum consensus problem as a distributed optimization problem, allowing a solution using the alternating direction method of multipliers. Unlike existing algorithms that rely on multiple sets of noise-corrupted estimates, RD-MC employs a single set, enhancing both robustness and efficiency. To further mitigate the effects of link noise and improve robustness, we apply moving averaging to the local estimates. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that RD-MC is significantly more robust to communication link noise compared to existing maximum-consensus algorithms.</description>

      <title>Multiple Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces Collaborative Wireless Localization System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09846v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies a multiple intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) collaborative localization system where multiple semi-passive IRSs are deployed in the network to locate one or more targets based on time-of-arrival. It is assumed that each semi-passive IRS is equipped with reflective elements and sensors, which are used to establish the line-of-sight links from the base station (BS) to multiple targets and process echo signals, respectively. Based on the above model, we derive the Fisher information matrix of the echo signal with respect to the time delay. By employing the chain rule and exploiting the geometric relationship between time delay and position, the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target's Cartesian coordinate position is derived. Then, we propose a two-stage algorithmic framework to minimize CRB in single- and multi-target localization systems by joint optimizing active beamforming at BS, passive beamforming at multiple IRSs and IRS selection. For the single-target case, we derive the optimal closed-form solution for multiple IRSs coefficients design and propose a lowcomplexity algorithm based on alternating direction method of multipliers to obtain the optimal solution for active beaming design. For the multi-target case, alternating optimization is used to transform the original problem into two subproblems where semi-definite relaxation and successive convex approximation are applied to tackle the quadraticity and indefiniteness in the CRB expression, respectively. Finally, numerical simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for multiple IRSs collaborative localization system compared to other benchmark schemes as well as the significant performance gains.</description>
