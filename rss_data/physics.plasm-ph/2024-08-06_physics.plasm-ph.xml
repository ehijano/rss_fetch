      <title>Methodological notes on the gauge invariance in the treatment of waves and oscillations in plasmas $via$ the Einstein-Vlasov-Maxwell system: Fundamental equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01531v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of gauge transformations in linearized gravitation is investigated. After a brief discussion of the fundamentals of the kinetic theory in curved spacetime, the Einstein-Vlasov-Maxwell system of equations in terms of gauge invariant quantities is established without neglecting the equations of motion associated with the dynamics of the non-radiative components of the metric tensor. The established theory is applied to a non-collisional electron-positron plasma, leading to a dispersion relation for gravitational waves in this model system. The problem of Landau damping is addressed and some attention is given to the issue of the energy exchanges between the plasma and the gravitational wave. In a future paper, a more complete set of approximate dispersion relations for waves and oscillations in plasmas will be presented, including the dynamics of non-radiative components of the metric tensor, with special attention to the problems of the Landau damping and of the energy exchanges between matter, the electromagnetic field and the gravitational field.</description>

      <title>Relaxation model for a homogeneous plasma with spherically symmetric velocity space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the transport equations from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation when the velocity space is spherically symmetric. The Shkarofsky form of Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth collision operator is employed in the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. A relaxation model for homogeneous plasma could be presented in closed form in terms of Gauss HyperGeometric2F1 functions. This has been accomplished based on the Maxwellian mixture model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classic models such as two-temperature thermal equilibrium model, Braginskii model and thermodynamic equilibrium model are special cases of our relaxation model. The present relaxation model is a nonequilibrium model which is under the assumption that the plasma system possesses finitely distinguishable independent features, but it is not relying on the conventional near-equilibrium assumption.</description>

      <title>Large-Angle Collisions in Burning Plasmas of Inertial Confinement Fusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent neutron analysis of experiments conducted at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) has revealed deviations from the Maxwellian distributions in the ion relative kinetic energy of burning plasmas, with the surprising emergence of supra-thermal deuterium and tritium (DT) ions that fall outside the predictions of macroscopic statistical hydrodynamic models. Our hybrid-particle-in-cell simulations, incorporating the newly-developed model of large-angle collisions, suggest this could be attributed to the increased significance of large-angle collisions among DT ions and \(\alpha\)-particles in the burning plasma. Extensive investigations into the implications of large-angle collisions in the burning plasma have yield several key findings, including an ignition moment promotion by \(\sim 10\, {\rm ps}\), the presence of supra-thermal ions below an energy threshold, and a hotspot expansion rate about six times faster than expected. Furthermore, we have established the congruency between the NIF neutron spectral moment analysis and our simulations. Our researches on large-angle collisions in burning plasmas offer new insights for experiment interpretation and update our understanding for new designs of inertial confinement fusions.</description>

      <title>Characterizing the Performance of the Implicit Massively Parallel Particle-in-Cell iPIC3D Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimizing iPIC3D, an implicit Particle-in-Cell (PIC) code, for large-scale 3D plasma simulations is crucial for space and astrophysical applications. This work focuses on characterizing iPIC3D's communication efficiency through strategic measures like optimal node placement, communication and computation overlap, and load balancing. Profiling and tracing tools are employed to analyze iPIC3D's communication efficiency and provide practical recommendations. Implementing optimized communication protocols addresses the Geospace Environmental Modeling (GEM) magnetic reconnection challenges in plasma physics with more precise simulations. This approach captures the complexities of 3D plasma simulations, particularly in magnetic reconnection, advancing space and astrophysical research.</description>

      <title>Evidence of dual energy transfer driven by magnetic reconnection at sub-ion scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02505v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties of energy transfer in the kinetic range of plasma turbulence have fundamental implications on the turbulent heating of space and astrophysical plasmas. It was recently suggested that magnetic reconnection may be responsible for driving the sub-ion scale cascade, and that this process would be characterized by a direct energy transfer towards even smaller scales (until dissipation), and a simultaneous inverse transfer of energy towards larger scales, until the ion break. Here we employ the space-filter technique on high-resolution 2D3V hybrid-Vlasov simulations of continuously driven turbulence providing for the first time quantitative evidence that magnetic reconnection is indeed able to trigger a dual energy transfer originating at sub-ion scales.</description>

      <title>Long-living Equilibria in Kinetic Astrophysical Plasma Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence in classical fluids is characterized by persistent structures that emerge from the chaotic landscape. We investigate the analogous process in fully kinetic plasma turbulence by using high-resolution, direct numerical simulations in two spatial dimensions. We observe the formation of long-living vortices with a profile typical of macroscopic, magnetically dominated force-free states. Inspired by the Harris pinch model for inhomogeneous equilibria, we describe these metastable solutions with a self-consistent kinetic model in a cylindrical coordinate system centered on a representative vortex, starting from an explicit form of the particle velocity distribution function. Such new equilibria can be simplified to a Gold-Hoyle solution of the modified force-free state. Turbulence is mediated by the long-living structures, accompanied by transients in which such vortices merge and form self-similarly new metastable equilibria. This process can be relevant to the comprehension of various astrophysical phenomena, going from the formation of plasmoids in the vicinity of massive compact objects to the emergence of coherent structures in the heliosphere.</description>

      <title>Wavenumber Calibration for an Imaging Refractometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An imaging refractrometer can be used to describe the properties of a high-energy density plasma by analyzing the transverse intensity distribution of a laser beam that has passed through the plasma. The output of the refractrometer can be directly calibrated in terms of beam deflection angles using ray transfer matrix analysis. This paper describes a novel way to calibrate the refractrometer output in terms of the spatial wavenumbers of the transverse intensity distribution of the laser beam. This is accomplished by replacing the plasma with a gridded structure that modulates the transverse intensity of the beam, producing an intensity distribution with a known Fourier Transform. This calibration technique will generate a one-to-one mapping of deflection angle to wavenumber and will enable measurement of the size of Fourier space available to the system. The spectrum of wavenumbers generated when the laser beam passes through a high-energy density plasma may contain information about the types of density fluctuation that are present in the plasma.</description>

      <title>Design Optimization of Permanent-Magnet Based Compact Transport Systems for Laser-Driven Proton Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Laser-driven (LD) ion acceleration has been explored in a newly constructed short focal length beamline at the BELLA petawatt facility (interaction point 2, iP2). For applications utilizing such LD ion beams, a beam transport system is required, which for reasons of compactness be ideally contained within 3 m. The large divergence and energy spread of LD ion beams present a unique challenge to transporting them compared to beams from conventional accelerators. This work gives an overview of proposed compact transport designs that can satisfy different requirements depending on the application for the iP2 proton beamline such as radiation biology, material science, and high energy density science. These designs are optimized for different parameters such as energy spread and peak proton density according to an application's need. The various designs consist solely of permanent magnet elements, which can provide high magnetic field gradients on a small footprint. While the field strengths are fixed, we have shown that the beam size and energy can be tuned effectively by varying the placement of the magnets. The performance of each design was evaluated based on high order particle tracking simulations of typical LD proton beams. A more detailed investigation was carried out for a design to deliver 10 MeV LD accelerated ions for radiation biology applications. With these transport system designs, the iP2 beamline is ready to house various application experiments.</description>

      <title>A conservative, implicit solver for 0D-2V multi-species nonlinear Fokker-Planck collision equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present an optimal implicit algorithm designed to accurately solve the multi-species nonlinear 0D-2V axisymmetric Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth (FRP) collision equation while preserving mass, momentum, and energy. We rely on the nonlinear Shkarofsky's formula of FRP (FRPS) collision operator in terms of Legendre polynomial expansions. The key to our meshfree approach is the adoption of the Legendre polynomial expansion for the angular direction and King function (Eq.\EQ{King}) expansion for the velocity axis direction. The Legendre polynomial expansion will converge exponentially and the King method, a moment convergence algorithm, could ensure the conservation with high precision in discrete form. Additionally, a post-step projection to manifolds is employed to exactly enforce symmetries of the collision operators. Through solving several typical problems across various nonequilibrium configurations, we demonstrate the superior performance and high accuracy of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic Waves and Electron Holes in Simulations of Low-Mach Quasi-Perpendicular Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless low Mach number shocks are abundant in astrophysical and space plasma environments, exhibiting complex wave activity and wave-particle interactions. In this paper, we present 2D Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations of quasi-perpendicular nonrelativistic ($\vsh \approx (5500-22000)$ km/s) low Mach number shocks, with a specific focus on studying electrostatic waves in the shock ramp and the precursor regions. In these shocks, an ion-scale oblique whistler wave creates a configuration with two hot counter-streaming electron beams, which drive unstable electron acoustic waves (EAWs) that can turn into electrostatic solitary waves (ESWs) at the late stage of their evolution. By conducting simulations with periodic boundaries, we show that EAW properties agree with linear dispersion analysis. The characteristics of ESWs in shock simulations, including their wavelength and amplitude, depend on the shock velocity. When extrapolated to shocks with realistic velocities ($\vsh \approx 300$ km/s), the ESW wavelength is reduced to one tenth of the electron skin depth and the ESW amplitude is anticipated to surpass that of the quasi-static electric field by more than a factor of 100. These theoretical predictions may explain a discrepancy, between PIC and satellite measurements, in the relative amplitude of high- and low-frequency electric field fluctuations.</description>

      <title>SLAMS-Propelled Electron Acceleration at High-Mach Number Astrophysical Shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02084v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short Large Amplitude Magnetic Structures (SLAMS) are frequently detected during spacecraft crossings over the Earth bow shock. We investigate the existence of such structures at astrophysical shocks, where they could result from the steepening of cosmic-ray (CR) driven waves. Using kinetic particle-in-cell simulations, we study the growth of SLAMS and the appearance of associated transient shocks in the upstream region of quasi-parallel, non-relativistic, high-Mach number collisionless shocks. We find that high-energy CRs significantly enhance the transverse magnetic field within SLAMS, producing highly inclined field lines. As SLAMS are advected towards the shock, these fields lines form an intermittent superluminal configuration which traps magnetized electrons at fast shocks. Due to their oscillatory nature, SLAMS are periodically separated by subluminal gaps with lower transverse magnetic field strength. In these regions, electrons diffuse and accelerate by bouncing between the shock and the approaching SLAMS region through a mechanism that we call quasi-periodic shock acceleration (QSA). We analytically derive the distribution of electrons accelerated via QSA, $f(p)\sim p^{[-4.7,-5.7]}$, which agrees well with the simulation spectra. We find that the electron power law remains steep until the end of our longest runs, providing a possible explanation for the steep electron spectra observed at least up to GeV energies in young and fast supernova remnants.</description>

      <title>Exploring relaxation dynamics in warm dense plasmas by tailoring non-thermal electron distributions with a free electron laser</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04240v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowing the characteristic relaxation time of free electrons in a dense plasma is crucial to our understanding of plasma equilibration and transport. However, experimental investigations of electron relaxation dynamics have been hindered by the ultra-fast, sub-femtosecond time scales on which these interactions typically take place. Here we propose a novel approach that uses x-rays from a free electron laser to generate well-defined non-thermal electron distributions, which can then be tracked via emission spectroscopy from radiative recombination as they thermalize. Collisional radiative simulations reveal how this method can enable the measurement of electron relaxation time scales {\it in situ}, shedding light on the applicability and accuracy of the Coulomb Logarithm framework for modelling collisions in dense plasmas.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MHD scales -- II: the kinematic phase of the supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17036v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} &lt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} &gt; 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} &gt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>Relativistic theory of the viscosity of fluids across the entire energy spectrum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18434v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The shear viscosity is a fundamental transport property of matter. Here we derive a general theory of the viscosity of gases based on the relativistic Langevin equation (deduced from a relativistic Lagrangian) and nonaffine linear response theory. The proposed relativistic theory is able to recover the viscosity of non-relativistic classical gases, with all its key dependencies on mass, temperature, particle diameter and Boltzmann constant, in the limit of Lorentz factor $\gamma=1$. It also unveils the relativistic enhancement mechanism of viscosity. In the limit of ultrarelativistic fluids, the theory provides a new analytical formula which reproduces the cubic increase of viscosity with temperature in agreement with various estimates for hot dense matter and the QGP-type fluid.</description>

      <title>Understanding the Impact of openPMD on BIT1, a Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo Code, through Instrumentation, Monitoring, and In-Situ Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19058v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo simulations on large-scale systems play a fundamental role in understanding the complexities of plasma dynamics in fusion devices. Efficient handling and analysis of vast datasets are essential for advancing these simulations. Previously, we addressed this challenge by integrating openPMD with BIT1, a Particle-in-Cell Monte Carlo code, streamlining data streaming and storage. This integration not only enhanced data management but also improved write throughput and storage efficiency. In this work, we delve deeper into the impact of BIT1 openPMD BP4 instrumentation, monitoring, and in-situ analysis. Utilizing cutting-edge profiling and monitoring tools such as gprof, CrayPat, Cray Apprentice2, IPM, and Darshan, we dissect BIT1's performance post-integration, shedding light on computation, communication, and I/O operations. Fine-grained instrumentation offers insights into BIT1's runtime behavior, while immediate monitoring aids in understanding system dynamics and resource utilization patterns, facilitating proactive performance optimization. Advanced visualization techniques further enrich our understanding, enabling the optimization of BIT1 simulation workflows aimed at controlling plasma-material interfaces with improved data analysis and visualization at every checkpoint without causing any interruption to the simulation.</description>

Abstract: Explosive transient events occur throughout the solar atmosphere. The differing manifestations range from coronal mass ejections to Ellerman bombs. The former may have negligible signatures in the lower atmosphere, and the latter may have negligible nonthermal emissions such as hard X-radiation. A solar flare generally involves a broad range of emission signatures. Using a suite of four space-borne telescopes, we report a solar event that combines aspects of simple UV bursts and hard X-ray emitting flares at the same time. The event is a compact C-class flare in active region AR11861, SOL2013-10-12T00:30. By fitting a combined isothermal and nonthermal model to the hard X-ray spectrum, we inferred plasma temperatures in excess of 15\,MK and a nonthermal power of about $3\times10^{27}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$ in this event. Despite these high temperatures and evidence for nonthermal particles, the flare was mostly confined to the chromosphere. However, the event lacked clear signatures of UV spectral lines, such as the Fe\,{\sc xii} 1349\,\AA\ and Fe\,{\sc xxi} 1354\,\AA\ emission lines, which are characteristic of emission from hotter plasma with a temperature over 1\,MK. Moreover, the event exhibited very limited signatures in the extreme-UV wavelengths. Our study indicates that a UV burst -- hard X-ray flare hybrid phenomenon exists in the low solar atmosphere. Plasma that heats to high temperatures coupled with particle acceleration by magnetic energy that is released directly in the lower atmosphere sheds light on the nature of active region core heating and on inferences of flare signatures.</description>
