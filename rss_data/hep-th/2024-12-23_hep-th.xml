      <title>Operator K-complexity in DSSYK: Krylov complexity equals bulk length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study the notion of complexity under time evolution in chaotic quantum systems with holographic duals. Continuing on from our previous work, we turn our attention to the issue of Krylov complexity upon the insertion of a class of single-particle operators in the double-scaled SYK model. Such an operator is described by a matter-chord insertion, which splits the theory into left/right sectors, allowing us, via chord-diagram technology, to compute two different notions of complexity associated to the operator insertion: firstly the Krylov complexity of Heisenberg evolution, and secondly the complexity of a state obtained by an operator acting on the thermofield double state. We will provide both an analytical proof and detailed numerical evidence, that both Krylov complexities arise from a recursively defined basis of states characterized by a constant total chord number. As a consequence, in all cases we are able to establish that Krylov complexity is given by the expectation value of a length operator acting on the Hilbert space of the theory, expressed in terms of basis states, organized by left and right chord number. We find analytical expressions for the semiclassical limit of K-complexity, and study how the size of the operator encodes the scrambling dynamics upon the matter insertion in Krylov language. We furthermore determine the effective Hamiltonian governing the evolution of K-complexity, showing that evolution on the Krylov chain can equivalently be understood as a particle moving in a Morse potential. A particular type of triple scaling limit allows to access the gravitational sector of the theory, in which the geometrical nature of K-complexity is assured by virtue of being a total chord length, in an analogous fashion to what was found for the K-complexity of the thermofield double state.</description>

      <title>Weak Hopf non-invertible symmetry-protected topological spin liquid and lattice realization of (1+1)D symmetry topological field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce weak Hopf symmetry as a tool to explore (1+1)-dimensional topological phases with non-invertible symmetries. Drawing inspiration from Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), we construct a lattice model featuring two boundary conditions: one that encodes topological symmetry and another that governs non-topological dynamics. This cluster ladder model generalizes the well-known cluster state model. We demonstrate that the model exhibits weak Hopf symmetry, incorporating both the weak Hopf algebra and its dual. On a closed manifold, the symmetry reduces to cocommutative subalgebras of the weak Hopf algebra. Additionally, we introduce weak Hopf tensor network states to provide an exact solution for the model. As every fusion category corresponds to the representation category of some weak Hopf algebra, fusion category symmetry naturally corresponds to a subalgebra of the dual weak Hopf algebra. Consequently,the cluster ladder model offers a lattice realization of arbitrary fusion category symmetries.</description>

      <title>Heterotic String Field Theory with Manifest Spacetime Supersymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the hybrid formalism with manifest $N=1$ $d=4$ spacetime supersymmetry, we construct the quadratic term in the heterotic superstring field theory action. As in open superstring field theory using the hybrid formalism, the heterotic string field theory action is constructed with three string fields and the massless sector describes $N=1$ $d=10$ supergravity in terms of $N=1$ $d=4$ superfields.</description>

      <title>QCD phase diagram from the gluon propagator at finite temperature and density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The screened massive expansion of full QCD is used in conjunction with a model for infrared quark masses to compute the Landau-gauge gluon propagator at finite temperature and baryonic density. Analytic expressions up to a one-dimensional momentum integral are provided for the propagator, and its behavior is studied at zero Matsubara frequency with respect to temperature, chemical potential, and the parameters of the expansion. The phase diagram of QCD is explored under the assumption that the deconfinement temperature can be identified as the position of the maximum of the longitudinal gluon propagator at zero Matsubara frequency and fixed spatial momentum.</description>

      <title>Crossed products and quantum reference frames: on the observer-dependence of gravitational entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A significant step towards a rigorous understanding of perturbative gravitational entropy was recently achieved by a series of works showing that a proper accounting of gauge invariance and observer degrees of freedom converts the Type III algebra of QFT observables in a gravitational subregion to a Type II crossed product, whose entropy reduces to the generalized entropy formula in a semiclassical limit. The observers thus used are also known as quantum reference frames (QRFs); as noted in our companion work [arXiv:2405.00114], using different QRFs result in different algebras, and hence different entropies -- so gravitational entropy is observer-dependent. Here, we provide an in-depth analysis of this phenomenon, with full derivations of many new results. Using the perspective-neutral QRF formalism, we extend previous constructions to allow for arbitrarily many observers, each carrying a clock with possibly degenerate energy spectra. We consider a semiclassical regime characterized by clocks whose energy fluctuations dominate over the fluctuations of the energy of the QFT. Unlike previous works, we allow the clocks and fields to be arbitrarily entangled. At leading order the von Neumann entropy still reduces to the generalized entropy, but linear corrections are typically non-vanishing and quantify the degree of entanglement between the clocks and fields. We also describe an `antisemiclassical' regime as the opposite of the semiclassical one, with suppressed fluctuations of the clock energy; in this regime, we show how the clock may simply be `partially traced' out when evaluating the entropy. Four explicit examples of observer-dependent entropy are then given, involving a gravitational interferometer, degenerate clock superselection, a semiclassical approximation applying to some clocks but not others, and differences between monotonic and periodic clocks.</description>

      <title>Algebras and states in super-JT gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In bosonic JT gravity, minimally coupled to bulk matter, there exists a single, delta-function-normalisable state in each $SL(2,R)$ representation of the matter QFT for any pair of positive energies $E_L, E_R$ at the left and right boundaries. In $\mathcal{N} = 2$ super-JT gravity coupled to matter, we show that there exists a single normalisable state in each $SU(1,1|1)$ matter representation (given appropriate R-charges) that has exactly zero energy at both boundaries. For non-BPS representations, these states have the peculiar property that they break all supersymmetry in the bulk, while preserving supersymmetry at both boundaries. Projecting the algebras of boundary observables onto these zero-energy states leads to a Type II$_1$ von Neumann factor at each boundary that contains a single operator for each supersymmetric matter boundary primary with sufficiently small R-charge. For neutral boundary primaries, the Type II$_1$ factor has a natural action on the matter QFT Hilbert space (with no additional gravitational degrees of freedom) such that the QFT vacuum is the unique tracial state. Moreover, the product of neutral matter operators can be found very explicitly and has a remarkably simple form. When primaries with nonzero matter R-charge are included, the trace can be written as a sum over matter vacuum expectation values associated to each allowed boundary R-charge $J_R$, with the terms in the sum weighted by $\mathrm{cos}(\pi J_R)$. In this way, the ground state algebras encode the ratios of the number of BPS microstates within each R-charge sector. In addition to the results on super-JT gravity described above, we provide a purely Lorentzian derivation of the algebraic structure of canonically quantised (bosonic) JT gravity plus matter, without appeal to the Euclidean gravitational path integrals used in previous work.</description>

      <title>Heat and work in black hole thermodynamics via holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a formulation of black hole thermodynamics that incorporates the notions of heat and work, based on the thermodynamics in quantum theory and the AdS/CFT correspondence. First, for coupled holographic CFTs, we define a coarse-graining procedure adopting the principle of maximum entropy. Employing this approach, when the system is divided into a target system and thermal baths, we formulate the first and second laws, as well as the fundamental thermodynamic relation. Then, by translating the resulting thermodynamics into the AdS gravity language, we construct a thermodynamic framework for composite black hole systems that encompasses both heat and work. This formulation relies on holography, but not on energy conditions on the gravity side. We also argue that the second law serves as a necessary criterion for the UV completeness of gravitational theories.</description>

      <title>Pure connection formalism and Plebanski's second heavenly equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plebanski's second heavenly equation reduces the problem of finding a self-dual Einstein metric to solving a non-linear second-order PDE for a single function. Plebanski's original equation is for self-dual metrics obtained as perturbations of the flat metric. Recently, a version of this equation was discovered for self-dual metrics arising as perturbations around a constant curvature background. We provide a new simple derivation of both versions of the Plebanski second heavenly equation. Our derivation relies on the `pure connection' description of self-dual gravity. Our results also suggest a new interpretation to the kinematic algebra of self-dual Yang-Mills theory, as the Lie algebra of (0,1) vector fields on a R4 endowed with a complex structure.</description>

      <title>Conductivities and excitations of a holographic flavour brane Weyl semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the electrical conductivities at non-zero frequency in a top-down holographic model of a Weyl semimetal, consisting of $\mathcal{N}=4$ supersymmetric $\mathrm{SU}(N_c)$ Yang--Mills theory coupled to $\mathcal{N}=2$ hypermultiplets with mass $m$, subject to an applied axial vector field $b$. The model exhibits a first-order phase transition between a Weyl semimetal phase at small $m/b$ and an insulating phase at large $m/b$. The conductivities develop peaks and troughs as functions of real frequency at low temperatures and for $m/b$ close to the phase transition. We compute the poles of the conductivities as functions of complex frequency, finding poles with small imaginary part at low temperatures and close to the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Feynman Integral Reduction without Integration-By-Parts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15962v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an interesting study of Feynman integral reduction that does not employ integration-by-parts identities. Our approach proceeds by studying the equivalence relations of integral contours in the Feynman parameterization. We find that the integration contour can take a more general form than that given by the Cheng-Wu theorem. We apply this idea to one-loop integrals, and derive universal reduction formulas that can be used to efficiently reduce any one-loop integral. We expect that this approach can be useful in the reduction of multi-loop integrals as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The techniques developed for matrix models and fuzzy geometry are powerful tools for representing strings and membranes in quantum physics. We study the representation of fuzzy surfaces using these techniques. This involves constructing graphs and writing their coordinates and connectivity into matrices. To construct arbitrary graphs and quickly change them, we use 3D software. A script generates the three matrices from the graphs. These matrices are then processed in Wolfram Mathematica to calculate the zero modes of the Dirac operator. Our first result shows the quantization of a two-dimensional Trefoil knot. Additional examples illustrate various properties and behaviors of this process. This helps us to gain a deeper understanding of fuzzy spaces and zero-mode surfaces. This work contributes to advancing the understanding of visualization aspects in fuzzy geometry.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wilson lines and the gravitational scattering of spinning bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A generalization of Wilson line operators at subleading power in the soft expansion has been recently introduced as an efficient building block of gravitational scattering amplitudes for non-spinning objects. The classical limit in this picture corresponds to the strict Regge limit, where the Post-Minkowskian (PM) expansion corresponds to the soft expansion, interpreted as a sum over correlations of soft emissions. Building on the well-studied worldline model with ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetry, in this work we extend the generalized Wilson line (GWL) approach to the case of spinning gravitating bodies. Specifically, at the quantum level we derive from first-principles a representation for the spin $1/2$ GWL that is relevant for the all-order factorization of next-to-soft gravitons with fermionic matter, thus generalizing the exponentiation of single-emission next-to-soft theorems. At the classical level, we identity the suitable generalization of Wilson line operators that enables the generation of classical spin observables at linear order in spin. Thanks to the crucial role played by the soft expansion, the map from Grassmann variables to classical spin is manifest. We also comment on the relation between the GWL approach and the Worldline Quantum Field Theory as well as the Heavy Mass Effective Theory formalism. We validate the approach by rederiving known results in the conservative sector at 2PM order.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to perform an exact calculation of one-loop quantum corrections to black hole entropy in terms of Virasoro semiclassical blocks. We analyse in detail four-dimensional Kerr black hole and show that in the near-extremal limit a branch of long-lived modes arises. We prove that the contribution of these modes accounts for a $(s-1/2)\log T_{\text{Hawking}}$ correction to the entropy for massless particles of spin $s=1,2$. We show that in the full calculation performed in the exact Kerr background the leading contribution actually is sourced by the near-horizon region only, and as such has a universal validity for any asymptotic behavior at infinity.</description>

      <title>Full S-matrices and Witten diagrams with (relative) L-infinity algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $L_\infty$-algebra approach to scattering amplitudes elegantly describes the nontrivial part of the $S$-matrix but fails to take into account the trivial part. We argue that the trivial contribution to the $S$-matrix should be accounted for by another, complementary $L_\infty$-algebra, such that a perturbative field theory is described by a cyclic relative $L_\infty$-algebra. We further demonstrate that this construction reproduces Witten diagrams that arise in AdS/CFT including, in particular, the trivial Witten diagrams corresponding to CFT two-point functions. We also discuss Chern-Simons theory and Yang-Mills theory on manifolds with boundaries using this approach.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic T-duality in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In (super)gravity theories, T-duality relates solutions with an exact isometry which can have wildly different asymptotic behaviors: a well-known example is the duality between BTZ black holes and (non-extremal) three-dimensional black strings. Using this dual pair, we show how the knowledge of a phase space which includes one set of solutions (here, BTZ black holes embedded in the Brown-Henneaux phase space) allows to obtain a phase space for the dual set via an asymptotic notion of T-duality. The resulting asymptotic symmetry algebras can be very different. For our particular example, we find a large algebra of symmetries for the black string phase space which includes as subalgebras $\mathfrak{bms}_2$, $\mathfrak{bms}_3$, and a twisted warped conformal algebra. On the way, we show that a chiral half of the Brown-Henneaux boundary conditions are dual to the Comp\`ere-Song-Strominger ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an alternative formulation of generalized unimodular gravity (GUMG), extending the Henneaux-Teitelboim approach to unimodular gravity (UMG). The central feature of this formulation is the consistent incorporation of time reparameterization, which enhances the gauge structure and reveals a spatial nonlocality hidden in the dynamics of the original formulation. We examine the resulting dynamics, emphasizing the effects of spatial nonlocality, and outline the constraint structure. In particular, we show that the gauge symmetry in the gravitational sector is extended by a functionally incomplete symmetry, as occurs in the unimodular gravity. Furthermore, we identify a subset of GUMG models for which the alternative formulation preserves manifest locality.</description>

      <title>Borel singularities and Stokes constants of the topological string free energy on one-parameter Calabi-Yau threefolds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Borel plane of the topological string free energy on all hypergeometric one-parameter Calabi-Yau models close to singular points in moduli space, focusing on the location of Borel singularities and the value of the associated Stokes constants. We find in particular that in models which exhibit massless D-branes at a singular point, the central charge of the D-brane close to the singular point coincides with the location of the leading Borel singularity, and the generalized Donaldson-Thomas invariant associated to the charge of the D-brane, in as far as its value is known, coincides with the Stokes constant associated to the Borel singularity.</description>

      <title>The Classical Super-Rotation Infrared Triangle</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universality of gravitational scattering at low energies and large distances encoded in soft theorems and memory effects can be understood from symmetries. In four-dimensional asymptotically flat spacetimes the infinite enhancement of translations, extending the Poincar\'e group to the BMS group, is the symmetry underlying Weinberg's soft graviton theorem and the gravitational displacement memory effect. Beyond this leading infrared triangle, loop corrections alter their nature by introducing logarithms in the soft expansion and late time tails to the memory, and this persists in the classical limit. In this work we give the first complete description of an `infrared triangle' where the long-range nature of gravitational interactions is accounted for. Building on earlier results in 2403.13053 where we derived a novel conservation law associated to the infinite dimensional enhancement of Lorentz transformations to superrotations, we prove here its validity to all orders in the gravitational coupling and show that it implies the classical logarithmic soft graviton theorem of Saha-Sahoo-Sen in 1912.06413. We furthermore extend the formula for the displacement memory and its tail from particles to fields, thus completing the classical superrotation infrared triangle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The universality of the logarithmic soft photon theorem in four dimensions can be traced to an infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetry which acts as a local phase rotation on matter as we have shown in 2403.13053. Here we extend our earlier results for the charges associated to these superphaserotations to all orders in the coupling and prove that their conservation is exactly the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem discovered by Saha, Sahoo and Sen in 1912.06413. We furthermore generalize the formulae for the associated electromagnetic displacement memory and its tail from particles to scalar matter fields. This completes the classical superphaserotation infrared triangle.</description>

      <title>Black hole spectroscopy and nonlinear echoes in Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of Einstein-Maxwell-scalar theory with a nonminimal coupling between the electromagnetic and scalar field, we study linear (non)radial perturbations and nonlinear radial dynamics of spherically symmetric black holes. In a certain region of the parameter space, this theory admits hairy black holes with a stable photon sphere. This has a counterpart in the effective potential of linear perturbations, featuring multiple maxima and minima. The corresponding quasinormal mode spectrum contains long-lived modes trapped in the potential cavity and the time-domain linear response displays echoes, as previously observed for horizonless compact objects. Interestingly, the black-hole dynamics in this theory can be studied at the nonlinear level. By performing fully-fledged 1+1 simulations, we show that echoes are present even when the nonlinearities are significant. To our knowledge, this is the first example of echoes appearing in a consistent theory beyond a linearized analysis. In a follow-up work we will study whether this feature is also present in the post-merger signal from black hole collisions in this theory.</description>

      <title>A correspondence between quantum error correcting codes and quantum reference frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a gauge theory, a collection of kinematical degrees of freedom is used to redundantly describe a smaller amount of gauge-invariant information. In a quantum error correcting code (QECC), a collection of computational degrees of freedom that make up a device's physical layer is used to redundantly encode a smaller amount of logical information. We elaborate this clear parallel in terms of quantum reference frames (QRFs), which are a universal toolkit for quantization in the presence of symmetries. The result is a precise dictionary between QECCs and QRFs within the perspective-neutral framework for constrained systems. Concepts from quantum error correction like error sets and correctability translate to novel insights into the informational architecture of gauge theories. Conversely, the dictionary provides a systematic procedure for constructing symmetry-based QECCs and characterizing their error correcting properties. In this initial work, we scrutinize the dictionary between Pauli stabilizer codes and their corresponding QRF setups, which possess symmetry groups that are isomorphic to the stabilizer group. We show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between maximal correctable error sets and tensor factorizations splitting system from frame degrees of freedom, relative to which errors corrupt only redundant frame data. When passed through the dictionary, standard Pauli errors from the code essentially behave as electric excitations that are exactly dual, via Pontryagin duality, to magnetic excitations related to gauge-fixing. We comprehensively illustrate our findings in surface codes, which themselves manifestly connect quantum error correction with gauge systems. The exploratory investigations in this article pave the way for deeper foundational applications to quantum gauge theories and for eventual practical applications to quantum simulation.</description>

      <title>Complete background cosmology of parity-even quadratic metric-affine gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15329v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmology of metric-affine gravity is studied for the general, parity preserving action quadratic in curvature, torsion and non-metricity. The model contains 27 a priori independent couplings in addition to the Einstein constant. Linear and higher order relations between the quadratic operators in a Friedmann--Lemaitre--Robertson--Walker spacetime are obtained, along with the modified Friedmann, torsion and non-metricity equations. Extra parameter constraints lead to two special branches of the model. Firstly, a branch is found in which the Riemannian spatial curvature (thought to be slightly closed or flat in the Lambda-CDM model of our Universe) is entirely screened from all the field equations, regardless of its true value. Secondly, an integrable branch is found which yields (anti) de Sitter expansion at late times. The particle spectra of these two branches are studied, and the need to eliminate higher-spin particles as well as ghosts and tachyons motivates further parameter constraints in each case. The most general model is also found which reproduces the exact Friedmann equations of general relativity. The full set of equations describing closed, open or flat cosmologies, for general parity-even quadratic metric-affine gravity, is made available for SymPy, Mathematica and Maple platforms.</description>

      <title>Non-equatorial scalar rings supported by rapidly spinning Gauss-Bonnet black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15332v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Black-hole spacetimes that possess stationary equatorial matter rings are known to exist in general relativity. We here reveal the existence of black-hole spacetimes that support {\it non}-equatorial matter rings. In particular, it is proved that rapidly-rotating Kerr black holes in the dimensionless large-spin regime ${\bar a}&gt;{\bar a}_{\text{crit}}= \sqrt{\big\{{{7+\sqrt{7}\cos\big[{1\over3}\arctan\big(3\sqrt{3}\big)\big]- \sqrt{21}\sin\big[{1\over3}\arctan\big(3\sqrt{3}\big)\big]}\big\}/12}}\simeq0.78$ can support a pair of non-equatorial massive scalar rings which are negatively coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet curvature invariant of the spinning spacetime (here ${\bar a}\equiv J/M^2$ is the dimensionless angular momentum of the central supporting black hole). We explicitly prove that these non-equatorial scalar rings are characterized by the dimensionless functional relation $-{{57+28\sqrt{21}\cos\big[{1\over3}\arctan\big({{1}\over{3\sqrt{3}}}\big)\big]} \over{8(1+\sqrt{1-{\bar a}^2})^6}} \cdot{{\bar\eta}\over{{\bar\mu}^2}}\to 1^{+}$ in the large-mass ${\bar\mu}\equiv M\mu\gg1$ regime (here $\{{\bar\eta}&lt;0,\mu\}$ are respectively the non-trivial coupling parameter of the composed Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet-massive-scalar field theory and the proper mass of the supported non-minimally coupled scalar field).</description>

      <title>Double rotatory power reversal and continuous Kerr angle in bi-isotropic media with anomalous Hall current</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate optical properties of bi-isotropic materials under the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) of the axion electrodynamics. Four refractive indices associated with circularly polarized waves are achieved, implying circular birefringence with rotatory power (RP) endowed with double sign reversal, an exotic optical signature for chiral dielectrics. The Kerr rotation and ellipticity are analyzed, with an unusual observation of rotation angle deprived of discontinuity. Anomalous reflection (greater than unity) is also reported, associated with negative refraction stemming from the anomalous transport properties. These effects constitute the singular optical signature of a bi-isotropic media with the AHE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the impact of vacuum polarization on light propagation in the background of a distorted, deformed compact object. Focusing on a spacetime containing two quadrupole parameters associated with the central object and external fields, we explore how these parameters influence observable effects as dynamical degrees of freedom. In this setup, we investigate electromagnetic birefringence, noting distinct polarization-dependent photon velocity variations and gravitational lens effects. Although current resolution may limit detection, future high-precision observations could reveal these quantum electrodynamics (QED) induced birefringence effects, advancing our understanding of vacuum birefringence in astrophysical contexts. We further analyze the dependence of shadow properties on the model's variables, using observational data from Sgr A*.</description>

Abstract: We count holomorphic curves in complex 3-space with boundaries on three special Lagrangian solid tori. The count is valued in the HOMFLYPT skein module of the union of the tori. Using 1-parameter families of curves at infinity, we derive three skein valued operator equations which must annihilate the count, and which dequantize to a mirror of the geometry. We show algebraically that the resulting equations determine the count uniquely, and that the result agrees with the topological vertex from topological string theory.</description>

      <title>Neutron stars in 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since the derivation of a well-defined $D\to4$ limit for 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (4DEGB) gravity coupled to a scalar field, there has been considerable interest in testing it as an alternative to Einstein's general theory of relativity. Past work has shown that this theory hosts interesting compact star solutions which are smaller in radius than a Schwarzschild black hole of the same mass in general relativity (GR), though the stability of such objects has been subject to question. In this paper we solve the equations for radial perturbations of neutron stars in the 4DEGB theory with SLy/BSk class EOSs, along with the MS2 EOS, and show that the coincidence of stability and maximum mass points in GR is still present in this modified theory, with the interesting additional feature of solutions re-approaching stability near the black hole solution on the mass-radius diagram. Besides this, as expected from past work, we find that larger values of the 4DEGB coupling $\alpha$ tend to increase the mass of neutron stars of the same radius (due to a larger $\alpha$ weakening gravity) and move the maximum mass points of the solution branches closer to the black hole horizon.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the order parameter in symmetry breaking phase transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15568v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The formation of topological defects in second-order phase transitions can be investigated by solving partial differential equations for the evolution of the order parameter in space and time, such as the Langevin equation. We demonstrate that the ordinary differential equations governing either the temporal or spatial dependence in the Langevin equation provide surprisingly substantial insights into the dynamics of the phase transition. The temporal evolution of the order parameter predicts the essence of the adiabatic-impulse scenario, including the scaling of the freeze-out time, which is crucial to the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In particular, Bernoulli differential equations that arise in the overdamped case can be solved analytically. The spatial part of the evolution, in turn, leads to the characteristic size of domains that choose the same broken symmetry. Apart from the fundamental insights into the KZM, this finding enables the exploration of Kibble-Zurek scaling using ordinary differential equations over a large range of quench timescales, which would otherwise be difficult to achieve with numerical simulations of the full partial differential equations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Cosmological Gravitational Wave Background (CGWB) anisotropies contain valuable information about the physics of the early universe. Given that General Relativity is intrinsically nonlinear, it is important to look beyond first-order contributions in cosmological perturbations. In this work, we present a non-perturbative approach for the computation of CGWB anisotropies at large scales, providing the extension of the initial conditions and the Sachs-Wolfe effect for the CGWB, which encodes the full non-linearity of the scalar metric perturbations. We also derive the non-perturbative expression for three-point correlation of the gravitational wave energy density perturbation in the case of an inflationary CGWB with a scale-invariant power spectrum and negligible primordial non-Gaussianity. We show that, under such conditions, the gravitational wave energy density perturbations are lognormally distributed, leading to an interesting effect such as intermittency.</description>

      <title>Free fall in modified symmetric teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The status of the equivalence principle in modified symmetric teleparallel gravity is examined. In this theory, minimum length geodesics are distinct from autoparallel geodesics, that is, the ``shortest'' paths are not the ``straightest'' paths. We show that a standard argument that singles out metric geodesics in general relativity does not apply in modified symmetric teleparallel gravity. This is because the latter theory does not obey the equivalence principle in the sense of Weinberg. We argue, however, that the structure of the theory makes it inevitable that a freely falling test particle follows a shortest path, a geodesic of the metric. The geodesic equation that governs the motion of a freely falling test particle involves the Levi-Civita connection, not some other connection obtained by solving the connection field equations of the theory. This also has bearing on whether, under appropriate conditions, modified symmetric teleparallel gravity is fully equivalent to general relativity.</description>

In doing so, we resolve a contradiction in the original argument, and in the case of a $\nu = 1/m$ Laughlin holes, we also show that the standard relation between fractional charge and statistics is necessary by an argument based on a t'Hooft anomaly in a one-form global ${\mathcal Z}_m$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Entanglement harvesting in quantum superposed spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15870v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of entanglement harvesting for a spacetime in quantum superposition, using two Unruh-DeWitt detectors interacting with a quantum scalar field where the spacetime background is modeled as a superposition of two quotient Minkowski spaces which are not related by diffeomorphisms. Our results demonstrate that the superposed nature of spacetime induces interference effects that can significantly enhance entanglement for both twisted and untwisted field. We compute the concurrence, which quantifies the harvested entanglement, as function of the energy gap of detectors and their separation. We find that it reaches its maximum when we condition the final spacetime superposition state to match the initial spacetime state. Notably, for the twisted field, the parameter region without entanglement exhibits a significant deviation from that observed in classical Minkowski space or a single quotient Minkowski space.</description>

      <title>The QCD moat regime and its real-time properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dense QCD matter may exhibit crystalline phases. Their existence is reflected in a moat regime, where mesonic correlations feature spatial modulations. We study the realtime properties of pions at finite temperature and density in QCD in order to elucidate the nature of this regime. We show that the moat regime arises from particle-hole-like fluctuations near the Fermi surface. This gives rise to a characteristic peak in the spectral function of the pion at nonzero \emph{spacelike} momentum. This peak can be interpreted as a new quasi particle, the moaton. In addition, our framework also allows us to directly test the stability of the homogeneous chiral phase against the formation of an inhomogeneous condensate in QCD. We find that the formation of such a phase is highly unlikely for baryon chemical potentials $\mu_B \leq 630$\,MeV.</description>

      <title>Effective Metric Description of 2+1 Dimensional Quantum Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15960v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an effective metric description of 2+1 dimensional black holes describing deviations from the classical Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole. The latter is a classical 2+1 dimensional rotating black hole with constant negative curvature. The effective metric is constrained by imposing the black hole symmetries and asymptotic classical behavior. The deformed metric is parametrized in terms of a physical quantity that we choose to be a physical distance. The latter can be solved for in three main regions of interest, the one around the horizon, origin, and spatial infinity. The finiteness of physical quantities at the horizon, such as the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars, leads to universal constraints on the physical parameters of the metric around the horizon. This allows us to further derive the general form of the corrected Hawking temperature in terms of the physical parameters of the effective metric. Assuming that the approach can be generalized to the interior of the black hole, we further develop an effective metric description near the origin. To illustrate the approach, we show how to recast the information encoded in a specific model of quantum BTZ known as quBTZ black hole in terms of the effective metric coefficients.</description>

      <title>Ti and Spi, Carrollian extended boundaries at timelike and spatial infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to provide a definition for a notion of extended boundary at time and space-like infinity which, following Figueroa-O'Farril--Have--Prohazka--Salzer, we refer to as Ti and Spi. This definition applies to asymptotically flat spacetime in the sense of Ashtekar--Romano and we wish to demonstrate, by example, its pertinence in a number of situations. The definition is invariant, is constructed solely from the asymptotic data of the metric and is such that automorphisms of the extended boundaries are canonically identified with asymptotic symmetries. Furthermore, scattering data for massive fields are realised as functions on Ti and a geometric identification of cuts of Ti with points of Minkowksi then produces an integral formula of Kirchhoff type. Finally, Ti and Spi are both naturally equipped with (strong) Carrollian geometries which, under mild assumptions, enable to reduce the symmetry group down to the BMS group, or to Poincar\'e in the flat case. In particular, Strominger's matching conditions are naturally realised by restricting to Carrollian geometries compatible with a discrete symmetry of Spi.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Non-Gaussianity from Neutrino Seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The neutrino mass generation via conventional seesaw mechanism is realized at high scales around $O(10^{14})$GeV and probing new physics of the seesaw scale poses a great challenge. A striking fact is that the neutrino seesaw scale is typically around the cosmological inflation scale. In this work, we propose a framework incorporating inflation and neutrino seesaw in which the inflaton primarily decays into right-handed neutrinos after inflation. This decay process is governed by the inflaton interaction with the right-handed neutrinos that respects the shift symmetry. Under the neutrino seesaw mechanism, fluctuations of the Higgs field can modulate the inflaton decays, contributing to the curvature perturbation. We investigate the induced non-Gaussian signatures and demonstrate that such signatures provides an important means to probe the high-scale neutrino seesaw mechanism.</description>

      <title>Full Parity-Violating Trispectrum in Axion Inflation: Reduction to Low-D Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent measurements of the galaxy 4-Point Correlation Function (4PCF) have seemingly detected non-zero parity-odd modes at high significance. Since gravity, the primary driver of galaxy formation and evolution is parity-even, any parity violation, if genuine, is likely to have been produced by some new parity-violating mechanism in the early Universe. Here we investigate an inflationary model with a Chern-Simons interaction between an axion and a $U(1)$ gauge field, where the axion itself is the inflaton field. Evaluating the trispectrum (Fourier-space analog of the 4PCF) of the primordial curvature perturbations is an involved calculation with very high-dimensional loop integrals. We demonstrate how to simplify these integrals and perform all angular integrations analytically by reducing the integrals to convolutions and exploiting the Convolution Theorem. This leaves us with low-dimensional radial integrals that are much more amenable to efficient numerical evaluation. This paper is the first in a series in which we will use these results to compute the full late-time 4PCF for axion inflation, thence enabling constraints from upcoming 3D spectroscopic surveys such as Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), Euclid, or Roman.</description>

      <title>Twist-tuned quantum criticality in moir\'e bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We argue that moir\'e bilayer graphene at charge neutrality hosts a continuous semimetal-to-insulator quantum phase transition that can be accessed experimentally by tuning the twist angle between the two layers. For small twist angles near the first magic angle, the system realizes a Kramers intervalley-coherent insulator, characterized by circulating currents and spontaneously broken time reversal and U(1) valley symmetries. For larger twist angles above a critical value, the spectrum remains gapless down to the lowest temperatures, with a fully symmetric Dirac semimetal ground state. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock theory applied to a realistic model of twisted bilayer graphene, based on the Bistritzer-MacDonald Hamiltonian augmented by screened Coulomb interactions, we find that the twist-tuned quantum phase transition is continuous. We argue that the quantum critical behavior belongs to the relativistic Gross-Neveu-XY universality class, and we characterize it through an effective field theory analysis. Our theoretical predictions can be directly tested using current experimental setups incorporating the recently developed quantum twisting microscope.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Chromodynamics in two spacetime dimensions is investigated with the Functional Renormalization Group. We use a functional formulation with covariant gauge fixing and derive Renormalization Group flow equations for the gauge coupling, quark mass and an algebraically complete set of local fermion-fermion interaction vertices. The flow, based on a convenient Callan-Symanzik-type regularization, shows the expected behavior for a super-renormalizable theory in the ultraviolet regime and leads to a strongly coupled regime in the infrared. Through a detailed discussion of symmetry implications, and variations in the gauge group and flavor numbers, the analysis sets the stage for a more detailed investigation of the bound state spectrum in future work.</description>

      <title>Quantitative classicality in cosmological interactions during inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16143v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the classical and quantum evolution of inflationary cosmological perturbations from quantum initial conditions, using the on-shell and off-shell contributions to correlators to investigate the signatures of interactions. In particular, we calculate the Keldysh contributions to the leading order bispectrum from past infinity, showing that the squeezed limit is dominated by the on-shell evolution. By truncating the time integrals in the analytic expressions for contributions to the bispectrum, we define a `quantum interactivity' and quantitatively identify scales and times for which it is sufficient to only assume classical evolution, given a fixed precision. In contrast to common perceptions inspired by free two-point functions, we show that common non-linear terms of inflationary perturbations can be well-described by classical evolution even prior to horizon crossing. The insights gained here can pave the way for quantitative criteria for justifying the validity of numerically simulating the generation and evolution of quantum fluctuations in inflation. In particular, we comment on the validity of using stochastic inflation to reproduce known in-in perturbative results. An extensive appendix provides a review of the Keldysh formulation of the in-in formalism with the initial state set at a finite, as opposed to infinite past, emphasizing the importance of considering temporal boundary terms and the initial state for correctly obtaining the propagators. We also show how stochastic dynamics can emerge as a sufficient approximation to the full quantum evolution. This becomes particularly transparent in the Keldysh description.</description>

Abstract: We study the quantum gravitational corrections to the geometry of a four-dimensionalcharged (Reissner-Nordstr\"om) Anti de Sitter black hole starting from an effective field theory approach to quantum gravity. We use the expression of the modified horizon radius to compute the quantum corrected Wald entropy, whose expression reproduces the logarithmic behaviour found by other methods. We perform a thermodynamics analysis and compute the quantum gravitational corrections to the temperature, pressure, specific heat and Helmholtz free energy. All these quantities are renormalisation group invariant. We find that a quantum charged AdS black hole can exist only for a bounded range of masses and that it can undergo a second order phase transition as it moves from a state with positive specific heat to a negative one.</description>

      <title>An axion-like mechanism as sufficient condition for confinement in QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01047v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This letter is about confinement in QCD. At the moment we have pictures of confinement to complete our understanding of the physics of strongly interacting particles, interaction which asks for confinement. As it is said in [1] : " In principle it should be possible to derive the confinement hypothesis from the QCD Lagrangian. At this time, no rigorous derivation exists, so it is not absolutely clear that the confinement hypothesis is a bone fide prediction of QCD". In this letter we show that a sufficient (of course not necessary) condition for confinement is that topological structure of vacuum in Nature does not correspond to the $\theta$-vacuum. Therefore, if different vacua with nontrivial winding number cannot be connected by tunneling, we obtain confinement as a consequence. Moreover, we show that an axion-like mechanism would suffice to describe a confined QCD phase.</description>

Abstract: Placing a black hole in a cavity provides a natural framework for exploring gravitational scales, thermodynamic instabilities, and effective gravity theories. In this paper, we examine the evolution of entanglement entropy and entanglement islands in a two-sided extension of the Schwarzschild black hole in a cavity. By introducing a reflecting boundary in the eternal black hole exteriors, we regulate the infrared modes of Hawking radiation, finding that the entanglement entropy eventually saturates at a constant value. This value can be lower than the black hole thermodynamic entropy, thus avoiding the Page formulation of the information paradox. Regarding entanglement islands, we identify a universal effect induced by the boundary, which we term the ``blinking island'' -- where the entanglement island temporarily disappears, resulting in a short-time information paradox.</description>

Abstract: We construct a new type of holographic correspondence between non-relativistic string theory in String Newton-Cartan AdS$_5\times$S$^5$ and Galilean Electrodynamics supplemented with 5 uncharged massless free scalar fields living on the 3+1 dimensional Penrose conformal boundary. In our derivation, we start with Maldacena's setting of a stack of $N$ coincident D3-branes and we show that the near-horizon/decoupling limit commutes with the non-relativistic limit, giving a unique answer both from the gravity and gauge theory perspectives. As a first evidence, we systematically compute the Killing vectors on the string theory side, and find that they match the symmetries of the dual gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.03547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One-loop integrands in Cachazo-He-Yuan (CHY) formula, which is based on the forward limit of tree-level amplitudes, involves linear propagators that are different from quadratic ones in traditional Feynman diagrams. In this paper, we provide a general approach to converting linear propagators in one-loop CHY formula into quadratic propagators, by refined graphic rule stemming from the recursive expansion of tree-level Einstein-Yang-Mills amplitudes. Particularly, we establish the correspondence between refined graphs and bi-adjoint scalar (BS) Feynman diagrams with linear propagators. Using this correspondence and graph-based relations of Berends-Giele currents in BS theory, the nonlocal terms accompanied by refined graphs can either be canceled out or be collected into local ones. Once the locality has been achieved, the integrand with linear propagators can be directly arranged into that with quadratic propagators. Following this approach, we first convert the linear propagators in single-trace Yang-Mills-scalar (YMS) integrands (with a pure-scalar loop) into quadratic ones. This result is then demonstrated to match the traditional one-loop Feynman diagrams. The discussions on single-trace YMS integrands are generalized to multi-trace YMS and Yang-Mills integrands.</description>

Abstract: Finite-temperature one-loop renormalization of the Standard Model, coupled with dynamic metric, is conducted in this study. The entire analysis is coherently carried out by using the refined background field method, applied in the spirit of the Coleman-Weinberg technique. The general form of the propagator, introduced in our previous work to facilitate Feynman diagram computation in a general curved background, proves useful in the presence of time-dependent temperature. Its utilization allows for the renormalization analysis of a FLRW background to essentially reduce to that of a constant finite-T flat spacetime. The implications of our findings for cosmology, particularly the cosmological constant problem and Hubble tension, are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There exist several good reasons why one may wish to add a total derivative to an interaction in quantum field theory, e.g., in order to improve the perturbative construction. Unlike in classical field theory, adding derivatives in general changes the theory. The analysis whether and how this can be prevented, is presently limited to perturbative orders $g^n$ , $n \leq 3$. We drastically simplify it by an all-orders formula, which also allows to answer some salient structural questions. The method is part of a larger program to (re)derive interactions of particles by quantum consistency conditions, rather than a classical principle of gauge invariance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that scale-invariant special Kahler geometries whose generic r-complex-dimensional abelian variety fiber is isomorphic (completely split) or isogenous (completely iso-split) as a complex torus to the product of r one-dimensional complex tori have constant $\tau^{ij}$ modulus on the Coulomb branch, i.e., are isotrivial. These simple results are useful in organizing the classification of scale-invariant special Kahler geometries, which, in turn, is relevant to the classification of possible 4-dimensional N=2 supersymmetric superconformal field theories.</description>

      <title>All-loop heavy-heavy-light-light correlators in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Heavy-Heavy-Light-Light (HHLL) correlators $\langle \mathcal{H} \mathcal{H} \mathcal{O}_2 \mathcal{O}_2 \rangle$ in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory with $SU(N)$ gauge group at generic $N$. The light operator $\mathcal{O}_2$ is the dimension two superconformal primary in the stress tensor multiplet and $\mathcal{H}$ is a general half-BPS superconformal primary operator with dimension (or $R$-charge) $\Delta_{\mathcal{H}}$. We consider the large-charge 't Hooft limit, where $\Delta_{\mathcal{H}} \rightarrow \infty$ with fixed 't Hooft-like coupling $\lambda:=\Delta_{\mathcal{H}}\, g_{_{\rm YM}}^2$. We show that the $L$-loop contribution to the HHLL correlators in the leading large-charge limit is universal for any choice of the heavy operator $\mathcal{H}$, given as $\lambda^L \sum_{\ell=0}^{L} \Phi^{(\ell)} \Phi^{(L-\ell)}$ with an $SU(N)$ colour factor coefficient, where $\Phi^{(\ell)}$ is the ladder Feynman integral, which is known to all loops. The dependence on the explicit form of the heavy operator lies only in the colour factor coefficients. We determine such colour factors for several classes of heavy operators, and show that the large charge limit leads to minimal powers of $N$. For the special class of "canonical heavy operators", one can even resum the all-loop ladder integrals and determine the correlators at finite $\lambda$. Furthermore, upon integrating over the spacetime dependence, the resulting integrated HHLL correlators agree with the existing results derived from supersymmetric localisation. Finally, as an application of the all-loop analytic results, we derive exact expressions for the structure constants of two heavy operators and the Konishi operator, finding intriguing connections with the integrated HHLL correlators.</description>

      <title>Celestial $Lw_{1+\infty}$ charges from a twistor action</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04028v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The celestial $Lw_{1+\infty}$ symmetries in asymptotically flat spacetimes have a natural geometric interpretation on twistor space in terms of Poisson diffeomorphisms. Using this framework, we provide a first-principle derivation of the canonical generators associated with these symmetries starting from the Poisson BF twistor action for self-dual gravity. We express these charges as surface integrals over the celestial sphere in terms of spacetime data at null infinity. The connection between twistor space and spacetime expressions at $\mathscr{I}$ is achieved via an integral formula for the asymptotic Bianchi identities due to Bramson and Tod. Finally, we clarify how $Lw_{1+\infty}$ transformations are symmetries of gravity from a phase space perspective by showing the invariance of the asymptotic Bianchi identities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20964v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the differential geometry of the moduli space of instantons on S^3 x S^1. Extending previous results, we show that a sigma-model with this target space can be expected to possess a large N=4 superconformal symmetry, supporting speculations that this sigma-model may be dual to Type IIB superstring theory on AdS_3 x S^3 x S^3 x S^1. The sigma-model is parametrized by three integers -- the rank of the gauge group, the instanton number, and a "level" (the integer coefficient of a topologically nontrivial B-field, analogous to a WZW level). These integers are expected to correspond to two five-brane charges and a one-brane charge. The sigma-model is weakly coupled when the level, conjecturally corresponding to one of the five-brane changes, becomes very large, keeping the other parameters fixed. The central charges of the large N=4 algebra agree, at least semiclassically, with expectations from the duality.</description>

      <title>Two-field models in the presence of impurities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03603v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work deals with systems of two real scalar fields coupled to impurity functions, meant to model inhomogeneities often encountered in real physical applications. We investigate the theoretical properties of these systems and some of the consequences of impurity doping. We show that the theory may be modified in a way that preserves some BPS sectors, while also greatly impacting the behavior and internal structure of the solution, and exemplify those results with an investigation of a few interesting models in which impurities are coupled to a theory with a quartic potential. It is shown that, in the presence of impurities, the asymptotic behavior of field configurations may be changed, leading to solutions with different long-range properties, which are relevant to several physical applications. Our examples also highlight other important consequences that may follow from the addition of impurities, such as the presence of zero-modes that can significantly change the internal structure of a given solution without altering its energy, the creation of new topological sectors that did not exist in the impurity-free theory, and the possibility of stable, nontrivial configurations generated by topologically trivial boundary conditions. We have also shown that it is sometimes possible to find energy minimizers in BPS sectors which were unpopulated in the canonical theory. These features show that impurities allow for significant flexibility in both the form of energy minimizers and the boundary conditions used to generate them, which may potentially broaden the range of applicability of the theory.</description>

Abstract: We classify a one-parameter family, $\mathfrak{confcarr}_z(d+1)$, of conformal extensions of the Carroll algebra in arbitrary dimension with $z$ being the anisotropic scaling exponent. We further obtain their infinite-dimensional extensions, $\widetilde{\mathfrak{confcarr}}_z(d+1)$, and discuss their corresponding finite-dimensional truncated subalgebras when the scaling exponent is integer or half-integer. For all these conformal extensions, we also constrain the 2-point and 3-point correlation functions with electric and/or magnetic features.</description>

Abstract: Generating functions $h_r(\tau)$ of D4-D2-D0 BPS indices, appearing in Calabi-Yau compactifications of type IIA string theory and identical to rank 0 Donaldson-Thomas invariants, are known to be higher depth mock modular forms satisfying a specific modular anomaly equation, with depth determined by the D4-brane charge $r$. We develop a method to solve the anomaly equation for arbitrary charges, in terms of indefinite theta series. This allows us to find the generating functions up to modular forms that can be fixed by computing just a finite number of Fourier coefficients of $h_r$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct new infinite classes of Euclidean supersymmetric solutions of four dimensional minimal gauged supergravity comprising a $U (1) \times U (1)$-invariant asymptotically locally hyperbolic metric on the total space of orbifold line bundles over a spindle (bolt). The conformal boundary is generically a squashed, branched, lens space and the graviphoton gauge field can have either twist or anti-twist through the spindle bolt. Correspondingly, the boundary geometry inherits two types of rigid Killing spinors, that we refer to as twist and anti-twist for the three-dimensional Seifert orbifolds, as well as some specific flat connections for the background gauge field, determined by the data of the spindle bolt. For all our solutions we compute the holographically renormalized on-shell action and compare it to the expression obtained via equivariant localization, uncovering a markedly distinct behaviour in the cases of twist and anti twist. Our results provide precise predictions for the large $N$ limit of the corresponding localized partition functions of three-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ superconformal field theories placed on Seifert orbifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Chamblin-Reall gravity is a remarkable non-conformal platform for the fluid/gravity correspondence to achieve its maximum efficiency. When a probe scalar field that does not change the background metric is manually introduced into the action of the gravity side, an external scalar field will appear at the boundary, and the gradients of the external scalar field will act as a driving force exerting on the dual relativistic fluid. Thus the dynamics of the fluid will be affected in the way that the stress tensor is no longer conserved. We will use the fluid/gravity correspondence to derive the transport coefficients related to the external scalar field and the explicit expression of the driving force.</description>

      <title>Towards Hamiltonian Formalism for String Field Theory and Nonlocality</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String field theories exhibit exponential suppression of interactions among component fields at high energies due to infinite-derivative factors such as $e^{\ell^2 \Box / 2}$ in their vertices. This nonlocality has hindered the development of a consistent Hamiltonian formalism, leading some to question whether such a formalism is even viable. To address this challenge, we introduce a toy model inspired by string field theory, and construct its Hamiltonian formalism by demanding that all correlation functions derived from the path-integral formalism are reproduced. Within this framework, we demonstrate that negative-norm states are eliminated by physical-state conditions, while zero-norm states decouple from the physical state space. This approach provides a novel perspective on the nonlocality inherent in string field theories.</description>

      <title>On the $1/c$ expansion in $2d$ CFTs with degenerate operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analytically determine the large central charge asymptotic expansion of the Virasoro conformal blocks entering in four-point functions with external degenerate operators on a sphere in $2d$ CFTs, and study its resurgence properties as a function of the conformal cross-ratio $z$. We focus on the cases of four heavy $(2,1)$ degenerate operators, and two $(2,1)$ heavy degenerate ones plus two arbitrary light operators. The $1/c$ asymptotic series is Borel summable for generic values of $z$, but it jumps when a Stokes line is crossed. Starting from the $1/c$ series of the identity block, we show how a resurgent analysis allows us to completely determine the other Virasoro block and in fact to reconstruct the full correlator. We also show that forbidden singularities, known to exist in correlators with two heavy and two light operators, appear with four heavy operators as well. In both cases, they are turning points emanating Stokes lines, artefacts of the asymptotic expansion, and we show how they are non perturbatively resolved. More general correlators and implications for gravitational theories in $\text{AdS}_{3}$ are briefly discussed. Our results are based on new asymptotic expansions for large parameters $(a,b,c)$ of certain hypergeometric functions $\,_2 F_1(a,b,c;z)$ which can be useful in general.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we investigate the renormalization of the gauge-invariant composite operators proposed in \cite{Dudal:2023jsu} to describe the $SU(2)\times U(1)$ Higgs model from a gauge-invariant perspective. To establish the relationship between the counterterms, we use the Algebraic Renormalization approach \cite{Piguet:1995er}. Therefore, we also derive the set of Ward identities of the model after introducing these composite operators. Using these Ward identities, we demonstrate important exact relations between the correlation functions of elementary fields and composite fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10172v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We reconsider the Equivalence Theorem from an algebraic viewpoint, using an extended BRST symmetry. This version of the Equivalence Theorem is then used to reexpress the Abelian Higgs model action, originally written in terms of undesirable gauge variant field excitations, in terms of gauge-invariant, physical variables, corresponding to the Fr\"ohlich-Morchio-Strocchi composite operators in the original field formulation. Although the ensuing action encompasses an infinite number of vertices and appears to be nonrenormalizable from the powercounting viewpoint, it nevertheless is renormalizable, thanks to the hidden equivalence with the original model. Hence, manifestly gauge-invariant computations are possible. We present an explicit illustration in terms of the gauge-invariant scalar field, its Green's function and corresponding pole mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Equilibrium states of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory can be characterized by the temperature and three chemical potentials, corresponding to the ${\rm U}(1)^3$ subgroup of the $R$-symmetry group. We investigate the phase diagram of the theory at strong coupling, in the grand canonical ensemble in flat space, using its holographic description via the five-dimensional model of Behrnd, Cveti\v{c}, and Sabra. The bulk action includes the metric, three Abelian gauge fields, and two neutral scalar fields. The equilibrium state described by the charged black brane is always thermodynamically unstable at low temperature. Relativistic hydrodynamics with multiple conserved charges predicts that thermodynamic instability is accompanied by a dynamical instability, with the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the corresponding Hessian playing a key role in identifying the unstable modes. We explicitly demonstrate this for three equal chemical potentials, finding unstable quasinormal modes that describe $R$-charge diffusion. Consequently, the low-temperature phase of ${\cal N}=4$ supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory with equal chemical potentials is not described by the AdS-Reissner-Nordstr\"om black brane.</description>

      <title>The heat flow conjecture for polynomials and random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.09660v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the roots of a polynomial of degree $N$, when the polynomial itself is evolving according to the heat flow. We propose a general conjecture for the large-$N$ limit of this evolution. Specifically, we propose (1) that the log potential of the limiting root distribution should evolve according to a certain first-order, nonlinear PDE, and (2) that the limiting root distribution at a general time should be the push-forward of the initial distribution under a certain explicit transport map. These results should hold for sufficiently small times, that is, until singularities begin to form.
  We offer three lines of reasoning in support of our conjecture. First, from a random matrix perspective, the conjecture is supported by a deformation theorem for the second moment of the characteristic polynomial of certain random matrix models. Second, from a dynamical systems perspective, the conjecture is supported by the computation of the second derivative of the roots with respect to time, which is formally small before singularities form. Third, from a PDE perspective, the conjecture is supported by the exact PDE satisfied by the log potential of the empirical root distribution of the polynomial, which formally converges to the desired PDE as $N\rightarrow \infty.$ We also present a "multiplicative" version of the the conjecture, supported by similar arguments.
  Finally, we verify rigorously that the conjectures hold at the level of the holomorphic moments.</description>

Abstract: The boundary structure of $3+1$-dimensional gravity (in the Palatini-Cartan formalism) coupled to to gauge (Yang-Mills) and matter (scalar and spinorial) fields is described through the use of the Kijowski-Tulczijew construction. In particular, the reduced phase space is obtained as the reduction of a symplectic space by some first class constraints and a cohomological description (BFV) of it is presented.</description>

      <title>The gauge symmetry violation in the QCD ground state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.04561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The purpose of this work is to report on convincing progress made in the investigation of the one of the true dynamical and gauge structures of the QCD ground state (vacuum). It also sheds new significunt insights into a mass squared dynamical generation in it. For this purpose, we use only the tensor algebra derivation rigorous rules in dealing with the corresponding skeleton loop integrals, contributing into the full gluon self-energy. The novel constraint on any solution to QCD has been exactly and uniquely derived in the framework of the Slavnov-Taylor identities for the gauge particles propagators. Its general solution makes it possible tpprove that the gauge symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian is groken in its state. The dynamical source of this effect has to be identified with the constant tadpole term, having the dimension of a mass squared. The exact proof has been given that it cannot be disregarded from the theory and its ground state by ant means. The gauge symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian forbids such kind of terms, but the perturbative renormalizability of the theory will not be affected. The particular solution of the novel constraint describes the gluon field configurations with unbroken gauge symmetry in the QCD vacuum. The solution with broken gauge symmetry dominates over the solution with unbroken one at large distances, while being in agreement with it at short distances.</description>

      <title>Real-Time Nucleation and Off-Equilibrium Effects in High-Temperature Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study real-time nucleation in perturbative high-temperature quantum field theories. Specifically, we consider the evolution of thermal particles driven out of equilibrium by nucleation. These particles form the thermal bath for the nucleating bubbles, and their off-equilibrium dynamics back-react on the bubbles, modifying the nucleation rates. Utilizing kinetic Boltzmann descriptions for the thermal particles, we derive modifications to Langer's nucleation rate arising from the off-equilibrium effects, unaccounted for in Linde's thermal rate. Importantly, we establish a connection to equilibrium computations of nucleation rates, particularly with the effective field theory approach, showing that they correctly capture the leading parts of the logarithm of the rate. We also show that the dominant damping of nucleation from a light bosonic quantum field arises from its corresponding long-wavelength classical modes, rather than the associated hard particles. This work provides a foundation for further studies of off-equilibrium effects in nucleation rates for realistic Standard Model extensions.</description>

      <title>STOLAS: STOchastic LAttice Simulation of cosmic inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10692v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a C++ package of the STOchastic LAttice Simulation (STOLAS) of cosmic inflation. It performs the numerical lattice simulation in the application of the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism. STOLAS can directly compute the three-dimensional map of the observable curvature perturbation without estimating its statistical properties. In its application to two toy models of inflation, chaotic inflation and Starobinsky's linear-potential inflation, we confirm that STOLAS is well-consistent with the standard perturbation theory. Furthermore, by introducing the importance sampling technique, we have success in numerically sampling the current abundance of primordial black holes in a non-perturbative way. The package is available at https://github.com/STOchasticLAtticeSimulation/STOLAS_dist.</description>

      <title>Opening the Black Box: predicting the trainability of deep neural networks with reconstruction entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An important challenge in machine learning is to predict the initial conditions under which a given neural network will be trainable. We present a method for predicting the trainable regime in parameter space for deep feedforward neural networks (DNNs) based on reconstructing the input from subsequent activation layers via a cascade of single-layer auxiliary networks. We show that a single epoch of training of the shallow cascade networks is sufficient to predict the trainability of the deep feedforward network on a range of datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, FashionMNIST, and white noise), thereby providing a significant reduction in overall training time. We achieve this by computing the relative entropy between reconstructed images and the original inputs, and show that this probe of information loss is sensitive to the phase behaviour of the network. We further demonstrate that this method generalizes to residual neural networks (ResNets) and convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Moreover, our method illustrates the network's decision making process by displaying the changes performed on the input data at each layer, which we demonstrate for both a DNN trained on MNIST and the vgg16 CNN trained on the ImageNet dataset. Our results provide a technique for significantly accelerating the training of large neural networks.</description>

      <title>On Wigner Degeneracy in Elko theory: Hermiticity and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a set of Hermitian interactions for quantum fields based on Elko, considering the recent achievements concerning the most general form of singular spinors and Wigner degeneracy. We consider Hermiticity and renormalizability a criterion to define the derivative Elko-Higgs interaction as the suitable candidate for a dark coupling. Then, the free parameters of the model are fixed by cosmological constraints on the dark matter abundance, bounds on the Higgs invisible decays, and limits on the electron-dark matter scattering mediated by the Higgs.</description>

      <title>Sound Speed Resonance of Gravitational Waves in Gauss-Bonnet-coupled inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the occurrence of Sound Speed Resonances (SSR) in Gauss-Bonnet-coupled inflation across a wide range of coupling functions and parameters. After inflation, the damped oscillations of the inflaton around its potential minimum induces damped oscillations of the sound speed of tensor modes, leading to resonant amplification of the latter. Once the inflaton stabilizes around the minimum, the tensor sound speed reduces to unity (speed of light). In the context of multi-field inflation, the sound speed oscillations can be followed by a second phase of inflation, resulting in a distinctive stochastic background of Gravitational Waves (GWs). We show that these GW signals can be probed by upcoming experiments such as $\textbf{SKA}$, $\textbf{DECIGO}$, and $\textbf{BBO}$ depending on the duration of the second inflationary phase.</description>

      <title>Overcoming the Zero-Rate Hashing Bound with Holographic Quantum Error Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06232v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A crucial insight for practical quantum error correction is that different types of errors, such as single-qubit Pauli operators, typically occur with different probabilities. Finding an optimal quantum code under such biased noise is a challenging problem, related to finding the (generally unknown) maximum capacity of the corresponding noisy channel. A benchmark for this capacity is given by the hashing bound, describing the performance of random stabilizer codes, which leads to the challenge of finding codes that reach or exceed this bound while also being efficiently decodable. In this work, we show that asymptotically zero-rate holographic codes, built from hyperbolic tensor networks that model holographic bulk/boundary dualities, fulfill both conditions. Of the five holographic code models considered, all are found to reach the hashing bound in some bias regime and one, the holographic surface-code fragment, appears to even exceed the capacity of previously known codes in the 2-Pauli-dominated noise regime. In addition, we consider Clifford deformations that allow all considered codes to reach the hashing bound for 1-Pauli-dominated noise as well. Our results thus establish that holographic codes, which were previously shown to possess efficient tensor-network decoders, also exhibit competitive thresholds under biased noise.</description>

      <title>Coadjoint-orbit bosonization of a Fermi surface in a weak magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a bosonized effective field theory for a 2d Fermi surface in a weak magnetic field using the coadjoint orbit approach, which was recently developed as a nonlinear bosonization method in phase space for Fermi liquids and non-Fermi liquids. We show that by parametrizing the phase space with the guiding center and the mechanical momentum, and by using techniques in noncommutative field theory, the physics of Landau levels and Landau level degeneracy ($N_{\Phi}$) naturally arises. For a parabolic dispersion, the resulting theory describes $N_{\Phi}$ flavors of free chiral bosons propagating in \emph{momentum space}. In addition, the action contains a linear term in the bosonic field, which upon mode expansion becomes a topological $\theta$-term. By properly quantizing this theory, we reproduce the well-known thermal and magnetic responses of a Fermi surface, including linear-in-$T$ specific heat, Landau diamagnetism, and the de Haas-van Alphen effect. {In particular, the de Haas-van Alphen effect is shown to be a direct consequence of the topological $\theta$-term.} Our theory paves the way toward understanding correlated gapless fermionic systems in a magnetic field using the powerful approach of bosonization.</description>

      <title>Effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.16878v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bell-network states are a class of entangled states of the geometry that satisfy an area-law for the entanglement entropy in a limit of large spins and are automorphism-invariant, for arbitrary graphs. We present a comprehensive analysis of the effective geometry of Bell-network states on a dipole graph. Our main goal is to provide a detailed characterization of the quantum geometry of a class of diffeomorphism-invariant, area-law states representing homogeneous and isotropic configurations in loop quantum gravity, which may be explored as boundary states for the dynamics of the theory. We found that the average geometry at each node in the dipole graph does not match that of a flat tetrahedron. Instead, the expected values of the geometric observables satisfy relations that are characteristic of spherical tetrahedra. The mean geometry is accompanied by fluctuations with considerable relative dispersion for the dihedral angle, and perfectly correlated for the two nodes.</description>

      <title>Angular integrals with three denominators via IBP, mass reduction, dimensional shift, and differential equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18177v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Angular integrals arise in a wide range of perturbative quantum field theory calculations. In this work we investigate angular integrals with three denominators in $d=4-2\varepsilon$ dimensions. We derive integration-by-parts relations for this class of integrals, leading to explicit recursion relations and a reduction to a small set of master integrals. Using a differential equation approach we establish results up to order $\varepsilon$ for general integer exponents and masses. Here, reduction identities for the number of masses, known results for two-denominator integrals, and a general dimensional-shift identity for angular integrals considerably reduce the required amount of work. For the first time we find for angular integrals a term contributing proportional to a Euclidean Gram determinant in the $\varepsilon$-expansion. This coefficient is expressed as a sum of Clausen functions with intriguing connections to Euclidean, spherical, and hyperbolic geometry. The results of this manuscript are applicable to phase-space calculations with multiple observed final-state particles.</description>

      <title>On the geometry of Lagrangian one-forms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Lagrangian multiform theory is a variational framework for integrable systems. In this article we introduce a new formulation which is based on symplectic geometry and which treats position, momentum and time coordinates of a finite-dimensional integrable hierarchy on an equal footing. This formulation allows a streamlined one-step derivation of both the multi-time Euler-Lagrange equations and the closure relation (encoding integrability). We argue that any Lagrangian one-form for a finite-dimensional system can be recast in our new framework. We also show that our new framework easily extends to non-commuting flows corresponding to nonabelian Lie groups. Thus Hamiltonian Lie group actions can be derived from a variational principle.</description>
