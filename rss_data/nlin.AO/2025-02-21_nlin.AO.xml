      <title>Noise-driven Synchronization of Vicsek Model in Mean</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Vicsek model has long stood as a pivotal framework in exploring collective behavior and self-organization, captivating the scientific community with its compelling dynamics. However, understanding how noise influences synchronization within this model and its associated phase transition characteristics has presented significant challenges. While numerous studies have focused on simulations due to the model's mathematical complexity, comprehensive theoretical analyses remain sparse. In this paper, we deliver a rigorous mathematical proof demonstrating that for any initial configuration of the Vicsek model, there exists a bound on noise amplitude such that if the noise amplitude is maintained within this bound, the system will achieve synchronization in mean. This finding not only lays a solid mathematical groundwork for the Vicsek model's phase transition theory but also underscores the critical role of noise in collective dynamics, enhancing our understanding of self-organizing systems in stochastic environments.</description>

      <title>The diffusive dynamics and electrochemical regulation of weak polyelectrolytes across liquid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework to study the spatio-temporal evolution of liquid-liquid phase separation of weak polyelectrolytes in ionic solutions. Unlike strong polyelectrolytes, which carry a fixed charge, the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes is modulated by the electrochemical environment through protonation and deprotonation processes. Leveraging numerical simulations and analysis, our work reveals how solution acidity (pH) influences the formation, interactions, and structural properties of phase-separated coacervates. We find that pH gradients can be maintained across coacervate interfaces resulting in a clear distinction in the electro-chemical properties within and outside the coacervate. By regulating the charge state of weak polyelectrolytes, pH gradients interact and modulate the electric double layer forming at coacervate interfaces eventually determining how they interact. Further linear and nonlinear analyses of stationary localised solutions reveal a rich spectrum of behaviours that significantly distinguish weak from strong polyelectrolytes. Overall, our results demonstrate the importance of charge regulation on phase-separating solutions of charge-bearing molecules and the possibility of harnessing charge-regulated mechanisms to control coacervates and shape their stability and spatial organisation.</description>

      <title>Optimal coordination of resources: A solution from reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient allocation is important in nature and human society, where individuals frequently compete for limited resources. The Minority Game (MG) is perhaps the simplest toy model to address this issue. However, most previous solutions assume that the strategies are provided a priori and static, failing to capture their adaptive nature. Here, we introduce the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to MG, where individuals adjust decisions based on accumulated experience and expected rewards dynamically. We find that this RL framework achieves optimal resource coordination when individuals balance the exploitation of experience with random exploration. Yet, the imbalanced strategies of the two lead to suboptimal partial coordination or even anti-coordination. Our mechanistic analysis reveals a symmetry-breaking in action preferences at the optimum, offering a fresh solution to the MG and new insights into the resource allocation problem.</description>

      <title>Epidemic risk perception and social interactions lead to awareness cascades on multiplex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16466v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The course of an epidemic is not only shaped by infection transmission over face-to-face contacts, but also by preventive behaviour caused by risk perception and social interactions. This study explores the dynamics of coupled awareness and biological infection spread within a two-layer multiplex network framework. One layer embodies face-to-face contacts, with a biological infection transmission following a simple contagion model, the SIR process. Awareness, modelled by the linear threshold model, a complex contagion, spreads over a social layer and induces behaviour that lowers the chance of a biological infection occurring. It may be provoked by the presence of either aware or infectious neighbours. We introduce a novel model combining these influences through a convex combination, creating a continuum between pure social contagion and local risk perception. Simulation of the model shows distinct effects arising from the awareness sources. Also, for convex combinations where both input sources are of importance, awareness cascades that are not attributable to only one of these sources, emerge. Under these conditions, the combination of a small-world face-to-face and a scale-free social layer, but not vice versa, make that the extent of the infections decreases with increasing transmission probability.</description>
