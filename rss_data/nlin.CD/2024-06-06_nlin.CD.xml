      <title>Impact of ageostrophic dynamics on the predictability of Lagrangian trajectories in surface-ocean turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Turbulent flows at the surface of the ocean deviate from geostrophic equilibrium on scales smaller than about 10 km. These scales are associated with important vertical transport of active and passive tracers, and should play a prominent role in the heat transport at climatic scales and for plankton dynamics. Measuring velocity fields on such small scales is notoriously difficult but new, high-resolution satellite altimetry is starting to reveal them. However, the satellite-derived velocities essentially represent the geostrophic flow component, and the impact of unresolved ageostrophic motions on particle dispersion needs to be understood to properly characterize transport properties. Here, we investigate ocean fine-scale turbulence using a model that represents some of the processes due to ageostrophic dynamics. We take a Lagrangian approach and focus on the predictability of the particle dynamics, comparing trajectories advected by either the full flow or by its geostrophic component only. Our results indicate that, over long times, relative dispersion is marginally affected by the filtering of the ageostrophic component. Nevertheless, advection by the filtered flow leads to an overestimation of the typical pair-separation rate, and to a bias on trajectories (in terms of displacement from the actual ones), whose importance grows with the Rossby number. We further explore the intensity of the transient particle clustering induced by ageostrophic motions and find that it can be significant, even for small flow compressibility. Indeed, we show that clustering is here due to the interplay between compressibility and persistent flow structures that trap particles, enhancing their aggregation.</description>

      <title>Attractor Memory for Long-Term Time Series Forecasting: A Chaos Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11463v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In long-term time series forecasting (LTSF) tasks, an increasing number of models have acknowledged that discrete time series originate from continuous dynamic systems and have attempted to model their dynamical structures. Recognizing the chaotic nature of real-world data, our model, \textbf{\textit{Attraos}}, incorporates chaos theory into LTSF, perceiving real-world time series as observations from unknown high-dimensional chaotic dynamic systems. Under the concept of attractor invariance, Attraos utilizes non-parametric Phase Space Reconstruction embedding and the proposed multi-scale dynamic memory unit to memorize historical dynamics structure and predicts by a frequency-enhanced local evolution strategy. Detailed theoretical analysis and abundant empirical evidence consistently show that Attraos outperforms various LTSF methods on mainstream LTSF datasets and chaotic datasets with only one-twelfth of the parameters compared to PatchTST.</description>

      <title>A transformer-based neural operator for large-eddy simulation of turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16026v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Predicting the large-scale dynamics of three-dimensional (3D) turbulence is challenging for machine learning approaches. This paper introduces a transformer-based neural operator (TNO) to achieve precise and efficient predictions in the large-eddy simulation (LES) of 3D turbulence. The performance of the proposed TNO model is systematically tested and compared with LES using classical sub-grid scale (SGS) models, including the dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) and the dynamic mixed model (DMM), as well as the original Fourier neural operator (FNO) model, in homogeneous isotropic turbulence (HIT) and free-shear turbulent mixing layer. The numerical simulations comprehensively evaluate the performance of these models on a variety of flow statistics, including the velocity spectrum, the probability density functions (PDFs) of vorticity, the PDFs of velocity increments, the evolution of turbulent kinetic energy, and the iso-surface of the Q-criterion. The results indicate that the accuracy of the TNO model is comparable to the LES with DSM model, and outperforms the FNO model and LES using DMM in HIT. In the free-shear turbulence, the TNO model exhibits superior accuracy compared to other models. Moreover, the TNO model has fewer parameters than the FNO model and enables long-term stable predictions, which the FNO model cannot achieve. The well-trained TNO model is significantly faster than traditional LES with DSM and DMM models, and can be generalized to higher Taylor-Reynolds number cases, indicating its strong potential for 3D nonlinear engineering applications.</description>
