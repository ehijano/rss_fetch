      <title>On a specific family of orthogonal polynomials of Bernstein-Szeg\"o type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study certain weight functions on $[-1,1]$ which are particular cases of the general weights considered by Bernstein and Szeg\"o. These weights are numbered by two positive integers and when these integers tend to infinity, these weights approximate weight functions on $\mathbb{R}$ considered by Ismail and Valent. We also consider modifications of these weight functions by a continuous variable $a&gt;0$. These ideas are then used to find finite analogs of some improper integrals first studied by Glaisher and Ramanujan.</description>

      <title>Hausdorff dimension of restricted Kakeya sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Kakeya set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ is a compact set that contains a unit line segment $I_e$ in each direction $e \in S^{n-1}$. The Kakeya conjecture states that any Kakeya set in $\mathbb{R}^n$ has Hausdorff dimension $n$. We consider a restricted case where the midpoint of each line segment $I_e$ must belong to a fixed set $A$ with packing dimension at most $s \in [0, n]$. In this case, we show that the Hausdorff dimension of the Kakeya set is at least $n - s$. Furthermore, using the "bush argument", we improve the lower bound to $\max \{ n - s, n - g_n(s)\}$, where $g_n(s)$ is defined inductively. For example, when $n = 4$, we prove that the Hausdorff dimension is at least $\max\{\frac{19}{5} - \frac{3}{5}s,4-s\}$. We also establish Kakeya maximal function analogues of these results.</description>

      <title>The $q$ and $q^{-1}$-symmetric orthogonal polynomials in the $q$-Askey scheme, their dual polynomials and functions, orthogonality, generating functions and relations and nonterminating $q$-Chaundy double product representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.04884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.04884v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive double-product representations of nonterminating basic hypergeometric series using diagonalization, a method introduced by Theo William Chaundy in 1943. We refer to this result as the $q$-Chaundy theorem and several limiting $q\to 1^{-}$ cases are considered. Using the $q$-Chaundy theorem, we explore properties of the symmetric and $q^{-1}$-symmetric basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the $q$-Askey scheme. These are the continuous dual $q$ and $q^{-1}$-Hahn polynomials, the $q$ and $q^{-1}$-Al-Salam--Chihara polynomials, the continuous big $q$ and $q^{-1}$-Hermite polynomials and the continuous $q$ and $q^{-1}$-Hermite polynomials. For instance, we show how many known (and unknown) generating functions can be easily derived for these polynomials. We also explore other methods to find generating functions for these polynomials. By applying the $q$-Chaundy theorem to the Ismail--Masson $q$-exponential generating function for continuous $q$ and $q^{-1}$-Hermite polynomials, we are able to derive alternative expansions of these generating functions, and from these, new terminating basic hypergeometric representations for the continuous $q$ and $q^{-1}$-Hermite polynomials. New quadratic transformations for the terminating basic hypergeometric series involved connect these representations. For the $q$ and $q^{-1}$-symmetric subfamilies of the Askey--Wilson polynomials and as well their dual polynomials, which include the big and little $q$-Jacobi polynomials and the $q^{-1}$-Bessel polynomials, we discuss, and show how to exploit special orthogonality relations (integral and infinite series), connection formulas, and duality relations for these infinite families to derive new generating relations, and as well summation and integration formulas.</description>

      <title>On the closability of differential operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.08058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.08058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the closability of directional derivative operators with respect to a general Radon measure $\mu$ on $\mathbb{R}^d$; our main theorem completely characterizes the vectorfields for which the corresponding operator is closable from the space of Lipschitz functions $\mathrm{Lip}(\mathbb{R}^d)$ to $L^p(\mu)$, for $1\leq p\leq\infty$. We also discuss the closability of the same operators from $L^q(\mu)$ to $L^p(\mu)$, and give necessary and sufficient conditions for closability, but we do not have an exact characterization. As a corollary we obtain that classical differential operators such as gradient, divergence and Jacobian determinant are closable from $L^q(\mu)$ to $L^p(\mu)$ only if $\mu$ is absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure. We finally consider the closability of a certain class of multilinear differential operators; these results are then rephrased in terms of metric currents.</description>

      <title>Lower bounds for the weak-type constants of the operators $\Lambda_m$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The operators $\Lambda_m$ ($m\in\mathbb{N}\cup \{0\}$) arise when one studies the action of the Beurling-Ahlfors transform on certain radial function subspaces. It is known that the weak-type $(1,1)$ constant of $\Lambda_0$ is equal to $1/\ln(2)\approx 1.44$. We construct examples showing that the weak-type $(1,1)$ constant of $\Lambda_1$ is larger than $1.38$ and that the weak-type $(1,1)$ constant of $\Lambda_m$ does not tend to $1$ when $m\to\infty$. This disproves a conjecture of Gill [Mich. Math. J. 59 (2010), No. 2, 353-363]. We also prove a companion result for the adjoint operators. This is the arXiv version of the paper - it includes some additional discussion in the appendices.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free Fourier restriction inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let ${{\bf R}_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}}}(p\to q)$ denote the best constant for the $L^p(\mathbb{R}^d)\to L^q(\mathbb{S}^{d-1})$ Fourier restriction inequality to the unit sphere $\mathbb{S}^{d-1}$, and let ${\bf R}_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} (p\to q;\textrm{rad})$ denote the corresponding constant for radial functions. We investigate the asymptotic behavior of the operator norms ${{\bf R}_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}}}(p\to q)$ and ${\bf R}_{\mathbb{S}^{d-1}} (p\to q;\textrm{rad})$ as the dimension $d$ tends to infinity. We further establish a dimension-free endpoint Stein-Tomas inequality for radial functions, together with the corresponding estimate for general functions which we prove with an $O(d^{1/2})$ dependence. Our methods rely on a uniform two-sided refinement of Stempak's asymptotic $L^p$ estimate of Bessel functions.</description>

      <title>$L^p$-boundedness of wave operators for fourth order Schr\"odinger operators with zero resonances on $\mathbb{R}^3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.06763v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $H = \Delta^2 + V$ be the fourth-order Schr\"odinger operator on $\mathbb{R}^3$ with a real-valued fast-decaying potential $V$. If zero is neither a resonance nor an eigenvalue of $H$, then it was recently shown that the wave operators $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ and unbounded at the endpoints $p=1$ and $p=\infty$.
  This paper is to further establish the $L^p$-boundedness of $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ that exhibit all types of singularities at the zero energy threshold. We first prove that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$ in the first kind resonance case, and then proceed to establish for the second kind resonance case that they are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; 3$, but not if $3 \le p \le \infty$. In the third kind resonance case, we also show that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\mathbb{R}^3)$ for all $1&lt;p&lt;3$ and generically unbounded on $L^p(\R^3)$ for any $3\le p\le\infty$. Moreover, it is also shown that $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $L^p(\R^3)$ for all $3\le p&lt;\infty$ if in addition $H$ has the zero eigenvalue, but no $p$-wave zero resonances and all zero eigenfunctions are orthogonal to $x_ix_jx_kV$ in $L^2(\R^3)$ for all $i,j,k=1,2,3$ with $x=(x_1,x_2,x_3)\in \R^3$.
  These results describe precisely the validity of the $L^p$-boundedness of $W_\pm(H, \Delta^2)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ for all types of singularities at the zero energy threshold with some exceptions for the endpoint cases $p=1,\infty$. As an application, $L^p$-$L^q$ decay estimates are also derived for the fourth-order Schr\"odinger equations and Beam equations with zero resonance singularities.</description>

      <title>Core equality of real sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given an ideal $\mathcal{I}$ on $\omega$ and a bounded real sequence $\textbf{x}$, we denote by $\text{core}_{\textbf{x}}(\mathcal{I})$ the smallest interval $[a,b]$ such that $\{n \in \omega: x_n \notin [a-\varepsilon,b+\varepsilon]\} \in \mathcal{I}$ for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$ (which corresponds to the interval $[\,\liminf \textbf{x}, \limsup \textbf{x}\,]$ if $\mathcal{I}$ is the ideal $\text{Fin}$ of finite subsets of $\omega$).
  First, we characterize all the infinite real matrices $A$ such that $$ \text{core}_{A\textbf{x}}(\mathcal{J})=\text{core}_{\textbf{x}}(\mathcal{I}) $$ for all bounded sequences $\textbf{x}$, provided that $\mathcal{J}$ is a countably generated ideal on $\omega$ and $A$ maps bounded sequences into bounded sequences. Such characterization fails if both $\mathcal{I}$ and $\mathcal{J}$ are the ideal of asymptotic density zero sets. Next, we show that such equality is possible for distinct ideals $\mathcal{I}, \mathcal{J}$, answering an open question in [J.~Math.~Anal.~Appl.~\textbf{321} (2006), 515--523]. Lastly, we prove that, if $\mathcal{J}=\text{Fin}$, the above equality holds for some matrix $A$ if and only if $\mathcal{I}=\text{Fin}$ or $\mathcal{I}=\text{Fin}\oplus \mathcal{P}(\omega)$.</description>
