      <title>European Defence Readiness: A Cold War 2.0 scenario analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We stress-test the European Defence Readiness in a Cold War 2.0 scenario analysis. Leveraging a general equilibrium multi-sector approach to the global economy, we simulate an abrupt decoupling from CRINK and evaluate impacts on defence readiness under changed future boundary conditions. Our results suggest that the defence industrial mobilisation, force mobility and sustained resilience readiness are largely off-track in view of the European Defence Readiness - defined as a steady state of preparedness. By quantifying the cost of unpreparedness, our results provide a measurable rationale for European allies to embark on a gradual de-risking trajectory rather than waiting for a much more costly abrupt shock trigger dictated by geopolitical events.</description>

      <title>How Well Did U.S. Rail and Intermodal Freight Respond to the COVID-19 Pandemic vs. the Great Recession?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes and compares patterns of U.S. domestic rail freight volumes during, and after the disruptions caused by the 2007-2009 Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. Trends in rail and intermodal shipment data are examined in conjunction with economic indicators, focusing on the extent of drop and recovery of freight volumes of various commodities and intermodal shipments, and the lead/lag time with respect to economic drivers. While impacts from and the rebound from the Great Recessions were slow to develop, COVID-19 produced both profound disruptions in the freight market and rapid rebound, with important variations across commodity types.
  Energy-related commodities (i.e., coal, petroleum, and fracking sand), dropped during the pandemic while demand for other commodities (i.e., grain products and lumber, and intermodal freight). rebounded rapidly and in some cases grew. Overall rail freight experienced a rapid rebound following the precipitous drop in traffic in March and April 2020, achieving a near-full recovery in five months. As the recovery proceeded through 2020, intermodal flow, containers moving by rail for their longest overland trips, rebounded strongly, some exceeding 2019 levels. In contrast, rail flows during the Great Recession changed slowly with the onset and recovery, extending over multiple years. Pandemic response reflected the impacts of quick shutdowns and a rapid shift in consumer purchasing patterns. Results for the pandemic illustrate the resilience of U.S. rail freight industry and the multifaceted role it plays in the overall logistics system. Amid a challenging logistical environment, freight rail kept goods moving when other methods of transport were constrained.</description>

      <title>Adventures in Demand Analysis Using AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper advances empirical demand analysis by integrating multimodal product representations derived from artificial intelligence (AI). Using a detailed dataset of toy cars on \textit{Amazon.com}, we combine text descriptions, images, and tabular covariates to represent each product using transformer-based embedding models. These embeddings capture nuanced attributes, such as quality, branding, and visual characteristics, that traditional methods often struggle to summarize. Moreover, we fine-tune these embeddings for causal inference tasks. We show that the resulting embeddings substantially improve the predictive accuracy of sales ranks and prices and that they lead to more credible causal estimates of price elasticity. Notably, we uncover strong heterogeneity in price elasticity driven by these product-specific features. Our findings illustrate that AI-driven representations can enrich and modernize empirical demand analysis. The insights generated may also prove valuable for applied causal inference more broadly.</description>

      <title>An Evaluation of Borda Count Variations Using Ranked Choice Voting Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The standard voting methods in the United States, plurality and ranked choice (or instant runoff) voting, are susceptible to significant voting failures. These flaws include Condorcet and majority failures as well as monotonicity and no-show paradoxes. We investigate alternative ranked choice voting systems using variations of the points-based Borda count which avoid monotonicity paradoxes. These variations are based on the way partial ballots are counted and on extending the values of the points assigned to each rank in the ballot. In particular, we demonstrate which voting failures are possible for each variation and then empirically study 421 U.S. ranked choice elections conducted from 2004 to 2023 to determine the frequency of voting failures when using five Borda variations. Our analysis demonstrates that the primary vulnerability of majority failures is rare or nonexistent depending on the variation. Other voting failures such as truncation or compromise failures occur more frequently compared to instant runoff voting as a trade-off for avoiding monotonicity paradoxes.</description>

      <title>Paternalism and Deliberation: An Experiment on Making Formal Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the relationship between soft and hard paternalism by examining two kinds of restriction: a waiting period and a hard limit (cap) on risk-seeking behavior. Mandatory waiting periods have been instituted for medical procedures, gun purchases and other high-stakes decisions. Are these policies substitutes for hard restrictions, and are delayed decisions more respected? In an experiment, decision-makers are informed about an impending high-stakes decision. Treatments define when the decision is made: on the spot or after one day, and whether the initial decision can be revised. In a general population survey experiment, another class of subjects (Choice Architects) is granted the opportunity to make rules for decision-makers. Given a decision's temporal structure, Choice Architects can decide on a cap to the decision-maker's risk taking. In another treatment, Choice Architects can implement a mandatory waiting period in addition to the cap. This allows us to study the substitutional relationship between waiting periods and paternalistic action and the effect of deliberation on the autonomy afforded to the decision-maker. Our highly powered experiment reveals that exogenous deliberation has no effect on the cap. Moreover, endogenously prescribed waiting periods represent add-on restrictions that do not substitute for the cap. Choice Architects believe that, with time, the average decision-maker will take less risk and -- because of the distribution of Choice Architects' bliss points -- come closer to Choice Architects' subjective ideal choice. These findings highlight the complementarity of policy tools in targeting various parts of a distribution of decision-makers.</description>

      <title>Are Politicians Responsive to Mass Shootings? Evidence from U.S. State Legislatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The United States leads the world in the number of violent mass shootings that occur each year, and policy making on firearms remains polarized along party lines. Are legislators responsive to mass shootings? We estimate the latent positions of nearly 2,000 state legislators on gun policy from their roll-call voting records on firearm-related bills from 2011 to 2022. Employing a staggered difference-in-differences design, we find that mass shootings within or near a state legislator's district do not alter their voting behavior on firearm policy, on average, for members of both parties. Our estimated effects of mass shootings on treated legislators' support for restrictive gun policies (on a -1 to 1 scale) range from a 4.8% reduction among California Democrats and a 0.9% increase among California Republicans to, across six total states, a 5% (among Democrats) and 7.1% (among Republicans) increase, with 95% confidence intervals spanning opposite directions. We conclude that, on average, mass shootings fail to produce changes in a legislator's support (opposition) for restrictive (permissive) firearms bills. Our findings suggest that even the most heinous acts of mass violence -- that are squarely in the domain of events that state legislators might respond to -- fail to produce any measurable effects on legislators' positions on firearm-related policy.</description>

      <title>The Learning Crisis: Three Years After COVID-19</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01260v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic caused widespread disruptions to education, with school closures affecting over one billion children. These closures, aimed at reducing virus transmission, resulted in significant learning losses, particularly in mathematics and science. Using data from TIMSS 2023, which assesses fourth and eighth-grade achievements across 71 education systems, this study analyzes the impact of school closure duration on learning outcomes. Mixed-effect models estimate deviations from pre-pandemic trends, adjusting for demographic factors. Results show a global average decline of 0.11 standard deviations (SD) in student achievement, with longer closures linked to more severe losses. The effects on low performers, girls, and linguistic minorities show effect sizes up to 0.22 SD. These findings highlight the lasting impact of school closures and emphasize the need for targeted recovery strategies and international cooperation to promote equitable educational outcomes post-pandemic.</description>

      <title>Inequality of opportunity under current China's license plate policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring inequality of opportunities has long been a challenging and open problem, primarily due to the limitations associated with individual-level data. In this study, we utilize data obtained from vehicle license plates in a comprehensive survey (17258 vehicles from 6 major cities in China) to evaluate the inequality of opportunities in the country. In our context, we define inequality of opportunity as the scenario where relatively expensive vehicles have a higher likelihood of being paired with license plates featuring 'Lucky Numbers'. To quantify this, we propose a lucky-number-based opportunity Gini coefficient. Through the calculation of the opportunity Gini coefficient, we observe a significant and positive correlation between opportunity inequality and income inequality. Particularly noteworthy is our finding that the advancement of technology, exemplified by the widespread adoption of new energy vehicles, can substantially reduce the inequality of opportunity. Taking incorporation of a random lottery process before acquiring a motor vehicle in Beijing and Shanghai as a natural experiment, our empirical results support the argument that, in terms of equality, employing random drawing is a fair and equitable approach for allocating scarce resources.</description>

      <title>Cognitive Noise and Altruistic Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07647v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I study altruistic choices through the lens of a cognitively noisy decision-maker. I introduce a theoretical framework that demonstrates how increased cognitive noise can directionally affect altruistic decisions and put its implications to the test: In a laboratory experiment, participants make a series of binary choices between taking and giving monetary payments. In the treatment, to-be-calculated math sums replace straightforward monetary payments, increasing the cognitive difficulty of choosing. The Treatment group exhibits a lower sensitivity towards changes in payments and decides significantly more often in favor of the other person, i.e., is more altruistic. I explore the origins of this effect with Bayesian hierarchical models and a number-comparison task, mirroring the "mechanics" of the altruism choices absent any altruistic preference. The treatment effect is similar in this task, suggesting that the perception of numerical magnitudes drives treatment differences. The probabilistic model supports this interpretation. A series of additional results show a negative correlation between cognitive reflection and individual measures of cognitive noise, as well as associations between altruistic choice and number comparison. Overall, these results suggest that the expression of altruistic preferences -- and potentially social preferences more generally -- is affected by the cognitive difficulty of their implementation.</description>

      <title>Knowledge and Freedom: Evidence on the Relationship Between Information and Paternalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: When is autonomy granted to a decision-maker based on their knowledge, and if no autonomy is granted, what form will the intervention take? A parsimonious theoretical framework shows how policymakers can exploit decision-maker mistakes and use them as a justification for intervention. In two experiments, policymakers ("Choice Architects") can intervene in a choice faced by a decision-maker. We vary the amount of knowledge decision-makers possess about the choice. Full decision-maker knowledge causes more than a 60% reduction in intervention rates. Beliefs have a small, robust correlation with interventions on the intensive margin. Choice Architects disproportionately prefer to have decision-makers make informed decisions. Interveners are less likely to provide information. As theory predicts, the same applies to Choice Architects who believe that decision-maker mistakes align with their own preference. When Choice Architects are informed about the decision-maker's preference, this information is used to determine the imposed option. However, Choice Architects employ their own preference to a similar extent. A riskless option is causally more likely to be imposed, being correlated with but conceptually distinct from Choice Architects' own preference. This is a qualification to what has been termed "projective paternalism."</description>

      <title>Seesaw Experimentation: A/B Tests with Spillovers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.02085v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates how a firm's performance can decline even when consistently implementing innovations validated through A/B testing. We introduce the concept of "seesaw experimentation," where successful innovations enhance performance in measured primary metrics but generate negative spillover effects in unmeasured secondary dimensions, ultimately reducing overall performance. We identify the conditions under which seesaw experimentation occurs. We also propose a simple solution to address it: implementing a positive hurdle rate for A/B tests. We derive the optimal hurdle rate for both the normal distribution and the fat-tailed distributions.</description>

      <title>Cool, But What About Oracles? An Oracle-Based Perspective on Blockchain Integration in the Accounting Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.20447v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bitcoin Network is a sophisticated accounting system that allows its underlying cryptocurrency to be trusted even in the absence of a reliable financial authority. Given its undeniable success, the technology, generally referred to as blockchain, has also been proposed as a means to improve legacy accounting systems. Accounting for real-world data, however, requires the intervention of a third party known as an Oracle, which, having not the same characteristics as a blockchain, could potentially reduce the expected integration benefit. Through a systematic review of the literature, this study aims to investigate whether the papers concerning blockchain integration in accounting consider and address the limitations posed by oracles. A broad overview of the limitations that emerged in the literature is provided and distinguished according to the specific accounting integration. Results support the view that although research on the subject counts numerous articles, actual studies considering oracle limitations are lacking. Interestingly, despite the scarce production of papers addressing oracles in various accounting sectors, reporting for ESG already shows interesting workarounds for oracle limitations, with permissioned chains envisioned as a valid support for the safe storage of sustainability data.</description>
