      <title>Decaying sterile neutrinos at short baselines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-standing anomalous experimental results from short-baseline neutrino experiments have persisted for decades. These results, when interpreted with one or more light sterile neutrinos, are inconsistent with numerous null results experimentally. However, if the sterile neutrino decays en route to the detector, this can mimic $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$ oscillation signals while avoiding many of these external constraints. We revisit this solution to the MiniBooNE and LSND puzzles in view of new data from the MicroBooNE experiment at Fermilab. Using MicroBooNE's liquid-argon time-projection chamber search for an excess of $\nu_e$ in the Booster beam, we derive new limits in two models' parameter spaces of interest: where the sterile neutrino decays (I) via mixing with the active neutrinos, or (II) via higher-dimensional operators. We also provide an updated, comprehensive fit to the MiniBooNE neutrino- and antineutrino-beam data, including appearance ($\nu_e$) and disappearance ($\nu_\mu$) channels. Despite alleviating the tension with muon neutrino disappearance experiments, we find that the latest MicroBooNE analysis rules out the decaying sterile neutrino solution in a large portion of the parameter space at more than $99\%$ CL.</description>

      <title>Entanglement and Bell nonlocality with bottom-quark pairs at hadron colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past years, it was shown that entanglement and Bell nonlocality, which are key concepts in Quantum Mechanics, can be probed in high-energy colliders, via processes of fundamental particle scattering. Recently, it has been shown that spin correlations can be measured in pairs of bottom quarks at the LHC. Given the low mass of the bottom quark compared to typical scattering processes at the LHC, many of the bottom-quark pairs are in the ultrarelativistic regime, where they can exhibit strong spin entanglement. We find that entanglement of bottom-quark pairs may be measurable even with Run 2 data, especially with the CMS $B$ parking dataset, while observation of Bell nonlocality may become feasible at the high-luminosity phase of the LHC.</description>

      <title>Testing quantum gravity effects with global lepton number symmetry and dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of testing quantum gravity (QG) effects with a type-I seesaw origin of light neutrino mass embedded in a global $U(1)_L$ symmetric framework which also includes dark matter (DM). The spontaneous breaking of $U(1)_L$ symmetry generates the seesaw scale as well as DM mass dynamically. The (pseudo) Nambu-Goldstone boson, known as majoron, acquires non-zero mass due to soft symmetry breaking terms of quadratic type in the scalar potential, which eventually breaks $U(1)_L$ to its $Z_2$ subgroup. The spontaneous symmetry breaking, which effectively breaks $Z_2$, leads to the formation of domain walls (DW), posing a threat to successful cosmology, if allowed to dominate. As gravity does not respect any global symmetries, we consider higher dimensional operators suppressed by the scale of QG namely, $\Lambda_{\rm QG}$ which introduces the required bias leading to DW annihilation and emission of stochastic gravitational waves (GW) observable at near future experiments. The same operators also lead to decay of DM bringing interesting indirect detection aspects. While DM is produced non-thermally via scalar portal interactions, light majoron can give rise to additional $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ within reach of future cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiments.</description>

      <title>Determining Weak-Mixing Angle at $\mu$TRISTAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mu$TRISTAN is a realistic high energy lepton collider based on the existing technology aiming at indirect and direct search for the physics beyond the standard model (SM). We propose a measurement to determine one of the most prominent parameters of the SM, weak mixing angle to test the SM and probe the new physics effect in M\o ller-like scattering with a wide range of interaction scales. We show that this experiment not only can determine the weak mixing angle with percent to milli-level accuracy but also scan over a wide range of interaction scales that have never been archived in a single experiment elsewhere.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the Correlation Between Thermal and Kinematic Parameters in Various Multiplicity Classes within 7 and 13 TeV pp Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transverse momentum spectra of identified particles at 7 TeV and 13 TeV in pp collisions in the framework of the blast wave model with Tsallis statistics (TBW). Based on experimental data by ALICE Collaboration, we observe that the model describes the $p_T$ spectra well with the common Tsallis temperature (T) and flow velocity (\beta_T) but separate non-extensive parameters (q) for baryons and mesons. The parameter dependence on multiplicity as well as on collision energy is investigated, and a strong dependence on the former while a weak dependence on the latter is reported. The extracted parameters in this work consist of the initial temperature (T_i), the average transverse momentum (&lt;p_T&gt;), the T, \beta_T, and the q. These parameters are found to increase a little with increasing energy, however, they (except the parameter q) decrease significantly with decreasing multiplicity. We observe that $\beta_T$ drops to zero after the multiplicity class VII, while, $T$ and $q$ do not change their behavior. Furthermore, our analysis explore the correlations among different parameters, including associations with the charged particle multiplicity per unit pseudorapidity (dN_{ch}/d\eta). The correlation between T and beta_T, T and dN_{ch}/d\eta, \beta_T and dN_{ch}/d\eta, T_i and &lt;p_T&gt; and T_i and dN_{ch}/d\eta demonstrates a positive relationship, while, the correlation between T and q-1, and q-1 and dN_{ch}/d\eta is negative. Finally, we implement an extra flow correction on the T parameter. Our findings reveal that the Doppler-corrected temperature parameter aligns closely with the T in scenarios with lower multiplicities. However, as the multiplicity increases, a noticeable divergence emerges between these parameters, indicating a widening separation between them.</description>

      <title>The Potential Energy of Heavy Quarkonium in Flavor-Dependent Systems from a Holographic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the framework of the Einstein-Maxwell-Dilaton (EMD) model, which incorporates information on the equation of state and baryon number susceptibility from lattice results, we have conducted a comprehensive analysis of the potential energy, running coupling, and dissociation time for heavy quark-antiquark pairs using gauge/gravity duality. This study encompasses various systems, including pure gluon systems, 2 flavor systems, 2+1 flavor systems, and 2+1+1 flavor systems under finite temperature and chemical potential. The results reveal that the linear component of the potential energy diminishes as the flavor increases. It is also found that our results are extremely close to the recent lattice results for 2+1 flavors at finite temperature. Moreover, we have thoroughly investigated the dissociation distance and running coupling constant of quark-antiquark pairs to gain a comprehensive understanding of their behavior across various flavors. Finally, we have examined real-time dynamics of quark dissociation. The findings indicate that the dissociation time of quark-antiquark pairs is dependent on temperature, chemical potential, and flavor of the systems.</description>

      <title>Detection Prospects of Millicharged Dark Matter in Unconventional Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel idea to discover millicharged particles (mCPs) captured by the earth during its existence. It has been demonstrated that the mCPs accumulation inside the earth leads to the enhancement of its number density much larger than the corresponding virial density. We propose to utilize an unconventional laser interferometer to probe these earth-bound mCPs through the detection of the photons's phase shift. We demonstrate that, for mCPs mass in the range between $1$ GeV to $10^{12}$ GeV, the sensitivity of probing their fractional electric charge $\epsilon$ could reach as low as $10^{-12}$ to $10^{-6}$ provided that mCPs number density is greater than $1~\text{cm}^{-3}$.</description>

      <title>Emergence of KNO scaling in multiplicity distributions in jets produced at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study the multiplicity distributions (MDs) of charged particles within jets in proton-proton collisions, which were measured by the ATLAS collaboration in 2011, 2016 and 2019. The first data set refers to jets with lower transverse momenta ($4 &lt; p_T &lt; 40$ GeV ) whereas the other two refer to higher $p_T$ jets ($0.1 &lt; p_T &lt; 2.5$ TeV). We find that the first set shows no sign of KNO scaling whereas the higher $p_T$ sets gradually approach the scaling limit. In the first set the mean multiplicity as a function of $p_T$ can be well described by expressions derived from QCD with different approximation schemes. For higher ($&gt; 500$ GeV) values of $p_T$ these expressions significantly overshoot the data. We show that the behavior of the MDs can be well represented by a Sub-Poisson distribution with energy dependent parameters. In the range $40 &lt; p_T &lt; 100$ GeV there is a transition from sub to super poissonian behavior and the MD evolves to a geometric distribution, which shows KNO scaling. In this way we fit the MDs in all transverse momentum intervals with one single expression. We discuss the implications of this phenomenological finding.</description>

      <title>Proton 3D reconstruction with T-odd TMD gluon densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present studies aimed at probing the 3D gluon content of the proton through spin-dependent TMD gluon densities, computed by means of the spectator-model approach. Our formalism incorporates a fit-based modulation function for the spectator mass, designed to capture longitudinal-momentum effects across a broad kinematic range. Special emphasis is placed on the time-reversal even Boer-Mulders and the time-reversal odd Sivers functions. Accurate understanding of these functions is crucial for conducting precise 3D analyses of nucleons, highlighting the importance of collaborative efforts between the LHC and EIC Communities.</description>

Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of the Polyakov--Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model considering the effects of an effective chiral chemical potential. We offer a new parametrization of the Polyakov loop potential depending on temperature and the chemical potential which, when used together with a proper regularization scheme of vacuum contributions, predicts results consistent with those from lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Shear viscosity from perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics to the hadron resonance gas at finite baryon, strangeness, and electric charge densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Through model-to-data comparisons from heavy-ion collisions, it has been shown that the Quark Gluon Plasma has an extremely small shear viscosity at vanishing densities. At large baryon densities, significantly less is known about the nature of the shear viscosity from Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). Within heavy-ion collisions, there are three conserved charges: baryon number (B), strangeness (S), and electric charge (Q). Here we calculate the shear viscosity in two limits using perturbative QCD and an excluded-volume hadron resonance gas at finite BSQ densities. We then develop a framework that interpolates between these two limits such that shear viscosity is possible to calculate across a wide range of finite BSQ densities. We find that the pQCD and hadron resonance gas calculations have different BSQ densities dependence such that a rather non-trivial shear viscosity appears at finite densities.</description>

      <title>Wave functions of multiquark hadrons from representations of the symmetry groups $S_n$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Construction of the wave functions of multiquark hadrons by traditional method based on tensor products of colors, flavors, spins (and orbital) parts becomes quite complex when quark numbers grow $n=5,6...12$, as it gets difficult to satisfy requirements of Fermi statistics. Our novel approach is focused directly on representations of the permutation symmetry generators. After showing how $C_3$ is manifested in the wave functions of (excited) baryons, we use it to construct the wave functions for a set of pentaquarks and hexaquarks (n=5,6). We also have some partial results for larger systems, with $n=9$ and 12, and even beyond that as far as $n=24$.</description>

      <title>Unified view of scalar and vector dark matter solitons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of solitons -- stable, long-lived, and localized field configurations -- is a generic prediction for ultralight dark matter. These solitons, known by various names such as boson stars, axion stars, oscillons, and Q-balls depending on the context, are typically treated as distinct entities in the literature. This study aims to provide a unified perspective on these solitonic objects for real or complex, scalar or vector dark matter, considering self-interactions and nonminimal gravitational interactions. We demonstrate that these solitons share universal nonrelativistic properties, such as conserved charges, mass-radius relations, stability and profiles. Without accounting for alternative interactions or relativistic effects, distinguishing between real and complex scalar dark matter is challenging. However, self-interactions differentiate real and complex vector dark matter due to their different dependencies on the macroscopic spin density of dark matter waves. Furthermore, gradient-dependent nonminimal gravitational interactions impose an upper bound on soliton amplitudes, influencing their mass distribution and phenomenology in the present-day universe.</description>

      <title>Timing-based mass measurement of exotic long-lived particles at the FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The very high luminosity run foreseen at the $Z$-pole for the FCC-ee will allow the detection in $Z$ decays of new particles with very low couplings to the Standard Model. These particles will have measurable flight paths before they decay. If the timing and the position of the decay vertex can be measured with high precision, the mass of such particles can be measured by exploiting the constrained kinematics of an $e^+e^-$ collider. The mass resolution achievable with this technique is studied through a detailed analysis in the framework of a parametrised simulation of the performance of the IDEA detector. The adopted benchmark model is the production of Heavy Neutral Leptons, which is one of the key channels for new physics discovery at the FCC-ee.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a generator for lepton nucleon collisions in the DIS regime, focusing in particular on processes with a massive lepton and/or a massive quark in the final state. We have built a full code matching NLO QCD corrections to parton shower Monte Carlo programs in the POWHEG-BOX framework. Our code can be used to compute NLO+PS accurate fully differential predictions for neutral current and charged current processes, including processes with an incoming tau neutrino, and/or including charm quarks in the final state. We also made comparisons with available data and predictions for the new neutrino experiments at CERN.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop parameterizations of 8 of the lowest Born-Oppenheimer potentials for quarkonium hybrid mesons as functions of the separation $r$ of the static quark and antiquark sources. The parameters are determined by fitting results calculated using pure $SU(3)$ lattice gauge theory. The parameterizations have the correct limiting behavior at small $r$, where the potentials form multiplets associated with gluelumps. They have the correct limiting behavior at large $r$, where the potentials form multiplets associated with excitations of a relativistic string. There is a narrow avoided crossing in the small-$r$ region between two potentials with the same Born-Oppenheimer quantum numbers.</description>

      <title>First Constraints on a Pixelated Universe in Light of DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04408v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pixelated dark energy is a string theory scenario with a quantum mechanically stable cosmological constant. The number of pixels that make up the universe slowly increases, manifesting as a time-dependent source of dark energy. DESI has recently reported evidence for dynamical dark energy that fits within this framework. In light of this, we perform the first cosmological analysis of the pixelated model. We find that the simplest model where the pixel growth rate is constant is unable to accommodate the data, providing a comparable fit to $\Lambda$CDM; but that models where the pixel growth rate is increasing and of order the Hubble constant today are compatible. Our analysis helps to clarify the features of UV constructions of dark energy necessary to accommodate the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice calculation of $B\to D^{(*)}\ell\bar\nu$ decay form factors is now available from multiple lattice collaborations for both zero-recoil limit and non-zero recoil kinematics. Yet, there are a number of challenges we face to better control the systematic errors and to extend the application of lattice calculations to related quantities. The subjects are chosen from my own perspective and not meant to be conprehensive.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding of the inclusive vs exclusive puzzle in the $|V_{cb}|$ determinations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lattice calculation may play an important role to understand the cause of the long-standing puzzle among the determination of $|V_{cb}|$. The key element is the computation of the inclusive decay rate, for which the formalism is under development. The method has its own problem: the approximation of the phase-space factor and finite volume effect. I discuss the current status of such study and future prospects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}$, $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta$, and $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta^{\prime}$ decays using the Belle and Belle~II data samples, which have integrated luminosities of 980~$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ and 426~$\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$, respectively. We measure the following relative branching fractions $${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0})/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}) = 0.48 \pm 0.02 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.03 ({\rm syst}) ,$$ $${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta)/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}) = 0.11 \pm 0.01 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.01 ({\rm syst}) ,$$ $${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\eta^{\prime})/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}) = 0.08 \pm 0.02 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.01 ({\rm syst}) $$ for the first time, where the uncertainties are statistical ($\rm stat$) and systematic ($\rm syst$). By multiplying by the branching fraction of the normalization mode, ${\mathcal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+})$, we obtain the following absolute branching fraction results $(6.9 \pm 0.3 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.5 ({\rm syst}) \pm 1.3 ({\rm norm})) \times 10^{-3}$, $(1.6 \pm 0.2 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.2 ({\rm syst}) \pm 0.3 ({\rm norm})) \times 10^{-3}$, and $(1.2 \pm 0.3 ({\rm stat}) \pm 0.1 ({\rm syst}) \pm 0.2 ({\rm norm})) \times 10^{-3}$, for $\Xi_{c}^{0}$ decays to $\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}$, $\Xi^{0}\eta$, and $\Xi^{0}\eta^{\prime}$ final states, respectively. The third errors are from the uncertainty on ${\mathcal B}(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+})$. The asymmetry parameter for $\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}$ is measured to be $\alpha(\Xi_{c}^{0}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{0}) = -0.90\pm0.15({\rm stat})\pm0.23({\rm syst})$.</description>

      <title>The distribution amplitude of the $\eta_c$-meson at leading twist from Lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Distribution amplitudes are functions of non-perturbative matrix elements describing the hadronization of quarks and gluons. Thanks to factorization theorems, they can be used to compute the scattering amplitude of high-energy processes. Recently, new ideas have allowed their computation using lattice QCD, which should provide us with a general, fully relativistic determination. We present the first lattice calculation of the $\eta_c$-meson distribution amplitude at leading twist. Starting from the relevant matrix element in discrete Euclidean space on a set of $N_f=2$ CLS ensembles, we explain the method to connect to continuum Minkowski spacetime. After addressing several sources of systematic uncertainty, we compare to Dyson-Schwinger and non-relativistic QCD determinations of this quantity. We find significant deviations between the latter and our result even at small Ioffe times.</description>

      <title>Accelerated protons produced by magnetic Penrose process in Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Typical mechanisms to extract energies from a rotating black hole are the Blandford-Znajek process and the Penrose process. The Penrose process requires a special condition that is difficult to occur in common astrophysical situations. However, the magnetic Penrose process (MPP) does not require such a special condition, and can produce ultra-high energy cosmic rays. When neutrons decay near a rotating black hole, the MPP efficiency of the produced proton is maximized. The supermassive black hole in Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*) is likely to have a radiatively inefficient accretion flow that is hot enough to produce neutrons by nuclear reactions, which can be subsequently accelerated to high-energy by the MPP. We calculate the production rate of accelerated protons from the Sgr A* to estimated the gamma-ray flux at Earth produced by these accelerated protons and the flux of the accelerated protons themselves transported from Sgr A* to Earth. We find that these very high-energy gamma rays ($E_{\gamma}\gtrsim10\,\mathrm{TeV}$) amount to a significant fraction of the flux of the gamma-ray from the HESS J1745-290 and the central molecular zone around $100\,\mathrm{TeV}$. The accelerated proton flux, when the dimensionless spin parameter $a_{*}=0.5$ and the magnetic field strength in the vicinity of the black hole $B_{0}=100\,\mathrm{G}$, is about $1.6-4.1\%$ of the cosmic ray proton flux from KASCADE experiment at about $1\,\mathrm{PeV}$. Due to the finite decay time of neutrons which need to be transported from the accretion flow to the acceleration zone, our acceleration model can operate only around black holes with mass not much greater than $\sim10^8\,M_\odot$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the pair production, string breaking, and hadronization of a receding electron-positron pair using the bosonized version of the massive Schwinger model in quantum electrodynamics in 1+1 space-time dimensions. Specifically, we study the dynamics of the electric field in Bjorken coordinates by splitting it into a coherent field and its Gaussian fluctuations. We find that the electric field shows damped oscillations, reflecting pair production. Interestingly, the computation of the asymptotic total particle density per rapidity interval for large masses can be fitted using a Boltzmann factor, where the temperature can be related to the hadronization temperature in QCD. Lastly, we discuss the possibility of an analog quantum simulation of the massive Schwinger model using ultracold atoms, explicitly matching the potential of the Schwinger model to the effective potential for the relative phase of two linearly coupled Bose-Einstein condensates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the relation between the emergence of a dilaton in gapped (confining) field theories, and the presence of either complex fixed points or instabilities in the strongly coupled dynamics in two classes of bottom-up holographic models. We demonstrate that in one of the two classes there is a critical line of first-order phase transitions (at zero temperature) that terminates at a critical point. We calculate the mass spectrum of fluctuations of the associated regular gravity backgrounds, which we interpret as bound states in the dual field theories. In proximity to the second-order phase transition, we find a parametrically light scalar state, and its composition leads us to identify it as a dilaton.</description>

      <title>Unraveling Trace Anomaly of Supradense Matter via Neutron Star Compactness Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The trace anomaly $\Delta\equiv 1/3-P/\varepsilon$ quantifies the possibly broken conformal symmetry in supradense matter under pressure $P$ at energy density $\varepsilon$. Perturbative QCD (pQCD) predicts a vanishing $\Delta$ at extremely high energy or baryon densities when the conformal symmetry is realized but its behavior at intermediate densities reachable in neutron stars (NSs) are still very uncertain. The extraction of $\Delta$ from NS observations strongly depends on the employed model for nuclear Equation of State (EOS). Based on the analytical results from perturbatively analyzing the dimensionless Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equations that are further verified numerically by using $10^5$ EOSs generated randomly with a meta-model in a very broad EOS parameter space constrained by terrestrial nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations, here we first show that the compactness $\xi\equiv M_{\rm{NS}}/R$ of a NS with mass $M_{\rm{NS}}$ and radius $R$ scales very accurately with $\Pi_{\rm{c}}\equiv\mathrm{X}/(1+3\mathrm{X}^2+4\mathrm{X})$ where $\mathrm{X}\equiv P_{\rm{c}}/\varepsilon_{\rm{c}}$ is the ratio of pressure over energy density at NS centers. The scaling of NS compactness thus enables one to readily read off the central trace anomaly $\Delta_{\rm{c}}=1/3-\mathrm{X}$ directly from the observational data of either the mass-radius or red-shift measurements. We then demonstrate indeed that the available NS data themselves from recent X-ray and gravitational wave observations can determine model-independently the trace anomaly as a function of energy density in NS cores, providing a stringent test of existing NS models and a clear guidance in a new direction for further understanding the nature and EOS of supradense matter.</description>

      <title>Canonicalizing zeta generators: genus zero and genus one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zeta generators are derivations associated with odd Riemann zeta values that act freely on the Lie algebra of the fundamental group of Riemann surfaces with marked points. The genus-zero incarnation of zeta generators are Ihara derivations of certain Lie polynomials in two generators that can be obtained from the Drinfeld associator. We characterize a canonical choice of these polynomials, together with their non-Lie counterparts at even degrees $w\geq 2$, through the action of the dual space of formal and motivic multizeta values. Based on these canonical polynomials, we propose a canonical isomorphism that maps motivic multizeta values into the $f$-alphabet. The canonical Lie polynomials from the genus-zero setup determine canonical zeta generators in genus one that act on the two generators of Enriquez' elliptic associators. Up to a single contribution at fixed degree, the zeta generators in genus one are systematically expanded in terms of Tsunogai's geometric derivations dual to holomorphic Eisenstein series, leading to a wealth of explicit high-order computations. Earlier ambiguities in defining the non-geometric part of genus-one zeta generators are resolved by imposing a new representation-theoretic condition. The tight interplay between zeta generators in genus zero and genus one unravelled in this work connects the construction of single-valued multiple polylogarithms on the sphere with iterated-Eisenstein-integral representations of modular graph forms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.13607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a state-of-the-art prediction for cross sections of neutrino deep inelastic scattering (DIS) from nucleon at high neutrino energies, $E_\nu$, from 100 GeV to 1000 EeV ($10^{12}$ GeV). Our calculations are based on the latest CT18 NNLO parton distribution functions (PDFs) and their associated uncertainties. In order to make predictions for the highest energies, we extrapolate the PDFs to small $x$ according to several procedures and assumptions, thus affecting the uncertainties at ultra-high $E_\nu$; we quantify the uncertainties corresponding to these choices. Similarly, we quantify the uncertainties introduced by the nuclear corrections which are required to evaluate neutrino-nuclear cross sections for neutrino telescopes. These results can be applied to currently-running astrophysical neutrino observatories, such as IceCube and KM3NeT, as well as various future experiments which have been proposed.</description>

Abstract: We present computation of the next-to-leading power corrections for Higgs plus one jet production in a hadron collider via gluon fusion channel. Shifting of spinors in the helicity amplitudes without additional radiation captures the leading next-to-soft radiative behaviour and makes the calculation tractable. We establish the connection between the shifted dipole spinors and the colour ordered radiative amplitudes. We find that next-to-maximal helicity violating amplitudes do not play a role in this correction. Compact analytic expressions of next-to-leading power leading logarithms coming from different helicity configurations are shown.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Fictitious States for Bell Inequality Violation in Bipartite Qubit Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a significant interest in testing quantum entanglement and Bell inequality violation in high-energy experiments. Since the analyses in high-energy experiments are performed with events statistically averaged over phase space, the states used to determine observables depend on the choice of coordinates through an event-dependent basis and are thus not genuine quantum states, but rather "fictitious states." We prove that if Bell inequality violation is observed with a fictitious state, then it implies the same for a quantum sub-state. We further show analytically that the basis which diagonalizes the spin-spin correlations is optimal for constructing fictitious states, and for maximizing the violation of Bell's inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00872v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an in-depth analysis of axions and axion-like particles in top-pair production at the LHC. Our main goal is to probe the axion coupling to top quarks at high energies. To this end, we calculate the top-antitop cross section and differential distributions including ALP effects up to one-loop level. By comparing these predictions with LHC precision measurements, we constrain the top coupling of axion-like particles with masses below the top-antitop threshold. Our results apply to all UV completions of the ALP effective theory with dominant couplings to top quarks, in particular to DFSZ-like axion models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the experimental constraints on the multipolar dark matter that has derivative coupling to the visible sector mediated by the Standard Model photon. The momentum dependent interaction enables them to be captured efficiently within massive celestial bodies boosted by their steep gravitational potential. This phenomena makes compact celestial bodies as an efficient target to probe such type of dark matter candidates. We demonstrate that a synergy of the updated direct detection results from DarkSide-50 and LUX-ZEPLIN together with IceCube bounds on high energy solar neutrinos from dark matter capture disfavour the viable parameter space of the dipolar dark matter scenario. Whereas, for the anapole dark matter scenario, a narrow window survives that lies within the reach of prospective heating signals due to the capture of dark matter at cold neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Sound velocity peak induced by the chiral partner in dense two-color QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00430v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the peak structure of the sound velocity was observed in the lattice simulation of two-color and two-flavor QCD at the finite quark chemical potential. The comparison with the chiral perturbation theory (ChPT) result was undertaken, however, the ChPT failed in reproducing the peak structure. In this study, to extend the ChPT framework, we incorporate contributions of the $\sigma$ meson, that is identified as the chiral partner of pions, on top of the low-energy pion dynamics by using the linear sigma model (LSM). Based on the LSM we derive analytic expressions of the thermodynamic quantities as well as the sound velocity within a mean-field approximation. As a result, we find that those quantities are provided by sums of the ChPT results and corrections, where the latter is characterized by a mass difference between the chiral partners, the $\sigma$ meson and pion. The chiral partner contributions are found to yield a peak in the sound velocity successfully. We furthermore show that the sound velocity peak emerges only when $m_\sigma &gt;\sqrt{3}m_\pi$ and $\mu_q &gt; m_\pi$, with $m_{\sigma(\pi)}$ and $\mu_q$ being the $\sigma$ meson (pion) mass and the quark chemical potential, respectively. The correlation between the sound velocity peak and the sign of the trace anomaly is also addressed.</description>

Abstract: We examine neutrino zeromode solutions on the electroweak $Z$-string and their effect on the stability of the string in the standard model and its extensions. We propose using topological invariants constructed from the momentum (and real) space topology of Green's functions, often used for investigating edge modes in condensed matter physics. We analyze the standard model and then examine type-I and type-II extensions of the neutrino sector as well as their hybrid. Based on this analysis, we also comment on proposals in the literature to stabilize the $Z$-string.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17144v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss a simple theory for neutrino masses where the total lepton number is a local gauge symmetry spontaneously broken below the multi-TeV scale. In this context, the neutrino masses are generated through the canonical seesaw mechanism and a Majorana dark matter candidate is predicted from anomaly cancellation. We discuss in great detail the dark matter annihilation channels and find out the upper bound on the symmetry breaking scale using the cosmological bounds on the relic density. Since in this context the dark matter candidate has suppressed couplings to the Standard Model quarks, one can satisfy the direct detection bounds even if the dark matter mass is close to the electroweak scale. This theory predicts a light pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (the Majoron) associated to the mechanism of neutrino mass. We discuss briefly the properties of the Majoron and the impact of the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy neutral gauge bosons arise in many motivated models of Beyond the Standard Model Physics. Experimental searches require that such gauge bosons are above the TeV scale in most models which means that the tools of effective field theories, in particular the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT), are useful. We match the SMEFT to models with heavy $Z^\prime$ bosons, including effects of dimension-8 operators, and consider the restrictions on model parameters from electroweak precision measurements and from Drell Yan invariant mass distributions and forward-backward asymmetry, $A_\text{FB}$, measurements at the LHC. The results demonstrate the model dependence of the resulting limits on SMEFT coefficients and the relatively small impact of including dimension-8 matching. In all cases, the limits from invariant mass distributions are stronger than from $A_\text{FB}$ measurements in the $Z^\prime$ models we consider.</description>

      <title>Matter Asymmetries in the $Z_N$ Dark matter -companion Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05694v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of $Z_{N\geq 3}$-symmetric WIMP dark matter models that are characterized by the semi-annihilation into the companion of dark matter has been proposed in ref.~\cite{Guo:2021rre}, providing a mechanism to evade the stringent direct detection constraint. In this work, we point out that such models naturally provide the three Sakharov elements necessary for dark matter asymmetry, and moreover this asymmetry can be transferred to the visible sector with a proper link to the leptonic or quark sector. In our minimal $Z_3$ example, the migration to the leptonic sector is via the asymmetric companion decay into neutrinos, and the lepton asymmetry can be further transferred to the quark sector. The CP violation parameter in the model is suppressed in the limit of static annihilation of dark matter, and the lift from thermal motion has been studied for the first time. A preliminary numerical analysis based on the Boltzmann equations shows that both correct relic density of dark matter and baryon asymmetry can be accommodated.</description>

      <title>Simulating Heavy Neutral Leptons with General Couplings at Collider and Fixed Target Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are motivated by attempts to explain neutrino masses and dark matter. If their masses are in the MeV to several GeV range, HNLs are light enough to be copiously produced at collider and accelerator facilities, but also heavy enough to decay to visible particles on length scales that can be observed in particle detectors. Previous studies evaluating the sensitivities of experiments have often focused on simple, but not particularly well-motivated, models in which the HNL mixes with only one active neutrino flavor. In this work, we accurately simulate models for HNL masses between 100 MeV and 10 GeV and arbitrary couplings to $e$, $\mu$, and $\tau$ leptons. We include over 150 HNL production channels and over 100 HNL decay modes, including all of the processes that can be dominant in some region of the general parameter space. The result is HNLCalc, a user-friendly, fast, and flexible library to compute the properties of HNL models. As examples, we implement HNLCalc to extend the FORESEE package to evaluate the prospects for HNL discovery at forward LHC experiments. We present sensitivity reaches for FASER and FASER2 in five benchmark scenarios with coupling ratios $|U_e|^2 : |U_\mu|^2 : |U_{\tau}|^2$ = 1:0:0, 0:1:0, 0:0:1, 0:1:1, and 1:1:1, where the latter two have not been studied previously. Comparing these to current constraints, we identify regions of parameter space with significant discovery prospects.</description>

      <title>Search for nearly degenerate higgsinos via photon fusion with the semileptonic channel at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11271v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electroweak scale higgsinos with a nearly degenerate spectrum in supersymmetric models are well-motivated, but generally less constrained at collider experiments as the decay products are often too soft to detect. Initial photon fusions alongside the collision of protons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have drawn attention recently as a way to search for new physics with such kind of spectra. In this paper, we demonstrate a search strategy for chargino pair production from photon fusion $pp\to p(\gamma\gamma\to\tilde{\chi}^{+}_{1}\tilde{\chi}^{-}_{1})p$ at the 13 TeV LHC via the semileptonic decay channel, as a probe for the compressed spectra of higgsinos. Forward detectors make it possible to detect the outgoing protons after emitting the initial photons in these processes. We here provide simple event selections on missing energy and transverse momentum of leptons, which are effective enough to reach significant sensitivity. The chargino mass can be excluded at 95\% C.L. up to about 295 GeV with the mass difference $\Delta m(\tilde{\chi}^{\pm}_{1},\tilde{\chi}^{0}_{1})$ being only a few GeV with the integrated luminosity of 3 ab$^{-1}$. With a relatively small luminosity of 100 fb$^{-1}$, the $2\sigma$ exclusion bounds can as well exceed current experimental limits in the range of $\Delta m=1\sim2$ GeV, reaching over 190 GeV for chargino mass.</description>

      <title>Vetoing all the Higgs imposters in $H\to \ell^-\ell^+ Z$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop an effective and methodical algorithm for the construction of general covariant four-point $H\ell\ell Z$ vertices, accommodating leptons $\ell=e, \mu$, and designed to handle a boson $H$ of any integer spin, not merely confined to spins up to 2. While our numerical analysis assumes the $H$-boson mass to be $m_H=125\,{\rm GeV}$, the analytical framework we propose is versatile, enabling the examination of various mass as well as spin scenarios. These meticulously devised general covariant four-point $H\ell\ell Z$ vertices are pivotal in vetoing all the imposters of the Standard Model Higgs boson holding the spin-0 and even-parity quantum numbers, especially in one of its primary decay channels, the three-body decay process $H\to \ell^-\ell^+ Z$, observable at the Large Hadron Collider. Our innovative strategy encompasses the analysis of all the effectively allowed scenarios, extending beyond the limitations of previous investigations on the Higgs spin and parity determinations in the decay $H \to \ell^-\ell^+ Z$. Based on the significantly expanded scheme, we demonstrate that the Higgs boson imposter of any spin and parity can be definitively vetoed by leveraging threshold effects and angular correlations, even though achieving such conclusive results in practical and exhaustive analyses necessitates high event rates.</description>

Abstract: Massless chiral excitations can arise from the interactions between a fermion and an axion string, propagating along the string and allowing it to superconduct. The properties of these excitations, or zero modes, dictate how the string interacts with light and can thus have important phenomenological consequences. In this paper, we add a nowhere-vanishing Dirac mass for the fermion in the usual model of axion electrodynamics. We find that the zero modes exhibit an interesting phase structure in which they delocalize from the string's core as the mass increases, up until a critical value past which they disappear. We study this structure from an analytic perspective, with explicit numerical solutions, and via anomaly inflow arguments. Finally, we derive the two-dimensional effective theory of the zero mode and its interactions with the four-dimensional gauge field and show how this effective theory breaks down as the zero modes delocalize.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12501v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of inelastic collisions between dark matter (DM) and heavy cosmic ray (CR) nuclei on CR propagation. We approximate the fragmentation cross-sections for DM-CR collisions using collider-measured proton-nuclei scattering cross-sections, allowing us to assess how these collisions affect the spectra of CR Boron and Carbon. We derive new CR spectra from DM-CR collisions by incorporating their cross-sections into the source terms and solving the diffusion equation for the complete network of reactions involved in generating secondary species. In a specific example with a coupling strength of $b_{\chi}=0.1$ and a DM mass of $m_{\chi}=0.1$ GeV, considering a simplified scenario where DM interacts exclusively with Oxygen, a notable modification in the Boron-to-Carbon spectrum due to the DM-CR interaction is observed. Particularly, the peak within the spectrum, spanning from $0.1$ GeV to $10$ GeV, experiences an enhancement of approximately 1.5 times. However, in a more realistic scenario where DM particles interact with all CRs, this peak can be amplified to twice its original value.Utilizing the latest data from AMS-02 and DAMPE on the Boron-to-Carbon ratio, we estimate a 95\% upper limit for the effective inelastic cross-section of DM-proton as a function of DM mass. Our findings reveal that at $m_\chi\simeq 2$ MeV, the effective inelastic cross-section between DM and protons must be less than $\mathcal{O}(10^{-32})~{\rm cm}^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.10166v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We systematically study a family of loop quantizations for the classical Kruskal spacetimes using the effective description motivated from loop quantum gravity for four generic parameters, $c_o, m, \delta_b$, and $\delta_c$, where the latter two denote the polymerization parameters that capture the underlying quantum geometry. We focus on the family where polymerization parameters are constant on dynamical trajectories and of which the Ashtekar-Olmedo-Singh (AOS) and Corichi-Singh (CS) models appear as special cases. We study general features of singularity resolution in all these models due to quantum gravity effects and analytically extend the solutions across the white hole (WH) and black hole (BH) horizons to the exterior. We find that the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of the Kretschmann scalar is $r^{-4}$. However, for AOS and CS models, black holes with masses greater than solar mass, the dominant term behaves as $r^{-6}$ for the size of the observable Universe and our analysis can be used to phenomenologically constrain the choice of parameters for other models. In addition, one can uniquely fix the parameter $c_o$ by requiring that the Hawking temperature at the BH horizon to the leading order be consistent with its classical value for a macroscopic BH. Assuming that the BH and WH masses are of the same order, we are able to identify a family of choices of $\delta_b$ and $\delta_c$ which share all the desired properties of the AOS model.</description>

Abstract: Till today, the nature of Dark Matter (DM) remains elusive despite all our efforts. This missing matter of the universe has not been observed by the already operating DM direct-detection experiments, but we can infer its gravitational effects. Galaxies and clusters of galaxies are most likely to contain DM trapped to their gravitational field. This leads us to the natural assumption that compact objects might contain DM too. Among the compact objects exist in galaxies, neutron stars are considered as natural laboratories, where theories can be tested, and observational data can be received. Thus, many models of DM have proposed it's presence in those stars. In particular, in the present study we focus on two types of dark matter particles, namely fermions and bosons with a mass range of [0.01-1.5] GeV and self-interaction strength in the range [10$^{-4}$-10$^{-1}$] MeV$^{-1}$. By employing the two-fluid model, we discovered a stable area in the M-R diagram of a celestial formation consisting of neutron star matter and DM that is substantial in size. This formation spans hundreds of kilometers in diameter and possesses a mass equivalent to 100 or more times the Solar mass. To elucidate, this entity resembles an enormous celestial body of DM, with a neutron star at its core. This implies that a supramassive stellar compact entity can exist without encountering any issues of stability and without undergoing a collapse into a black hole. In any case, the present theoretical prediction can, if combined with corresponding observations, shed light on the existence of DM and even more on its basic properties.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{Z}_3$ lattice gauge theory as a toy model for dense QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07595v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose the $(3+1)$-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_3$ lattice gauge theory coupled with the 2-flavor Wilson-Dirac fermion as a toy model for studying quantum chromodynamics (QCD) at nonzero density. We study its phase diagram in the space of the lattice gauge couplings $g^2$ and the quark chemical potentials $\mu$ and discuss the similarity and difference compared with anticipated behaviors of actual QCD. This model also provides a testing ground for various algorithms of the numerical Hamiltonian formalism as its Hilbert space is finite-dimensional in a finite box.</description>

      <title>Fermi-Dirac Integrals in Degenerate Regimes: A Novel Asymptotic Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05287v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterize in a novel manner the physical properties of the low temperature Fermi gas in the degenerate domain as a function of temperature and chemical potential. For the first time we obtain low temperature $T$ results in the domain where several fermions are found within a de Broglie spatial cell. In this regime, the usual high degeneracy Sommerfeld expansion fails. The other known semi-classical Boltzmann domain applies when fewer than one particle is found in the de Broglie cell. We also improve on the understanding of the Sommerfeld expansion in the regime where the chemical potential is close to the mass and also in the high temperature regime. In these calculcations we use a novel characterization of the Fermi distribution allowing the separation of the finite and zero temperature phenomena. The relative errors of the three approximate methods (Boltzmann limit, Sommerfeld expansion, and the new domain of several particles in the de Broglie cell) are quantified.</description>

      <title>Towards Universal Unfolding of Detector Effects in High-Energy Physics using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The unfolding of detector effects in experimental data is critical for enabling precision measurements in high-energy physics. However, traditional unfolding methods face challenges in scalability, flexibility, and dependence on simulations. We introduce a novel unfolding approach using conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (cDDPM). Our method utilizes the cDDPM for a non-iterative, flexible posterior sampling approach, which exhibits a strong inductive bias that allows it to generalize to unseen physics processes without explicitly assuming the underlying distribution. We test our approach by training a single cDDPM to perform multidimensional particle-wise unfolding for a variety of physics processes, including those not seen during training. Our results highlight the potential of this method as a step towards a "universal" unfolding tool that reduces dependence on truth-level assumptions.</description>
