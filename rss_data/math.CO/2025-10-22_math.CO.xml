      <title>Sunflower Bound with a Sub-Logarithmic Base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a family $\mathcal{F}$ of sets each of cardinality $m \in \mathbb{Z}_{&gt;2}$ includes a $k$-sunflower if $ |\mathcal{F}| \ge \left( \frac{c k^2 \ln m}{\ln \ln m} \right)^m$ for some constant $c&gt;0$, where $k$-sunflower means a family of $k$ different sets with a common pairwise intersection. The base of the exponential lower bound is sub-logarithmic for each $k$ updating the current best-known result.</description>

      <title>Polynomial bounds for pathwidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dallard, Milani\v{c}, and \v{S}torgel conjectured that for a hereditary graph class $\mathcal{G}$, if there is some function $f:\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}$ such that every graph $G\in \mathcal{G}$ with clique number $\omega(G)$ has treewidth at most $f(\omega(G))$, then there is a polynomial function $f$ with the same property. Chudnovsky and Trotignon refuted this conjecture in a strong sense, showing that neither polynomial nor any prescribed growth can be guaranteed in general. Here we prove that, in stark contrast, the analog of the Dallard-Milani\v{c}-\v{S}torgel conjecture for pathwidth is true: For every hereditary graph class $\mathcal{G}$, if the pathwidth of every graph in $\mathcal{G}$ is bounded by some function of its clique number, then the pathwidth of every graph in $\mathcal{G}$ is bounded by a polynomial function of its clique number.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $b_{t,i}(n)$ denote the total number of $i$-hooks in $t$-regular partitions of $n$. Singh and Barman conjectured that $b_{t+1,2}(n) \geq b_{t,2}(n)$ holds for all $t\ge 3$ and $n\ge 0$. This conjecture was known to hold for $t=3$ due to work of Barman Mahanta and Singh. In this paper, we prove this conjecture.</description>

      <title>Congruences modulo powers of $3$ for generalized Frobenius partitions $C\Psi_{6,0}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1984, Andrews introduced the family of partition functions $c\phi_k(n)$, the number of generalized Frobenius partitions of $n$ with $k$ colors. We have proved a conjecture on congruences modulo powers of 3 for $c\phi_6(n)$ before. In this paper, we establish a connection between $C\Psi_{6,3}$ and $C\Psi_{6,0}$ via an Atkin-Lehner involution and prove congruences modulo powers of 3 for $c\psi_{6,0}(n)$.</description>

      <title>On better-quasi-ordering under graph minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19285v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the aftermath of the Robertson--Seymour Graph Minor Theorem, Thomas conjectured that the countable graphs are well-quasi-ordered under the minor relation. We prove that this conjecture, when restricted to graphs with no infinite paths (rays), is equivalent to the statement that the finite graphs are better-quasi-ordered, another well-known open problem. Even more, we prove that the latter implies that the countable rayless graphs are better-quasi-ordered.
  We prove several other statements to be equivalent to the above, one of which being that the rayless countable graphs of rank $\alpha$ can be decomposed into exactly $\aleph_0$ minor-twin classes for every ordinal $\alpha&lt;\omega_1$.
  By restricting the latter statement to trees, and combining it with Nash-Williams' theorem that the infinite trees are well-quasi-ordered, we deduce as a side result that a minor-closed family of N-labelled rayless forests is Borel -- in the Tychonoff product topology -- if and only if it does not contain all rayless forests.
  As another side-result, we prove Seymour's self-minor conjecture for rayless graphs of any cardinality.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Ramsey theory of Diophantine equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of asymptotic partition regularity for Diophantine equations. We show how this notion is at the core of almost all known negative results in the Ramsey theory of equations, and we use it to produce new ones, as in the case of Fermat-Catalan equations. The methods we use here are based on translating asymptotic partition regularity into the context of nonstandard extensions, via the notion of Archimedean equivalence classes of hypernaturals.</description>

      <title>Knuth's big-chooser matchbox process: the case of many matchboxes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Banach's matchbox problem considers the setting of two matchboxes that each initially contain the same number of matches. Boxes are chosen with equal probability and a match removed each time. The problem concerns the law of the number of matches remaining in one box once the other box empties. Knuth considered a generalization of this problem whereby `big-choosers' arrive with probability $p$ and remove a match from the box with the most number remaining, and `little-choosers' arrive with probability $1-p$ and remove a match from the box with the least number remaining.
  In this paper we consider Knuth's generalization for the case of $k$ matchboxes. We determine the generating function for the expected number of matches remaining in $k-1$ matchboxes once a box first empties, a quantity we refer to as the `residue'. Interestingly, this generating function is a quotient whose denominator contains a generating function for a special case of the Raney numbers. The form for this generating function allows us to give an expression for the expected residue in terms of a sum that involves diagonal state return probabilities, where a diagonal state is a configuration in which all matchboxes each contain the same number of matches. We use analytic techniques to determine the asymptotic behaviour of this expected value for all values of $p$, which involves the study of an asymmetric random walk.
  We also consider the expected value of the order of the first return to a diagonal state and determine its asymptotic behaviour. The coefficients of the diagonal state probability generating function are shown to be related to `manila folder configurations in a filing cabinet', and we make this connection precise. This allows us to use known results for the enumeration of such manila folder configurations to give a closed form expression for the diagonal state return probabilities.</description>

      <title>Geometric description of $d$-dimensional flows of a graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $d$-dimensional nowhere-zero $r$-flow on a graph $G$, an $(r,d)$-NZF from now on, is a flow where the value on each edge is an element of $\mathbb{R}^d$ whose (Euclidean) norm lies in the interval $[1, r-1]$. Such a notion is a natural generalization of the well-known concept of a circular nowhere-zero $r$-flow (i.e.\ $d = 1$). The minimum of the real numbers $r$ such that a graph $G$ admits an $(r, d)$-NZF is called the $d$-dimensional flow number of $G$ and is denoted by $\phi_d(G)$. In this paper we provide a geometric description of some $d$-dimensional flows on a graph $G$, and we prove that the existence of a suitable cycle double cover of $G$ is equivalent, for $G$, to admit such a geometrically constructed $(r,d)$-NZF. This geometric approach allows us to provide upper bounds for $\phi_{d-2}(G)$ and $\phi_{d-1}(G)$, assuming that $G$ admits an (oriented) $d$-cycle double cover.</description>

      <title>Closed-Form Analysis and Extremal Bounds of Albertson and Sigma Indices in Trees with Prescribed Degree Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study explores the irregularity properties of trees with prescribed degree sequences by analyzing two prominent topological indices: the Albertson index and the sigma index.
  With a particular emphasis on caterpillar trees -frequently used to model molecular chains- we derive a closed-form expression for the Albertson index: \[ \mathrm{irr}(\mathscr{C}(n,m)) = m(m+1)n - 2m + 2, \quad \text{for } n \geq 3. \] Furthermore, we establish extremal bounds for both indices across tree families characterized by fixed degree sequences. The results yield a unified analytical framework for comparing linear and quadratic irregularity measures, and provide new structural insights relevant to applications in chemical graph theory and extremal graph analysis.</description>

      <title>A characterization of graphs of diameter two with fewer lines than vertices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2008 Chen and Chv\'atal conjectured that any metric space on n points has at least n lines, unless all the points belong to one line. Chv\atal proved in 2014 that this is indeed the case for metric spaces with distances 0, 1 and 2. In this work, we prove that there exists a family of ten graphs such that a metric space defined by a graph of diameter two has fewer lines than points if and only if the associated graph belongs to that family.</description>

      <title>String graphs are quasi-isometric to planar graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19602v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that for every countable string graph $S$, there is a planar graph $G$ with $V(G)=V(S)$ such that \[ \frac{1}{23660800}d_S(u,v) \le d_G(u,v) \le 162 d_S(u,v) \] for all $u,v\in V(S)$, where $d_S(u,v)$, $d_G(u,v)$ denotes the distance between $u$ and $v$ in $S$ and $G$ respectively. In other words, string graphs are quasi-isometric to planar graphs.
  This theorem lifts a number of theorems from planar graphs to string graphs, we give some examples. String graphs have Assouad-Nagata (and asymptotic dimension) at most 2. Connected, locally finite, quasi-transitive string graphs are accessible. A finitely generated group $\Gamma$ is virtually a free product of free and surface groups if and only if $\Gamma$ is quasi-isometric to a string graph.
  Two further corollaries are that countable planar metric graphs and complete Riemannian planes are also quasi-isometric to planar graphs, which answers a question of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu. For finite string graphs and planar metric graphs, our proofs yield polynomial time (for string graphs, this is in terms of the size of a representation given in the input) algorithms for generating such quasi-isometric planar graphs.</description>

      <title>Rational Exponents for Generalized Tur\'an Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generalized Tur\'an number $\text{ex}(n,H,\mathcal{F})$ denotes the maximum number of copies of $H$ in an $n$-vertex graph which contains no copies of any graph in a family $\mathcal{F}$ of graphs. The generalized rational exponents conjecture states that for every rational $r\geq 1$ there exist graphs $H,F$ such that $\text{ex}(n,H,\{F\})=\Theta(n^r)$. We extend a result of Bukh and Conlon to show that for every non-empty graph $H$ on $v\geq 2$ vertices and every rational $r$ in the interval $[v-1,v]$ there exists a finite family $\mathcal{F}_r$ such that $\text{ex}(n,H,\mathcal{F}_r)=\Theta(n^r)$.</description>

      <title>Burling graphs in graphs with large chromatic number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph class is $\chi$-bounded if the only way to force large chromatic number in graphs from the class is by forming a large clique. In the 1970s, Erd\H{o}s conjectured that intersection graphs of straight-line segments in the plane are $\chi$-bounded, but this was disproved by Pawlik et al. (2014), who showed another way to force large chromatic number in this class -- by triangle-free graphs $B_k$ with $\chi(B_k)=k$ constructed by Burling (1965). This also disproved the celebrated conjecture of Scott (1997) that classes of graphs excluding induced subdivisions of a fixed graph are $\chi$-bounded.
  We prove that in broad classes of graphs excluding induced subdivisions of a fixed graph, including the increasingly more general classes of segment intersection graphs, string graphs, region intersection graphs, and hereditary classes of graphs with finite asymptotic dimension, large chromatic number can be forced only by large cliques or large graphs $B_k$.
  One corollary is that the hereditary closure of $\{B_k\colon k\geq 1\}$ forms a minimal hereditary graph class with unbounded chromatic number -- the second known graph class with this property after the class of complete graphs. Another corollary is that the decision variant of approximate coloring in the aforementioned graph classes can be solved in polynomial time by exhaustively searching for a sufficiently large clique or copy of $B_k$. We also discuss how our results along with some results of Chudnovsky, Scott, and Seymour on the existence of colorings can be turned into polynomial-time algorithms for the search variant of approximate coloring in string graphs (with intersection model in the input) and other aforementioned graph classes. Such an algorithm has not yet been known for any graph class that is not $\chi$-bounded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19681v1 Announce Type: new

Motivated by its application in hypergraph Tur\'{a}n problems, we establish a refinement of their result under the additional assumption that the graph contains a large independent set in which every vertex has high degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a random construction proving that the extreme off-diagonal Ramsey numbers satisfy $R(3,k)\ge \left(\frac12+o(1)\right)\frac{k^2}{\log{k}}$. This bound has been conjectured to be asymptotically tight, and improves the previously best bound $R(3,k)\ge \left(\frac13+o(1)\right)\frac{k^2}{\log{k}}$. In contrast to all previous constructions achieving the correct order of magnitude, we do not use a nibble argument, and the proof is significantly less technical.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19746v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recoverable systems provide coarse models of data storage on the two-dimensional square lattice, where each site reconstructs its value from neighboring sites according to a specified local rule. To study the typical behavior of recoverable patterns, this work introduces an interaction potential on the local recovery regions of the lattice, which defines a corresponding interaction model. We establish uniqueness of the Gibbs measure at high temperature and derive bounds on the entropy in the zero- and low-temperature regimes.
  For the recovery rule under consideration, exactly recoverable configurations coincide with maximal independent sets of the grid. Relying on methods developed for the standard hard-core model, we show phase coexistence at high activity in the maximal case. Unlike the standard hard-core model, however, the maximal version admits nontrivial ground states even at low activity, and we manage to classify them explicitly. We further verify the Peierls condition for the associated contour model. Combined with the Pirogov-Sinai theory, this shows that each ground state gives rise to an extremal Gibbs measure, proving phase coexistence at low activity.</description>

      <title>Recognizing Leaf Powers and Pairwise Compatibility Graphs is NP-Complete</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leaf powers and pairwise compatibility graphs were introduced over twenty years ago as simplified graph models for phylogenetic trees. Despite significant research, several properties of these graph classes remain poorly understood. In this paper, we establish that the recognition problem for both classes is NP-complete. We extend this hardness result to a broader hierarchy of graph classes, including pairwise compatibility graphs and their generalizations, multi interval pairwise compatibility graphs.</description>

      <title>Forbidden Sidon subsets of perfect difference sets, featuring a human-assisted proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We resolve a $1000 Erd\H{o}s prize problem, complete with formal verification generated by a large language model.
  In over a dozen papers, beginning in 1976 and spanning two decades, Paul Erd\H{o}s repeatedly posed one of his "favourite" conjectures: every finite Sidon set can be extended to a finite perfect difference set. We establish that {1, 2, 4, 8, 13} is a counterexample to this conjecture.
  During the preparation of this paper, we discovered that although this problem was presumed to be open for half a century, Marshall Hall, Jr. published a different counterexample three decades before Erd\H{o}s first posed the problem. With a healthy skepticism of this apparent oversight, and out of an abundance of caution, we used ChatGPT to vibe code a Lean proof of both Hall's and our counterexamples.</description>

      <title>Partition functions that repel perfect-powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A conjecture by Sun states that the partition function $p(n)$, for $n&gt;1$, is never a perfect power. Recent work by Merca et al. proposes generalizations of perfect-power repulsion for $p(n)$. In this note, we prove these generalizations for the functions $p_B(n)$, which count the number of partitions of $n$ with the largest part $\leq B$. If $B\geq 4$ and $k\geq 3$, with $k\nmid (B-1)$, then we prove that there are only finitely many pairs $(n,m)$ for which $$\lvert p_B(n)-m^k\rvert\le d.$$ These results support Sun and Merca et al.'s conjectures, as $p_B(n) \rightarrow p(n)$ when $B \rightarrow +\infty.$ To prove this, we reduce the problem to Siegel's Theorem, which guarantees the finiteness of integral points on curves with genus $\geq 1$.</description>

      <title>Supermodular Maximization with Cardinality Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $V$ be a finite set of $n$ elements, $f: 2^V \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$ be a nonnegative monotone supermodular function, and $k$ be a positive integer no greater than $n$. This paper addresses the problem of maximizing $f(S)$ over all subsets $S \subseteq V$ subject to the cardinality constraint $|S| = k$ or $|S|\le k$.
  Let $r$ be a constant integer. The function $f$ is assumed to be {\em $r$-decomposable}, meaning there exist $m\,(\ge1)$ subsets $V_1, \dots, V_m$ of $V$, each with a cardinality at most $r$, and a corresponding set of nonnegative supermodular functions $f_i : 2^{V_i} \rightarrow \mathbb{R}_+$, $i=1,\ldots,m$ such that $f(S) =\sum_{i=1}^m f_i(S \cap V_i)$ holds for each $S \subseteq V$. Given $r$ as an input, we present a polynomial-time $O(n^{(r-1)/2})$-approximation algorithm for this maximization problem, which does not require prior knowledge of the specific decomposition.
  When the decomposition $(V_i,f_i)_{i=1}^m$ is known, an additional connectivity requirement is introduced to the problem. Let $G$ be the graph with vertex set $V$ and edge set $\cup_{i=1}^m \{uv:u,v\in V_i,u\neq v\}$. The cardinality constrained solution set $S$ is required to induce a connected subgraph in $G$. This model generalizes the well-known problem of finding the densest connected $k$-subgraph. We propose a polynomial time $O(n^{(r-1)/2})$-approximation algorithm for this generalization. Notably, this algorithm gives an $O(n^{1/2})$-approximation for the densest connected $k$-subgraph problem, improving upon the previous best-known approximation ratio of $O(n^{2/3})$.</description>

      <title>Escape of Mass of the $p$-Cantor Sequence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime. In 2017, Kemarsky, Paulin, and Shapira (KPS) conjectured that any Laurent series over $\mathbb{F}_p$ exhibits full escape of mass with respect to any irreducible polynomial $P(t)\in\mathbb{F}_p[t]$. In 2025, this was shown to be false in the case $p=2$ and $P(t)=t$ by Nesharim, Shapira and the first named author. This work shows that for any odd prime $p$ and any irreducible polynomial $P(t)\in\mathbb{F}_p[t]$, the so-called $p$-Cantor sequence provides a counterexample to the aforementioned conjecture over $\mathbb{F}_p$. Furthermore, the concepts of maximal escape of mass and generic escape of mass are introduced. These lead to two natural variations of the KPS conjecture, both of which are shown to hold for all previous counterexamples.</description>

Abstract: We construct infinite periodic versions of the stress matrix and establish sufficient conditions for periodic tensegrity frameworks to be globally rigid in $\mathbb{R}^d$ in the cases when the lattice is either fixed, fully flexible, or flexible with a volume constraint for the fundamental domain. For the fixed and fully flexible lattice variants, we also establish necessary and sufficient conditions for generic infinite periodic bar-joint frameworks to be globally rigid in $\mathbb{R}^d$. These results provide periodic versions of the fundamental results of Connelly, as well as Gortler, Healy and Thurston on the global rigidity of generic finite bar-joint frameworks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $H_n$ be the row space of a signed adjacency matrix of a $C_4$-free bipartite bi-regular graph in which one part has degree $d(n)\to\infty$ and the other part has degree $k+1$ where $k\geq 1$ is a fixed integer. We show that the local limit as $n\to \infty$ of the determinantal process corresponding to the orthogonal projection on $H_n$ is a variant of a Poisson$(k)$ branching process conditioned to survive.
  This setup covers a wide class of determinantal processes such as uniform spanning trees, Kalai's determinantal hypertrees, hyperforests in regular cell complexes, discrete Grassmanians, incidence matroids and more, as long as their degree tends to $\infty$.</description>

Abstract: Kempe equivalence is a classical and fundamental notion in graph coloring theory. In the present paper we establish a connection between Kempe equivalence and quadratic stable set ring, which are toric rings associated to graphs. In fact, we characterize when the stable set ring of a graph is quadratic by using Kempe equivalence. As an application, we relate our theorem to the theory of perfectly contractile graphs, a hereditary subclass of perfect graphs introduced by Bertschi. In particular, our characterization implies that the conjecture of Everett and Reed on perfectly contractile graphs entails the conjecture of the authors and Shibata on quadratic stable set rings. Furthermore, we show that the stable set rings of several important subclasses of perfectly contractile graphs including weakly chordal graphs are quadratic. Finally, we propose a new combinatorial conjecture characterizing perfectly contractile graphs purely in terms of Kempe equivalence on replication graphs.</description>

      <title>Higher Dimer Covers on Snake Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Snake graphs are a class of planar graphs that are important in the theory of cluster algebras. Indeed, the Laurent expansions of the cluster variables in cluster algebras from surfaces are given as weight generating functions for 1-dimer covers (or perfect matchings) of snake graphs. Moreover, the enumeration of 1-dimer covers of snake graphs provides a combinatorial interpretation of continued fractions. In particular, the number of 1-dimer covers of the snake graph $\mathscr{G}[a_1,\dots,a_n]$ is the numerator of the continued fraction $[a_1,\dots,a_n]$. This number is equal to the top left entry of the matrix product $\left(\begin{smallmatrix} a_1&amp;1\\1&amp;0 \end{smallmatrix}\right) \cdots \left(\begin{smallmatrix} a_n&amp;1\\1&amp;0 \end{smallmatrix}\right)$.
  In this paper, we give enumerative results on $m$-dimer covers of snake graphs. We show that the number of $m$-dimer covers of the snake graph $\mathscr{G}[a_1,\ldots,a_n]$ is the top left entry of a product of analogous $(m+1)$-by-$(m+1)$ matrices. We discuss how our enumerative results are related to other known combinatorial formulas, and we suggest a generalization of continued fractions based on our methods. These generalized continued fractions provide some interesting open questions and a possibly novel approach towards Hermite's problem for cubic irrationals.</description>

Abstract: We prove that every locally finite, quasi-transitive graph with a thick end whose cycle space is generated by cycles of bounded length contains the full-grid as an asymptotic minor and as a diverging minor. This in particular includes all locally finite Cayley graphs of finitely presented groups that are not virtually free, and partially solves problems of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu and of Georgakopoulos and Hamann.
  Additionally, we show that every (not necessarily quasi-transitive) graph of finite maximum degree which has a thick end and whose cycle space is generated by cycles of bounded length contains the half-grid as an asymptotic minor and as a diverging minor.</description>

Abstract: There are several interrelated notions of discrete curvature on graphs. Many approaches utilize the optimal transportation metric on its probability simplex or the distance matrix of the graph. In this survey article, we compute formulas for three different types of curvature on graphs. Along the way we obtain: a comparison result for the curvatures under consideration, a degree-diameter theorem for trees, and a combinatorial identity for certain sums of distances on trees.</description>

Abstract: The objective of this work is to establish a mathematical framework for the study of symmetric shift registers over the field GF(2). The present paper gives a new approach where the symmetric shift registers are represented by associated systems of nonlinear difference equations. Arithmetical progressions will play a central part. This approach clarifies the underlying structures and makes it easier to determine the minimal periods of the sequences generated by the symmetric shift registers. Key words: Shift registers, nonlinear difference equations, periods, arithmetical progressions, GF(2).</description>

      <title>Perfect Matchings in Random Sparsifications of Dense Hypergraphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11359v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decision problem of perfect matchings in uniform hypergraphs is famously an NP-complete problem. It has been shown by Keevash--Knox--Mycroft [STOC, 2013] that for every $\varepsilon&gt;0$, such decision problem restricted to $k$-uniform hypergraphs $H$ satisfying that every $(k-1)$-set of vertices is in at least $(1/k+\varepsilon)|H|$ edges is tractable, and the quantity $1/k$ is best possible. In this paper we study the existence of perfect matchings in the random $p$-sparsification of such $k$-uniform hypergraphs, that is, for $p=p(n)\in [0,1]$, every edge is kept with probability $p$ independent of others. As a consequence, we give a polynomial-time algorithm that with high probability solves the decision problem; we also derive effective bounds on the number of perfect matchings in such hypergraphs. At last, similar results are obtained for the $F$-factor problem in graphs.
  The key ingredients of the proofs are a strengthened partition lemma for the lattice-based absorption method, and the random redistribution method developed recently by Kelly, M\"uyesser and Pokrovskiy, based on the spread method.</description>

Abstract: The polynomial version of van der Waerden's theorem, proved using dynamical systems by V. Bergelson and A. Leibman in 1996, \cite{Bergelson1996}, significantly highlighted the role of dynamical systems in addressing problems related to monochromatic configurations within algebraic structures. In this paper, by introducing symbolic polynomials, we aim to provide an alternative proof of the polynomial version of van der Waerden's theorem relying solely on Stone-\v{C}ech compactification of an infinite discrete semigroup.</description>

      <title>The distance spectrum of the line graph of the crown graph</title>

Abstract: The distance eigenvalues of a connected graph $G$ are the eigenvalues of its distance matrix $D(G)$. A graph is called distance integral if all of its distance eigenvalues are integers. Let $n \geq 3$ be an integer. The crown graph $Cr(n)$ is a graph obtained from the complete bipartite graph $K_{n,n}$ by removing a perfect matching. Let $L(Cr(n))$ denote the line graph of the crown graph $Cr(n)$. Using the equitable partition method, the set of distinct distance eigenvalues of the graph $L(Cr(n))$ has been determined which shows that this graph is distance integral [S.Morteza Mirafzal, The line graph of the crown graph is distance integral, Linear and Multilinear Algebra 71, no. 4 (2023): 662-672]. The distance spectrum of the graph $L(Cr(n))$ has not been found yet. In this paper, having the set of distance eigenvalues of $L(Cr(n))$ in the hand, we determine the distance spectrum of this graph.</description>

      <title>Enumeration and Distribution of Consecutive Equi-$n$-Squares and Their Algebraic Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce consecutive equi-$n$-squares, a variant of equi-$n$-squares in which at least one row or column is in consecutive or reverse-consecutive order, but every element may not appear in every row or column. We derive exact and asymptotic formulas for the number of consecutive equi-$n$-squares, showing precisely how their proportion among all equi-$n$-squares rapidly approaches zero as $n\to\infty$.
  We also analyze the distribution of consecutive equi-$n$-squares under uniform random sampling and explore connections to algebraic structures, interpreting equi-$n$-squares and consecutive equi-$n$-squares as Cayley tables. Finally, we supplement our theoretical results with Monte Carlo simulations for small values of $n$.</description>

      <title>On the Walsh spectra of quadratic APN functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: APN functions play a central role as building blocks in the design of many block ciphers, serving as optimal functions to resist differential attacks. One of the most important properties of APN functions is their linearity, which is directly related to the Walsh spectrum of the function. In this paper, we establish two novel connections that allow us to derive strong conditions on the Walsh spectra of quadratic APN functions. We prove that the Walsh transform of a quadratic APN function $F$ operating on $n=2k$ bits is uniquely associated with a vector space partition of $\mathbb{F}_2^n$ and a specific blocking set in the corresponding projective space $PG(n-1,2)$. These connections allow us to prove a variety of results on the Walsh spectrum of $F$. We prove for instance that $F$ can have at most one component function of amplitude larger than $2^{3n/4}$. We also find the first nontrivial upper bound on the number of bent component functions of a quadratic APN function, and provide conditions for a function to be CCZ-equivalent to a permutation based on its number of bent components.</description>

      <title>Hitting all longest paths in $H$-free graphs and $H$-graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The \textit{longest path transversal number} of a connected graph $G$, denoted by $lpt(G)$, is the minimum size of a set of vertices of $G$ that intersects all longest paths in $G$. We present constant upper bounds for the longest path transversal number of \textit{hereditary classes of graphs}, that is, classes of graphs closed under taking induced subgraphs. Our first main result is a structural theorem that allows us to \textit{refine} a given longest path transversal in a graph using domination properties. This has several consequences: First, it implies that for every $t \in \{5,6\}$, every connected $P_t$-free graph $G$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq t-2$. Second, it shows that every $(\textit{bull}, \textit{chair})$-free graph $G$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq 5$. Third, it implies that for every $t \in \mathbb{N}$, every connected chordal graph $G$ with no induced subgraph isomorphic to $K_t \mat \overline{K_t}$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq t-1$, where $K_t \mat \overline{K_t}$ is the graph obtained from a $t$-clique and an independent set of size $t$ by adding a perfect matching between them. Our second main result provides an upper bound for the longest path transversal number in \textit{$H$-intersection graphs}. For a given graph $H$, a graph $G$ is called an \textit{$H$-graph} if there exists a subdivision $H'$ of $H$ such that $G$ is the intersection graph of a family of vertex subsets of $H'$ that each induce connected subgraphs. The concept of $H$-graphs, introduced by Bir\'o, Hujter, and Tuza, naturally captures interval graphs, circular-arc graphs, and chordal graphs, among others. Our result shows that for every connected graph $H$ with at least two vertices, there exists an integer $k = k(H)$ such that every connected $H$-graph $G$ satisfies $lpt(G) \leq k$.</description>

      <title>Families of tractable problems with respect to vertex-interval-membership width and its generalisations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Temporal graphs are graphs whose edges are labelled with times at which they are active. Their time-sensitivity provides a useful model of real networks, but renders many problems studied on temporal graphs more computationally complex than their static counterparts. To contend with this, there has been recent work devising parameters for which temporal problems become tractable. One such parameter is vertex-interval-membership (VIM) width. Broadly, this gives a bound on the number of vertices we need to keep track of at any given time to solve many problems. Our contributions are two-fold. Firstly, we introduce a new parameter, tree-interval-membership (TIM) width, that generalises both VIM width and several existing generalisations. Secondly, we provide meta-algorithms for both VIM and TIM width which can be used to prove fixed-parameter-tractability for large families of problems, bypassing the need to give involved dynamic programming arguments for every problem. In doing this, we provide a characterisation of problems in FPT with respect to both parameters. We apply these algorithms to temporal versions of Hamiltonian path, dominating set, matching, and edge deletion to limit maximum reachability.</description>

      <title>An unconditional lower bound for the active-set method in convex quadratic maximization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16648v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that the active-set method needs an exponential number of iterations in the worst-case to maximize a convex quadratic function subject to linear constraints, regardless of the pivot rule used. This substantially improves over the best previously known lower bound [IPCO 2025], which needs objective functions of polynomial degrees $\omega(\log d)$ in dimension $d$, to a bound using a convex polynomial of degree 2. In particular, our result firmly resolves the open question [IPCO 2025] of whether a constant degree suffices, and it represents significant progress towards linear objectives, where the active-set method coincides with the simplex method and a lower bound for all pivot rules would constitute a major breakthrough.
  Our result is based on a novel extended formulation, recursively constructed using deformed products. Its key feature is that it projects onto a polygonal approximation of a parabola while preserving all of its exponentially many vertices. We define a quadratic objective that forces the active-set method to follow the parabolic boundary of this projection, without allowing any shortcuts along chords corresponding to edges of its full-dimensional preimage.</description>

      <title>Bounding the number of holes required for folding rectangular polyominoes into cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18197v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of whether rectangular polyominoes with holes are cube-foldable, that is, whether they can be folded into a cube, if creases are only allowed along grid lines. It is known that holes of sufficient size guarantee that this is the case.
  Smaller holes which by themselves do not make a rectangular polyomino cube-foldable can sometimes be combined to create cube-foldable polyominoes. We investigate minimal sets of holes which guarantee cube-foldability. We show that if all holes are of the same type, the these minimal sets have size at most 4, and if we allow different types of holes, then there is no upper bound on the size.</description>
