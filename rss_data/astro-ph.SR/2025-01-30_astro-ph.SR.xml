      <title>The initial-to-final mass relation of white dwarfs in intermediate-separation binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17220v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the applicability of the initial-to-final mass relation (IFMR) for white dwarfs (WDs) in intermediate-separation binary systems (approximately 1 AU), using astrometric binaries identified in open clusters from Gaia DR3. A careful analysis of the astrometric orbits and spectral energy distributions isolates 33 main-sequence (MS) stars with highly likely WD companions. By combining cluster age estimates, dynamically measured WD masses, and, where available, WD cooling temperatures, we derive progenitor masses for 26 WD candidates. Our analysis suggests the presence of two distinct WD populations: (i) low-mass WDs, likely shaped by binary interactions during the progenitor's red-giant phase; and (ii) "spender" WDs, which experienced higher-than-expected mass loss and have progenitor masses above the IFMR predictions. The rest of the candidates, referred to as the "others", represent systems with inconclusive formation mechanisms. We suggest that at least some of these systems might be hierarchical triples, where the companion to the MS is a double WD or a double-WD merger product. However, follow-up studies are required to determine the nature of each case. These results highlight significant deviations from the IFMR derived for isolated WDs, emphasizing the role of binary evolution. Follow-up observations, particularly in the far-ultraviolet, are crucial for refining these findings and advancing our understanding of mass transfer processes and binary evolution pathways.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Analysis of Close Binary OCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we analyzed the close binary open clusters CWNU 2666 and HSC 224, which are in close spatial proximity, using photometric and astrometric data from the {\it Gaia} DR3 catalog. Likely member stars were identified based on a membership probability threshold ($P \geq 0.5$), resulting in 106 and 146 members for CWNU 2666 and HSC 224, respectively. The mean proper motion components ($\mu_{\alpha}\cos\delta$, $\mu_{\delta}$) were determined to be (0.646$\pm$0.155, -0.769$\pm$0.124) mas yr$^{-1}$ for CWNU 2666, and (0.665$\pm$0.131, -0.728$\pm$0.107) mas yr$^{-1}$ for HSC 224. The isochrone distances ($d_{\rm iso}$) were estimated as 1885$\pm$44 pc for CWNU 2666 and 1866$\pm$29 pc for HSC 224. The corresponding cluster ages ($t$) were derived as 160$\pm$15 Myr and 140$\pm$15 Myr, respectively. The astrometric and fundamental astrophysical parameters derived in this study demonstrate that the two open clusters are a close pair of open clusters.</description>

      <title>Recovering Ion Distribution Functions: I. Slepian Reconstruction of VDFs from MMS and Solar Orbiter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plasma velocity distribution functions (VDFs) constitute a fundamental observation of numerous operational and future missions. An efficient parameterization of VDFs is crucial for (1) preserving enough information to investigate macroscopic moments along with kinetic effects, (2) producing smooth distributions whereby it is possible to perform derivatives in phase space to support numerical solvers, and (3) economic data management and its storage. Previous studies have used spherical harmonics as an efficient basis for representing electron VDFs. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm targeted towards decomposing ion VDFs measured by electrostatic analyzers onboard Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission (MMS) and Solar Orbiter (SolO) spacecrafts. We use Slepian functions, custom-designed bases providing compact support in phase space, initially developed in information theory and later used for terrestrial and planetary applications. In this paper, we choose well-studied, well-measured, and complex intervals from MMS and SolO containing a range of simpler gyrotropic and agyrotropic distributions to benchmark the robustness of our reconstruction method. We demonstrate the advantages of using Slepian functions over spherical harmonics for solar wind plasma distributions. We also demonstrate that our choice of basis representation efficiently preserves phase space complexities of a 3D agyrotropic distribution function. This algorithm shown in this study will be extended to Parker Solar Probe and future missions such as Helioswarm.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Remote-sensing and In-situ Observations of Fine-scale Structure in a Pseudostreamer Coronal Mass Ejection through the Solar Corona</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coronal pseudostreamer flux systems have a specific magnetic configuration that influences the morphology and evolution of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) from these regions. Here we continue the analysis of the Wyper et al. (2024, ApJ 975, 168) magnetohydrodynamic simulation of a CME eruption from an idealized pseudostreamer configuration through the construction of synthetic remote-sensing and in-situ observational signatures. We examine the pre-eruption and eruption signatures in extreme ultraviolet and white-light from the low corona through the extended solar atmosphere. We calculate synthetic observations corresponding to several Parker Solar Probe-like trajectories at $\sim$10$R_\odot$ to highlight the fine-scale structure of the CME eruption in synthetic WISPR imagery and the differences between the in-situ plasma and field signatures of flank and central CME-encounter trajectories. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of several aspects of our simulation results in the context of interpretation and analysis of current and future Parker Solar Probe data.</description>

      <title>Broadening of the Main Sequence of a Star Cluster by Undetected Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the spread in apparent magnitudes (or absolute magnitudes) of main-sequence stars in a star cluster. I specifically consider the effect of binary stars in broadening the main sequence. I present analytic and semi-analytic expressions for the probability density function (pdf) of the magnitude at a given photometric color, including the effects of binarity. The expressions obtained employ plausible models for the pdfs of the magnitudes of the primary and secondary stars, as well as the distribution of secondary-to-primary mass ratio. A crucial parameter is the fraction of stars in the star cluster that are binaries. The resultant formulas can be used to determine the fraction of binaries in a sample of stars taken from a star cluster, or to limit long term variations in the luminosity of solar type stars.</description>

      <title>Testing Cluster Membership of Planetary Nebulae with High-Precision Proper Motions. II. HST Observations of PHR J1315-6555 in the Open Cluster AL 1 (ESO 96-SC04)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae (PNe) shown to be members of star clusters provide information on their properties and evolutionary histories that cannot be determined for PNe in the field, in particular the initial masses of their progenitor stars. Here we investigate the bipolar PN PHR J1315-6555 (hereafter PHR J1315), which lies near the open cluster AL 1 (ESO 96-SC04) on the sky. Previous work has established that the PN and cluster have similar radial velocities and amounts of interstellar reddening, and similar distances estimated using independent methods. We have obtained new images of the PN and cluster using the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). Combined with archival HST frames taken 12 years earlier, they provide high-precision proper motions (PMs) for two candidate central stars of PHR J1315. We find that the PMs of both candidates are consistent with those of cluster members, strongly confirming the PN's membership in AL 1. The candidate lying closer to the center of PHR J1315 has the color and luminosity of an early F-type dwarf, suggesting that it may be the optical primary in a close post-common-envelope binary. We used the HST data to construct a color-magnitude diagram for AL 1, which we corrected for significant foreground differential reddening. Isochrone fitting reveals that the cluster lies at a remarkably large distance of about 13 kpc, and has an age of about 1.0 Gyr. The initial mass of the progenitor of PHR J1315 was about 2.1 Msun. We suggest followup investigations that would provide tighter constraints on the object's evolution.</description>

      <title>Protostellar Outflows at the EarliesT Stages (POETS) VI. Evidence of disk-wind in G11.92-0.61 MM1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetohydrodynamic disk-winds play a key role in the formation of massive stars by providing the fine-tuning between accretion and ejection, where excess angular momentum is redirected away from the disk, allowing further mass growth. However, only a limited number of disk-wind sources have been detected to date. To better constrain the exact mechanism of this phenomenon, expanding the sample is critical. We performed an analysis of the disk-wind candidate G11.92-0.61 MM1 by estimating the physical parameters of the system and constraining the wind-launching mechanism. Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Band 6 observations were conducted in September 2021 with ALMA's longest baselines, which provided a synthesised beam of $\sim$30 mas. We obtained high-resolution images of the CH$_3$CN ($v_8=1$ and $v=0$), CH$_3$OH, SO$_2$, and SO molecular lines, and the 1.3 mm continuum. Our molecular data allowed us to refine the parameters of the disk-outflow system in MM1. The rotating disk is resolved into two regions with distinct kinematics: the inner region ($&lt;$300 au) is traced by high-velocity emission of high-excitation CH$_3$CN lines and shows a Keplerian rotation; the outer region ($&gt;$300 au), traced by mid-velocity CH$_3$CN emission, rotates in a sub-Keplerian regime. The central source is estimated to be $\sim$20 $M_{\odot}$, which is about half the mass estimated in previous lower-resolution studies. A strong collimated outflow is traced by SO and SO$_2$ emission up to $\sim$3400 au around MM1a. The SO and SO$_2$ emissions show a rotation-dominated velocity pattern, a constant specific angular momentum, and a Keplerian profile that suggests a magneto-centrifugal disk-wind origin with launching radii of $\sim$50-100 au. G11.92-0.61 MM1 appears to be one of the clearest cases of molecular line-traced disk-winds detected around massive protostars.</description>

      <title>Velocity Structure of Circumstellar Environment around Class 0/I Protostars: Uncertainty in the Protostellar Mass Estimation Using Circumstellar Velocities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent high-resolution observations have enabled detailed investigations of the circumstellar environments around Class 0/I protostars. Several studies have reported that the infall velocity of the envelope is a few times smaller than the free-fall velocity inferred from protostellar masses estimated via the observed rotational velocity of their Keplerian disks. To explore the physical origins of the slow infall, we perform a set of three-dimensional non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the star formation process, extending to $10^5$ yr after protostar formation. Our simulations show that the infall velocity decreases markedly at the outer edge of the pseudo-disk (at radii of $\sim \! 100-1000$ au) and is much slower than the expected free-fall velocity. The degree of this reduction depends on (1) the initial magnetic field strength, (2) the alignment between the initial field and the rotation axis, and (3) the evolutionary stage of the system. Across our parameter space, the ratio of the infall velocity to the free-fall velocity is as small as $0.2-0.5$, which is consistent with the observations. We further examine the reliability of protostellar mass estimates derived from infall and rotational velocities. While the mass derived from disk rotation closely matches the true value, deviation by a factor of $0.3-2$ is found for the estimates using the infall velocity; it is underestimated due to slow infall, but could also be overestimated due to the contribution of disk mass. These findings underscore the critical role of magnetic fields in shaping star formation dynamics and highlight the uncertainties associated with protostellar mass estimates.</description>

      <title>Detection of Oscillation-like Patterns in Eclipsing Binary Light Curves using Neural Network-based Object Detection Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The primary aim of this research is to evaluate several convolutional neural network-based object detection algorithms for identifying oscillation-like patterns in light curves of eclipsing binaries. This involves creating a robust detection framework that can effectively process both synthetic light curves and real observational data. The study employs several state-of-the-art object detection algorithms, including Single Shot MultiBox Detector, Faster Region-based Convolutional Neural Network, You Only Look Once, and EfficientDet besides a custom non-pretrained model implemented from scratch. Synthetic light curve images and images derived from observational TESS light curves of known eclipsing binaries with a pulsating component were constructed with corresponding annotation files using custom scripts. The models were trained and validated on established datasets, followed by testing on unseen {\it{Kepler}} data to assess their generalization performance. The statistical metrics are also calculated to review the quality of each model. The results indicate that the pre-trained models exhibit high accuracy and reliability in detecting the targeted patterns. Faster R-CNN and You Only Look Once, in particular, showed superior performance in terms of object detection evaluation metrics on the validation dataset such as mAP value exceeding 99\%. Single Shot MultiBox Detector, on the other hand, is the fastest although it shows slightly lower performance with a mAP of 97\%. These findings highlight the potential of these models to contribute significantly to the automated determination of pulsating components in eclipsing binary systems, facilitating more efficient and comprehensive astrophysical investigations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of magnetic flux sheets in the quiet Sun. I. Statistical properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-scale magnetic flux emergence in the quiet Sun is crucial for maintaining solar magnetic activity. On the smallest scales studied so far, namely within individual granules, two mechanisms have been identified: emergence in tiny magnetic loops and emergence in the form of magnetic flux sheets covering the granule. While there are abundant observations of tiny magnetic loops within granules, the evidence for the emergence of granule-covering magnetic sheets is much more limited. This work aims to statistically analyze magnetic flux sheets, quantify their frequency on the solar surface and their potential contribution to the solar magnetic budget in the photosphere, and investigate the plasma dynamics and granular-scale phenomena associated with their emergence. Using spectro-polarimetric datasets from the solar optical telescope aboard the Hinode satellite and the ground-based Swedish Solar telescope, we developed a two-step method to identify magnetic flux sheet emergence events, detecting magnetic flux patches based on the calculation of the transverse and longitudinal magnetic flux density and associating them with their host granules based on velocity field analysis. We identified 42 events of magnetic flux sheet emergence and characterized their magnetic properties and the associated plasma dynamics of their host granules. Our results align with numerical simulations, indicating a similar occurrence rate. We investigated the relationship between magnetic flux emergence and granular phenomena, finding that flux sheets often emerge in association with standard nascent granules, as well as exploding granules, or granules with granular lanes. In particular, we highlight the potential role of recycled magnetic flux from downflow regions in facilitating flux sheet emergence.</description>

      <title>NutMaat: A Python package for stellar spectral classification on the MK system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar spectral classification according to the Morgan-Keenan (MK) system remains fundamental to astrophysical studies, yet modern surveys require automated, scalable tools. We present NutMaat, a Python-based package inspired by MKCLASS, designed to automate MK classification while addressing scalability and usability limitations. It employs modern computational tools for batch processing and offers a modular architecture that enables efficient, platform-independent analysis of large spectral datasets. Tested on the CFLIB and MILES libraries, NutMaat achieved spectral and luminosity classification accuracies comparable to MKCLASS, with minimal systematic offsets and a robust performance down to S/N $\approx$ 5. NutMaat successfully identified chemically peculiar stars, tested on LAMOST DR7 ACV variables, and processed the SDSS-IV MaStar library to produce a stellar catalog, demonstrating survey readiness. Future development of NutMaat will focus on extending wavelength coverage, computational acceleration via Cython, and refining peculiarity classification. As an open-source tool, NutMaat bridges traditional MK methods with modern data workflows, offering a scalable solution for current and future spectroscopic surveys.</description>

      <title>Can circumstellar interaction explain the strange light curve features of Type Ib/c supernovae?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The evolution and the surrounding of stripped-envelope supernova progenitors are still under debate: some studies suggest single-star, while others prefer massive binary progenitors. Moreover, the basic physical properties of the exploding star and its interaction with circumstellar matter could significantly modify the overall light curve features of these objects. To better understand the effect of stellar evolution and circumstellar interaction, systematic hydrodynamic calculations are needed.
  Aims. Here, we test the hypothesis that circumstellar matter generated by an extreme episodic $\eta$ Carinae-like eruption that occurs days or weeks before the supernova explosion may explain the controversies related to the general light curve features of stripped-envelope supernovae.
  Methods. In this work, we present our bolometric light curve calculations of both single- and binary progenitors generated by hydrodynamic simulations via MESA and SNEC. We also studied the effect of an interaction with a close, low-mass circumstellar matter assumed to be created just a few days or weeks before the explosion. Beyond generating a model light curve grid, we compared our results with some observational data.
  Results. We found that merely the shape of the supernova light curve could indicate that the cataclysmic death of the massive star happened in a binary system or was related to the explosion of a single star. Moreover, our study also shows that a confined dense circumstellar matter may be responsible for the strange light curve features (bumps, re-brightening, or steeper tail) of some Type Ib/c supernovae.</description>

Abstract: We model the transport of solar energetic particles (SEPs) in the solar wind. We propagated relativistic test particles in the field of a steady three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulation of the solar wind. We used the code MPI-AMRVAC for the wind simulations and integrated the relativistic guiding center equations using a new third-order-accurate predictor-corrector time-integration scheme. Turbulence-induced scattering of the particle trajectories in velocity space was taken into account through the inclusion of a constant field-aligned scattering mean free path $\lambda_\parallel$. We considered mid-range SEP electrons of $81\:{\rm keV}$ injected into the solar wind at a heliocentric distance of 0.28 AU and a magnetic latitude of $24^{\circ}$. For $\lambda_\parallel =0.5\:{\rm AU}$, the simulated velocity pitch angle distributions agree qualitatively well with in situ measurements at 1 AU. More generally, for $\lambda_\parallel$ in the range 0.1 to 1\:AU, an energy-loss rate associated with the velocity drift of about $10\%$ per day is observed. The energy loss is attributable to the magnetic curvature and gradient-induced poleward drifts of the electrons against the dominant component of the electric field. In our case study, which is representative of the average solar wind conditions, the observed drift-induced energy-loss rate is fastest near a heliocentric distance of 1.2 AU. We emphasize that adiabatic cooling is the dominant mechanism during the first 1.5 hours of propagation. Only at later times does the drift-associated loss rate become dominant.</description>

      <title>Optimized sampling of SDSS-IV MaStar spectra for stellar classification using supervised models</title>

Abstract: Supervised machine learning models are increasingly being used for solving the problem of stellar classification of spectroscopic data. However, training such models requires a large number of labelled instances, the collection of which is usually costly in both time and expertise. Active learning algorithms minimize training dataset sizes by keeping only the most informative instances. This paper explores the application of active learning to sampling stellar spectra using data from a highly class-imbalanced dataset. We utilize the MaStar library from the SDSS DR17 along with its associated stellar parameter catalogue. A preprocessing pipeline that includes feature selection, scaling, and dimensionality reduction is applied to the data. Using different active learning algorithms, we iteratively query instances, where the model or committee of models exhibits the highest uncertainty or disagreement, respectively. We assess the effectiveness of the sampling techniques by comparing several performance metrics of supervised-learning models trained on the queried samples with randomly-sampled counterparts. Evaluation metrics include specificity, sensitivity, and the area under the curve; in addition to the Matthew's correlation coefficient, which accounts for class imbalance. We apply this procedure to effective temperature, surface gravity, and iron metallicity, separately. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of active learning algorithms in selecting samples that produce performance metrics superior to random sampling and even stratified samples, with fewer training instances. Active learning is recommended for prioritizing instance labelling of astronomical-survey data by experts or crowdsourcing to mitigate the high time cost. Its effectiveness can be further exploited in selection of targets for follow-up observations in automated astronomical surveys.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Amplification during Stellar Collisions between Low-Mass Stars</title>

Abstract: Blue straggler stars in stellar clusters are a subset of stars that are bluer and appear younger than other cluster members, seemingly straggling behind in their evolution. They offer a unique opportunity to understand the stellar dynamics and populations within their hosts. In the collisional formation scenario, a persistent challenge is the excessive angular momentum in the collision product. The consequent significant mass loss during transition to a stable state leads to a star with too low a mass to be a blue straggler, unless it spins down efficiently. While many proposed spin-down mechanisms involve boosted angular momentum loss via magnetic braking within the collision product, the existence or strength of these magnetic fields has not been confirmed. Here, we report three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical simulations of collisions between two low-mass main-sequence stars and investigate magnetic field amplification. Magnetic field energy is amplified by a factor of $10^{8}-10^{10}$, resulting in the magnetic field strength of $10^{7}-10^{8}$G at the core of the collision product, independent of collision parameters. The surface magnetic field strengths have increased up to $10-10^{4}$ G. In addition, a distinctly flattened, rotating gas structure appears around the collision products in off-axis collisions, which may be a hint of possible disk formation. Such significant magnetic amplification and potential disk formation suggest the possibility of efficient spin-down of collision products via magnetic braking and magnetic disk locking, which can result in their appearance as blue stragglers.</description>

      <title>Supersensitive seismic magnetometry of white dwarfs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.20557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of magnetic fields in white dwarfs (WDs) remains mysterious. Magnetic WDs are traditionally associated with field strengths $\gtrsim1\,\mathrm{MG}$, set by the sensitivity of typical spectroscopic magnetic field measurements. Informed by recent developments in red giant magnetoasteroseismology, we revisit the use of WD pulsations as a seismic magnetometer. WD pulsations primarily probe near-surface magnetic fields, whose effect on oscillation mode frequencies is to asymmetrize rotational multiplets and, if strong enough, suppress gravity-mode propagation altogether. The sensitivity of seismology to magnetic fields increases strongly with mode period and decreases quickly with the depth of the partial ionization-driven surface convective zone. We place upper limits for magnetic fields in $24$ pulsating WDs: $20$ hydrogen-atmosphere (DAV) and three helium-atmosphere (DBV) carbon-oxygen WDs, and one extremely low-mass (helium-core) pulsator. These bounds are typically $\sim1$-$10\,\mathrm{kG}$, although they can reach down to $\sim10$-$100\,\mathrm{G}$ for DAVs and helium-core WDs in which lower-frequency modes are excited. Seismic magnetometry may enable new insights into the formation and evolution of WD magnetism.</description>

      <title>Jets are the most robust observable ingredient of common envelope evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04017v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I examine images of 50 planetary nebulae (PNe) with observable post-common envelope evolution (CEE) binary central stars and find that jets are about 40 percent more common than dense equatorial outflows. Because, in some cases, energetic jets can compress an equatorial outflow and because fast jets might disperse early in the PN evolution and avoid detection, the CEE process is likelier to launch jets than to eject a dense equatorial outflow by a larger factor than 1.4. In most cases, the companion, mainly a main sequence star, launches the jets as it accretes mass from the envelope of the giant star. By CEE jets, I also refer to jets launched shortly before the onset of the CEE, likely a grazing envelope evolution phase, and shortly after the CEE. The jets and the accretion of mass by the companion before, during, and after the CEE affect envelope mass removal and the final orbital separation. Most numerical simulations of the CEE ignore jets, and those that include jets omit other processes. Despite the considerable progress in the last decade with tens of hydrodynamical simulations of the CEE, we are still far from correctly simulating the CEE. Including jets in simulations of the CEE requires heavy computer resources, but it must be the next step.</description>

      <title>Physics-Based Simulation of the 2013 April 11 Solar Energetic Particle Event</title>

Abstract: Solar energetic particles (SEPs) can pose hazardous radiation risks to both humans and spacecraft electronics in space. Numerical modeling based on first principles offers valuable insights into the underlying physics of SEPs and provides synthetic observables for SEPs at any time and location in the inner heliosphere. In this work, we present a numerical scheme, which conserves the number of particles based on integral relations for Poisson brackets \citep{sokolov2023high}, to solve the kinetic equation for particle acceleration and transport processes. We implement this scheme within the Space Weather Modeling Framework, developed at the University of Michigan. In addition, we develop a new shock-capturing tool to study the coronal mass ejection-driven shock originating from the low solar corona. These methodological advancements are applied to conduct a comprehensive study of a historical SEP event on April 11, 2013. Multi-spacecraft observations, including SOHO, SDO, GOES and ACE near Earth, and STEREO-A/B, are used for model--data comparison and validation. We show synthetic observables, including extreme ultraviolet and white-light images, proton time--intensity profiles, and energy spectra, and discuss their differences and probable explanations compared to observations. Our simulation results demonstrate the application of the Poisson bracket scheme with a particle solver to simulating a historical SEP event. We also show the capability of extracting the complex shock surface using our shock-capturing tool and understand how the complex shock surface affects the particle acceleration process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery of twelve metal-poor and distant pre-main sequence (PMS) candidates in the dwarf irregular galaxy Wolf-Lundmark-Melotte (WLM)~968 kpc away, at a present-day metallicity of [Fe/H] around $-$0.9. These candidates have masses between 1.25-5 M$_{\odot}$, with ages &lt;10 Myr, and exhibit significant near-infrared excesses at 2.5 and 4.3 $\mu$m. They are concentrated within a cluster roughly 10 pc (2'') across situated in the HII region [HM95]-9. These are the most distant and metal-poor PMS stars known, and can offer new quantitative insights into star formation at low-metallicities.</description>

      <title>The PLATO field selection process. II. Characterization of LOPS2, the first long-pointing field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07687v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) is an ESA M-class mission to be launched by the end of 2026 to discover and characterize transiting planets around bright and nearby stars, and in particular habitable rocky planets hosted by solar-like stars. Over the mission lifetime, an average of 8% of the science data rate will be allocated to Guest Observer programs (GOs) selected by ESA through public calls, hence it is essential for the community to know in advance where the observing fields will be located. In a previous paper, we identified two preliminary long-pointing fields (LOPN1 and LOPS1) for PLATO, respectively in the northern and southern hemisphere. Here we present LOPS2, a slightly adjusted version of the southern field that has recently been selected by the PLATO Science Working Team as the first field to be observed by PLATO for at least two continuous years, following the scientific requirements. In this paper, we describe the astrophysical content of LOPS2 in detail, including known planetary systems, bright/variable/binary stars, clusters and synergies with other current and future facilities.</description>
