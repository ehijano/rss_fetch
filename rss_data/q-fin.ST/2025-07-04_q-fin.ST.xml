      <title>Forecasting Nigerian Equity Stock Returns Using Long Short-Term Memory Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Investors and stock market analysts face major challenges in predicting stock returns and making wise investment decisions. The predictability of equity stock returns can boost investor confidence, but it remains a difficult task. To address this issue, a study was conducted using a Long Short-term Memory (LSTM) model to predict future stock market movements. The study used a historical dataset from the Nigerian Stock Exchange (NSE), which was cleaned and normalized to design the LSTM model. The model was evaluated using performance metrics and compared with other deep learning models like Artificial and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The experimental results showed that the LSTM model can predict future stock market prices and returns with over 90% accuracy when trained with a reliable dataset. The study concludes that LSTM models can be useful in predicting financial time-series-related problems if well-trained. Future studies should explore combining LSTM models with other deep learning techniques like CNN to create hybrid models that mitigate the risks associated with relying on a single model for future equity stock predictions.</description>

      <title>News Sentiment Embeddings for Stock Price Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper will discuss how headline data can be used to predict stock prices. The stock price in question is the SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF Trust, also known as SPY that tracks the performance of the largest 500 publicly traded corporations in the United States. A key focus is to use news headlines from the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) to predict the movement of stock prices on a daily timescale with OpenAI-based text embedding models used to create vector encodings of each headline with principal component analysis (PCA) to exact the key features. The challenge of this work is to capture the time-dependent and time-independent, nuanced impacts of news on stock prices while handling potential lag effects and market noise. Financial and economic data were collected to improve model performance; such sources include the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) and Treasury Interest Yields. Over 390 machine-learning inference models were trained. The preliminary results show that headline data embeddings greatly benefit stock price prediction by at least 40% compared to training and optimizing a machine learning system without headline data embeddings.</description>

      <title>DeepSupp: Attention-Driven Correlation Pattern Analysis for Dynamic Time Series Support and Resistance Levels Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01971v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Support and resistance (SR) levels are central to technical analysis, guiding traders in entry, exit, and risk management. Despite widespread use, traditional SR identification methods often fail to adapt to the complexities of modern, volatile markets. Recent research has introduced machine learning techniques to address the following challenges, yet most focus on price prediction rather than structural level identification. This paper presents DeepSupp, a new deep learning approach for detecting financial support levels using multi-head attention mechanisms to analyze spatial correlations and market microstructure relationships. DeepSupp integrates advanced feature engineering, constructing dynamic correlation matrices that capture evolving market relationships, and employs an attention-based autoencoder for robust representation learning. The final support levels are extracted through unsupervised clustering, leveraging DBSCAN to identify significant price thresholds. Comprehensive evaluations on S&amp;P 500 tickers demonstrate that DeepSupp outperforms six baseline methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance across six financial metrics, including essential support accuracy and market regime sensitivity. With consistent results across diverse market conditions, DeepSupp addresses critical gaps in SR level detection, offering a scalable and reliable solution for modern financial analysis. Our approach highlights the potential of attention-based architectures to uncover nuanced market patterns and improve technical trading strategies.</description>

      <title>Integration of Wavelet Transform Convolution and Channel Attention with LSTM for Stock Price Prediction based Portfolio Allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portfolio allocation via stock price prediction is inherently difficult due to the notoriously low signal-to-noise ratio of stock time series. This paper proposes a method by integrating wavelet transform convolution and channel attention with LSTM to implement stock price prediction based portfolio allocation. Stock time series data first are processed by wavelet transform convolution to reduce the noise. Processed features are then reconstructed by channel attention. LSTM is utilized to predict the stock price using the final processed features. We construct a portfolio consists of four stocks with trading signals predicted by model. Experiments are conducted by evaluating the return, Sharpe ratio and max drawdown performance. The results indicate that our method achieves robust performance even during period of post-pandemic downward market.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Labor Markets with LSTNet: A Multi-Scale Deep Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a deep learning approach for forecasting short-term employment changes and assessing long-term industry health using labor market data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Our system leverages a Long- and Short-Term Time-series Network (LSTNet) to process multivariate time series data, including employment levels, wages, turnover rates, and job openings. The model outputs both 7-day employment forecasts and an interpretable Industry Employment Health Index (IEHI). Our approach outperforms baseline models across most sectors, particularly in stable industries, and demonstrates strong alignment between IEHI rankings and actual employment volatility. We discuss error patterns, sector-specific performance, and future directions for improving interpretability and generalization.</description>

      <title>Detecting Fraud in Financial Networks: A Semi-Supervised GNN Approach with Granger-Causal Explanations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fraudulent activity in the financial industry costs billions annually. Detecting fraud, therefore, is an essential yet technically challenging task that requires carefully analyzing large volumes of data. While machine learning (ML) approaches seem like a viable solution, applying them successfully is not so easy due to two main challenges: (1) the sparsely labeled data, which makes the training of such approaches challenging (with inherent labeling costs), and (2) lack of explainability for the flagged items posed by the opacity of ML models, that is often required by business regulations. This article proposes SAGE-FIN, a semi-supervised graph neural network (GNN) based approach with Granger causal explanations for Financial Interaction Networks. SAGE-FIN learns to flag fraudulent items based on weakly labeled (or unlabelled) data points. To adhere to regulatory requirements, the flagged items are explained by highlighting related items in the network using Granger causality. We empirically validate the favorable performance of SAGE-FIN on a real-world dataset, Bipartite Edge-And-Node Attributed financial network (Elliptic++), with Granger-causal explanations for the identified fraudulent items without any prior assumption on the network structure.</description>

      <title>Comparing Bitcoin and Ethereum tail behavior via Q-Q analysis of cryptocurrency returns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The cryptocurrency market presents both significant investment opportunities and higher risks relative to traditional financial assets. This study examines the tail behavior of daily returns for two leading cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin and Ethereum, using seven-parameter estimates from prior research, which applied the Generalized Tempered Stable (GTS) distribution. Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots against the Normal distribution reveal that both assets exhibit heavy-tailed return distributions. However, Ethereum consistently shows a greater frequency of extreme values than would be expected under its Bitcoin-modeled counterpart, indicating more pronounced tail risk.</description>

      <title>Currents Beneath Stability: A Stochastic Framework for Exchange Rate Instability Using Kramers Moyal Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the stochastic behavior of currency exchange rates is critical for assessing financial stability and anticipating market transitions. In this study, we investigate the empirical dynamics of the USD exchange rate in three economies, including Iran, Turkey, and Sri Lanka, through the lens of the Kramers-Moyal expansion and Fokker-Planck formalism. Using log-return data, we confirm the Markovian nature of the exchange rate fluctuations, enabling us to model the system with a second-order Fokker-Planck equation. The inferred Langevin coefficients reveal a stabilizing linear drift and a nonlinear, return-dependent diffusion term, reflecting both regulatory effects and underlying volatility. A rolling-window estimation of these coefficients, paired with structural breakpoint detection, uncovers regime shifts that align with major political and economic events, offering insight into the hidden dynamics of currency instability. This framework provides a robust foundation for detecting latent transitions and modeling risk in complex financial systems.</description>

      <title>NGAT: A Node-level Graph Attention Network for Long-term Stock Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph representation learning methods have been widely adopted in financial applications to enhance company representations by leveraging inter-firm relationships. However, current approaches face three key challenges: (1) The advantages of relational information are obscured by limitations in downstream task designs; (2) Existing graph models specifically designed for stock prediction often suffer from excessive complexity and poor generalization; (3) Experience-based construction of corporate relationship graphs lacks effective comparison of different graph structures. To address these limitations, we propose a long-term stock prediction task and develop a Node-level Graph Attention Network (NGAT) specifically tailored for corporate relationship graphs. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrate the limitations of existing graph comparison methods based on model downstream task performance. Experimental results across two datasets consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed task and model. The project is publicly available on GitHub to encourage reproducibility and future research.</description>

      <title>A Midsummer Meme's Dream: Investigating Market Manipulations in the Meme Coin Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.01963v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From viral jokes to a billion-dollar phenomenon, meme coins have become one of the most popular segments in cryptocurrency markets. Unlike utility-focused crypto assets like Bitcoin or Ethereum, meme coins derive value primarily from community sentiment, making them vulnerable to manipulation. This study presents a cross-chain analysis of the meme coin ecosystem, examining 34,988 tokens across Ethereum, BNB Smart Chain, Solana, and Base. We characterize the tokenomics of meme coins and track their growth in a three-month longitudinal analysis. We discover that among high-return tokens (&gt;100%), an alarming 82.6% show evidence of extensive use of artificial growth strategies designed to create a misleading appearance of market interest. These include wash trading and a form of manipulation we define as Liquidity Pool-Based Price Inflation (LPI), where small strategic purchases trigger dramatic price increases. We also find evidence of schemes designed to profit at the expense of investors, such as pump and dumps and rug pulls. In particular, most of the tokens involved had previously experienced wash trading or LPI, indicating how initial manipulations often set the stage for later exploitation. These findings reveal that manipulations are widespread among high-performing meme coins and suggest that their dramatic gains are often likely driven by coordinated efforts rather than natural market dynamics.</description>
