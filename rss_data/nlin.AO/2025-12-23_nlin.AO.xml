      <title>Topological Flux on a Context Manifold Generates Nonreciprocal Collective Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions, where the influence of agent $i$ on $j$ differs from that of $j$ on $i$, are fundamental in active and living matter. Yet, most models implement such asymmetry phenomenologically. Here we show that non-reciprocity can emerge from internal topology alone. Agents evolve on an internal ``context manifold'' coupled to a Chern-Simons gauge field. Because the gauge field is first order in time, it relaxes rapidly; eliminating it yields an effective transverse, antisymmetric interaction kernel that generically produces chiral waves, persistent vorticity, and irreversible state transitions. Numerical simulations reveal clear signatures of broken reciprocity: long-lived vortex cores, finite circulation, asymmetric information flow, and a nonzero reciprocity residual. The dynamics further exhibit pronounced hysteresis under parameter sweeps, demonstrating memory effects that cannot occur in reciprocal or potential-driven systems. These results identify Chern-Simons gauge fields as a minimal and universal source of directional influence and robust non-reciprocal collective behavior.</description>

      <title>Topological cluster synchronization via Dirac spectral programming on directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective synchronization in complex systems arises from the interplay between topology and dynamics, yet how to design and control such patterns in higher-order networks remains unclear. Here we show that a Dirac spectral programming framework enables programmable topological cluster synchronization on directed hypergraphs. By encoding tail-head hyperedges into a topological Dirac operator and introducing a tunable mass term, we obtain a spectrum whose isolated eigenvalues correspond to distinct synchronization clusters defined jointly on nodes and hyperedges. Selecting a target eigenvalue allows the system to self-organize toward the associated cluster state without modifying the underlying hypergraph structure. Simulations on directed-hypergraph block models and empirical systems--including higher-order contact networks and the ABIDE functional brain network--confirm that spectral selection alone determines the accessible synchronization patterns. Our results establish a general and interpretable route for controlling collective dynamics in directed higher-order systems.</description>

      <title>A proof-of-principle experiment on the spontaneous symmetry breaking machine and numerical estimation of its performance on the $K_{2000}$ benchmark problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we proposed a unique physically implemented type simulator for combinatorial optimization problems, called the spontaneous symmetry breaking machine (SSBM). In this paper, we first report the results of experimental verification of SSBM using a small-scale benchmark system, and then describe numerical simulations using the benchmark problems (K2000) conducted to confirm its usefulness for large-scale problems. From 1000 samples with different initial fluctuations, it became clear that SSBM can explore a single extremely stable state. This is based on the principle of a phenomenon used in SSBM, and could be a notable advantage over other simulators.</description>

      <title>Stylized Facts and Their Microscopic Origins: Clustering, Persistence, and Stability in a 2D Ising Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of financial markets using models inspired by statistical physics offers a fruitful approach to understand collective and extreme phenomena [3, 14, 15] In this paper, we present a study based on a 2D Ising network model where each spin represents an agent that interacts only with its immediate neighbors plus a term reated to the mean field [1, 2]. From this simple formulation, we analyze the formation of spin clusters, their temporal persistence, and the morphological evolution of the system as a function of temperature [5, 19]. Furthermore, we introduce the study of the quantity $1/2P\sum_{i}|S_{i}(t)+S_{i}(t+\Delta t)|$, which measures the absolute overlap between consecutive configurations and quantifies the degree of instantaneous correlation between system states. The results show that both the morphology and persistence of the clusters and the dynamics of the absolute sum can explain universal statistical properties observed in financial markets, known as stylized facts [2, 12, 18]: sharp peaks in returns, distributions with heavy tails, and zero autocorrelation. The critical structure of clusters and their reorganization over time thus provide a microscopic mechanism that gives rise to the intermittency and clustered volatility observed in prices [2, 15].</description>

      <title>Various Vicsek Models with Underlying Network Characteristics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collective motion is a fundamental phenomenon in biological swarms. As a framework for studying synchronization in motions, the Vicsek model is simple and efficient, assuming isotropic interactions with a complete field of view. Drawing inspiration from natural swarms, we incorporate realistic constraints into the model. By analysing the interaction structures from the complex network perspective, we demonstrate that models with the homogeneous interaction rules naturally form Erdos-Renyi networks, whereas the introduction of heterogeneity leads to Barabasi-Albert networks. Furthermore, we discover that the model's synchronization is fundamentally governed by the average degree of the interaction network. Through a comparative analysis across these topologies, we identify a stretched-exponential relationship between the average degree and the synchronization metrics.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamics of higher-order Vicsek model emerging from local conformity interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a system of self-propelled particles whose alignment with neighbors depends on the degree of local alignment. We show that such a local conformity interaction naturally yields a Vicsek-type model with pairwise and three-body interactions. Through numerical and approximate theoretical investigation of its deterministic and stochastic collective dynamics, we identify a novel bidirectionally ordered phase in which the particles move in opposite directions. Moreover, both continuous and discontinuous order-disorder transitions are observed, suggesting that the system belongs to a different universality class from previous models.</description>

      <title>Swarming Lattice in Frustrated Vicsek-Kuramoto Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.08913v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a frustration parameter $\alpha$ into the Vicsek-Kuramoto systems of self-propelled particles. While the system exhibits conventional synchronized states, such as global phase synchronization and swarming, for low frustration ($\alpha &lt; \pi/2$), beyond the critical point $\alpha = \pi/2$, a Hopf-Turing bifurcation drives a transition to a resting hexagonal lattice, accompanied by spatiotemporal patterns such as vortex lattices and dual-cluster lattices with oscillatory unit-cell motions. Lattice dominance is governed by coupling strength and interaction radius, with a clear parametric boundary balancing pattern periodicity and particle dynamics. Our results demonstrate that purely orientational interactions are sufficient to form symmetric lattices, challenging the necessity of spatial forces and illuminating the mechanisms driving lattice formation in active matter systems.</description>

      <title>The Universe Learning Itself: On the Evolution of Dynamics from the Big Bang to Machine Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a unified, dynamical-systems narrative of the universe that traces a continuous chain of structure formation from the Big Bang to contemporary human societies and their artificial learning systems. Rather than treating cosmology, astrophysics, geophysics, biology, cognition, and machine intelligence as disjoint domains, we view each as successive regimes of dynamics on ever-richer state spaces, stitched together by phase transitions, symmetry-breaking events, and emergent attractors. Starting from inflationary field dynamics and the growth of primordial perturbations, we describe how gravitational instability sculpts the cosmic web, how dissipative collapse in baryonic matter yields stars and planets, and how planetary-scale geochemical cycles define long-lived nonequilibrium attractors. Within these attractors, we frame the origin of life as the emergence of self-maintaining reaction networks, evolutionary biology as flow on high-dimensional genotype-phenotype-environment manifolds, and brains as adaptive dynamical systems operating near critical surfaces. Human culture and technology-including modern machine learning and artificial intelligence-are then interpreted as symbolic and institutional dynamics that implement and refine engineered learning flows which recursively reshape their own phase space. Throughout, we emphasize recurring mathematical motifs-instability, bifurcation, multiscale coupling, and constrained flows on measure-zero subsets of the accessible state space. Our aim is not to present any new cosmological or biological model, but a cross-scale, theoretical perspective: a way of reading the universe's history as the evolution of dynamics itself, culminating (so far) in biological and artificial systems capable of modeling, predicting, and deliberately perturbing their own future trajectories.</description>

      <title>A framework for the use of generative modelling in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11630v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss an approach to mathematically modelling systems made of objects that are coupled together, using generative models of the dependence relationships between states (or trajectories) of the things comprising such systems. This broad class includes open or non-equilibrium systems and is especially relevant to self-organising systems. The ensuing variational free energy principle (FEP) has certain advantages over using random dynamical systems explicitly, notably, by being more tractable and offering a parsimonious explanation of why the joint system evolves in the way that it does, based on the properties of the coupling between system components. The FEP is a method whose use allows us to build a model of the dynamics of an object as if it were a process of variational inference, because variational free energy (or surprisal) is a Lyapunov function for its dynamics. In short, we argue that using generative models to represent and track relations amongst subsystems leads us to a particular statistical theory of interacting systems. Conversely, this theory enables us to construct nested models that respect the known relations amongst subsystems. We point out that the fact that a physical object conforms to the FEP does not necessarily imply that this object performs inference in the literal sense; rather, it is a useful explanatory fiction which replaces the `explicit' dynamics of the object with an `implicit' flow on free energy gradients -- a fiction that may or may not be entertained by the object itself.</description>

      <title>Slow spatial migration can help eradicate cooperative antimicrobial resistance in time-varying environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01939v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat and combating its spread is of paramount importance. AMR often results from a cooperative behaviour with shared drug protection. Microbial communities generally evolve in volatile, spatially structured settings. Migration, space, fluctuations, and environmental variability all have a significant impact on the development and proliferation of AMR. While drug resistance is enhanced by migration in static conditions, this changes in time-fluctuating spatially structured environments. Here, we consider a two-dimensional metapopulation consisting of demes in which drug-resistant and sensitive cells evolve in a time-changing environment. This contains a toxin against which protection can be shared (cooperative AMR). Cells migrate between demes and connect them. When the environment and the deme composition vary on the same timescale, strong population bottlenecks cause fluctuation-driven extinction events, countered by migration. We investigate the influence of migration and environmental variability on the AMR eco-evolutionary dynamics by asking at what migration rate fluctuations can help clear resistance and what are the near-optimal environmental conditions ensuring the quasi-certain eradication of resistance in the shortest possible time. By combining analytical and computational tools, we answer these questions by determining when the resistant strain goes extinct across the entire metapopulation. While dispersal generally promotes strain coexistence, here we show that slow-but-nonzero migration can speed up and enhance resistance clearance, and determine the near-optimal conditions for this phenomenon. We discuss the impact of our findings on laboratory-controlled experiments and outline their generalisation to lattices of any spatial dimension.</description>

      <title>Chimera states on m-directed hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12511v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chimera states are synchronization patterns in which coherent and incoherent regions coexist in systems of identical oscillators. This elusive phenomenon has attracted significant interest and has been widely analyzed, revealing several types of dynamical states. Most studies involve reciprocal pairwise couplings, where each oscillator exerts and receives the same interaction from neighboring ones, thus being modeled via symmetric networks. However, real-world systems often exhibit non-reciprocal, non-pairwise (many-body) interactions. Previous studies have shown that chimera states are more elusive in the presence of non-reciprocal pairwise interactions, while they are easier to observe when the interactions are reciprocal and higher-order (many-body). In this work, we investigate the emergence of chimera states on non-reciprocal higher-order structures, called mdirected hypergraphs, which we compare with their corresponding networks, and we observe that chimera state and specifically amplitude-mediated chimeras can emerge due to directionality, which had not been previously observed in the absence of directionality. We also compare the effect of non-reciprocal interactions between higher-order and pairwise couplings, and we find numerically that chimera states appear over a broader parameter range when considering higher-order interactions than in the corresponding network case, demonstrating the impact of directionality and the effect of higher-order interactions. Finally, the nature of phase chimeras has been further validated through phase reduction theory.</description>

      <title>Information Supercurrents in Chiral Active Matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.16884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent minimalist modeling has demonstrated that overdamped polar chiral active matter can support emergent, inviscid Euler turbulence, despite the system's strictly dissipative microscopic nature. In this letter, we establish the statistical mechanical foundation for this emergent inertial regime by deriving a formal isomorphism between the model's agent dynamics and the overdamped Langevin equation for disordered Josephson junctions. We identify the trapped agent state as carrying non-dissipative (phase rigidity) information supercurrents, analogous to a macroscopic superconducting phase governed by the Adler equation. The validity of this mapping is confirmed analytically and empirically by demonstrating a disorder-broadened Adler-Ohmic crossover in the system's slip velocity, corresponding to the saddle-node bifurcation of phase-locking systems. These results define the new minimal chiral flocking model as a motile, disordered Josephson array, bridging active turbulence and superconductivity.</description>
