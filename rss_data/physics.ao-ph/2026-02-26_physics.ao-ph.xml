      <title>A Generalized Richardson Number Diagnostic for Turbulence in the Free Atmosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new Richardson number formulation, Ri_new, is introduced to improve the diagnosis of turbulence in the stratified free atmosphere, particularly near jet stream regions. The formulation is derived from the turbulent kinetic energy budget and accounts for both vertical wind shear and horizontal shear (deformation and divergence), weighted by the ratio of horizontal to vertical eddy viscosities (Kmh/Kmv). This extends the classical Richardson number Ri_old, which includes only vertical shear, and provides a physically based measure of the balance between stratification and three-dimensional shear production. The diagnostics Ri_new, Ri_old, and the widely used Turbulence Index 1 (TI1), computed from ERA5 reanalysis, are evaluated using more than 247 million automated turbulence reports from commercial aircraft (2017-2024). Across various turbulence intensity thresholds, Ri_new consistently outperforms the other diagnostics, resulting in higher AUC values and improved probability of detection at operationally relevant false-alarm rates. Sensitivity analyses show that the predictive skill of Ri_new is maximized for Kmh/Kmv values in the range 10^3-10^4, with peak performance near 5000 and weak dependence on horizontal resolution. Seasonal and regional evaluations indicate that the added value of Ri_new is largest where turbulence generation involves both vertical and horizontal shear, such as over the contiguous United States and during summer. Over oceans, performance remains high and Ri_new still provides the best overall discrimination skill. These results demonstrate that incorporating horizontal wind shear into the Richardson number yields a physically consistent and statistically robust improvement in turbulence diagnostics, with relevance for research and operational applications.</description>

      <title>A consistent phase-averaged model of the interactions between surface gravity waves and currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate a model of the two-way interactions between surface gravity waves and ocean currents. The model couples the transport of wave action in the four-dimensional (horizontal) position--wavevector phase space with the Craik--Leibovich system for the currents. Coupling is via the Doppler shift in the dispersion relation governing action transport, and wave pseudomomentum in the Craik--Leibovich system. The velocity in the Doppler shift is a vertical integral of the Lagrangian mean velocity of the currents, with a weight that is consistent with the vertical structure of the pseudomomentum. This consistency ensures conservation of momentum and energy in the coupled wave--current system.
  The conservation properties of the wave--current model stem from an underlying variational structure. We derive this structure from that of the rotating Euler equations for an incompressible fluid with free surface by introducing a Lagrangian wave--mean decomposition, making simplifying approximations, and Whitham averaging.
  We apply the wave--current model to the problem of generation of inertial oscillations by surface waves originally considered by Hasselmann.</description>

      <title>Particle, kinetic and hydrodynamic models for sea ice floes. Part II: Rotating floes with nonlinear contact forces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21972v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the multiscale modeling framework introduced in Part I (Deng and Ha, Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena 483 (2025) 134951) for sea-ice floe dynamics with non-rotating floes to the case with rotational floes and nonlinear contact interactions. Building on the particle-kinetic-hydrodynamic hierarchy developed for non-rotating floes, we generalize the particle model to describe ice floes as rigid bodies characterized by position, linear velocity, angular velocity, size, and moment of inertia. The interaction rules now include nonlinear contact forces and torques arising from short-range compression, restitution, and tangential friction laws, together with hydrodynamic drag that couples translational and rotational motions. These particle descriptions lead to an enriched Vlasov-type kinetic equation posed on an extended phase space, whose moments yield a hydrodynamic system for mass, momentum, and angular-momentum balances. Compared with Part I, the resulting macroscopic equations feature additional stress contributions, rotational transport, and dissipative mechanisms stemming from nonlinear collisions. The proposed framework provides a more realistic description of sea-ice floe dynamics and offers a systematic pathway toward multiscale modeling of sea-ice rheology under complex environmental forcing.</description>

      <title>Experimental study of turbulent thermal diffusion of inertial particles in a convective turbulence forced by oscillating grids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of turbulent thermal diffusion of inertial solid particles in laboratory experiments with convective turbulence forced by one or two oscillating grids in the air flow. Turbulent thermal diffusion causes a non-diffusive contribution to turbulent flux of particles described in terms of an effective pumping velocity directed opposite to the gradient of the mean fluid temperature. For inertial particles, this effective pumping velocity depends on the Stokes and Reynolds numbers. In the experiments, fluid velocity and spatial distribution of inertial particles are measured using Particle Image Velocimetry system, and the temperature field is measured in many locations by a temperature probe equipped with 12 thermocouples. Measurements of temperature and particle number density spatial distributions have demonstrated formation of large-scale clusters of inertial particles in the vicinity of the mean temperature minimum due to turbulent thermal diffusion. In the experiments, the effective pumping velocity resulting in formation of large-scale clusters of inertial particles (having the diameter $10 \mu m$) is in 2.5 times larger than that for non-inertial particles (having the diameter $0.7 \mu m$). This is in an agreement with the theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>Chlorophyll-a Mapping and Prediction in the Mar Menor Lagoon Using C2RCC-Processed Sentinel 2 Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09736v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Mar Menor, Europe's largest hypersaline coastal lagoon, located in southeastern Spain, has undergone severe eutrophication crises, with devastating impacts on biodiversity and water quality. Monitoring chlorophyll-a, a proxy for phytoplankton biomass, is essential to anticipate harmful algal blooms and guide mitigation strategies. Traditional in situ measurements, while precise, are spatially and temporally limited. Satellite-based approaches provide a more comprehensive view, enabling scalable and long-term monitoring. This study aims to overcome limitations of chlorophyll monitoring, often restricted to surface estimates or limited temporal coverage, by developing a reliable methodology to predict and map chlorophyll-a concentrations across the water column of the Mar Menor. This work integrates Sentinel 2 imagery with buoy-based ground truth to create models capable of high-resolution, depth-specific monitoring, enhancing early-warning capabilities for eutrophication. Sentinel 2 images were atmospherically corrected using C2RCC processors. Buoy data were aggregated by depth. Multiple ML algorithms, including CatBoost, XGBoost, SVMs, and MLPs, were trained and validated using a cross-validation scheme with multi-objective optimization functions. Band-combination experiments and spatial aggregation strategies were tested to optimize prediction. The results show depth-dependent performance. The Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE) obtained ranges from 0.34 at the surface to 0.39 at 3-4 m, while the R2 value was 0.76 at the surface, 0.76 at 1-2 m, 0.70 at 2-3 m, and 0.60 at 3-4 m. Generated maps successfully reproduced known eutrophication events. The study delivers an end-to-end, validated methodology chlorophyll mapping. Its integration of multispectral band combinations, buoy calibration, and modeling offers a transferable framework for other turbid coastal systems.</description>
