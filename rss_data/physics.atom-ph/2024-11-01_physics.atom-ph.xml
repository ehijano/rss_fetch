      <title>Intensities of all fine-structure resolved rovibrational electric quadrupole absorption lines in $^{16}$O$_2$($X^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$) calculated with a new $\textit{ab initio}$ quadrupole moment curve</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The intensities of all rovibrational electric quadrupole absorption lines in $^{16}$O$_2$($X^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$), for which the vibrational quantum number is $v \leq 35$ and the total angular momentum quantum number is $J \leq 40$, are calculated in the intermediate coupling using a new $\textit{ab initio}$ quadrupole moment curve of the ground electronic state of O$_2$. The calculated values agree with those available in the HITRAN database, which at present includes only the $1$-$0$ fundamental vibrational band of $^{16}$O$_2$($X^{3}\Sigma^{-}_{g}$). We therefore recommend using the intensities of the vibrational overtones and hot bands reported here in updating the HITRAN database for O$_2$ in the upcoming 2024 edition.</description>

      <title>Impact of micromotion on the excitation of Rydberg states of ions in a Paul trap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trapped ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation and computation. Their capabilities can be further augmented by making use of electronically highly excited Rydberg states, which enable the realization of long-ranged electric dipolar interactions. Most experimental and theoretical studies so far focus on the excitation of ionic Rydberg states in linear Paul traps, which generate confinement by a combination of static and oscillating electric fields. These two fields need to be carefully aligned to minimize so-called micromotion, caused by the time-dependent electric field. The purpose of this work is to systematically understand the qualitative impact of micromotion on the Rydberg excitation spectrum, when the symmetry axes of the two electric fields do not coincide. Considering this scenario is not only important in the case of possible field misalignment, but becomes inevitable for Rydberg excitations in 2D and 3D ion crystals. We develop a minimal model describing a single trapped Rydberg ion, which we solve numerically via Floquet theory and analytically using a perturbative approach. We calculate the excitation spectra and analyze in which parameter regimes addressable and energetically isolated Rydberg lines persist, which are an important requirement for conducting coherent manipulations.</description>

      <title>229Th-doped nonlinear optical crystals for compact solid-state clocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent laser excitation of the 229Th isomeric transition in a solid-state host opens the door for a portable solid-state nuclear optical clock. However, at present the vacuum-ultraviolet laser systems required for clock operation are not conducive to a fieldable form factor. Here, we propose a possible solution to this problem by using 229Th-doped nonlinear optical crystals, which would allow clock operation without a vacuum-ultraviolet laser system and without the need of maintaining the crystal under vacuum.</description>

      <title>Coherence Preserving Leakage Detection and Cooling in Alkaline Earth Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23430v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optically trapped atoms in arrays of optical tweezers have emerged as a powerful platform for quantum information processing given the recent demonstrations of high-fidelity quantum logic gates and on-demand reconfigurable geometry. Both in gate operations and atomic transport, additional errors will occur due to leakage out of the computation space, atomic motional heating, or loss of an atom out of a trap completely. In this work, we address these error channels in a unified manner through laser fluorescence that can detect and cool the atom without disturbing the quantum information encoded therein. As only the electrons in the atom couple directly to the laser field, such quantum nondemolition (QND) processes are made possible by encoding quantum information in the nuclear spin of alkaline earth-like atoms and avoiding the effects of the hyperfine interaction which couples it to the electrons. By detuning a fluorescence laser off-resonantly from the $\mathrm{^1S_0} \rightarrow \mathrm{^1P_1}$ transition, far compared to the (small) hyperfine spitting, optical pumping between nuclear states falls off rapidly with detuning, scaling as $~1/\Delta^4$. In contrast, Rayleigh scattering falls off as $~1/\Delta^2$. We also consider a resonant leakage detection protocol off the $^1\mathrm{P}_1$ line. This is achieved by disabling the hyperfine coupling via a strong AC stark effect and canceling the residual lightshifts via dressing. The same scheme can be used to recool the atoms towards the vibrational ground state for the quantum information encoded in the ground state of alkaline earth atoms while preserving the coherence. These advances could significantly improve the prospect of neutral atoms for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Quantum logic for state preparation, readout, and leakage detection with binary subspace measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23531v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a general technique for using quantum logic spectroscopy to perform quantum non-demolition (QND) measurements that determine which of two subspaces a logic ion is in. We then show how to use the scheme to perform high fidelity state preparation and measurement (SPAM) and non-destructive leakage detection, as well as how this would reduce the engineering task associated with building larger quantum computers. Using a magnetic field gradient, we can apply a geometric phase interaction to map the magnetic sensitivity of the logic into onto the spin-flip probability of a readout ion. In the `low quantization field' regime, where the Zeeman splitting of the sublevels in the hyperfine ground state manifold are approximately integer multiples of each other, we show how to we can use the technique to distinguish between $2^{K}$ hyperfine sublevels in only $K$ logic/readout measurement sequences--opening the door for efficient state preparation of the logic ion. Finally, we show how the binary nature of the scheme, as well as its potential for high QND purity, let us improve SPAM fidelities by detecting and correcting errors rather than preventing them.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Joule-expansion experiments with a quantum gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24217v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classic Joule-expansion experiments, now with a quantum-degenerate atomic Bose gas. In contrast to the classical-gas experiments, where no temperature change was measured, here we observe both cooling and heating effects, which arise, respectively, due to quantum statistics and inter-particle interactions. Our observations are reproduced in numerical calculations within the Hartree-Fock approximation.</description>

      <title>Search for QCD Axions in light of String Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06652v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The QCD axion stands as one of the most promising candidates for resolving the strong CP problem. However, the value of the axion's decay constant $f_a$ and, by extension, its mass $m_a$, remain uncertain within the framework of effective field theory, posing a challenge for experimental detection. Fortunately, fields such as cosmology and astrophysics can offer crucial clues about potential mass ranges. Additionally, string theory and the more recent swampland principles might shed some light on the subject. The most straightforward string theory compactifications suggest that $f_a$ is around the GUT scale, leading to a quantum abundance of dark matter. We found that this range can be detected through hydrogen atomic transitions. The recent concept of the dark dimension scenario introduces an alternative possibility. If axions are confined to the four-dimensional Standard Model brane, their decay constant $f_a$ would be on the order of $10^{10}$ GeV. In this scenario, where axions constitute only a minor portion of dark matter, we show that a laser-interferometry setup would be an effective detection method.</description>

      <title>A universal speed limit for spreading of quantum coherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08204v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discoveries of fundamental limits for the rates of physical processes, from the speed of light to the Lieb-Robinson bound for information propagation, are conceptual breakthroughs that often challenge our understanding of the underlying physics. Here we observe such a limit for a paradigmatic many-body phenomenon, the spreading of coherence during formation of a weakly interacting Bose-Einstein condensate. We study condensate formation in an isolated homogeneous atomic gas that is initially far from equilibrium, in an incoherent low-energy state, and condenses as it relaxes towards equilibrium. Tuning the inter-atomic interactions that drive condensation, we show that the spreading of coherence through the system is initially slower for weaker interactions, and faster for stronger ones, but always eventually reaches the same limit, where the square of the coherence length grows at a universal rate given by the ratio of Planck's constant and the particle mass. These observations are robust to changes in the initial state, the gas density, and the system size. Our results provide benchmarks for theories of universality far from equilibrium, are relevant for quantum technologies that rely on large-scale coherence, and invite similar measurements in other quantum systems.</description>
