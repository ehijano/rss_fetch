      <title>Electronic structure and minimal models for flat and corrugated CuO monolayers: an ab initio study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01130v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $\mathrm{CuO}$ atomic thin monolayer ($\mathrm{mlCuO}$) was synthesized recently. Interest in the $\mathrm{mlCuO}$ is based on its close relation to $\mathrm{CuO_2}$ layers in typical high temperature cuprate superconductors. Here, we present the calculation of the band structure, the density of states and the Fermi surface of the flat $\mathrm{mlCuO}$ as well as the corrugated $\mathrm{mlCuO}$ within the density functional theory (DFT) in the generalized gradient approximation (GGA). In the flat $\mathrm{mlCuO}$, the $\mathrm{Cu}$-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ band crosses the Fermi level, while the $\mathrm{Cu}$-$3d_{xz,yz}$ hybridized band is located just below it. The corrugation leads to a significant shift of the $\mathrm{Cu}$-$3d_{xz,yz}$ hybridized band down in energy and a degeneracy lifting for the $\mathrm{Cu}$-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$ bands. Corrugated $\mathrm{mlCuO}$ is more energetically favorable than the flat one. In addition, we compared the electronic structure of the considered $\mathrm{CuO}$ monolayers with bulk $\mathrm{CuO}$ systems. We also investigated the influence of a crystal lattice strain (which might occur on some interfaces) on the electronic structure of both $\mathrm{mlCuO}$ and determined the critical strains of topological Lifshitz transitions. Finally, we proposed a number of different minimal models for the flat and the corrugated $\mathrm{mlCuO}$ using projections onto different Wannier functions basis sets and obtained the corresponding Hamiltonian matrix elements in a real space.</description>

      <title>Pressure-induced anomalous enhancement in superconducting critical temperature of transition-metal chalcogenide Ta$_2$PdS$_6$ and Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of a second dome in the superconducting phase through pressure-driven manipulation of crystal structures in materials has attracted considerable attention. Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) represent a highly promising platform, as the second dome has been observed in several binary compounds. Recently, ternary TMCs such as Ta$_2$PdS$_6$ and Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$ have exhibited pressure-induced superconducting domes. In this study, we perform electrical transport measurements of Ta$_2$PdS$_6$ and Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$ under extremely high pressures exceeding 100 GPa, namely uninvestigated regions in previous reports, to reveal the emergence of the second dome. The superconducting critical temperatures (T$_c$) in both Ta$_2$PdS$_6$ and Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$ initially decrease with increasing pressure. Subsequently, the Tcs tend to enhance drastically above 100 GPa. Notably, the maximum T$_c$ in Ta$_2$PdS$_6$ is 11.2 K at 130.0 GPa, which is a relatively high record among the TMCs. The emergence of the second dome in Ta$_2$PdS$_6$ and Ta$_2$PdSe$_6$ opens further motivation for the investigation under extreme conditions beyond the first dome to find hidden ordered phases.</description>

      <title>Singlet-triplet mixed state in spin-orbital-parity coupled superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unlike noncentrosymmetric superconductors, the effects of spin singlet- and spin triplet-pairing mixing in centrosymmetric superconductors remain ambiguous. Recently, it was experimentally demonstrated that an anisotropically enhanced in-plane critical fields beyond Pauli limit would be induced by the coupling of spin,orbit and parity ($p$-, $d$-orbitals) degrees of freedom in centrosymmetric transition metal dichacogenides , which is called as spin-orbit-parity coupled (SOPC) superconductors. In this work, we show that the SOPC would induce a strong spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing mixing near the topological band inversion in this system. Moreover, we find that the presence of such mixing provides a close explanation of the observed the in-plane upper critical fields $B_{c2}$ in terms of both the enhancement and anisotropy. We also propose measuring the equal-spin Andreev reflection between 2M-WS$_2$ and a ferromagnetic (FM) lead to detect the spin-triplet pairing in 2M-WS$_2$. Our work paves a way to study the spin-singlet and spin-triplet pairing in centrosymmetric superconductors with strong spin-orbital parity coupling.</description>

      <title>Probing disorder-induced time-reversal symmetry breaking in Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between superconductivity and time-reversal symmetry (TRS) is one of the most fascinating problems in condensed matter physics. Although most superconductors inherently possess TRS, nonmagnetic disorder can induce states that demonstrate the breaking of this symmetry. Yet, the identification of experimental signatures of superconductivity with broken TRS remains a challenge. Here, we fabricate vertical Josephson junctions using metallic superconductor (Al) and ion bombarded Sr2RuO4 to study disorder-driven TRS breaking effects. We observe persistent magnetoresistive hysteresis behavior dependent on the disorder deposition time that provides evidence of TRS breaking below the superconducting transition temperature. Field and temperature dependent measurements suggest that the observed effects arise from disorder-induced anomalous flux in Sr2RuO4 which can be sensitively detected by superconducting Al. Our experimental results can be accounted within a physical framework of disorder-induced reconstruction of the superconducting order parameter as described within a multiband Ginzburg-Landau approach.</description>

      <title>High-pressure self-flux growth and characterization of Li-deficient Li0.95FeAs single crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single crystals of LiFeAs were successfully grown by a self-flux method using the cubic anvil high-pressure and high-temperature technique. The reaction took place in a closed boron nitride crucible at a pressure of 1 GPa and a temperature of 1050 C. The grown crystals, retrieved from solidified lump, exhibit plate-like shapes with sizes up to 0.7 x 0.7 x 0.15 mm3. Single-crystal x-ray diffraction refinement confirmed the high structural perfection of the grown crystals (space group P4/nmm, No 129, Z = 2, a = 3.77370(10) A, c = 6.3468(6) A, and V = 90.384(9) A3) with the presence of a small deficiency on the Li site. The refined chemical composition of the produced crystals is Li0.95FeAs. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurements revealed bulk superconductivity with a superconducting transition Tc = 16 K. A comparative analysis of LiFeAs, Li1-xFeAs, and Li1-yFe1+yAs systems reveal that superconductivity is less sensitive to the Li deficiency, although it may completely disappear in the presence of both Fe excess and Li deficiency.</description>

      <title>Observation of Majorana zero modes emerged from topological Dirac semimetal states under uniaxial strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological properties observed in iron-based superconductors extend our understanding of vortex Majorana quasiparticle excitations in unexpected ways. Vortex Majorana physics has been extensively studied within the context of the topologically protected surface Dirac state. By employing an in-situ strain device, we demonstrate that uniaxial strain can generate Majorana zero modes out of the topological Dirac semimetal bulk state in LiFeAs. Uniaxial strain along [100] direction is found to enhance the band renormalization of LiFeAs, effectively reducing the energy separation between the Fermi level and the topological Dirac semimetal state, and breaking C4 symmetry. Using scanning tunneling microscopy, we observe the evolution of vortex bound states in the topological Dirac semimetal state region, accompanied by the emergence of Majorana zero modes and vortex bound states contributed by the bulk band. Our work provides a controllable method for experimentally engineering Majorana physics in iron-based superconductors, and offers valuable insights into the topological Dirac semimetal state with intrinsic s-wave superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Spin-stripe order tied to the pseudogap phase in La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although spin and charge stripes in high-Tc cuprates have been extensively studied, the exact range of carrier concentration over which they form a static order remains uncertain, complicating efforts to understand their significance. In La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) and in zero external magnetic field, static spin stripes are confined to a doping range well below p*, the pseudogap boundary at zero temperature. However, when high fields suppress the competing effect of superconductivity, spin stripe order is found to extend up to p*. Here, we investigated La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4 (Eu-LSCO) using 139La nuclear magnetic resonance and observe field-dependent spin fluctuations suggesting a similar competition between superconductivity and spin order as in LSCO. Nevertheless, we find that static spin stripes are present practically up to p* irrespective of field strength: the stronger stripe order in Eu-LSCO prevents superconductivity from enforcing a non-magnetic ground state, except very close to p*. Thus, spin-stripe order is consistently bounded by p* in both LSCO and Eu-LSCO, despite their differing balances between stripe order and superconductivity. This indicates that the canonical stripe order, where spins and charges are intertwined in a static pattern, is fundamentally tied to the pseudogap phase. Any stripe order beyond the pseudogap endpoint must then be of a different nature: either spin and charge orders remain intertwined, but both fluctuating, or only spin order fluctuates while charge order remains static. The presence of spin-stripe order up to p*, the pervasive, slow, and field-dependent spin-stripe fluctuations, as well as the electronic inhomogeneity documented in this work, must all be carefully considered in discussions of Fermi surface transformations, quantum criticality, and strange metal behavior.</description>

      <title>Theory of potential impurity scattering in pressurized superconducting La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently discovered high-T$_c$ superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (La-327) is believed to be driven by the non-phononic repulsive interaction. Depending on the strength of the interlayer repulsion, the symmetry of the superconducting order parameter is expected to be either $d$-wave or sign-changing bonding-antibonding $s_{\pm}$-wave. Unfortunately, due to the need of high pressure to reach superconducting phase, conventional spectroscopic probes to validate the symmetry of the order parameter are hard to use. Here, we study the effect of the point-like non-magnetic impurities on the superconducting state of La-327 and show that $s_{\pm}$-wave and $d$-wave symmetries show a very different behavior as a function of impurity concentration, which can be studied experimentally by irradiating the La-327 samples by electrons prior applying the pressure. While $d-$wave superconducting state will be conventionally suppressed, the $s_{\pm}$-wave state shows more subtle behavior, depending on the asymmetry between bonding and antibonding subspaces. For the electronic structure, predicted to realize in La-327, the $s_{\pm}-$wave state will be robust against complete suppression and the transition temperature, $T_c$ demonstrates a transition from convex to concave behavior, indicating a crossover from $s_{\pm}$-wave to $s_{++}$-wave symmetry as a function of impurity concentration. We further analyze the sensitivity of the obtained results with respect to the potential electronic structure modification.</description>

      <title>Full counting statistics for unconventional superconductor junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise and current measurements are key tools for studying mesoscopic systems, revealing insights beyond conductance alone. For instance, noise measurements show that transport carriers in conventional superconductors have charge 2e. The noise power also depends on junction type, distinguishing different transport processes. Existing theories focus primarily on zero temperature shot noise in tunnel junctions with conventional superconductors, where transport is carried by quasiparticles and Cooper pairs. Here we develop a full counting statistics theory for unconventional superconductor / normal metal junctions of different types, incorporating the effect of thermal noise on the differential Fano factor, the ratio of differential noise power and conductance. In these junctions there is a third type of transport carrier, surface Andreev bound states. Our study reveals that junctions with dispersionless surface Andreev bound states exhibit negative differential Fano factor at finite temperatures. In contrast, in the presence of dispersive surface Andreev bound states, the noise power always increases with voltage, but there are local minima in the differential noise at those voltages corresponding to the extrema of the surface Andreev bound state spectrum. For normal metals and conventional superconductors the voltage dependence of the differential Fano factor is similar in all types of junctions, including tunnel junctions and diffusive barriers. However, significant differences arise with unconventional superconductors, making distinct junction types valuable tools for identifying pairing symmetries. Our results also highlight the importance of finite temperature effects in noise power measurements for potential unconventional superconductors, offering new means to determine pairing symmetries in topological superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multiply connected electronic networks threaded by flux tubes have been proposed as a platform for adiabatic quantum transport and topological states. Multi-terminal Josephson junction (MTJJ) has been suggested as a pathway to realize this concept. Yet, the manifestations of topology in MTJJ remain open for experimental study. Here, we investigated the artificial topological band structure of three-terminal graphene Josephson junctions. Employing tunnelling spectroscopy and magnetic flux gates, we captured the tomography of the Andreev bound state (ABS) energy spectrum as a function of two independent phase differences. This ABS spectrum exhibits the topological transition from gapped to gapless states, akin to the band structure of nodal-line semimetals. Our results show the potential of graphene-based MTJJs for engineering band topologies in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Modelling Realistic Multi-layer devices for superconducting quantum electronic circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present a numerical model specifically designed for 3D multilayer devices, with a focus on nanobridge junctions and coplanar waveguides. Unlike existing numerical models, ours does not approximate the physical layout or limit the number of constituent materials, providing a more accurate and flexible design tool. We calculate critical currents, current phase relationships, and the energy gap where relevant. We validate our model by comparing it with published data. Through our analysis, we found that using multilayer films significantly enhances control over these quantities. For nanobridge junctions in particular, multilayer structures improve qubit anharmonicity compared to monolayer junctions, offering a substantial advantage for qubit performance. For coated multilayer microwave circuits it allows for better studies of the proximity effect, including their effective kinetic inductance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22769v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically propose a mechanism to realize the superconducting diode effect (SDE): The current can generate a magnetic field, affecting the magnetic moment of magnetic impurity. When the connection region of the Josephson junction is coupled with the magnetic impurity, the supercurrents in positive and negative directions have different influences on the magnetic moment. This results in a phenomenon that the critical supercurrents in these opposite directions are unequal, which is called SDE. We model the Josephson connection region by a quantum dot. Then the critical supercurrents are investigated by the non-equilibrium Green's function method, and we carry out a detailed symmetry analysis on the supercurrent relations. The calculation results confirm that the SDE does exist in this system. Besides, the SDE is significant in a wide parameter space and can be effectively adjusted in various ways. Our design only demands a magnetic impurity and conventional superconductors. The unconventional finite-momentum Cooper pair and spin-orbit coupling are not required, and there is also no need for the existence of chirality or an external magnetic field. Our work provides a universal device structure for the development of superconducting electronics.</description>

      <title>First principle prediction of structural distortions in the cuprates and their impact on the electronic structure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07997v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Materials-realistic microscopic theoretical descriptions of copper-based superconductors are challenging due to their complex crystal structures combined with strong electron interactions. Here, we demonstrate how density functional theory can accurately describe key structural, electronic, and magnetic properties of the normal state of the prototypical cuprate Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212). We emphasize the importance of accounting for energy-lowering structural distortions, which then allows us to: (a) accurately describe the insulating antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state of the undoped parent compound (in contrast to the metallic state predicted by previous {\it ab initio} studies); (b) identify numerous low-energy competing spin and charge stripe orders in the hole-overdoped material nearly degenerate in energy with the AFM ordered state, indicating strong spin fluctuations; (c) predict the lowest-energy hole-doped crystal structure including its long-range structural distortions and oxygen dopant positions that match high-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements; and (d) describe electronic bands near the Fermi energy with flat antinodal dispersions and Fermi surfaces that in agreement with angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) measurements and provide a clear explanation for the structural origins of the so-called ``shadow bands''. We also show how one must go beyond band theory and include fully dynamic spin fluctuations via a many-body approach when aiming to make quantitative predictions to measure the ARPES spectra in the overdoped material. Finally, regarding spatial inhomogeneity, we show that the local structure at the CuO$_2$ layer, rather than dopant electrostatic effects, modulates the local charge-transfer gaps, local correlation strengths, and by extension the local superconducting gaps.</description>

      <title>Quantum oscillations in the hole-doped cuprates and the confinement of spinons</title>

Abstract: A long standing problem in the study of the under-hole-doped cuprates has been the description of the Fermi surfaces underlying the high magnetic field quantum oscillations, and their connection to the higher temperature pseudogap metal. Harrison and Sebastian (arXiv:1103.4181) proposed that the pseudogap `Fermi arcs' are reconstructed into an electron pocket by field-induced charge density wave order. But computations on such a model (Zhang and Mei, arXiv:1411.2098) show an unobserved additional oscillation frequency from a Fermi surface arising from the backsides of the hole pockets completing the Fermi arcs. We describe a transition from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) model of the pseudogap metal, to a metal with bi-directional charge density wave order without fractionalization. We show that the confinement of the fermionic spinon excitations of the FL* across this transition can eliminate the unobserved oscillation frequency.</description>

      <title>Critical Filaments and Superconductivity in Quasiperiodic Twisted Bilayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multilayer moir\'e materials can exhibit topological electronic features yet are inherently quasiperiodic -- leading to wave function interference whose Anderson-localizing tendency can be mitigated by topology. We consider a quasiperiodic variant of the chiral Bistritzer-MacDonald model for twisted bilayer graphene with two incommensurate moir\'e potentials that serves as a toy model for twisted trilayer. We observe "filaments" linking magic angles with enhanced density of states and fractal wave functions that evade localization; states away from the filaments mimic fractal surface states of dirty topological superconductors. We demonstrate that topological quasiperiodicity can broadly enhance superconductivity without magic-angle fine-tuning.</description>
