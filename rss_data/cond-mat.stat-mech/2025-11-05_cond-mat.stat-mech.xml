      <title>Some remarks on the objectivity and thermodynamic consistency of Korteweg-type fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we compare the entropy principle and the objectivity arguments in the methodologies of Dunn and Serrin [1] and in the more recent weakly nonlocal thermodynamic analysis of Korteweg-type fluids in [2]. It is concluded that the different objectivity approaches lead to the same constitutive functions, and that the difference in the thermodynamically compatible pressure tensors of perfect Korteweg fluids is due to different symmetry requirements.</description>

      <title>Mittag-Leffler Quantum Statistics and Thermodynamic Anomalies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Building upon the framework established in our recent work [M. Seifi et al., Phys. Rev. E 111, 054114 (2025)], wherein a generalized Maxwell Boltzmann distribution was formulated using the Mittag Leffler function within the superstatistical formalism, we extend this approach to the quantum domain. Specifically, we introduce two statistical distributions,termed the Mittag Leffler Bose Einstein (MLBE) and Mittag Leffler Fermi Dirac (MLFD) distributions, constructed by generalizing the conventional Bose-Einstein and Fermi-Dirac distributions through the Mittag-Leffler function. This generalization incorporates a deformation parameter (\alpha), which facilitates a continuous interpolation between bosonic and fermionic statistics, while inherently capturing nonequilibrium effects and generalized thermodynamic behavior. We analyze the thermodynamic geometry associated with these distributions and identify significant departures from standard statistical models. Notably, the MLBE distribution manifests a Bose-Einstein-like condensation even in the absence of interactions, whereas the MLFD distribution exhibits unconventional features, such as negative heat capacity in the low-temperature regime. These findings highlight the pivotal role of statistical deformation in determining emergent macroscopic thermodynamic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium Macroscopic Response Relations for Counting Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02041</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding how macroscopic nonequilibrium systems respond to changes in external or internal parameters remains a fundamental challenge in physics. In this work, we report a parameter transitional symmetry valid for macroscopic dynamics arbitrarily far from equilibrium. The symmetry leads to exact response relations and gives meaningful expansions in both linear and short-time regimes. This framework provides a universal description of macroscopic response phenomena arbitrarily far from equilibrium - including non-stationary processes and time-dependent attractors. The theory is validated and demonstrated numerically using the Willamowski-Rossler model, which exhibits rich dynamical behaviors including limit cycles and chaos.</description>

      <title>Exact Mapping of Nonequilibrium to Equilibrium Phase Transitions for Systems in Contact with Two Thermal Baths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02127v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a large class of nonequilibrium many-body systems in contact with two thermal baths admit an exact mapping onto equivalent equilibrium systems. This mapping provides direct access to nonequilibrium phase transition points from known equilibrium results, irrespective of the model, interaction topology, or distance from equilibrium. We verify the universality of this correspondence using paradigmatic models (Ising, Potts, and Blume-Capel), and highlight distinctive features in entropy production close to critical and tricritical points. Our findings connect equilibrium and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, with implications for microscopic thermal machines and stochastic thermodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.02267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The generic shape of the single-time and two-time correlators in non-equilibrium phase-ordering kinetics with ${z}=2$ is obtained from the co-variance of the four-point response functions. Their non-equilibrium scaling forms follow from a new non-equilibrium representation of the Schr\"odinger algebra.</description>

      <title>Charge glass from supercooling topological-ordered liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological order characterizes a class of quantum and classical many-body liquid states that escape the conventional classification by spontaneous symmetry breaking. Many properties of the topological-ordered states still await a clear understanding, and nature of phase transition dynamics is one of them. Normally, when a liquid freezes into a solid, crystallization starts with nucleation and a solid domain quickly grows on the surface of the expanding nucleus, and the domains evolve into macroscopic size. In this work, we reveal that the crystallization of the topological-ordered liquid proceeds in a fundamentally different way. The topological-ordered phase is characterized by a global conserved quantity and its conjugate fractional charge, which we call a flux and a triplet in our working system of the charge Ising model on a triangular lattice. In contrast to the normal crystallization process, the phase transition is driven by the diffusive motion of triplets, which is required to change the value of conserved fluxes to exit the topological-ordered phase. In order to complete crystallization, triplets must spend a divergently long time to diffuse over a macroscopic distance across the system, which results in glassy behavior. Reflecting the diffusive motion of triplets, the initial crystallization process shows slowing down with unusually small Avrami exponent $\sim0.5$. These anomalous dynamics are specific to the crystallization from topological-ordered liquid, and well account for the main features of charge glass behavior exhibited by the organic conductors, $\theta$-(BEDT-TTF)$_2$X(SCN)$_4$.</description>

      <title>Haldane-Inspired Generalized Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and study a generalized quantum statistical framework, referred to as \emph{alpha statistics}, that continuously interpolates between Bose--Einstein and Fermi--Dirac statistics and naturally extends into the hyperbosonic regime for $\alpha &lt; 0$. Inspired by Haldane's exclusion statistics, this formulation introduces a modified occupation weight function that encodes effective statistical interactions via the parameter $\alpha$. Using thermodynamic geometry, we analyze the sign and singular behavior of the thermodynamic curvature as a diagnostic of underlying interactions and phase structures. A crossover temperature $T^{*}$, at which the curvature changes sign, marks the transition between effectively attractive (Bose-like) and repulsive (Fermi-like) statistical regimes. When expressed relative to the Bose--Einstein condensation temperature $T_{c}$, the ratio $T^{*}/T_{c}$ depends universally on $\alpha$. For negative $\alpha$, corresponding to hyperbosonic statistics, we find curvature singularities at specific fugacities, indicating modified condensation phenomena distinct from conventional Bose condensation. These results highlight the geometric and thermodynamic consequences of alpha statistics and establish a link between fractional exclusion principles and curvature-induced interaction signatures in statistical thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Post-quench relaxation dynamics of Gross-Neveu lattice fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the quantum relaxation dynamics for a lattice version of the one-dimensional (1D) $N$-flavor Gross-Neveu (GN) model after a Hamiltonian parameter quench. Allowing for a system-reservoir coupling $\gamma$, we numerically describe the system dynamics through a time-dependent self-consistent Lindblad master equation. For a closed ($\gamma=0$) finite-size system subjected to an interaction parameter quench, the order parameter dynamics exhibits oscillations and revivals. In the thermodynamic limit, our results imply that the order parameter reaches its post-quench stationary value in accordance with the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). However, time-dependent finite-momentum correlation matrix elements equilibrate only if $\gamma&gt;0$. Our findings highlight subtle yet important aspects of the post-quench relaxation dynamics of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement asymmetry in gauge theories: chiral anomaly in the finite temperature massless Schwinger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The entanglement asymmetry has emerged in recent years as a practical quantity to study phases of matter. We present the first study of entanglement asymmetry in gauge theories by considering the chiral anomaly of the analytically solvable massless Schwinger model at both zero and finite temperatures. At zero temperature, we find the asymmetry exhibits logarithmic growth with system size. At finite temperature, we show that it is parametrically more sensitive to chiral symmetry-breaking than the corresponding local order parameter: while the chiral condensate decays exponentially, the asymmetry decreases only logarithmically. This establishes the entanglement asymmetry as a promising tool to probe (finite-temperature) phase transitions in gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Gradient RG Flow in Scalar-Fermion QFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gradient property of the renormalisation group (RG) is examined to four-loop order in scalar-fermion systems in $d=4$ and $d=4-\varepsilon$ dimensions. The crucial role played by the beta shift, which is a modification of the standard dim-reg beta function, is elucidated, and specific conditions that it needs to satisfy for the RG flow to be gradient are derived. Over a thousand gradient-flow conditions are found, all of which are scheme-independent and satisfied whenever the full set of results needed to check them is available. It is shown, in the framework of the $\varepsilon=4-d$ expansion, that the space of conformal field theories (CFTs) is dominated by those with non-zero beta shift as the number of fields grows. Physical properties of CFTs obtained as solutions where the beta functions are not zero in the $\varepsilon$ expansion are discussed.</description>

      <title>Stability of mixed-state phases under weak decoherence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.01976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that the Gibbs states of classical, and commuting-Pauli, Hamiltonians are stable under weak local decoherence: i.e., we show that the effect of the decoherence can be locally reversed. In particular, our conclusions apply to finite-temperature equilibrium critical points and ordered low-temperature phases. In these systems the unconditional spatio-temporal correlations are long-range, and local (e.g., Metropolis) dynamics exhibits critical slowing down. Nevertheless, our results imply the existence of local "decoders" that undo the decoherence, when the decoherence strength is below a critical value. An implication of these results is that thermally stable quantum memories have a threshold against decoherence that remains nonzero as one approaches the critical temperature. Analogously, in diffusion models, stability of data distributions implies the existence of computationally-efficent local denoisers in the late-time generation dynamics.</description>

      <title>On the supra-linear storage in dense networks of grid and place cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Place-cell networks, typically forced to pairwise synaptic interactions, are widely studied as models of cognitive maps: such models, however, share a severely limited storage capacity, scaling linearly with network size and with a very small critical storage. This limitation is a challenge for navigation in 3-dimensional space because, oversimplifying, if encoding motion along a one-dimensional trajectory embedded in 2-dimensions requires $O(K)$ patterns (interpreted as bins), extending this to a 2-dimensional manifold embedded in a 3-dimensional space -yet preserving the same resolution- requires roughly $O(K^2)$ patterns, namely a supra-linear amount of patterns. In these regards, dense Hebbian architectures, where higher-order neural assemblies mediate memory retrieval, display much larger capacities and are increasingly recognized as biologically plausible, but have never linked to place cells so far. Here we propose a minimal two-layer model, with place cells building a layer and leaving the other layer populated by neural units that account for the internal representations (so to qualitatively resemble grid cells in the MEC of mammals): crucially, by assuming that each place cell interacts with pairs of grid cells, we show how such a model is formally equivalent to a dense Battaglia-Treves-like Hebbian network of grid cells only endowed with four-body interactions. By studying its emergent computational properties by means of statistical mechanics of disordered systems, we prove -analytically- that such effective higher-order assemblies (constructed under the guise of biological plausibility) can support supra-linear storage of continuous attractors; furthermore, we prove -numerically- that the present neural network is capable of recognition and navigation on general surfaces embedded in a 3-dimensional space.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic active matter under confinement: dynamical heterogeneity, bursts, and glassy behavior in a few-body system of self-propelling camphor surfers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a few-body system composed of self-propelling camphor surfers confined within a circular boundary. These millimeter-sized particles move in a regime where inertia and long-ranged interactions play a significant role, leading to surprisingly complex and subtle collective dynamics. These dynamics include self-organized bursts and glassy behavior at intermediate densities--phenomena not apparent from ensemble-averaged steady-state measures. By analyzing quantities like the overlap order parameter, we observe that the system exhibits dynamical slowing down as particle density increases. This slowdown is also reflected in the bursting activity, where both the amplitude and frequency of bursts decrease with increasing particle density. A minimal inertial active-particle model reproduces these dynamical steady states, revealing the importance of a new intermediate length scale--larger than the particle size. This intermediate scale is critical for the formation of structures resembling caging and plays a key role in the glass-like transition. Our results describe a macroscopic analog of an active glass with the additional phenomena of bursting.</description>

Abstract: We point out a correspondence between the Jackiw--Teitelboim (JT) gravity and the stationary measure of the Kardar--Parisi--Zhang (KPZ) equation on an interval. By relating the Schwarzian limit of the double-scaled SYK to the weakly asymmetric limit of the open ASEP, we establish that the path-integral measure defining the Euclidean evolution between two end-of-the-world branes in JT gravity can be interpreted as the stationary measure of the KPZ equation on an interval with Neumann boundary conditions. We also establish the match between correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Universal behavior at the Lifshitz Points of an active Malthusian Ising model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lifshitz points (LPs) are multicritical points where ordered, disordered, and patterned phases meet. Originally studied in equilibrium magnetic systems, LPs have since been identified in soft matter and even cosmological settings. Their role in active, living matter, however, remains entirely unexplored. Here we address this gap by introducing and analyzing LPs in the Active Malthusian Ising Model (AMIM) -- a minimal model of living matter that incorporates motility together with birth-death dynamics. Despite its simplicity, the AMIM provides direct experimental relevance. We show that the system generically exhibits two distinct LPs and elucidate their universal behavior using a dynamic renormalization group analysis with the $\epsilon$-expansion method at one loop. Our results yield testable predictions for future simulations and experiments, establishing LPs as a fertile testing ground for novel physics in active matter.</description>

Abstract: Quantum batteries have emerged as promising platforms for exploring energy storage and transfer processes governed by quantum mechanical laws. In this work, we study three models of two-qubit open quantum systems. The first model comprises two central spins immersed in spin baths, and both central spins are collectively considered as quantum batteries. The impact of inter-qubit interactions on the performance of the quantum battery is investigated. In the second model, a two-qubit model interacting with a squeezed thermal bath serves as a collective quantum battery, where the impact of inter-atomic distance and the bath temperature on the battery's performance is explored. Furthermore, a two-qubit model is used, where one qubit is modeled as a battery and the other as a charger. The charger in this model interacts with an anisotropic spin-chain bath, which is conducive to quantum criticality. It is demonstrated that this criticality has a substantial impact on the quantum battery's storage capacity.</description>

Abstract: We study the statistical distribution of Newtonian gravitational forces acting on a test particle embedded in an infinite, homogeneous, and uncorrelated random gas of particles. In the limit where both the number of neighboring particles and the confining volume tend to infinity with constant density, this distribution converges to the classic Holtsmark distribution. Our focus here is on the contribution of the nearest particle neighbors to the total Newtonian force. To this end, we derive the joint spatial distribution of the nearest neighbors in arbitrary spatial dimensions, and show that, in three dimensions, the divergence of the variance of the Holtsmark distribution originates entirely from the dominant influence of the nearest neighbor.</description>

      <title>Optimal control strategy for collisional Brownian engines</title>

Abstract: Collisional Brownian engines have recently gained attention as alternatives to conventional nanoscale engines. However, a comprehensive optimization of their performance, which could serve as a benchmark for future engine designs, is still lacking. In this work, we address this gap by deriving and analyzing the optimal driving protocol for a collisional Brownian engine. By maximizing the average output work, we show that the optimal protocol consists of linear force segments separated by impulsive delta-like kicks that instantaneously reverse the particle's velocity. This structure enforces constant velocity within each stroke, enabling fully analytical expressions for optimal output power, efficiency, and entropy production. We demonstrate that the optimal protocol significantly outperforms standard strategies (such as constant, linear, or periodic drivings) achieving higher performance while keeping entropy production under control. Remarkably, when evaluated using realistic experimental parameters, the efficiency approaches near-unity at the power optimum, with entropy production remaining well controlled, a striking feature of the optimal protocol. To analyze a more realistic scenario, we examine the impact of smoothing the delta-like forces by introducing a finite duration and find that, although this reduces efficiency and increases entropy production, the optimal protocol still delivers high power output in a robust manner. Altogether, our results provide a theoretical benchmark for finite-time thermodynamic optimization of Brownian engines under time-periodic drivings.</description>

Abstract: We consider the Blume--Capel model in the scaling limit to realize the thermal perturbation of the tricritical Ising fixed point. We develop a numerical scaling limit extrapolation for one-point functions and R\'enyi entropies in the ground state. In a mass quench scenario, we found long-lived oscillations despite the absence of explicit spin-flip symmetry breaking or confining potential. We construct form factors of branch-point twist fields in the paramagnetic phase. In the scaling limit of small quenches, we verify form factor predictions for the energy density and leading magnetic field using the dynamics of one-point functions, and branch-point twist fields using the dynamics of R\'enyi entropies.</description>

      <title>Emergent Distance and Metricity of Mutual Information in 1D Quantum Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.09749v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop and formalize a phase diagnostic based on the information-distance \(d_E = K_0/\sqrt{I}\) (mutual information \(I\)) for 1D quantum chains. Calibrating with the Euclidean benchmark \(I(r)\propto r^{-2}\mapsto d_E(r)\propto r\) makes the triangle-inequality test parameter-free and scale-invariant. Under site-averaged, monotone scaling conditions on the 1D line we establish a criterion linking the decay of \(I(r)\) to metric behavior of \(d_E(r)\): power laws \(I(r)\sim r^{-X}\) with \(0&lt;X\le 2\) yield subadditivity (metric scaling), while exponential clustering leads to superadditivity. As an analytic check complementing our earlier numerical study, we verify these predictions in the 1D transverse-field Ising chain using an exact Jordan-Wigner/Bogoliubov-de Gennes solution: at criticality \(I(r)\) follows a power law close to the \(X=2\) benchmark and the equal-legs triangle defect \(\Delta(r,r)=d_E(2r)-2d_E(r)\) is asymptotically non-positive; in gapped regimes \(I(r)\) decays exponentially and \(\Delta(r,r)\gg 0\). The result is a practical, falsifiable large-scale diagnostic based solely on site-averaged two-site mutual information.</description>

      <title>Intermittent localization and fast spatial learning by non-Markov random walks with decaying memory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.01806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random walks on lattices with preferential relocation to previously visited sites provide a simple framework for modeling the displacements of animals and humans. When the lattice contains a few impurities or resource sites where the walker spends more time on average at each visit than on the other sites, the long range memory can suppress diffusion and induce by reinforcement a steady state localized around a resource. This phenomenon can be identified with a spatial learning process. Here we study theoretically and numerically how the decay of memory impacts learning in a model with one impurity. If memory decays as $1/\tau$ or slower, where $\tau$ is the time backward into the past, the localized solution is the same as with perfect, non-decaying memory and it is linearly stable. If forgetting is faster than $1/\tau$, for instance exponential, an unusual regime of intermittent localization is observed, where well localized periods of exponentially distributed duration are disrupted by possibly long intervals of diffusive motion. At the transition between the two regimes, for a kernel in $1/\tau$, the approach to the stable localized state is the fastest, opposite to the expected critical slowing down effect. Hence, forgetting can allow the walker to save a lot of memory without compromising learning and to achieve a faster learning process. These findings agree with biological evidence on the benefits of forgetting.</description>

      <title>Maximum Quantum Work at Criticality: Stirling Engines and Fibonacci-Lucas Degeneracies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25533v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many-body effects and quantum criticality play a central role in determining the performance of quantum thermal machines. Although operating near a quantum critical point (QCP) is known to enhance engine performance, the precise thermodynamic conditions required to attain the Carnot efficiency limit remain unsettled. Here, we derive the exact conditions for a quantum Stirling engine to achieve Carnot efficiency when a QCP drives its working medium. In the low-temperature regime, where only the ground-state manifold is populated, the net work output is given by $ W = k_B \delta \ln (g_{\text{crit}}/g_0) $ with $ \delta = T_H - T_L $, which directly yields the Carnot efficiency $ \eta_C = 1 - T_L/T_H $, independent of microscopic details. Notably, whereas ideal Stirling cycles attain Carnot efficiency only with a perfect regenerator, here no regenerator is required because, at low temperatures, the thermal population remains confined to the degenerate ground state; this represents a clear quantum advantage over engines with classical working substances. We validate this universal result by recovering known behaviors in various quantum systems, including spin chains with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and magnetic anisotropies. Applying the framework to the one-dimensional antiferromagnetic Ising model, we predict non-extensive scaling of the work output governed by Fibonacci and Lucas numbers for open chains and closed rings, respectively, which converges to classical extensivity in the thermodynamic limit. This analysis establishes a general and robust foundation for designing quantum thermal machines that reach the Carnot bound while delivering finite work.</description>

      <title>Diffusion velocity modulus of self-propelled spherical and circular particles in the generalized Langevin approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.27536v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This research provides a framework for describing the averaged modulus of the velocity reached by an accelerated self-propelled Brownian particle diffusing in a thermal fluid and constrained to a harmonic external potential. The system is immersed in a thermal bath of harmonic oscillators at a constant temperature, where its constituents also interact with the external field. The dynamics is investigated for a sphere and a disk, and is split into two stochastic processes. The first describes the gross-grained inner time-dependent self-velocity generated from a set of independent Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes without the influence of the external field. This internal mechanism provides the initial velocity for the particle to diffuse in the fluid, which is implemented in a modified generalized Langevin equation as the second process. We find that the system exhibits spontaneous fluctuations in the diffusive velocity modulus due to the inner mechanism; however, as expected, the momentary diffusive velocity fluctuations fade out at large times. The internal propelled velocity module in spherical coordinates is derived, as well as the simulation of the different modules for both the sphere and the already known equations for a disk in polar coordinates.</description>

      <title>Minimum Action Principle for Entropy Production Rate of Far-From-Equilibrium Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00967v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Boltzmann distribution connects the energetics of an equilibrium system with its statistical properties, and it is desirable to have a similar principle for non-equilibrium systems. Here, we derive a variational principle for the entropy production rate (EPR) of far-from-equilibrium discrete state systems, relating it to the action for the transition probability measure of discrete state processes. This principle leads to a tighter, non-quadratic formulation of the dissipation function, speed limits, the thermodynamic-kinetic uncertainty relation, the large deviation rate functional, and the fluctuation relation, all within a unified framework of the thermodynamic length. Additionally, the optimal control of non-conservative transition affinities using the underlying geodesic structure is explored, and the corresponding slow-driving and finite-time optimal driving exact protocols are analytically computed. We demonstrate that discontinuous endpoint jumps in optimal protocols are a generic, model-independent physical mechanism that reduces entropy production during finite-time driving of far-from-equilibrium systems.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic Length in Stochastic Thermodynamics of Far-From-Equilibrium Systems: Unification of Fluctuation Relation and Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.00970v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Boltzmann distribution for an equilibrium system constrains the statistics of the system by the energetics. Despite the non-equilibrium generalization of the Boltzmann distribution being studied extensively, a unified framework valid for far-from-equilibrium discrete state systems is lacking. Here, we derive an exact path-integral representation for discrete state processes and represent it using the exponential of the action for stochastic transition dynamics. Solving the variational problem, the effective action is shown to be equal to the inferred entropy production rate (a thermodynamic quantity) and a non-quadratic dissipation function of the thermodynamic length (TL) defined for microscopic stochastic currents (a dynamic quantity). This formulates a far-from-equilibrium analog of the Boltzmann distribution, namely, the minimum action principle. The non-quadratic dissipation function is physically attributed to incorporating non-Gaussian fluctuations or far-from-equilibrium non-conservative driving. Further, an exact large deviation dynamical rate functional is derived. The equivalence of the variational formulation with the information geometric formulation is proved. The non-quadratic TL recovers the non-quadratic thermodynamic-kinetic uncertainty relation (TKUR) and the speed limits, which are tighter than the close-to-equilibrium quadratic formulations. Moreover, if the transition affinities are known, the non-quadratic TL recovers the fluctuation relation (FR). The minimum action principle manifests the non-quadratic TKUR and FR as two faces corresponding to the thermodynamic inference and partial control descriptions, respectively. In addition, the validity of these results is extended to coarse-grained observable currents, strengthening the experimental/numerical applicability of them.</description>

Abstract: Optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics are a frontier for understanding the control and design of non-equilibrium systems, with broad practical applications in biology, chemistry, and nanoscale/mesoscale systems. Optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry have emerged as optimal control methodology, but they are based on slow-driving and close to equilibrium assumptions. An optimal control framework in stochastic thermodynamics for finite time driving is still elusive. Therefore, we solve in this paper an optimal control problem for changing the control parameters of a discrete-state far-from-equilibrium process from an initial to a final value in finite-time. Optimal driving protocols are derived that minimize the total finite-time dissipation cost for the driving process. Our framework reveals that discontinuous endpoint jumps are a generic, model-independent physical mechanism that minimizes the optimal driving entropy production, whose importance is further amplified for far-from-equilibrium systems. The thermodynamic and dynamic physical interpretation and understanding of discontinuous endpoint jumps is formulated. An exact mapping between the finite-time to slow driving optimal control formulation is elucidated, developing the state-of-the-art of optimal mass transport theory and thermodynamic geometry, which has been the current paradigm for studying optimal processes in stochastic thermodynamics that relies on slow driving assumptions. Our framework opens up a plethora of applications to the thermodynamically efficient control of a far-from-equilibrium system in finite-time, which opens up a way to their efficient design principles.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15181v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the action-angle variables for a Hamiltonian flow of the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, from a formulation introduced in a 2022 work due to Keating, Reshetikhin, and Sridhar, hence confirming a conjecture of the authors as to whether the Hamiltonian flow is integrable. To demonstrate that such an integrability property of the Hamiltonian holds from the action-angle variables, we make use of previous methods for studying Hamiltonian systems, implemented by Faddeev and Takhtajan, in which it was shown that integrability of a Hamiltonian system holds for the nonlinear Schrodinger's equation by computing action-angle variables from the Poisson bracket, which is connected to the analysis of entries of the monodromy and transfer matrices. For the inhomogeneous six-vertex model, an approach for computing the action-angle variables is possible through formulating several relations between entries of the quantum monodromy, and transfer, matrices, which can be not only be further examined from the structure of $L$ operators, but also from computing several Poisson brackets parameterized from entries of the monodromy matrix.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13960v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Living organisms have developed advanced motion strategies for efficient space exploration, serving as inspiration for the movements of microrobots. These real-life strategies often involve anomalous dynamics displaying random movement patterns that deviate from Brownian motion. Despite their biological inspiration, autonomous stochastic navigation strategies of current microrobots remain much less versatile than those of their living counterparts. Supported by theoretical reasoning, this work demonstrates superparamagnetic colloidal microrobots with fully customizable stochastic dynamics displaying the entire spectrum of anomalous diffusion, from subdiffusion to superdiffusion, across statistically significant spatial and temporal scales (covering at least two decades). By simultaneously tuning microrobots' step-length distribution and, critically, their velocity autocorrelation function with magnetic fields, fundamental anomalous dynamics are reproduced with tailored properties mimicking L\'evy walks and fractional Brownian motion. These findings pave the way for programmable microrobotic systems that replicate optimal stochastic navigation strategies found in nature for applications in medical robotics and environmental remediation.</description>

Abstract: The dynamics of nonlocally coupled dissipative kicked rotors is rich and complex. In this study, we consider a network of rotors where each interacts equally with a certain range of its neighbors. We focus on the influence of the coupling strength and the coupling range, and show both analytically and numerically the critical transitions in the phase diagram, which include bifurcations of simple spatiotemporal patterns and changes in basin sizes of coherent states with different wavenumbers. We highlight that this diagram is fundamentally different from those found in other coupled systems such as in coupled logistic maps or Lorenz systems. Finally, we show an interesting domain-wall phenomenon in the coupled chaotic rotors, where a super-long transient interface state (partially regular and partially chaotic) is observed and can persist exponentially long as the coupling range increases up to a critical threshold.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03115v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The stability of localization in the presence of interactions remains an open problem, with finite-size effects posing significant challenges to numerical studies. In this work, we investigate the perturbative stability of noninteracting localization under weak interactions, which allows us to analyze much larger system sizes. Focusing on disordered Anderson and quasiperiodic Aubry-Andr\'e models in one dimension, and using the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP) at first order in perturbation theory, we compute first-order corrections to noninteracting local integrals of motion (LIOMs). We find that for at least an $O(1)$ fraction of the LIOMs, the corrections are well-controlled and converge at large system sizes, while others suffer from resonances. Additionally, we introduce and study the charge-transport capacity of this weakly interacting model. To first order, we find that the charge transport capacity remains bounded in the presence of interactions. Taken together, these results demonstrate that localization is perturbatively stable to weak interactions at first order, implying that, at the very least, localization persists for parametrically long times in the inverse interaction strength. We expect this perturbative stability to extend to all orders at sufficiently strong disorder, where the localization length is short, representing the true localized phase. Conversely, our findings suggest that the previously proposed interaction-induced avalanche instability, namely in the weakly localized regime of the Anderson and Aubry-Andr\'e models, is a more subtle phenomenon arising only at higher orders in perturbation theory or through nonperturbative effects.</description>

      <title>Emergence: from physics to biology, sociology, and computer science</title>

Abstract: Many systems involve numerous interacting parts and the whole system can have properties that the individual parts do not. I take this novelty as the defining characteristic of an emergent property. Other characteristics associated with emergence discussed include universality, order, complexity, unpredictability, irreducibility, diversity, self-organisation, discontinuities, and singularities. Emergent phenomena are widespread across physics, biology, social sciences, and computing, and are central to major scientific and societal challenges. Understanding emergence involves considering the stratification of reality across different scales (energy, time, length, complexity), each with its distinct ontology and epistemology, leading to semi-autonomous scientific disciplines. A central challenge is bridging the gap between macroscopic emergent properties and microscopic component interactions. Identifying an intermediate mesoscopic scale where new, weakly interacting entities or modular structures emerge is key. Theoretical approaches, such as effective theories (describing phenomena at a specific scale) and toy models (simplified systems for analysis), are vital. The Ising model exemplifies how toy models can elucidate emergence characteristics. Emergence is central to condensed matter physics, chaotic systems, fluid dynamics, nuclear physics, quantum gravity, neural networks, protein folding, and social segregation. An emergent perspective should influence scientific strategy by shaping research questions, methodologies, priorities, and resource allocation. An elusive goal is the design and control of emergent properties.</description>

      <title>An introduction to Markovian open quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26530</link>

Abstract: This is a concise, pedagogical introduction to the dynamic field of open quantum systems governed by Markovian master equations. We focus on the mathematical and physical origins of the widely used Lindblad equation, its unraveling in terms of stochastic pure-state trajectories and the corresponding continuous measurement protocols, the structure of steady states with emphasis on the role of symmetry and conservation laws, and a sampling of the novel physical phenomena that arise from nonunitary dynamics (dissipation and measurements). This is far from a comprehensive summary of the field. Rather, the objective is to provide a conceptual foundation and physically illuminating examples that are useful to graduate students and researchers entering this subject. There are exercise problems and references for further reading throughout the notes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the limit of the Lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann form describing the Entanglement Hamiltonian: A quantum Monte Carlo study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.00950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The entanglement Hamiltonian (EH) encapsulates the essential entanglement properties of a quantum many-body system and serves as a powerful theoretical construct. From the EH, one can extract a variety of entanglement quantities, such as entanglement entropies, negativity, and the entanglement spectrum. However, its general analytical form remains largely unknown. While the Bisognano-Wichmann theorem gives an exact EH form for Lorentz-invariant field theories, its validity on lattice systems is limited, especially when Lorentz invariance is absent. In this work, we propose a general scheme based on the lattice-Bisognano-Wichmann (LBW) ansatz and multi-replica-trick quantum Monte Carlo methods to numerically reconstruct the entanglement Hamiltonian in two-dimensional systems and systematically explore its applicability to systems without translational invariance, going beyond the original scope of the primordial Bisognano-Wichmann theorem. Various quantum phases--including gapped and gapless phases, critical points, and phases with either discrete or continuous symmetry breaking--are investigated, demonstrating the versatility of our method in reconstructing entanglement Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we find that when the entanglement boundary of a system is ordinary (i.e., free from surface anomalies), the LBW ansatz provides an accurate approximation well beyond Lorentz-invariant cases. Our work thus establishes a general framework for investigating the analytical structure of entanglement in complex quantum many-body systems.</description>
