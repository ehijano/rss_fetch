      <title>A Remark On Case-Gursky-V\'etois identity and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the works of Gursky (CMP, 1997), V\'etois (Potential Anal., 2023) and Case (Crelle's journal, 2024), we make use of an Obata type formula established in these works to obtain some Liouville type theorems on conformally Einstein manifolds. In particular, we solve Hang-Yang conjecture (IMRN, 2020) via an Obata-type argument and obtain optimal perturbation.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities on non-compact Euclidean submanifolds: sharpness and rigidity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper is devoted to provide Michael-Simon-type $L^p$-logarithmic-Sobolev inequalities on complete, not necessarily compact $n$-dimensional submanifolds $\Sigma$ of the Euclidean space $\mathbb R^{n+m}$. Our first result, stated for $p=2$, is sharp, it is valid on general submanifolds, and it involves the mean curvature of $\Sigma$. It implies in particular the main result of S. Brendle [Comm. Pure Appl. Math.}, 2022]. In addition, it turns out that equality can only occur if and only if $\Sigma$ is isometric to the Euclidean space $\mathbb R^{n}$ and the extremizer is a Gaussian. The second result is a general $L^p$-logarithmic-Sobolev inequality for $p\geq 2$ on Euclidean submanifolds with constants that are codimension-free in case of minimal submanifolds. In order to prove the above results - especially, to deal with the equality cases - we elaborate the theory of optimal mass transport on submanifolds between measures that are not necessarily compactly supported. Applications are provided to sharp hypercontractivity estimates of Hopf-Lax semigroups on submanifolds. The first hypercontractivity estimate is for general submanifolds with bounded mean curvature vector, the second one is for self-similar shrinkers endowed with the natural Gaussian measure. The equality cases are characterized here as well.</description>

      <title>Mass, Conformal Capacity, and the Volumetric Penrose Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a smooth, bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^3$ diffeomorphic to a ball. Consider $M = \mathbb{R}^3 \setminus \Omega$ equipped with an asymptotically flat metric $g = f^4 g_{\text{euc}}$, where $f\to 1$ at infinity. Assume that $g$ has non-negative scalar curvature and that $\Sigma = \partial M$ is a minimal 2-sphere in the $g$ metric. We prove a sharp inequality relating the ADM mass of $M$ with the conformal capacity of $\Omega$. As a corollary, we deduce a sharp lower bound for the ADM mass of $M$ in terms of the Euclidean volume of $\Omega$. We also prove a stability type result for this ``volumetric Penrose inequality.'' The proofs are based on a monotonicity formula holding along the level sets of a 3-harmonic function.</description>

      <title>K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers and Fano fibrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we build connections between K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers, i.e., complete (possibly non-compact) shrinking gradient K\"ahler-Ricci solitons, and algebraic geometry. In particular, we (1). prove that a K\"ahler-Ricci shrinker is naturally a quasi-projective variety, using birational algebraic geometry; (2). formulate a conjecture relating the existence of K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers and K-stability of polarized Fano fibrations, which unifies and extends the YTD type conjectures for K\"ahler-Einstein metrics, Ricci-flat K\"ahler cone metrics and compact K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers; (3). formulate conjectures connecting tangent flows at singularities of K\"ahler-Ricci flows and algebraic geometry, via a 2-step degeneration for the weighted volume of a Fano fibration.</description>

      <title>The odd-dimensional long neck problem via spectral flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a scalar-mean curvature comparison theorem for the long neck problem on odd-dimensional spin manifolds. This extends previous work of Cecchini and Zeidler, and gives a complete answer to Gromov's long neck problem in terms of spin manifolds. As a related question, we prove a quantitative version of Llarull's theorem on non-compact spin manifolds. Our results are derived by studying the spectral flow of a family of Callias operators.</description>

      <title>Geometry and periods of $G_2$-moduli spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the geometry the moduli space $\mathscr{M}$ of torsion-free $G_2$-structures on a compact $G_2$-manifold $M$, equipped with the volume-normalised $L^2$-metric $\mathscr{G}$. When $b^1(M) = 0$, this metric is known to be of Hessian type and to admit a global potential. Here we give a new description of the geometry of $\mathscr{M}$, based on the observation that there is a natural way to immerse the moduli space into a homogeneous space $D$ diffeomorphic to $GL(n+1)/ (\{\pm 1\} \times O(n))$, where $n = b^3(M) - 1$. We point out that the formal properties of this immersion $\Phi : \mathscr{M} \rightarrow D$ are very similar to those of the period map defined on the moduli spaces of Calabi--Yau threefolds. With a view to understand the curvatures of $\mathscr{G}$, we also derive a new formula for the fourth derivative of the potential and relate it to the second fundamental form of $\Phi(\mathscr{M}) \subset D$.</description>

      <title>An Invariant for Transverse Coassociative 4-Folds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10193v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a $\mathbb{Z}_2$-valued invariant for pairs of transverse coassociative submanifolds of a $G_2$-manifold when they are simply-connected and spin. We prove that there is a canonical generalized connected sum of two transverse coassociatives whose diffeomorphism type is determined by this invariant. When one of these coassociatives is graphical over the other, we show that this invariant is analogous to the invariant associated to the zero-circles of a near-symplectic form on an oriented 4-manifold.</description>

      <title>Conformal geometry of quasi-umbilical timelike surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper focuses on the conformal Lorentz geometry of quasi-umbilical timelike surfaces in the $(1+2)$-Einstein universe, the conformal compactification of Minkowski 3-space realized as the space of oriented null lines through the origin of $\mathbb{R}^{2,3}$. A timelike immersion of a surface $X$ in the Einstein universe is quasi-umbilical if its shape operator at any point of $X$ is non-diagonalizable over the complex numbers. We prove that quasi-umbilical surfaces are isothermic, that their conformal deformations depend on one arbitrary function in one variable, and show that their conformal Gauss map is harmonic. We then investigate their geometric structure and show how to construct all quasi-umbilical surfaces from null curves in the 4-dimensional neutral space form $S^{2,2}$.</description>

      <title>Partial AHS-Structures, their Cartan description and partial BGG sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10410v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: G-structures and Cartan geometries are two major approaches to the description of geometric structures (in the sense of differential geometry) on manifolds of some fixed dimension $n$. We show that both descriptions naturally extend to the setting of manifolds of dimension $\geq n$ which are endowed with a distinguished involutive distribution $F$ of rank $n$. The resulting ``partial'' structures are most naturally interpreted as smooth families of standard G-structures or Cartan geometries on the leaves of the foliation defined by $F$.
  We prove that for the special class of AHS-structures (also known as $|1|$-graded parabolic geometries) the construction of a canonical Cartan geometry associated to a G-structure extends to this general setting. As an application, we prove that for partial AHS-structures there is an analog of the machinery of BGG sequences. This constructs sequences of differential operators of arbitrarily high order intrinsic to the structures. Under appropriate flatness conditions, these sequence are fine resolutions of sheaves which locally can be realized as pullbacks of sheaves on local leaf spaces for the foliation defined by $F$.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Lie algebras admitting regular semisimple algebraic Nijenhuis operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to classify all real and complex 3-dimensional Lie algebras admitting regular semisimple algebraic Nijenhuis operators. This problem is completely solved (see Theorems 2 and 3) by describing all Nijenhuis eigenbases for each 3-dimensional Lie algebra. It turns out that the answer is different in real and complex cases in the sence that there are real Lie algebras such that they do not admit an algebraic Nijenhuis operator, but their complexification admits such operators. An equally interesting question is to describe all algebraic Nijenhuis operators which are not equivalent by an automorphism of the Lie algebra. We give an answer to this question for some Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Streets-Tian Conjecture holds for 2-step solvmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Hermitian-symplectic metric is a Hermitian metric whose K\"ahler form is given by the $(1,1)$-part of a closed $2$-form. Streets-Tian Conjecture states that a compact complex manifold admitting a Hermitian-symplectic metric must be K\"ahlerian (i.e., admitting a K\"ahler metric). The conjecture is known to be true in dimension $2$ but is still open in dimensions $3$ or higher. In this article, we confirm the conjecture for all 2-step solvmanifolds, namely, compact quotients of 2-step solvable Lie groups by discrete subgroups. In the proofs, we adopted a method of using special {\em non-unitary} frames, which enabled us to squeeze out some hidden symmetries to make the proof go through. Hopefully the technique could be further applied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of metrics on Euclidean space that generalize the left-invariant metric of the SOL group and the metric of the logarithmic model of Hyperbolic space. Suppose G is a connected, simply-connected, Heintze group of Abelian type with diagonalizable derivation or the horospherical product of two such groups. In this scenario, G is isometric to Euclidean space with a metric of the type considered. We have derived a formula for the volume entropy of metrics in this family and used it to solve a conjecture related to a family of 3-manifolds that interpolates between the SOL group and hyperbolic space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $A^-$ and $A^+$ be properly immersed closed locally convex subsets of a Riemannian manifold $M$ with pinched negative sectional curvature. When the Bowen-Margulis measure on $T^1M$ is finite and mixing for the geodesic flow, we prove that the Lebesgue measures along the common perpendiculars of length at most $t$ from $A^-$ to $A^+$, counted with multiplicities and lifted to $T^1M$, equidistribute to the Bowen-Margulis measure as $t\to+\infty$. When $M$ is locally symmetric with finite volume and the geodesic flow is exponentially mixing, we give an error term for the asymptotic. When $T^1M$ is endowed with a bounded H\"older-continuous potential, and when the associated equilibrium state is finite and mixing for the geodesic flow, we prove the equidistribution of these Lebesgue measures weighted by the amplitudes of the potential to the equilibrium state.</description>

Abstract: We study the Fubini-Study currents and equilibrium metrics of continuous Hermitian metrics on sequences of holomorphic line bundles over a fixed compact K\"ahler manifold. We show that the difference between the Fubini-Study currents and the curvature of the equilibrium metric, when appropriately scaled, converges to 0 in the sense of currents. As a consequence, we obtain sufficient conditions for the scaled Fubini-Study currents to converge weakly.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be a relatively compact $C^2$ domain in a complex manifold $\mathcal M$ of dimension $n$. Assume that $H^{1}(M,\Theta)=0$ where $\Theta$ is the sheaf of germs of holomorphic tangent fields of $M$. Suppose that the Levi-form of the boundary of $M$ has at least 3 negative eigenvalues or at least $n-1$ positive eigenvalues pointwise. We will first construct a homotopy formula for $\Theta$-valued $(0,1)$-forms on $\overline M$. We then apply a Nash-Moser iteration scheme to show that if a formally integrable almost complex structure of the H\"{o}lder-Zygmund class $\Lambda^r$ on $\overline M$ is sufficiently close to the complex structure on $ M$ in the H\"{o}lder-Zygmund norm $\Lambda^{r_0}(\overline M)$ for some $r_0&gt;5/2$, then there is a diffeomorphism $F$ from $\overline M$ into $\mathcal M$ that transforms the almost complex structure into the complex structure on $F(M)$, where $F \in \Lambda^s(M)$ for all $s&lt;r+1/2$.</description>

      <title>Structured Regularization for Constrained Optimization on the SPD Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Matrix-valued optimization tasks, including those involving symmetric positive definite (SPD) matrices, arise in a wide range of applications in machine learning, data science and statistics. Classically, such problems are solved via constrained Euclidean optimization, where the domain is viewed as a Euclidean space and the structure of the matrices (e.g., positive definiteness) enters as constraints. More recently, geometric approaches that leverage parametrizations of the problem as unconstrained tasks on the corresponding matrix manifold have been proposed. While they exhibit algorithmic benefits in many settings, they cannot directly handle additional constraints, such as inequality or sparsity constraints. A remedy comes in the form of constrained Riemannian optimization methods, notably, Riemannian Frank-Wolfe and Projected Gradient Descent. However, both algorithms require potentially expensive subroutines that can introduce computational bottlenecks in practise. To mitigate these shortcomings, we introduce a class of structured regularizers, based on symmetric gauge functions, which allow for solving constrained optimization on the SPD manifold with faster unconstrained methods. We show that our structured regularizers can be chosen to preserve or induce desirable structure, in particular convexity and "difference of convex" structure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Constraints on embedded spheres and real projective planes in 4-manifolds from Seiberg-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the Seiberg-Witten invariants of branched covers of prime degree, where the branch locus consists of embedded spheres. Aside from the formula itself, our calculations give rise to some new constraints on configurations of embedded spheres in 4-manifolds. Using similar methods, we also obtain new constraints on embeddings of real projective planes and spheres with a cusp singularity. Moreover, we show that the existence of certain configurations of surfaces would give rise to 4-manifolds of non-simple type. Our proof makes use of equivariant Seiberg-Witten invariants as well as a gluing formula for the relative Seiberg-Witten invariants of 4-manifolds with positive scalar curvature boundary.</description>

      <title>Variational autoencoders with latent high-dimensional steady geometric flows for dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop Riemannian approaches to variational autoencoders (VAEs) for PDE-type ambient data with regularizing geometric latent dynamics, which we refer to as VAE-DLM, or VAEs with dynamical latent manifolds. We redevelop the VAE framework such that manifold geometries, subject to a geometric flow, embedded in Euclidean space are learned in the intermediary latent space developed by encoders and decoders. We reformulate the traditional evidence lower bound (ELBO) loss with a considerate choice of prior. We develop a linear geometric flow with a steady-state regularizing term. This geometric flow requires only automatic differentiation of one time derivative, and can be solved in moderately high dimensions in a physics-informed approach, allowing more expressive latent representations. We discuss how this flow can be formulated as a gradient flow, and maintains entropy away from metric singularity. This, along with an eigenvalue penalization condition, helps ensure the manifold is sufficiently large in measure, nondegenerate, and a canonical geometry, which contribute to a robust representation. Our methods focus on the modified multi-layer perceptron architecture with tanh activations for the manifold encoder-decoder. We demonstrate, on our datasets of interest, our methods perform at least as well as the traditional VAE, and oftentimes better. Our methods can outperform a standard VAE and a VAE endowed with our proposed architecture by up to 25% reduction in out-of-distribution (OOD) error and potentially greater. We highlight our method on ambient PDEs whose solutions maintain minimal variation in late times over its solution. Our approaches are particularly favorable with severe OOD effect. We provide empirical justification towards how latent Riemannian manifolds improve robust learning for external dynamics with VAEs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article we obtain a nonlocal version of the Alexandrov Theorem which asserts that the only set with sufficiently smooth boundary and of constant nonlocal mean curvature is an Euclidean ball. We consider a general nonlocal mean curvature given by a radial and monotone kernel and we formulate an easy-to-check condition which is necessary and sufficient for the nonlocal version of the Alexandrov Theorem to hold in the treated context. Our definition encompasses numerous examples of various nonlocal mean curvatures that have been already studied in the literature. To prove the main result we obtain a specific formula for the tangential derivative of the nonlocal mean curvature and combine it with an application of the method of moving planes.</description>

Abstract: We prove the short-time existence of Ricci flows on complete manifolds with scalar curvature bounded below uniformly, Ricci curvature bounded below by a negative quadratic function, and with almost Euclidean isoperimetric inequality holds locally. In particular, this result applies to manifolds with both Ricci curvature and injectivity radius bounded from below. We also study the short-time behaviour of these solutions which may have unbounded curvature at the initial time, and provide some applications. A key tool is Perelman's pseudolocality theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05306v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second author and H. Yin have developed a Ricci flow existence theory that gives a complete Ricci flow starting with a surface equipped with a conformal structure and a nonatomic Radon measure as a conformal factor. This led to the discovery of a large array of new expanding Ricci solitons. In this paper we use the recent uniqueness theory in this context, also developed by the second author and H. Yin, to give a complete classification of all expanding Ricci solitons on surfaces. Along the way, we prove a converse to the existence theory that is not constrained to solitons: every complete Ricci flow on a surface over a time interval $(0,\varepsilon)$ admits a $t\downarrow 0$ limit within the class of admissible initial data. This makes surfaces the first nontrivial setting for Ricci flow in which a bijection can be given between the entire set of complete Ricci flows over maximal time intervals $(0,T)$, and a class of initial data that induces them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17726v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the notion of magnetic curvature recently introduced by the first author, we extend E. Hopf's theorem to the setting of magnetic systems. Namely, we prove that if the magnetic flow on the s-sphere bundle is without conjugate points, then the total magnetic curvature is non-positive, and vanishes if and only if the magnetic system is magnetically flat. We then prove that magnetic flatness is a rigid condition, in the sense that it only occurs when either the magnetic form is trivial and the metric is flat, or when the magnetic system is K\"ahler, the metric has constant negative sectional holomorphic curvature, and s equals the Ma\~n\'e critical value.</description>

Certain warped product manifolds, with 2-dimensional base, and in particular some spacetimes, are such 2-quasi Einstein manifolds.</description>

Abstract: In [2], it is observed that if in the twistor space associated with an oriented vector bundle of rank $4$ over $T^2$ with a positive-definite metric and a metric connection, the horizontality has infinite complexity derived from one of the cases studied in [1], then the complexity is expressed by a dense subset of $S^2$. In the present paper, it is observed that in such a situation, the topological holonomy group is dense in $SO(3)$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce the notions of \textit{conformal barycenter} and \textit{holomorphic barycenter} of a measurable set $D$ in the hyperbolic ball. The two barycenters coincide in the disk, but they differ in multidimensional balls $\mathbb{C}^m \cong \mathbb{R}^{2m}$. These notions are counterparts of barycenters of measures on spheres, introduced by Douady and Earle in 1986.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the differential geometry properties of focal surfaces of lightcone framed surfaces in Lorentz-Minkowski 3-space. In general, a mixed type surface is a connected regular surface with non-empty spacelike and timelike point sets. In order to investigate the mixed type surface with singular points, we introduce the lightcone framed surface. First, we give the lightcone frame, by which we define the lightcone framed surface. Next, we consider the differential geometry properties of lightcone framed surfaces by using the lightcone frame. At last, we give the definition of focal surfaces of lightcone framed surfaces and investigate the differential geometry properties of focal surfaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.18695v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a simply-connected closed manifold $X$ of $\dim X \neq 4$, the mapping class group $\pi_0(\mathrm{Diff}(X))$ is known to be finitely generated. We prove that analogous finite generation fails in dimension 4. Namely, we show that there exist simply-connected closed smooth 4-manifolds whose mapping class groups are not finitely generated. More generally, for each $k&gt;0$, we prove that there are simply-connected closed smooth 4-manifolds $X$ for which $H_k(B\mathrm{Diff}(X);\mathbb{Z})$ are not finitely generated. The infinitely generated subgroup of $H_k(B\mathrm{Diff}(X);\mathbb{Z})$ which we detect are topologically trivial, and unstable under the connected sum of $S^2 \times S^2$. The proof uses characteristic classes obtained from Seiberg-Witten theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.07328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Factorization structures occur in toric differential and discrete geometry, and can be viewed in multiple ways, e.g., as objects determining substantial classes of explicit toric Sasaki and K\"ahler geometries, as special coordinates on such, or as an apex generalisation of cyclic polytopes featuring a generalised Gale's evenness condition. This article presents a comprehensive study of factorization structures. It establishes their structure theory and introduces their use in the geometry of cones and polytopes. The article explains the construction of polytopes and cones compatible with a given factorization structure, and exemplifies it for product Segre-Veronese and Veronese factorization structures, where the latter case includes cyclic polytopes. Further, it derives the generalised Gale's evenness condition for compatible cones, polytopes and their duals, and explicitly describes faces of these. Factorization structures naturally provide generalised Vandermonde identities, which relate normals of any compatible polytope, and which are used for Veronese factorization structure to find examples of Delzant and rational Delzant compatible polytopes. The article offers a myriad of factorization structure examples, which are later characterised to be precisely factorization structures with decomposable curves, and raises the question if these encompass all factorization structures, i.e., the existence of an indecomposable factorization curve.</description>

      <title>A mathematical framework of intelligence and consciousness based on Riemannian Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11024v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding intelligence is a central pursuit in neuroscience, cognitive science, and artificial intelligence. Intelligence encompasses learning, problem-solving, creativity, and even consciousness. Recent advancements in geometric analysis have revealed new insights into high-dimensional information representation and organisation, exposing intrinsic data structures and dynamic processes within neural and artificial systems. However, a comprehensive framework that unifies the static and dynamic aspects of intelligence is still lacking. This manuscript proposes a mathematical framework based on Riemannian geometry to describe the structure and dynamics of intelligence and consciousness. Intelligence elements are conceptualised as tokens embedded in a high-dimensional space. The learned token embeddings capture the interconnections of tokens across various scenarios and tasks, forming manifolds in the intelligence space. Thought flow is depicted as the sequential activation of tokens along geodesics within these manifolds. During the navigation of geodesics, consciousness, as a self-referential process, perceives the thought flow, evaluates it against predictions, and provides feedback through prediction errors, adjusting the geodesic: non-zero prediction errors, such as learning, lead to the restructuring of the curved manifolds, thus changing the geodesic of thought flow. This dynamic interaction integrates new information, evolves the geometry and facilitates learning. The geometry of intelligence guides consciousness, and consciousness structures the geometry of intelligence. By integrating geometric concepts, this proposed theory offers a unified, mathematically framework for describing the structure and dynamics of intelligence and consciousness. Applicable to biological and artificial intelligence, this framework may pave the way for future research and empirical validation.</description>

Abstract: We give explicit formulas and asymptotics for the distribution of the index of the Brownian loop in the following geometrical settings: the complex projective line from which two points have been removed; the complex hyperbolic line from which one point has been removed; the odd dimensional spheres from which a great hypersphere has been removed; and the complex anti-de Sitter spaces. Our analysis is based on the geometry of the Hopf and anti-de Sitter fibrations, and on the relationship between winding and area forms.</description>
