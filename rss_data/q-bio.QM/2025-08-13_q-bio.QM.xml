      <title>An Interactive Platform for Unified Assessment of Drug-Drug Interactions Using Descriptive and Pharmacokinetic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Drug-drug interactions (DDIs) are a major concern in polypharmacy. Public databases often provide only qualitative descriptions without pharmacokinetic context. We present an interactive web tool that integrates 191,541 descriptive DDI records from DrugBank with 3,779 AUC-based interactions from the PK-DDIP dataset, extracted from FDA-approved drug labeling (DailyMed) using natural language processing and manual verification. Using multi-step name harmonization (exact, fuzzy, synonym expansion, manual curation), 1,803 interaction pairs were unified across 639 overlapping compounds. The platform is built with Streamlit and offers smart drug search, color-coded output, and real-time response. It enables users to explore both descriptive and pharmacokinetic data, supporting research and education in clinical pharmacology and drug safety. This research prototype is not intended for clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Language Models Can Understand Spectra: A Multimodal Model for Molecular Structure Elucidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08441v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structure elucidation is a fundamental technique for understanding the microscopic composition of matter and is widely applied across various disciplines in the natural sciences and engineering. However, existing methods often rely heavily on prior databases or known structural information, making it difficult to resolve unknown structures. In addition, complex structures typically require the joint analysis of multiple spectroscopic modalities. This process heavily depends on expert domain knowledge and is often accompanied by high costs in terms of both time and instrumentation. To address these challenges, we propose SpectraLLM, the first large language model designed to support multi-modal spectroscopic joint reasoning. SpectraLLM is capable of processing either single or multiple spectroscopic inputs and performing end-to-end structure elucidation. By integrating continuous and discrete spectroscopic modalities into a shared semantic space, SpectraLLM learns to uncover substructural patterns that are consistent and complementary across spectra, enabling precise molecular structure elucidation. We pretrain and fine-tune SpectraLLM in the domain of small molecules, and evaluate it on six standardized, publicly available chemical datasets. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing approaches trained on single modalities. Notably, SpectraLLM demonstrates strong robustness and generalization even for single-spectrum inference, while its multi-modal reasoning capability further improves the accuracy of structural prediction.</description>

      <title>HSA-Net: Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Framework for Efficient and Scalable Molecular Language Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08334v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem, where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network (HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP) module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the direct and indirect impact of COVID-19 vaccination: evidence from Victoria, Australia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vaccines not only directly protect vaccinated individuals but also contribute to protect the entire population via indirect herd-immunity benefits. However, researchers have long struggled to quantify these indirect effects at the population level, hindering assessment of vaccination program effectiveness. We developed a new method to estimate these effects, thereby markedly improving measures of the number of infections, hospitalizations, and deaths averted by vaccination. Our population-based analysis of 6,440,000 residents of Victoria, Australia reveal strong indirect effects during the Delta outbreak (September-November 2021). By modelling a non-vaccination counterfactual, we conservatively estimate 316,000 infections were averted (95\% BCI: 232k-406k), as well as 33,500 hospitalizations (95\% BCI: 22.2k-46.2k), and 4,900 deaths (95\% BCI: 2.9k-7.3k). These are 4.0, 7.5, and 8.0 times higher, respectively, than observed. Half of the averted infections and around one-quarter of hospitalizations and deaths were attributable to indirect protection. Homogeneous vaccination across LGAs could have reduced outcomes by approximately 25\%.</description>

      <title>A control theoretical approach to gene regulation raises quantitative constraints for dynamic homeostasis in stochastic gene expression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cell phenotype dynamic homeostasis contrasts with the inherent randomness of intracellular reactions. Although feedback control of master regulatory genes (MRG) is a key strategy for maintaining gene network expression ranges limited, understanding the quantitative constraints and corresponding mechanisms enabling such a dynamic stability under noise remains elusive. Here we model MRG expression as a stochastic process and downstream genes as sensors which response conditionally induce MRG activity. We show that at homeostatic regime: i. the trajectories of the MRG expression levels can be adjusted towards specific ranges using both the exact solutions of the stochastic model and the exact stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA); ii. there exists a sampling rate which optimizes the feedback control of the MRG activity, and non-optimal controls resulting in alternative homeostatic dynamics; iii. the feedback control of MRG activity leads to updates which intensities and time intervals are non-linearly related; iv. the ON state probability of an MRG promoter has dynamics confined within a narrow domain. Our results help to understand the quantitative constraints underpinning dynamic homeostasis despite randomness, the mechanisms underlying alternative, non-optimal, homeostatic regimes, and may be useful for theoretically prototyping therapies aiming at gene networks modulation.</description>

      <title>Quantitative evaluation of methods to analyze motion changes in single-particle experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.18100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.18100v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analysis of live-cell single-molecule imaging experiments can reveal valuable information about the heterogeneity of transport processes and interactions between cell components. These characteristics are seen as motion changes in the particle trajectories. Despite the existence of multiple approaches to carry out this type of analysis, no objective assessment of these methods has been performed so far. Here, we report the results of a competition to characterize and rank the performance of these methods when analyzing the dynamic behavior of single molecules. To run this competition, we implemented a software library that simulates realistic data corresponding to widespread diffusion and interaction models, both in the form of trajectories and videos obtained in typical experimental conditions. The competition constitutes the first assessment of these methods, providing insights into the current limitations of the field, fostering the development of new approaches, and guiding researchers to identify optimal tools for analyzing their experiments.</description>

      <title>Chemist-aligned retrosynthesis by ensembling diverse inductive bias models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05269v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chemical synthesis remains a critical bottleneck in the discovery and manufacture of functional small molecules. AI-based synthesis planning models could be a potential remedy to find effective syntheses, and have made progress in recent years. However, they still struggle with less frequent, yet critical reactions for synthetic strategy, as well as hallucinated, incorrect predictions. This hampers multi-step search algorithms that rely on models, and leads to misalignment with chemists' expectations. Here we propose RetroChimera: a frontier retrosynthesis model, built upon two newly developed components with complementary inductive biases, which we fuse together using a new framework for integrating predictions from multiple sources via a learning-based ensembling strategy. Through experiments across several orders of magnitude in data scale and splitting strategy, we show RetroChimera outperforms all major models by a large margin, demonstrating robustness outside the training data, as well as for the first time the ability to learn from even a very small number of examples per reaction class. Moreover, industrial organic chemists prefer predictions from RetroChimera over the reactions it was trained on in terms of quality, revealing high levels of alignment. Finally, we demonstrate zero-shot transfer to an internal dataset from a major pharmaceutical company, showing robust generalization under distribution shift. With the new dimension that our ensembling framework unlocks, we anticipate further acceleration in the development of even more accurate models.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unified Framework for Determining Conformational Ensembles of Disordered Proteins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disordered proteins play essential roles in myriad cellular processes, yet their structural characterization remains a major challenge due to their dynamic and heterogeneous nature. We here present a community-driven initiative to address this problem by advocating a unified framework for determining conformational ensembles of disordered proteins. Our aim is to integrate state-of-the-art experimental techniques with advanced computational methods, including knowledge-based sampling, enhanced molecular dynamics, and machine learning models. The modular framework comprises three interconnected components: experimental data acquisition, computational ensemble generation, and validation. The systematic development of this framework will ensure the accurate and reproducible determination of conformational ensembles of disordered proteins. We highlight the open challenges necessary to achieve this goal, including force field accuracy, efficient sampling, and environmental dependency, advocating for collaborative benchmarking and standardized protocols.</description>
