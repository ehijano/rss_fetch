      <title>Investigating radioactivity in soil samples from neutral and vegetation land of Punjab/India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, radioactivity investigations of soil samples from neutral and agricultural sites in Punjab/India have been carried out to study the impact of land use patterns. The analysis of radiological, mineralogical, physicochemical, and morphological attributes of soil samples has been performed employing state-of-the-art techniques. The mean activity concentration of 238U, 232Th, 40K, 235U, and 137Cs, measured using a carbon-loaded p-type HPGe detector, in neutral land was observed as 58.03, 83.95, 445.18, 2.83, and 1.16Bq kg-1, respectively. However, in vegetation land, it was found to be 40.07, 64.68, 596.74, 2.26 and 2.11Bq kg-1, respectively. In the detailed activity analysis, radium equivalent (Raeq) radioactivity is found to be in the safe prescribed limit of 370Bq kg-1 for all investigated soil samples. However, the dosimetric investigations revealed that the outdoor absorbed gamma dose rate (96.08nGy h-1) and consequent annual effective dose rate (0.12mSv y-1) for neutral land, and the gamma dose rate (82.46nGy h-1) and subsequent annual effective dose rate (0.10mSv y-1) for vegetation land marginally exceeded the global average. The surface morphology of neutral land favored more compactness, while agricultural land favored high porosity. Various heavy metals of health concern, namely As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Hg, Pb, Se, and Zn, were also evaluated in all soil samples using Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectroscopy (ICP-MS). Pollution Load Index (PLI) and Ecological Risk Index (RI) revealed that vegetation land was more anthropogenically contaminated than neutral land, with maximum contamination from Hg and As.</description>

      <title>Head-Independent Time-Invariant Infiltration Rate in Aquifer Recharge with Treated Municipal Wastewater</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Means to increase water resources are essential in regions grappling with water scarcity and growing populations. Soil aquifer treatment (SAT) is a cheap, low maintenance, low-energy method to supply water for irrigation of crops consumed raw or even for drinking purposes. However, the most expensive cost-component of SATs is the land use, the infiltration basins the area of which is inversely proportional to the infiltration rate, the most important characteristic of SAT basins design and operation, which until now was believed to be time-dependent and, therefore, difficult to predict. Focusing on the Shafdan SAT in Israel as a showcase and using a decade's worth of data from 50 recharge basins, we study the time dependence of the infiltration rates. The study reveals a noteworthy consistency in the decline of effluent levels during the drainage phase across various flooding events, signifying a constant, head-independent infiltration rate. 97% of over 40,000 flooding events showed this behavior. Furthermore, the infiltration rate calculated in this manner provides good predictions of the average infiltration rate during the entire wetting phase.
  The water-level-independent infiltration rate is a general feature. It was found in all the 50 studied basins, regardless of the soil sand content, commissioning year, operation conditions and season. The constant infiltration rate law revealed in this study simplifies the prediction of the flooding cycle duration and will facilitate simplified predictive modeling of multiple basins SAT systems. Our research may extend beyond SAT systems, offering insights applicable to other managed aquifer recharge methods, crucial for effective water resource management, ensuring environmental compatibility.</description>

      <title>GeoFlood: Computational model for overland flooding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents GeoFlood, a new open-source software package for solving shallow water equations (SWE) on a quadtree hierarchy of mapped, logically Cartesian grids managed by the parallel, adaptive library ForestClaw (Calhoun and Burstedde, 2017). The GeoFlood model is validated using standard benchmark tests from Neelz and Pender (2013) and against George (2011) results obtained from the GeoClaw software (Clawpack Development Team, 2020) for the historical Malpasset dam failure problem. The benchmark test results are compared against GeoClaw and software package HEC-RAS (Hydraulic Engineering Center - River Analysis System, Army Corp of Engineers) results (Brunner, 2018). This comparison demonstrates the capability of GeoFlood to accurately and efficiently predict flood wave propagation on complex terrain. The results from comparisons with the Malpasset dam break show good agreement with the GeoClaw results and are consistent with the historical records of the event.</description>

      <title>The Directionality of Gravitational and Thermal Diffusive Transport in Geologic Fluid Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusive transport has implications for the long-term status of underground storage of hydrogen (H$_2$) fuel and carbon dioxide (CO$_2$), technologies which are being pursued to mitigate climate change and advance the energy transition. Once injected underground, CO$_2$ and H$_2$ will exist in multiphase fluid-water-rock systems: being partially-soluble, injected fluids can flow through the porous rack in a connected plume, become disconnected and trapped as ganglia surrounded by groundwater within the storage rock pore space, and also dissolve and migrate through the aqueous phase. Recent analyses have focused on the concentration gradients induced by differing capillary pressure between fluid ganglia which can drive diffusive transport ("Ostwald ripening"). However, studies have neglected or excessively simplified important factors; namely: the non-ideality of gases under geologic conditions, the opposing equilibrium state of dissolved CO$_2$ and H$_2$ driven by the partial molar density of dissolved solutes, and entropic and thermodiffusive effects resulting from geothermal gradients. We conduct an analysis from thermodynamic first principles and use this to provide numerical estimates at conditions relevant to underground storage reservoirs. We show that entropic contributions to the free energy are so significant as to cause a reversal in the direction of diffusive transport in systems with geothermal gradients. For CO$_2$, even geothermal gradients less than 10 C/km induce downwards diffusion at depths relevant to storage. Diffusive transport of H$_2$ is less affected, but still reverses direction under typical gradients. Contrary to previous studies, we find that in diffusion and convection will likely work in concert - both driving CO$_2$ downwards, and both driving H$_2$ upwards - for conditions representative of their respective storage reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the earth tides with a diamagnetic-levitated micro-oscillator at room temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precise measurement of the gravity of the earth plays a pivotal role in various fundamental research and application fields. Although a few gravimeters have been reported to achieve this goal, miniaturization of high-precision gravimetry remains a challenge. In this work, we have proposed and demonstrated a miniaturized gravimetry operating at room temperature based on a diamagnetic levitated micro-oscillator with a proof mass of only 215 mg. Compared with the latest reported miniaturized gravimeters based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems, the performance of our gravimetry has substantial improvements in that an acceleration sensitivity of 15 $\mu Gal/\sqrt{Hz}$ and a drift as low as 61 $\mu Gal$ per day have been reached. Based on this diamagnetic levitation gravimetry, we observed the earth tides, and the correlation coefficient between the experimental data and theoretical data reached 0.97. Some moderate foreseeable improvements can develop this diamagnetic levitation gravimetry into chip size device, making it suitable for mobile platforms such as drones. Our advancement in gravimetry is expected to facilitate a multitude of applications, including underground density surveying and the forecasting of natural hazards.</description>

      <title>A unified kinematic wave theory for melt infiltration into firn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the refreezing of melt water in firn we revisit the one-dimensional percolation of liquid water and non-reactive gas in porous ice. We analyze the dynamics of infiltration in the absence of capillary forces and heat conduction to understand the coupling between advective heat and mass transport in firn. In this limit, we formulate a kinematic wave theory that results in a 2X2-system of hyperbolic partial differential equations (PDEs) corresponding to the conservation of composition and enthalpy. For simple initial conditions (Riemann problems) this system admits self-similar solutions that illuminate the structure of melting/refreezing fronts and analytical solutions are provided for 12 basic cases of physical relevance encountered in the literature. Further we develop an extended kinematic theory that encompasses the cases when the firn saturates completely to form a perched water table governed by elliptic PDE so that the model is no longer fully hyperbolic (local). These solutions provide benchmarks for numerical models of melt infiltration into firn. They also provide insight into important physical processes such as the formation of frozen fringes, the perching of meltwater on pre-existing low porosity layers and the conditions required for impermeable ice lens formation. Lastly, these analytic solutions can be utilized to improve and compare the performance of the firn hydrology, ice-sheet and Earth system models. Our analysis provides a theoretical framework to understand these important processes in firn which affect the partitioning between meltwater infiltration and surface runoff and therefore determine the surface mass loss from ice sheets and its contribution to sea level rise.</description>

      <title>Target-oriented least-squares reverse-time migration with Marchenko redatuming and double-focusing: Field data application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16420v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the focus of reflection seismologists has shifted to applications where a high-resolution image of the subsurface is required. Least-Squares Reverse-Time Migration (LSRTM) is a common tool used to compute such images. Still, its high computational costs have led seismologists to use target-oriented LSRTM for imaging only a small target of interest within a larger subsurface block. Redatuming the data to the upper boundary of the target of interest is one approach to target-oriented LSRTM. Still, many redatuming methods cannot account for multiple scattering within the overburden. We apply a target-oriented least-squares reverse time migration algorithm that integrates Marchenko redatuming and double-focusing to a field dataset. This redatuming method accounts for all orders of multiple scattering in the overburden, thus improving the accuracy of target-oriented LSRTM. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of a double-focusing algorithm in reducing the data size by decreasing both spatial and temporal dimensions of the model and the data. The algorithm's performance is evaluated using field data acquired in the Norwegian Sea. The numerical results show that our target-oriented LSRTM algorithm can reduce the internal multiple effects and increase the resolution of the resulting image.</description>

      <title>Geophysical survey based on Hybrid Gravimetry using Relative Measurements and an Atomic Gravimeter as an Absolute Reference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.00415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravimetry is a versatile metrological approach in geophysics to accurately map subterranean mass and density anomalies. There is a broad diversification regarding the working principle of gravimeters, wherein atomic gravimeters are one of the most technologically progressive class of gravimeters which can monitor gravity at an absolute scale with a high-repetition without exhibiting drift. Despite the apparent utility for geophysical surveys, atomic gravimeters are (currently) laboratory-bound devices due to the vexatious task of transportation. Here, we demonstrated the utility of an atomic gravimeter on-site during a gravity survey, where the issue of immobility was circumvented with a relative spring gravimeter. The atomic gravimeter served as a means to map the relative data from the spring gravimeter to an absolute measurement with an effective precision of 7.7$\mu$Gal. Absolute measurements provide a robust and feasible method to define and control gravity data taken at different sites, or a later date, which is critical to analyze underground geological units, in particular when it is combined with other geophysical approaches.</description>
