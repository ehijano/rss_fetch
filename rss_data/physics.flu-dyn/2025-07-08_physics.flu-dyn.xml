      <title>Large-scale streak instabilities of transitional channel flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emergence of large-scale spatial modulations of turbulent channel flow, as the Reynolds number is decreased, is addressed numerically using the framework of linear stability analysis. Such modulations are known as the precursors of laminar-turbulent patterns found near the onset of relaminarisation. A synthetic two-dimensional base flow is constructed by adding finite-amplitude streaks to the turbulent mean flow. The streak mode is chosen as the leading resolvent mode from linear response theory. Besides, turbulent fluctuations can be taken into account or not by using a simple Cess eddy viscosity model. The linear stability of the base flow is considered by searching for detuned unstable eigenmodes, thereby allowing for large-scale modulations. As the streak amplitude is increased in the presence of the turbulent closure, the base flow loses its stability to a large-scale modulation below a critical Reynolds number value. The structure of the corresponding eigenmode, its critical Reynolds number, its critical angle and wavelengths are all fully consistent with the onset of turbulent modulations from the literature. The existence of a threshold value of the Reynolds number is directly related to the presence of an eddy viscosity, and is justified using an energy budget. The values of the critical streak amplitudes are discussed in relation with those relevant to turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>Vortex topology in the lee of a 6:1 prolate spheroid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A large scale parametric study of the flow over the prolate spheroid is presented to understand the effect of Reynolds number and angle of attack on the separation, the wake formation and the loads. Large-Eddy Simulation is performed for six Reynolds numbers ranging from Re = 0.15M to Re = 4M and for eight angles of attack ranging from 10 degrees to 90 degrees. For all the cases considered, the boundary layer separates symmetrically and forms a recirculation region. Several distinct flow topologies are observed that can be grouped into three categories: proto-vortex, coherent vortex and recirculating wake. In the proto-vortex state, the recirculation does not have a distinct center of rotation, instead, a two-layer detached flow structure is formed. In the coherent vortex state, the separated shear layer rolls into a three-dimensional vortex that is aligned with the axis of the spheroid. This vortex has a clear center of rotation corresponding to a minimum of pressure and transforms the azimuthal momentum from the separated shear layer into axial momentum. In the recirculating wake regime, the recirculation is incoherent and the primary separation forms a dissipative shear layer that is convected in the direction of the free-stream. This symmetric pair of shear layers bounds a low-momentum recirculating cavity on the leeward side of the spheroid. The properties of these states are not constant, but evolve along the axis of the spheroid and are dictated by the characteristics of the boundary layer at separation. The variation of the flow with Reynolds number and angle of attack is described, and its connection to the loads on the spheroid are discussed.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous stochasticity in the fluctuating Navier-Stokes equations on a logarithmic lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The predictability of turbulent flows remains a challenging problem for mathematicians, physicists, and meteorologists. In this context, we consider the 3D incompressible Navier-Stokes equations with small-scale random forcing on logarithmic lattices in Fourier space. Our goal is to probe the phenomenon of spontaneous stochasticity in this system, which means that its solutions remain stochastic in the limit of vanishing viscosity and noise. For this, we consider numerical simulations with increasing Reynolds numbers and vanishing noise amplitudes. Through measurements of statistics of individual large-scale Fourier modes, we verify the spontaneous stochasticity in two different setups: from rough initial data, and after a finite-time blowup of a strong solution. The convergence of probability density functions for distinct parameters suggests that the limiting solution is a universal stochastic process.</description>

      <title>Disentangling temperature and Reynolds number effects in quantum turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between viscous and frictional dissipation is key to understanding quantum turbulence dynamics in superfluid $^4$He. Based on a coarse-grained two-fluid description, an original scale-by-scale energy budget that identifies each scale's contribution to energy dissipation is derived. Using the Hall-Vinen-Bekharevich-Khalatnikov (HVBK) model to further characterize mutual friction, direct numerical simulations at temperatures $1.44 \, \mathrm{K} \lesssim T \lesssim 2.16 \, \mathrm{K}$ indicate that mutual friction promotes intense momentum exchanges between the two fluids to maintain a joint energy cascade despite their viscosity mismatch. However, the resulting overall frictional dissipation remains small (compared to the viscous dissipation) and confined to far-dissipative scales. This remarkable feature allows us to define an effective Reynolds number for the turbulence intensity in a two-fluid system, helping to disentangle the effects of Reynolds number and temperature in quantum turbulence. Thereby, simple physical arguments predict that the distance $\ell$ between quantized vortices (normalized by the turbulence integral scale $L_0$) should behave as $\ell/L_0 \approx 0.5 \, \mathrm{Re}_\kappa^{-3/4}$ with the Reynolds number based on the quantum of circulation $\kappa$. This law is well supported by a large set of experimental and numerical data within the temperature range of the HVBK model. Finally, this new approach offers the possibility of revisiting the ongoing controversy on intermittency in quantum turbulence. It is shown that observed changes in intermittency arise from Reynolds number effects rather than from temperature variations, as proposed in recent studies.</description>

      <title>Phase dynamics and their role determining energy flux in hydrodynamic shell models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transfer of energy and other conserved quantities across scales, also known as flux or spectral flux, is a central aspect of out-of-equilibrium systems such as turbulent hydrodynamic flows. Despite its role in the few predictive theories that exist, a dynamical understanding of what determines said flux (and its direction in scale) has yet to be established. In this study, we work towards this understanding by investigating how the dynamics of complex Fourier velocity phases influence the flux of conserved quantities in hydrodynamic shell models. The phase dynamics, like energy evolution, are influenced by contributions from all neighboring triads, making the full problem intractable. Instead, we assume that the dynamics of the triad phases are determined solely by the so-called self-interaction term and treat the other neighboring triad terms as noise. This transforms the phase dynamics into that of a noisy phase oscillator, which we solve analytically to predict phase statistics. We validate this assumption with a suite of shell model simulations. Our results give us analytical predictions for the energy flux, when the energy spectrum is given. We prove that all shell models that conserve energy along with a sign-indefinite quadratic quantity (this includes three-dimensional turbulence analogues) undergo a forward energy cascade, and further show that the phase dynamics prevent the shell model analogue of two-dimensional turbulence from forming an inverse cascade of energy.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution of turbulent velocity fields in two-way coupled particle-laden flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a deep learning-based super-resolution (SR) framework specifically developed for accurately reconstructing high-resolution velocity fields in two-way coupled particle-laden turbulent flows. Leveraging conditional generative adversarial networks (cGANs), the generator network architecture incorporates explicit conditioning on physical parameters, such as effective particle mass density and subgrid kinetic energy, while the discriminator network is conditioned on low-resolution data as well as high-frequency content of the input data. High-fidelity direct numerical simulation (DNS) datasets, covering a range of particle Stokes numbers, particle mass loadings, and carrier gas turbulence regimes, including forced- and decaying-turbulence, serve as training and testing datasets. Extensive validation studies, including detailed analyses of energy spectra, probability density functions (PDFs), vorticity distributions, and wavelet-based decomposition demonstrate the model's accuracy and generalization capabilities across different particle parameters. The results show that the network utilizes particle data, mainly in the reconstruction of high-frequency details modulated by particles. Additionally, systematic assessment of the model's performance in capturing previously unseen flow regimes further validates its predictive capabilities.</description>

      <title>Elastohydrodynamics of 3D chemically active filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active deformable filaments exhibit a large range of qualitatively different three-dimensional dynamics, depending on their flexibility, the strength of the active forcing, and the surrounding environment. For a sufficiently strong activity, the resulting forces buckle the filament into different shapes, altering its dynamic behaviour. We investigate the dynamic behaviour of elastic, chemically propelled phoretic filaments, combining two existing models; a local version of slender phoretic theory, which determines the resulting slip flows for chemically propelled filaments with a given shape and chemical patterning, is paired with an efficient method for capturing the elastohydrodynamics of a deformable filament in viscous flow to study the chemoelastohydrodynamics of filaments. As the activity increases, or equivalently the filament stiffness decreases, these filaments undergo buckling instabilities that alter their behaviour from rigid rods. We follow their behaviour well beyond the buckling threshold to find a rich array of dynamics, including motions that may be described as planar swimming, circling, pinwheeling, flapping and diffusive.</description>

      <title>Spatially localised doubly diffusive convection in an axisymmetric spherical shell</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Doubly diffusive convection describes the fluid motion driven by the competition of temperature and salinity gradients diffusing at different rates. While the convective motions driven by these gradients usually occupy the entire domain, parameter regions exist where the convection is spatially localised. Although well-studied in planar geometries, spatially localised doubly diffusive convection has never been investigated in a spherical shell, a geometry of relevance to astrophysics. In this paper, numerical simulation is used to compute spatially localised solutions of doubly diffusive convection in an axisymmetric spherical shell. Several families of spatially localised solutions, named using variants of the word convecton, are found and their bifurcation diagram computed. The various convectons are distinguished by their symmetry and by whether they are localised at the poles or at the equator. We find that because the convection rolls that develop in the spherical shell are not straight but curve around the inner sphere, their strength varies with latitude, and the system is spatially modulated. As a result spatially periodic states can no longer form and, much like in a planar system with non-standard boundary conditions, localised states are forced to arise via imperfect bifurcations. While the direct relevance is to doubly diffusive convection, parallels drawn with the Swift Hohenberg equation suggest a wide applicability to other pattern forming systems in similar geometries.</description>

      <title>Burnett-level multi-relaxation-time central-moment discrete Boltzmann modeling of reactive flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A multi-relaxation-time central-moment discrete Boltzmann method (CDBM) is developed for compressible reactive flows, incorporating the effects of chemical reactions. The Chapman--Enskog multiscale analysis demonstrates that the model recovers the Burnett equations in the hydrodynamic limit, with tunable specific heat ratios and Prandtl numbers. Within the CDBM framework, a unified Boltzmann equation governs the evolution of hydrodynamic variables, thermodynamic quantities, and higher-order central moments. The collision and reaction term are consistently computed via matrix inversion method. A two-dimensional twenty-five discrete velocities, exhibiting favorable spatial symmetry, is constructed and employed. The model is validated through simulations of the thermal Couette flow, homogeneous chemical reaction, steady detonation wave, and collision of two detonation waves. This work presents a versatile numerical simulation tool capable of addressing complex reactive flows characterized by hydrodynamic and thermodynamic nonequilibrium effects, applicable to both scientific research and engineering practice.</description>

      <title>Active Scalar Mixing by Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mixing of active scalars by homogeneous isotropic incompressible stochastic velocity fields. We consider both Navier-Stokes generated turbulent fields as well as artificially generated homogeneous isotropic stochastic fields. We use Fourier pseudospectral direct numerical simulations to study the mixing dynamics of two non-reacting species of different density ratios. We use the Atwood number to create a denser mixture and a lighter mixture. We show that in the absence of stirring, a denser mixture homogenizes faster than the lighter mixture. The direction of the density gradient causes the interface across which the molecular diffusion occurs to expand outward for the denser mixture and inward for the lighter mixture. The stirring process, which enhances the diffusion process, increases the rate of homogenization in both mixing methods under study. We define a new mixing metric for studying the mixing evolution of active scalars, which indicates that a denser inhomogeneity in a lighter mixture spreads faster but homogenizes slower. For low Mach number turbulence, there is a negligible coupling between the density gradients and the velocity field responsible for stirring. The post-stirring behavior of active scalars is found to be similar to passive scalars, where the scalar energy spectra decay exponentially and exhibit self-similarity. The turbulence fields generated by solving the Navier-Stokes equation homogenize both the mixtures faster than the synthetic cases. We show that matching the kinetic energy spectra and inertial subrange scaling of a synthetically generated stochastic field with that of a Navier-Stokes generated field is not enough to study mixing dynamics.</description>

      <title>Spreading droplets of yield-stress fluids with and without gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of gravity on the spreading of droplets of yield stress fluids, by performing both microgravity experiments (in a drop tower) and experiments under terrestrial gravity. We investigate the dependence of the final droplet shape on yield stress and gravity. Droplets are deposited on a thin film of the same material, allowing to directly test scaling laws derived from the thin-film equation for viscoplastic fluids. Microgravity conditions allow to vary independently the two relevant dimensionless numbers, the Bond number, B, and the plastocapillary number, J, and thus to disentangle the influence of surface tension from that of the yield stress on the droplet shapes. Simulations using a visco-elastic model with shear thinning complement the experiments and show good agreement regarding the droplet shapes. Possible deviations arising in the regime of non-negligible elastic effects and large plastocapillary numbers (large yield stress) are discussed.</description>

      <title>Optimal transitional mechanisms of incompressible separated shear layers subject to external disturbances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal transitional mechanisms are analysed for an incompressible shear layer developing over a short, pressure gradient-induced laminar separation bubble (LSB) with peak reversed flow of 2%. Although the bubble remains globally stable, the shear layer destabilises due to the amplification of external time- and spanwise-periodic disturbances. Using linear resolvent analysis (RA), we demonstrate that the pressure gradient modifies boundary layer receptivity, shifting from Tollmien-Schlichting (T-S) waves and streaks in a zero pressure gradient (ZPG) environment to Kelvin-Helmholtz (K-H) and centrifugal instabilities in the presence of the LSB. To characterise the non-linear evolution of these disturbances, we employ the Harmonic-Balanced Navier-Stokes (HBNS) framework, solving the Navier-Stokes equations in spectral space with a finite number of Fourier harmonics. Additionally, adjoint optimisation is incorporated to identify forcing disturbances that maximise the mean skin friction drag, conveniently chosen as the cost function for the optimisation problem since it is commonly observed to increase in the transitional stage. Compared to attached boundary layers, this transition scenario exhibits both similarities and differences. While oblique T-S instability is replaced by oblique K-H instability, both induce streamwise rotational forcing through the quadratic non-linearity of the N-S equations. However, in separated boundary layers, centrifugal instability first generates strong streamwise vortices due to multiple centrifugal resolvent modes, which then develop into streaks via lift-up. Finally, we show that the progressive distortion and disintegration of K-H rollers, driven by streamwise vortices, lead to the breakdown of large coherent structures.</description>

      <title>Retraction Dynamics of a Highly Viscous Liquid Sheet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional capillary-driven retraction of a finite, planar liquid sheet in the asymptotic regime where both the Ohnesorge number $\mathrm{Oh}$ and the initial length-to-thickness ratio $l_0/h_0$ are large. In this regime, the fluid domain decomposes into two regions: a thin-film region governed by one-dimensional mass and momentum equations, and a small tip region near the free edge described by a self-similar Stokes flow. Asymptotic matching between these regions yields an effective boundary condition for the thin-film region, representing a balance between viscous and capillary forces at the free edge. Surface tension drives the thin-film flow only through this boundary condition, while the local momentum balance is dominated by viscous and inertial stresses. We show that the thin-film flow possesses a conserved quantity, reducing the equation of thickness to heat equation with time-dependent boundary conditions. The reduced problem depends on a single dimensionless parameter $\mathcal{L} = l_0 / (4 h_0 \mathrm{Oh})$. Numerical solutions of the reduced model agree well with previous studies and reveal that the sheet undergoes distinct retraction regimes depending on $\mathcal{L}$ and a dimensionless time after rupture $T$. We derive asymptotic approximations for the thickness profile, velocity profile, and retraction speed during the early and late stages of retraction. At early times, the retraction speed grows as $T^{1/2}$, while at late times it decays as $1/T^2$. An intermediate regime arises for very long sheets ($\mathcal{L} \gg 1$). During this phase, the retraction speed approaches the Taylor-Culick value. When $T \approx \mathcal{L}$, the speed undergoes fast deceleration from the Taylor-Culick speed to late-time asymptotics.</description>

      <title>Bayesian optimization of a cost function in suboptimal control for reducing skin friction drag in wall turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A systematic and automated framework for developing closed-loop flow control strategies is proposed, integrating suboptimal control theory [Lee et al., J. Fluid Mech. 358, 245 (1998)] with Bayesian optimization. The approach is demonstrated in the context of reducing skin friction drag in a low-Reynolds-number turbulent channel flow. A cost function in the suboptimal control framework is formulated as a linear combination of various wall quantities, with the corresponding weight coefficients optimized via Bayesian optimization to maximize a drag reduction rate. The proposed method successfully identifies effective cost functions, achieving approximately 20% drag reduction, which is comparable to or even higher than those reported in previous studies. Additionally, some cost functions proposed in previous studies are rediscovered. The present approach offers novel perspectives on the decision of the cost function, highlighting its potential for advancing active control strategies in turbulent flows.</description>

      <title>A symbolic regression-based implicit algebraic stress turbulence model: incorporating the production of non-dimensional Reynolds stress deviatoric tensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulence constitutes an exceptionally complex and irregular flow phenomenon that manifests in liquids, gases, and plasma, making it ubiquitous in both natural processes and engineering applications. Given the relatively modest advancements in classical turbulence models over the past half-century, data-driven approaches, such as machine learning, have recently gained considerable traction in turbulence model research. In this study, we introduce a symbolic regression-based implicit algebraic stress turbulence model that incorporates the production of non-dimensional Reynolds stress deviatoric tensor, thereby capturing the contribution of the shape of local turbulence produced by the mean flow field. We rigorously evaluate our model across five distinct characteristic flow cases and benchmark it against three alternative turbulence models. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that the proposed model exhibits robust performance and substantial generalizability across all test cases while manifesting notable advantages when compared with the reference turbulence models.</description>

      <title>Heat transfer modulation in Phase Change Materials via fin insertion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We leverage a large set of numerical simulations to study optimized geometrical configurations for Phase Change Materials (PCMs) cells. We consider a PCM cell as a square enclosure with a solid substance that undergoes melting under the effect of a heat source from one side and under the effects of buoyancy forces. Moreover, an additional source fin with prescribed length $l$ and height $h$ protrudes into the cell perpendicularly from the heat source. The fin prompts enhanced heat transfer and convection within the PCM cell, thus shortening (in comparison to a finless cell) the melting time $t_m$ needed for all the PCM material to melt and transit from the solid to the liquid phase. This improvement is systematically studied as a function of the fin geometrical details ($l$, $h$), as well as the Rayleigh number $\operatorname{Ra}$ -- encoding the importance of buoyancy forces with respect to diffusion/dissipation effects -- and the Stefan number $\operatorname{St}$ -- encoding the importance of sensible heat with respect to latent heat. Overall, our systematic study in terms of the free parameters $l$, $h$, $\operatorname{Ra}$ and $\operatorname{St}$ offers inspiring insights to optimize the structure of a PCM cell during its manufacturing process and suggests optimal operating conditions for such geometrical configurations.</description>

      <title>Numerical search for states with constant enstrophy flux over finite time intervals in two-dimensional turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An ensemble model of turbulence based on states with constant flux in wavenumber space was proposed in [K. Yoshida, Phys. Rev. E, 106, 045106 (2022)]. The justification of this ensemble model relies on the conjecture that almost all states with constant flux correspond to turbulence states. To verify this conjecture, a numerical search for states with constant enstrophy flux in wavenumber space over finite time intervals in two-dimension turbulence is conducted using a Monte Carlo method. Properties of the obtained states, such as energy spectrum and spectra related to fourth-order moments, are examined and compared with those of turbulence states obtained from direct numerical simulations. The dependence of the obtained states on the time interval and the initial conditions used in the numerical search is also discussed.</description>

      <title>A novel parallelizable convergence accelerating method: Pointwise Frequency Damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel class of data-driven acceleration methods for steady-state flow field solvers. The core innovation lies in predicting and assigning the asymptotic limit value for each parameter during iterations based on its own historical data, rather than processing and assigning the entire flow field at once. This approach fundamentally guarantees identical results between serial and parallel computations. Subsequently, a formula for representing the asymptotic limit based on historical data is derived and discretized, yielding a purely algebraic expression.Furthermore, the applicability scope of the method is discussed, along with the underlying reasons for its acceleration capability. A quantitative expression for estimating the speedup ratio is also provided. Extensive validation cases were tested, ranging from the simplest inviscid airfoil flow to complex three-dimensional viscous transonic cruise flow around a aircraft, and solving asymmetric linear systems via GMRES. These tests consistently demonstrate significant acceleration effects with speedup factors ranging from 2.5 to 4. Combined with the near-zero computational overhead of the purely algebraic formulation during the solving process and the inherently parallel-compatible pointwise prediction principle, the results strongly indicate that this method is highly suitable for large-scale industrial mesh computations.</description>

      <title>Emergence of local ordering and giant number fluctuations in active turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study spatiotemporal chaos in dense active suspensions using a generalized hydrodynamic model. As the activity is increased, we observe a clear structural transition marked by the formation of intense, spatially organized vortices with the appearance of giant number fluctuations. This transition is accompanied by the emergence of local polar ordering, an increase in velocity correlations, and a shift in the velocity distribution from unimodal to bimodal. Beyond activity, reducing the instability timescale leads to similar structural changes in the flow. This suggests that both activity and instability dynamics can serve as control parameters for pattern formation. Our findings reveal how local ordering and dynamical instability interact to generate large-scale structures in active systems. Furthermore, based on the energy budget, we define an order parameter that quantifies the structural changes in the phase space of activity and instability time scales.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A floating Leidenfrost droplet exhibits curvature inversion of its underside, due to the balance of vapor pressure and surface tension. Using interferometric imaging, we find different behavior for a levitated hydrogel sphere. Curvature inversion is observed briefly just after deposition, but quickly gives way to a steady state with no inversion. We show the essential role of vaporization on shaping the underbelly of the hydrogel, adding a new component to the interplay between vapor pressure and elastic force</description>

      <title>Accuracy and stability of the accelerated multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-direct-forcing immersed boundary method allows for high accuracy of the no-slip condition in moving-particle problems but suffers from numerical instability if simulation parameters are not carefully chosen. This study investigates the numerical accuracy and stability of the accelerated multidirect-forcing immersed boundary method. An analysis of the discretized equations of body motion in moving boundary problems identifies a critical parameter that solely determines the numerical stability for the body motion. Additionally, numerical simulations reveal the optimal acceleration parameter that minimizes the error in the no-slip condition and is independent of details of the boundary discretisation, the boundary shape, and spatial dimensionality. This study provides a guideline for establishing numerically stable simulations of moving boundary problems at optimal accuracy of the no-slip condition.</description>

      <title>Stability analysis of transitional flows based on disturbance magnitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We utilize input-output analysis and the small gain theorem to derive a disturbance-based criterion for analyzing the stability of flows. A detailed study is conducted on applying this criterion to three canonical flows: Couette, plane Poiseuille, and Blasius flows, considering three input-output approaches: unstructured, structured with non-repeated blocks, and structured with repeated blocks. By covering a wide range of Reynolds numbers for each flow, we reveal a complex interplay between dominant flow structures that determine the stability threshold bound, arising from both unstructured and structured input-output approaches. The obtained thresholds comply with a hierarchical relationship derived from our theoretical analysis, in which the unstructured approach provides a stricter bound, i.e., a lower threshold on disturbance magnitude to trigger instability, compared to structured approaches. The latter are accounting (to some extent) for the flow system nonlinearity. This threshold can be triggered through various transition routes, such as the presence of a finite-size perturbation in the flow or via a transient growth scenario. We demonstrate that our analysis converges to linear stability theory when an infinitesimally small threshold is imposed. Our stability analysis is more general, allowing for finite-amplitude perturbations and nonlinear interactions, which enables us to explain the observed transition in various shear flows at both subcritical and supercritical Reynolds numbers, as observed in experimental and direct numerical simulation studies. In particular, we utilize our stability criterion to demonstrate that Couette flow can become unstable and transition can be triggered at different Reynolds numbers, which is consistent with past experimental observations.</description>

      <title>Deriving thin-film averaged equations using computer algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05103v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the use of computer algebra for facilitating the derivation of thin film reduced-order models. We focus on the weighted residual integral boundary layer (WRIBL) method, which has proven to be a very effective technique for developing reduced-order models by averaging the Navier-Stokes equations over the thin-gap direction. In particular, we use SymPy (the symbolic computing library in Python) to derive the core-annular WRIBL model of Dietze and Ruyer-Quil (J. Fluid Mech. 762, 60, 2015); the derivation is especially involved due to the inclusion of second-order terms, the presence of two hydrodynamically active phases, the enforcement of interfacial boundary conditions, and the cylindrical geometry. We show, using excerpts of code, how each step of the derivation can be broken down into substeps that are amenable to symbolic computation. To illustrate the application of the derived model, we solve it numerically using scientific computing libraries in Python, and briefly explore the dynamics of the Rayleigh-Plateau instability. The use of open-source computer algebra, in the manner described here, greatly eases the derivation of averaged models, thereby facilitating their use for the study of multiscale flows, as well as for computationally-efficient prediction and optimization.</description>

      <title>OGF: An Online Gradient Flow Method for Optimizing the Statistical Steady-State Time Averages of Unsteady Turbulent Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Turbulent flows are chaotic and unsteady, but their statistical distribution converges to a statistical steady state. Engineering quantities of interest typically take the form of time-average statistics such as $ \frac{1}{t} \int_0^t f ( u(x,\tau; \theta) ) d\tau \overset{t \rightarrow \infty}{\rightarrow} F(x; \theta)$, where $u(x,t; \theta)$ are solutions of the Navier--Stokes equations with parameters $\theta$. Optimizing over $F(x; \theta)$ has many engineering applications including geometric optimization, flow control, and closure modeling. However, this remains an open challenge, as existing computational approaches are incapable of scaling to physically representative numbers of grid points. The fundamental obstacle is the chaoticity of turbulent flows: gradients calculated with the adjoint method diverge exponentially as $t \rightarrow \infty$.
  We develop a new online gradient-flow (OGF) method that is scalable to large degree-of-freedom systems and enables optimizing for the steady-state statistics of chaotic, unsteady, turbulence-resolving simulations. The method forward-propagates an online estimate for the gradient of $F(x; \theta)$ while simultaneously performing online updates of the parameters $\theta$. A key feature is the fully online nature of the algorithm to facilitate faster optimization progress and its combination with a finite-difference estimator to avoid the divergence of gradients due to chaoticity. The proposed OGF method is demonstrated for optimizations over three chaotic ordinary and partial differential equations: the Lorenz-63 equation, the Kuramoto--Sivashinsky equation, and Navier--Stokes solutions of compressible, forced, homogeneous isotropic turbulence. In each case, the OGF method successfully reduces the loss based on $F(x; \theta)$ by several orders of magnitude and accurately recovers the optimal parameters.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Inspired Tensor-Network Fractional-Step Method for Incompressible Flow in Curvilinear Coordinates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an algorithmic framework based on tensor networks for computing fluid flows around immersed objects in curvilinear coordinates. We show that the tensor network simulations can be carried out solely using highly compressed tensor representations of the flow fields and the differential operators and discuss the numerical implementation of the tensor operations required for computing fluid flows in detail. The applicability of our method is demonstrated by applying it to the paradigm example of steady and transient flows around stationary and rotating cylinders. We find excellent quantitative agreement in comparison to finite difference simulations for Strouhal numbers, forces and velocity fields. The properties of our approach are discussed in terms of reduced order models. We estimate the memory saving and potential runtime advantages in comparison to standard finite difference simulations. We find accurate results with errors of less than 0.3% for flow-field compressions by a factor of up to 20 and differential operators compressed by factors of up to 1000 compared to sparse matrix representations. We provide strong numerical evidence that the runtime scaling advantages of the tensor network approach with system size will provide substantial resource savings when simulating larger systems. Finally, we note that, like other tensor network-based fluid flow simulations, our algorithmic framework is directly portable to a quantum computer leading to further scaling advantages.</description>

      <title>A shear-induced limit on bacterial surface adhesion in fluid flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling bacterial surface adhesion and subsequent biofilm formation in fluid systems is crucial for the safety and efficacy of medical and industrial processes. Here, we theoretically examine the transport of bacteria close to surfaces, isolating how the key processes of bacterial motility and fluid flow interact and alter surface adhesion. We exploit the disparity between the fluid velocity and the swimming velocity of common motile bacteria and, using a hybrid asymptotic-computational approach, we systematically derive the coarse-grained bacterial diffusivity close to surfaces as a function of swimming speed, rotational diffusivity, and shape. We calculate an analytical upper bound for the bacterial adhesion rate by considering the scenario in which bacteria adhere irreversibly to the surface on first contact. Our theory predicts that maximal adhesion occurs at intermediate flow rates: at low flow rates, increasing flow increases surface adhesion, while at higher flow rates, adhesion is decreased by shear-induced cell reorientation.</description>

      <title>Drivers of Layered Circulations in the South China Sea: Volume Flux or Vorticity Flux?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The South China Sea (SCS) features a unique layered circulation structure known as the cyclonic-anticyclonic-cyclonic (CAC) pattern, whose driving mechanisms remain a subject of debate. This study employs idealized numerical simulations using the MITgcm to investigate the role of volume flux and vorticity flux through the Luzon Strait (LS) to the SCS circulation. The control experiment successfully reproduces the observed "sandwiched" transport structure at the LS and the CAC circulation within the SCS. Sensitivity experiments, in which planetary vorticity is set to zero in the Pacific and LS, reveal that the CAC structure is insensitive to vorticity flux input. By applying the Stommel-Arons model to Cartesian coordinates, we provide analytical solutions that align with the simulation results, supporting the volume flux-driven hypothesis. Our findings suggest that the deep inflow through the LS is the primary driver of the layered circulation system, while the middle-layer outflow is a dynamical consequence. These results challenge the vorticity flux-driven hypothesis and offer new insights into the dynamics of layered circulations in the SCS.</description>

      <title>Mass Transfer Through Vapor-Liquid Interfaces From Hydrodynamic Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We assess the capabilities of hydrodynamic density functional theory (DFT) to predict mass transfer across vapor-liquid interfaces by studying the response of an initially equilibrated pure component vapor-liquid system to the localized insertion of a second component. Hydrodynamic DFT captures the effect of interfaces on the dynamics by modeling the chemical potential gradients of an inhomogeneous system based on classical DFT. Hydrodynamic DFT effectively connects molecular models with continuum fluid dynamics. Away from interfaces the framework simplifies to the isothermal Navier-Stokes equations. We employ Maxwell-Stefan diffusion with a generalized driving force to model diffusive molecular transport in inhomogeneous systems. For the considered Lennard--Jones truncated and shifted (LJTS) fluid, we utilize a non-local Helmholtz energy functional based on the perturbed truncated and shifted (PeTS) equation of state. The model provides noise-free partial densities and fluxes for the mass transfer near the interface, as well as profiles of these quantities across the interface. A comparison with non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations shows that hydrodynamic DFT accurately predicts mass transfer across the interface, including microscopic phenomena such as the temporary enrichment and repulsion of the light boiling component at the interface. Combining generalized entropy scaling with generalized Maxwell-Stefan diffusion allows for an accurate description of diffusive molecular transport in the system. This approach can accurately predict phase behavior, equilibrium interfaces, and mass transfer across interfaces based on molecular interactions for mixtures of strongly dissimilar components. Our results suggest that hydrodynamic DFT can accurately predict the dynamics of mixtures at vapor-liquid interfaces.</description>

      <title>Perturbed Toroidal Vortices Display Internal Simply Connected Topology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04596v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work shows that the interiors of perturbed zero-helicity vortices display simply connected topology with a crescent-shaped boundary. Flux surfaces in fluid and magnetic vortices were explored analytically, while particle trajectories in the context of plasma confinement were examined numerically, demonstrating the existence of both toroidal and simply connected topologies. This new topology appears for perturbations in a broad class, with amplitudes and spatial variance allowed to be arbitrarily small. A corollary of this work proves the closedness of field lines under odd-parity perturbations of zero-helicity vortices.</description>

      <title>Parameter Estimation and Adaptive Solution of the Leray-Burgers Equation Using Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.08874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we employ the Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to estimate the practical range of the characteristic wavelength parameter(referred to as the smoothing parameter) $\alpha$ in the Leray-Burgers equation. The Leray-Burgers equation, a regularization of the inviscid Burgers equation, incorporates a Helmholtz filter with a characteristic wavelength $\alpha$ to replace the usual convective velocity, inducing a regularized convective velocity. The filter bends the equation's characteristics slightly and makes them not intersect each other, leading to a global solution in time. By conducting computational experiments with various initial conditions, we determine the practical range of $\alpha &gt;0$ that closely approximates the solutions of the inviscid Burgers equation. Our findings indicate that the value of $\alpha$ depends on the initial data, with the practical range of $\alpha$ being between 0.01 and 0.05 for continuous initial profiles and between 0.01 and 0.03 for discontinuous initial profiles. The Leray-Burgers equation captures shock and rarefaction waves within the temporal domain for which training data exists. However, as the temporal domain extends beyond the training interval, data-driven forward computation demonstrates that the predictions generated by the PINN start to deviate from the exact solutions. This study also highlights the effectiveness and efficiency of the Leray-Burgers equation in real practical problems, specifically Traffic State Estimation.</description>

      <title>Next-order balanced model captures submesoscale physics and statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.03422v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using nonlinear simulations in two settings, we demonstrate that QG$^\mathrm{+1}$, a potential-vorticity based next-order-in-Rossby balanced model, captures several aspects of ocean submesoscale physics. In forced-dissipative 3D simulations under baroclinically unstable Eady-type background states, the statistical equilibrium turbulence exhibits long cyclonic tails and a plethora of rapidly-intensifying ageostrophic fronts. Despite that the model requires setting an explicit, small value for the fixed scaling Rossby number, the emergent flows are nevertheless characterized by vorticity and convergence values larger than the local Coriolis frequency, as observed in upper-ocean submesoscale flows. Simulations of QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ under the classic strain-induced frontogenesis set-up show realistic frontal asymmetry and a provable finite time blow-up, quantitatively comparable to simulations of the semigeostrophic equations. The inversions in the QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ model are straightforward linear Poisson problems, allowing for the reconstruction of all flow fields from the PV and surface buoyancy, while avoiding the semigeostrophic coordinate transformation. Taken together, these results suggest QG$^\mathrm{+1}$ might be a useful tool for studying upper-ocean submesoscale dynamics.</description>

      <title>Variable-property and intrinsic compressibility corrections for turbulence models using near-wall scaling theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a novel approach to derive compressibility corrections for Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) models. Using this approach, we derive variable-property corrections for wall-bounded flows that take into account the distinct scaling characteristics of the inner and outer layers, extending the earlier work of Otero Rodriguez et al. [Int. J. Heat Fluid Flow, 73, 2018]. We also propose modifying the eddy viscosity to account for changes in the near-wall damping of turbulence due to intrinsic compressibility effects. The resulting corrections are consistent with our recently proposed velocity transformation [Hasan et al., Phys. Rev. Fluids, 8, L112601, 2023] in the inner layer and the Van Driest velocity transformation in the outer layer. Furthermore, we address some important aspects related to the modeling of the energy equation, primarily focusing on the turbulent Prandtl number and the modeling of the source terms. Compared to the existing state-of-the-art compressibility corrections, the present corrections, combined with accurate modeling of the energy equation, lead to a significant improvement in the results for a wide range of turbulent boundary layers and channel flows. The proposed corrections have the potential to enhance modeling across a range of applications, involving low-speed flows with strong heat transfer, fluids at supercritical pressures, and supersonic and hypersonic flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09291v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Theoretical results on water waves almost always start by assuming irrotationality of the flow in order to simplify the formulation. In this work, we investigate the well-foundedness of this hypothesis via numerical simulations of the free-surface Navier-Stokes equation. We show that, in the presence of a non-flat bottom, a gravity wave can shed vortex pairs, or modons, from the bottom boundary layer into the bulk flow. As these eddies approach the free surface they modify the shape of the wave. It is found that this perturbation is singular and does not vanish with the viscosity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10916v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An analytical derivation of the buoyancy-induced initial acceleration of a spherical gas bubble in a host liquid is presented. The theory makes no assumptions further than applying the two-phase incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, showing that neither the classical approach using potential theory nor other simplifying assumptions are needed. The result for the initial bubble acceleration as a function of the gas and liquid densities, classically built on potential theory, is retained. The result is reproduced by detailed numerical simulations. The accelerated, although stagnant state of the bubble induces a pressure distribution on the bubble surface which is different from the result related to the Archimedean principle, emphasizing the importance of the non-equilibrium state for the force acting on the bubble.</description>

      <title>Scale invariance of intermittency in LES turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15874v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Turbulent flows exhibit large intermittent fluctuations from inertial to dissipative scales, characterized by multifractal statistics and breaking the statistical self-similarity. It has recently been proposed that the Navier-Stokes turbulence restores a hidden form of scale invariance in the inertial interval when formulated for a dynamically (nonlinearly) rescaled quasi-Lagrangian velocity field. Here we show that such hidden self-similarity extends to the Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) approach in computational fluid dynamics (CFD). In particular, we show that classical subgrid-scale models, such as implicit or explicit Smagorinsky closures, respect the hidden scale invariance at all scales -- both resolved and subgrid. In the inertial range, they reproduce the hidden scale invariance of Navier-Stokes statistics. These properties are verified very accurately by numerical simulations and, beyond CFD, turn LES into a valuable tool for fundamental turbulence research.</description>

      <title>Linear instability in planar viscoelastic Taylor-Couette flow with and without explicit polymer diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08454v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Elastic turbulence has been found in computations of planar viscoelastic Taylor-Couette flow using the Oldroyd-B model, apparently generated by a linear instability (van Buel et al. Europhys. Lett., 124, 14001, 2018). We demonstrate that no such linear instability exists in the governing equations used unless some diffusion is added to the polymer conformation tensor equation, as might occur through a diffusive numerical scheme. With this addition, the polymer diffusive instability (PDI) (Beneitez et al. (Phys. Rev. Fluids, 8, L101901, 2023)) exists and leads to chaotic flows resembling those found by van Buel et al. (2018). We show how finite volume or finite-difference discretisations of the governing equations can naturally introduce diffusive errors near boundaries which are sufficient to trigger PDI. This suggests that PDI could well be important in numerical solutions of wall-bounded viscoelastic flows modelled using Oldroyd-B and FENE-P even with no polymer stress diffusion explicitly included.</description>

      <title>Compressibility correction to the k-$\omega$ turbulence model that considers the wall-cooling effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10009v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In supersonic and hypersonic flows, the near-wall density variation due to wall cooling poses a challenge for accurately predicting the near-wall velocity and temperature profiles using classical eddy viscosity turbulence models. Compressible turbulent boundary layers are known to follow the universal wall law via semi-local transformation. However, developing a turbulence model that predicts a velocity profile, which, via semi-local transformation, follows the universal wall law, remains challenging. The current paper builds upon Danis-Durbin's practice of modifying the $\omega$ equation and proposes a simple modification to the $k-\omega$ two-equation model. The formulation of the proposed modification involves dimensional analysis and the proper selection of the local length scale. The newly introduced modification is used to modify the slope of the velocity profile starting from the viscous layer to above. It recovers a semi-local scaling of turbulent kinetic energy, viscosity, and eddy frequency, then achieves a very decent correction of the velocity profile in compressible turbulent channel flows, satisfying the universal wall law after applying Trettel \&amp; Larsson's transformation. The proposed new $k-\omega$ model can also improve the velocity and temperature predictions in strongly wall-cooled zero-pressure-gradient hypersonic turbulent boundary layers, compared to the original $k-\omega$ model. Validation using the favorable and adverse pressure gradient boundary layers suggests that the model does not impose a negative effect on the original $k-\omega$ model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09797v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motion of a water droplet on a single vertical sugar fiber is analyzed. The fiber is positioned vertically, with the droplet placed at its pending end. If the capillary force exceeds the weight of the droplet, the droplet remains suspended at the fiber's extremity. As water dissolves, the fiber eventually breaks. Subsequently, the droplet may fall down carrying a portion of the undissolved fiber or, more interestingly, the droplet may be propelled upwards, remaining attached to the fiber. The process can then restart. A phase diagram is constructed based on the droplet's volume and the fiber's diameter. A model has been built to assess the critical droplet volume for a given fiber diameter, above which the droplet falls. Below this volume, the droplet can move upwards along the fiber.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16886v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analytic properties of adjoint solutions are investigated for the two-dimensional (2D) full potential equation. For subcritical flows, the Green's function approach is used to derive the analytic adjoint solution for a cost function measuring aerodynamic force. The connection of the adjoint problems for the potential flow equation and the compressible adjoint Euler equations reveals that the adjoint potential and stream function correspond to linear combinations of the compressible adjoint variables measuring the influence of point mass and vorticity sources. The solutions for the adjoint potential and stream function corresponding to aerodynamic lift contain two unknown functions encoding the effect of perturbations to the Kutta condition. The properties of these functions are analyzed from an analytic viewpoint and also by examining numerical adjoint solutions. Based on this analysis, a possible formulation of the Kutta condition within the adjoint framework is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed neural networks for solving moving interface flow problems using the level set approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02440v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper advances the use of physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) architectures to address moving interface problems via the level set method. Originally developed for other PDE-based problems, we particularly leverage PirateNet's features, including causal training, sequence-to-sequence learning, random weight factorization, and Fourier feature embeddings, and tailor them to handle problems with complex interface dynamics. Numerical experiments validate this framework on benchmark problems such as Zalesak's disk rotation and time-reversed vortex flow. We demonstrate that PINNs can efficiently solve level set problems exhibiting significant interface deformation without the need for upwind numerical stabilization, as generally required by classic discretization methods, or additional mass conservation schemes. However, incorporating an Eikonal regularization term in the loss function with an appropriate weight can further enhance results in specific scenarios. Our results indicate that PINNs with the PirateNet architecture surpass conventional PINNs in accuracy, achieving state-of-the-art error rates of $L^2=0.14\%$ for Zalesak's disk and $L^2=0.85 \%$ for the time-reversed vortex flow problem, as compared to reference solutions. Additionally, for a complex two-phase flow dam break problem coupling the level set with the Navier-Stokes equations, we propose a geometric reinitialization method embedded within the sequence-to-sequence training scheme to ensure long-term stability and accurate inference of the level set field.</description>

      <title>Unified description of viscous, viscoelastic, or elastic thin active films on substrates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is frequent for active or living entities to find themselves embedded in a surrounding medium. Resulting composite systems are usually classified as either active fluids or active solids. Yet, in reality, particularly in the biological context, a broad spectrum of viscoelasticity exists in between these two limits. There, both viscous and elastic properties are combined. To bridge the gap between active fluids and active solids, we here systematically derive a unified continuum-theoretical framework. It covers viscous, viscoelastic, and elastic active materials. Our continuum equations are obtained by coarse-graining a discrete, agent-based microscopic dynamic description. In our subsequent analysis, we mainly focus on thin active films on supporting substrates. Strength of activity and degree of elasticity are used as control parameters that control the overall behavior. We concentrate on the analysis of transitions between spatially uniform analytical solutions of collective migration. These include isotropic and polar, orientationally ordered states. A stationary polar solution of persistent directed collective motion is observed for rather fluid-like systems. It corresponds to the ubiquitous swarming state observed in various kinds of dry and wet active matter. With increasing elasticity, persistent motion in one direction is prevented by elastic anchoring and restoring forces. As a consequence, rotations of the spatially uniform migration direction and associated flow occur. Our unified description allows to continuously tune the material behavior from viscous, via viscoelastic, to elastic active behavior by variation of a single parameter. Therefore, it allows in the future to investigate the time evolution of complex systems and biomaterials such as biofilms within one framework.</description>

Abstract: While many living biological media combine both viscous and elastic properties, most theoretical studies employ either purely fluid- or solid-like descriptions. We here use a unified framework for active films on substrates capable of describing a broad range of viscoelastic behavior to explore the interplay between activity and rheology. The core of the study is a comprehensive state diagram showing a rich world of spatiotemporal dynamic states. Our results demonstrate the potential of tunable rheology to realize modes of controlled active transport on the microscale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08516v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Micropolar fluid theory, an extension of classical Newtonian fluid dynamics, incorporates angular velocities and rotational inertias and has long been a foundational framework for describing granular flows. We propose a macroscopic model of granular matter based on active micropolar fluid dynamics, which incorporates internal rotations, couple stresses, and broken parity through odd viscosity. Our framework extends traditional micropolar theory to describe chiral granular flows driven far from equilibrium, where energy is continuously injected and dissipated. In particular, we focus on steady states and explicitly neglect energy conservation, reflecting the dissipative nature of granular systems maintained in non-equilibrium by external forcing. Within this setup, we study the lift force experienced by a test bead embedded in a compressible, parity-breaking granular flow. We analyze how odd viscosity and microrotation modify the transverse forces, using both analytical results in the linearized Stokes regime and nonlinear finite element simulations. Our results demonstrate that active micropolar fluids provide a physically consistent and symmetry-informed continuum description of chiral granular matter, capable of capturing lift forces that emerge uniquely from odd transport effects.</description>

Abstract: We present a rigorous framework for determining the equilibrium configurations of uniformly rotating, self-gravitating fluid bodies. This work addresses the classical challenge of modeling rotational deformation in celestial objects such as stars and planets. By integrating foundational theory with modern mathematical tools, we develop a unified formalism that enhances the precision and generality of shape modeling in astrophysical contexts. Our method applies Lie group theory to vector flows and solves functional equations using the Neumann series. We extend Clairaut's classical linear perturbation theory into the nonlinear regime via Lie exponential mapping, yielding a system of nonlinear functional equations for gravitational potential and fluid density. These are analytically tractable using shift operators and Neumann series summation, enabling explicit characterization of density and gravitational perturbations. This leads to an exact nonlinear differential equation for the shape function, describing equilibrium deformation without assuming slow rotation. We validate the framework through exact solutions, including the Maclaurin spheroid, Jacobi ellipsoid, and unit-index polytrope. We also introduce spectral decomposition techniques for analyzing radial harmonics and gravitational perturbations. Using Wigner's formalism for angular momentum addition, we compute higher-order nonlinear corrections efficiently. The framework includes boundary conditions for Legendre harmonics, supporting the derivation of nonlinear Love numbers and gravitational multipole moments. This work offers a comprehensive, non-perturbative approach to modeling rotational and tidal deformations in astrophysical and planetary systems.</description>
