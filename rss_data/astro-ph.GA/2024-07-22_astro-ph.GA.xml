      <title>Dark matter core creation depends on the timing of star formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14579v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study feedback-driven cold dark matter core creation in the EDGE suite of radiation-hydrodynamical dwarf galaxy simulations. Understanding this process is crucial when using observed dwarf galaxies to constrain the particle nature of dark matter. While previous studies have shown the stellar-mass to halo-mass ratio $(M_{\star} / M_{200})$ determines the extent of core creation, we find that in low-mass dwarfs there is a crucial additional effect, namely the timing of star formation relative to reionisation. Sustained post-reionisation star formation decreases central dark matter density through potential fluctuations; conversely, pre-reionisation star formation is too short-lived to have such an effect. In fact, large stellar masses accrued prior to reionisation are a strong indicator of early collapse, and therefore indicative of an increased central dark matter density. We parameterise this differentiated effect by considering $M_{\star,\mathrm{post}}/M_{\star,\mathrm{pre}}$, where the numerator and denominator represent the amount of star formation after and before $z\sim6.5$, respectively. Our study covers the halo mass range $10^9 &lt; M_{200} &lt; 10^{10} M_\odot$ (stellar masses between $10^4 &lt; M_{\star} &lt; 10^8 M_\odot$), spanning both ultra-faint and classical dwarfs. In this regime, $M_{\star,\mathrm{post}}/M_{\star,\mathrm{pre}}$ correlates almost perfectly with the central dark matter density at $z=0$, even when including simulations with a substantially different variant of feedback and cooling. We provide fitting formulae to describe the newfound dependence.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the Milky Way dust extinction curve in 3D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar dust is a major foreground contaminant for many observations and a key component in the chemistry of the interstellar medium, yet its properties remain highly uncertain. Using low-resolution spectra, we accurately measure the extinction curve - a diagnostic of the grain properties - for 130 million stars, orders of magnitude more than previously available, allowing us to map its variation in the Milky Way and Magellanic Clouds in 3D in unprecedented detail. We find evidence that accretion is the dominant mechanism of grain growth in moderately dense regions, with coagulation dominating at higher densities. Moreover, we find that the extinction curve flattens in star-forming regions, possibly caused by cycling of large grains formed in molecular clouds, or by preferential destruction of small grains by supernova shocks.</description>

      <title>Big Galaxies and Big Black Holes: The Massive Ends of the Local Stellar and Black Hole Mass Functions and the Implications for Nanohertz Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the $z=0$ galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) by combining the GSMF at stellar masses $M_* \lesssim 10^{11.3} M_\odot$ from the census study of Leja et al. (2020) and the GSMF of massive galaxies at $M_* \gtrsim 10^{11.5} M_\odot$ from the volume-limited MASSIVE galaxy survey. To obtain a robust estimate of $M_*$ for local massive galaxies, we use MASSIVE galaxies with $M_*$ measured from detailed dynamical modeling or stellar population synthesis modeling (incorporating a bottom-heavy initial mass function) with high-quality spatially-resolved spectroscopy. These two independent sets of $M_*$ agree to within ${\sim}7$%. Our new $z=0$ GSMF has a higher amplitude at $M_* \gtrsim 10^{11.5} M_\odot$ than previous studies, alleviating prior concerns of a lack of mass growth in massive galaxies between $z\sim 1$ and 0. We derive a local black hole mass function (BHMF) from this GSMF and the scaling relation of SMBH and galaxy masses. The inferred abundance of local SMBHs above $\sim 10^{10}M_\odot$ is consistent with the number of currently known systems. The predicted amplitude of the nanohertz stochastic gravitational wave background is also consistent with the levels reported by Pulsar Timing Array teams. Our $z = 0$ GSMF therefore leads to concordant results in the high-mass regime of the local galaxy and SMBH populations and the gravitational wave amplitude from merging SMBHs. An exception is our BHMF yields a $z=0$ SMBH mass density that is notably higher than the value estimated from quasars at higher redshifts.</description>

      <title>A kiloparsec-scale ordered magnetic field in a galaxy at z=5.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic fields are prevalent on almost all astronomical scales, but their importance in different systems and over cosmic time is yet to be understood. Our current knowledge on the evolution of magnetic fields is limited by scarce observations in the distant Universe, where galaxies have recently been found to be more evolved than most of our model predictions. In this study, we conduct rest-frame 131 $\mu$m full-polarisation ALMA observations of dust emission in a strongly lensed dusty star-forming galaxy, SPT0346-52, at z=5.6, when the Universe was only 1 Gyr old. Dust grains can become aligned with local magnetic fields, resulting in the emission of linearly polarised thermal infrared radiation. Our observations have revealed a median polarisation level of 0.9$\pm$0.2 per cent with a variation of $\pm$0.4 per cent across the regions with polarisation detection, similar to that of local starburst galaxies. The polarised dust emission is patchy. It mostly overlaps with the [C II] emission at a velocity of about -150 km/s, and extends over 3 kiloparsecs with a bimodal distribution in position angles. Our analysis indicates that the kpc-scale polarised dust is most likely aligned by the large-scale magnetic fields associated with a galaxy merger. If the ordered fields are confirmed to be coherent, such early detection of large-scale magnetic fields favours an efficient formation of magnetic fields in primordial galaxies, which highlights the importance of magnetic fields in mediating galaxy evolution over long cosmic timescales. Future surveys towards a wider galaxy population are necessary to test the ubiquitousness of large-scale magnetic fields in early galaxies.</description>

      <title>Pumping Iron: How turbulent metal diffusion impacts multiphase galactic outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most numerical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution are unable to properly resolve the turbulent cascade at or below the resolution scale and turbulence models are required to capture the motion of eddies on those unresolved scales. In this study, we investigate the impact of turbulent metal diffusion models on multiphase outflows originating from dwarf galaxies ($M_{\rm halo} \sim 10^{10} - 10^{11}$ M$_\odot$). We use our state-of-the-art numerical model for the formation of single stars and non-equilibrium cooling and hydrogen chemistry. Our simulations are carried out at a mass resolution of $\sim$1 M$_{\odot}$, where the individual supernova explosions are resolved in terms of hot-phase generation and momentum input. We find that mass, energy, and metal loading factors are only weakly affected by the inclusion of a metal diffusion model. The metal enrichment factor at low altitude above the galactic disk is higher by around 20 per cent when the metal diffusion model is included. Specifically, we find more efficient cooling in the cold interstellar medium, as higher amounts of metals are kept in the cold dense phase. The most striking effect of the metal diffusion model is that, without metal diffusion, there is more rapid cooling in the hot phase and a reduced sound speed by a factor of two. Specifically, we find that the hot phase is more metal enriched in the case without metal diffusion leading to more rapid (over) cooling of that phase which is consistent with the higher sound speed we find in the runs with metal diffusion.</description>

      <title>Fast and Flexible Inference Framework for Continuum Reverberation Mapping using Simulation-based Inference with Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuum reverberation mapping (CRM) of active galactic nuclei (AGN) monitors multiwavelength variability signatures to constrain accretion disk structure and supermassive black hole (SMBH) properties. The upcoming Vera Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will survey tens of millions of AGN over the next decade, with thousands of AGN monitored with almost daily cadence in the deep drilling fields. However, existing CRM methodologies often require long computation time and are not designed to handle such large amount of data. In this paper, we present a fast and flexible inference framework for CRM using simulation-based inference (SBI) with deep learning to estimate SMBH properties from AGN light curves. We use a long-short-term-memory (LSTM) summary network to reduce the high-dimensionality of the light curve data, and then use a neural density estimator to estimate the posterior of SMBH parameters. Using simulated light curves, we find SBI can produce more accurate SMBH parameter estimation with $10^3-10^5$ times speed up in inference efficiency compared to traditional methods. The SBI framework is particularly suitable for wide-field RM surveys as the light curves will have identical observing patterns, which can be incorporated into the SBI simulation. We explore the performance of our SBI model on light curves with irregular-sampled, realistic observing cadence and alternative variability characteristics to demonstrate the flexibility and limitation of the SBI framework.</description>

      <title>The factors that influence protostellar multiplicity I: Gas temperature, density, and mass in Perseus with Nobeyama</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protostellar multiplicity is common at all stages and mass ranges. However, the factors that determine the multiplicity of protostellar systems have not been systematically characterized through their molecular gas. Nobeyama 45m Radio Observatory OTF maps of HCN, HNC, HCO$^+$, and N$_2$H$^+$ (J = 1--0) toward five subregions in Perseus, complemented with single pointing APEX observations of HNC (J = 4--3) are used to derive physical parameters of the dense gas. Both observations have angular resolutions of $\sim$18", equivalent to $\sim$5000 AU scales at the distance of Perseus. Kinetic gas temperature is derived from the $I$(HCN)/$I$(HNC) J = 1--0 ratio, and H$_2$ density is obtained from the HNC J=4--3/J=1--0 ratio. These parameters are used to obtain the N$_2$H$^+$ and HCO$^+$ gas masses. The inferred and derived parameters are compared to source parameters. Inferred mean kinetic gas temperature ($I$(HCN)/$I$(HNC) J=1--0 ratio; ranging between 15 and 26 K), and H$_2$ volumetric density (HNC J=4--3/J=1--0; 10$^5$ -- 10$^6$ cm$^{-3}$) do not show correlations with multiplicity in Perseus. The derived gas and dust masses, 1.3 to 16 $\times~10^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$ for the N$_2$H$^+$ gas mass, 0.1 to 25 M$_{\odot}$ for envelope dust masses (850 $\mu$m), and 0.8 to 10 $\times~10^{-10}$ M$_{\odot}$ for the HCO$^+$ gas mass, are correlated to multiplicity and number of protostellar components. The warm gas masses are a factor of 16 lower than the cold gas masses. This work shows that gas and dust mass is correlated to multiplicity at $\sim$5000 AU scales in Perseus. Higher order multiples tend to have higher gas and dust masses in general, while close binaries (separations $\leq$7") and single protostars have similar gas and dust mass distributions. On the other hand, H$_2$ density and kinetic gas temperature do not show any correlation with multiplicity.</description>

      <title>SO2 and OCS toward high-mass protostars: A comparative study between ice and gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the chemical history of interstellar OCS and SO2 by deriving a statistically-significant sample of gas-phase column densities towards massive protostars and comparing to observations of gas and ices towards other sources spanning from dark clouds to comets. We analyze a subset of 26 line-rich massive protostars observed by ALMA as part of the ALMAGAL survey. Column densities are derived for OCS and SO2 from their rare isotopologues O13CS and 34SO2 towards the compact gas around the hot core. We find that gas-phase column density ratios of OCS and SO2 with respect to methanol remain fairly constant as a function of luminosity between low- and high-mass sources, despite their very different physical conditions. The derived gaseous OCS and SO2 abundances relative to CH3OH are overall similar to protostellar ice values, with a significantly larger scatter for SO2 than for OCS. Cometary and dark-cloud ice values agree well with protostellar gas-phase ratios for OCS, whereas higher abundances of SO2 are generally seen in comets compared to the other sources. Gaseous SO2/OCS ratios are consistent with ices toward dark clouds, protostars, and comets, albeit with some scatter. The constant gas-phase column density ratios throughout low and high-mass sources indicate an early stage formation before intense environmental differentiation begins. Icy protostellar values are similar to the gas phase medians, compatible with an icy origin of these species followed by thermal sublimation. The larger spread in SO2 compared to OCS ratios w.r.t. CH3OH is likely due to a more water-rich chemical environment associated with the former, as opposed to a CO-rich origin of the latter. Post-sublimation gas-phase processing of SO2 can also contribute to the large spread. Comparisons to ices in dark clouds and comets point to a significant inheritance of OCS from earlier to later evolutionary stages.</description>

      <title>How does the velocity anisotropy of halo stars, dark matter and satellite galaxies depend on host halo properties?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the mass ($M_{200}$) and concentration ($c_{200}$) dependencies of the velocity anisotropy ($\beta$) profiles for different components in the dark matter halo, including halo stars, dark matter and subhalos, using systems from the IllustrisTNG simulations. Beyond a critical radius, $\beta$ becomes more radial with the increase of $M_{200}$, reflecting more prominent radial accretion around massive halos. The critical radius is $r\sim r_s$, $0.3~r_s$ and $r_s$ for halo stars, dark matter and subhalos, with $r_s$ the scale radius of host halos. This dependence on $M_{200}$ is the strongest for subhalos, and the weakest for halo stars. In central regions, $\beta$ of halo stars and dark matter particles gets more isotropic with the increase of $M_{200}$ in TNG300 due to baryons. By contrast, $\beta$ of dark matter from the dark matter only TNG300-Dark run shows much weaker dependence on $M_{200}$ within $r_s$. Dark matter in TNG300 is slightly more isotropic than in TNG300-Dark at $0.2~r_s&lt;r&lt;10~r_s$ and $\log_{10}M_{200}/M_\odot&lt;13.8$. Halo stars and dark matter also become more radial with the increase in $c_{200}$, at fixed $M_{200}$. Halo stars are more radial than the $\beta$ profile of dark matter by approximately a constant beyond $r_s$. Dark matter particles are more radial than subhalos. The differences can be understood as subhalos on more radial orbits are easier to get stripped, contributing more stars and dark matter to the diffuse components. We provide a fitting formula to the difference between the $\beta$ of halo stars and of dark matter at $r&gt;r_s$ as $\beta_\mathrm{star}-\beta_\mathrm{DM}=(-0.028 \pm 0.008)\log_{10}M_{200}/M_\odot + (0.690\pm0.010)$.</description>

      <title>Probing 3D magnetic fields using starlight polarization and grain alignment theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization of starlight induced by dust grains aligned with the magnetic field (hereafter B-field) is widely used to measure the two-dimensional B-fields projected onto the plane-of-sky. Here, we introduce a new method to infer three-dimensional B-fields using starlight polarization. The B-field's inclination angle or line-of-sight (LOS) component of B-fields is constrained by the starlight polarization efficiency from observations and the alignment degree provided by the magnetically enhanced radiative torque (MRAT) alignment theory. We first perform synthetic observation of starlight polarization of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of a filamentary cloud. We then test the new technique with our updated POLARIS code and find that the B-field's inclination angles can be precisely determined by the starlight polarization efficiency from synthetic observations. Regardless of grain magnetic properties, the technique can provide an accurate constraint on B-field's inclination angles in low-density regions $N_{\rm H} &lt; 5\times 10^{21}\,\cm^{-2}$ (or visual extinction $A_{V}&lt; 3$) using optical polarization, whereas the technique can infer further to high-density regions $N_{\rm H} \sim 5 \times 10^{22}\,\cm^{-2}$ (or $A_{V}\sim 30$) using near-infrared polarization. Our new technique opens the full potential of tracing 3D B-fields and constraining dust properties and grain alignment physics on multiple scales of the diffuse interstellar medium and star-forming regions using multi-wavelength starlight polarization observations.</description>

      <title>EPOCHS I. The Discovery and Star Forming Properties of Galaxies in the Epoch of Reionization at $6.5 &lt; z &lt; 18$ with PEARLS and Public JWST data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present in this paper the discovery, properties, and a catalog of 1165 high redshift $6.5 &lt; z &lt; 18$ galaxies found in deep JWST NIRCam imaging from the GTO PEARLS survey combined with data from JWST public fields. We describe our bespoke homogeneous reduction process and our analysis of these areas including the NEP, CEERS, GLASS, NGDEEP, JADES, and ERO SMACS-0723 fields with over 214 arcmin$^{2}$ imaged to depths of $\sim 30$ mag. We describe our rigorous methods for identifying these galaxies, involving the use of Lyman-break strength, detection significance criteria, visual inspection, and integrated photometric redshifts probability distributions predominately at high redshift. Our sample is a robust and highly pure collection of distant galaxies from which we also remove brown dwarf stars, and calculate completeness and contamination from simulations. We include a summary of the basic properties of these $z &gt; 6.5$ galaxies, including their redshift distributions, UV absolute magnitudes, and star formation rates. Our study of these young galaxies reveals a wide range of stellar population properties as seen in their colors and SED fits which we compare to stellar population models, indicating a range of star formation histories, dust, AGN and/or nebular emission. We find a strong trend exists between stellar mass and $(U-V)$ color, as well as the existence of the `main-sequence' of star formation for galaxies as early as $z \sim 12$. This indicates that stellar mass, or an underlying variable correlating with stellar mass, is driving galaxy formation, in agreement with simulation predictions. We also discover ultra-high redshift candidates at $z &gt; 12$ in our sample and describe their properties. Finally, we note a significant observed excess of galaxies compared to models at $z &gt; 12$, revealing a tension between predictions and our observations.</description>

      <title>Gravothermal collapse and the diversity of galactic rotation curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15005v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rotation curves of spiral galaxies exhibit a great diversity that challenge our understanding of galaxy formation and the nature of dark matter. Previous studies showed that in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models with a cross section per unit mass of $\sigma/m\approx{\cal O}(1)~{\rm cm^2/g}$, the predicted dark matter central densities are a good match to the observed densities in galaxies. In this work, we explore a regime with a larger cross section of $\sigma/m\approx20-40~{\rm cm^2/g}$ in dwarf galactic halos. We will show that such strong dark matter self-interactions can further amplify the diversity of halo densities inherited from their assembly history. High concentration halos can enter the gravothermal collapse phase within $10~{\rm Gyr}$, resulting in a high density, while low concentration ones remain in the expansion phase and have a low density. We fit the rotation curves of $14$ representative low surface brightness galaxies and demonstrate how the large range of observed central densities are naturally accommodated in the strong SIDM regime of $\sigma/m\approx20-40~{\rm cm^2/g}$. Galaxies that are outliers in the previous studies due to their high halo central densities, are no longer outliers in this SIDM regime as their halos would be in the collapse phase. For galaxies with a low density, the SIDM fits are robust to the variation of the cross section. Our findings open up a new window for testing gravothermal collapse, the unique signature of strong dark matter self-interactions, and exploring broad SIDM model space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In astrochemistry, computational methods play a crucial role in addressing fundamental astronomical questions. Interstellar molecules profoundly influence the chemistry and physics of the interstellar medium (ISM), playing pivotal roles in planet formation and the emergence of life. Understanding their chemistry relies on theoretical approaches such as Density Functional Theory (DFT) and post-Hartree-Fock methods, which are essential for exploring pathways to molecular complexity and determining their interstellar abundances. Various theoretical methods investigate the formation of interstellar molecules in both gaseous and solid states. Molecules in interstellar space may originate from bottom-up processes (building up from CO molecules) or top-down processes (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon fragmentation). Here, we present a journey of theoretical investigations aimed at studying the reactivity of interstellar molecules in space.</description>

      <title>More sulphur in TMC-1: Discovery of the NC$_3$S and HC$_3$S radicals with the QUIJOTE line survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the detection of the free radicals NC$_3$S and HC$_3$S towards TMC-1 with the QUIJOTE line survey. The derived column densities are (1.4$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{11}$ for NC$_3$S and (1.5$\pm$0.2)$\times$10$^{11}$ for HC$_3$S. We searched for NCCS, but only three transitions are within the domain of our QUIJOTE line survey and the observed lines are marginally detected at the 3$\sigma$ level, providing an upper limit to its column density of $\leq$6$\times$10$^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$. We also unsuccessfully searched for longer species of the NC$_n$S (n$\ge$4) and HC$_n$S (n$\ge$5) families in our TMC-1 data. A chemical model based on a reduced set of reactions involving HC$_3$S and NC$_3$S predicts abundances that are 10-100 times below the observed values. These calculations indicate that the most efficient reactions of formation of HC$_3$S and NC$_3$S in the model are S + C$_3$H$_2$ and N + HC$_3$S, respectively, while both radicals are very efficiently destroyed through reactions with neutral atoms.</description>

      <title>FASHI: A blind survey of 21cm HI absorption galaxies with FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FAST All Sky HI survey (FASHI) is broader in frequency band and deeper in detection sensitivity than most of previous HI surveys. FASHI is designed to cover the entire sky observable by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). Based on the FASHI data, we perform a blind survey of 21cm HI absorption galaxies at redshift $z&lt;0.09$ over an area of about 10000 square degrees. We detected 51 HI absorbers, including 21 previously known and 30 new ones, with 8 sources having no optical spectroscopic redshift. The probability of occurrence for HI absorbers in all HI galaxies is 1/1078. The radio flux densities of the FASHI absorbers are mainly concentrated in the range of $S_{\rm 1.4GHz}=10\sim100$ mJy, but even as low as $2.6\pm0.4$mJy. The number of redshifted absorbers is slightly higher than the number of blueshifted absorbers. Such results would provide some important clues for future flux-selected HI absorber surveys. Therefore, FAST has significantly improved the capabilities and performance for HI absorption observations and provided a true blind survey of 21cm HI absorption galaxies for such studies.</description>

      <title>Environmental effects on Low Surface Brightness Galaxies in the IllustrisTNG simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Employing the TNG100 run of the IllustrisTNG project, we characterize the environment of Low Surface Brightness Galaxies (LSBGs) across varying scales, from their associated dark matter halos to their distribution within the broader cosmic structure. We find no significant differences in the halo concentration index $c_{200}$ between LSBGs and their High Surface Brightness (HSBGs) counterparts, with LSBGs residing in halos with higher spin parameter $\lambda$ and slightly more spherical shapes than HSBGs. LSBGs show a stronger alignment between the dark and stellar angular momentum vectors than their high surface brightness counterparts. The relative abundance of LSBGs within groups and clusters displays a central deficit, hinting at potential destruction upon reaching these core regions. Studying the density field, we find a preference for rotation-dominated LSBGs to reside in low-density environments, while dispersion-dominated LSBGs thrive in high-density regions where galaxy interactions govern their evolution, an observation corroborated by our analysis of the two-point correlation function $\xi (r)$. Our examination of the cosmic web reveals no significant differences in the distance to the closest large-scale structure, barring a few exceptions. This suggests a limited impact of large-scale spatial distribution on mechanisms driving LSBG evolution. All together, we conclude that the halo vicinity and local environment at the scale of galaxy clusters, where mechanisms such as galaxy mergers and tidal stripping, as well as stellar and gas accretion take place, is the most likely environment that favour the emergence of LSBGs with different morphologies, mostly driven by the presence or absence of important local interaction phenomena.</description>

      <title>FEASTS Combined with Interferometry (II): Significantly Changed HI Surface Densities and Even More Inefficient Star Formation in Galaxy Outer Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We update the HI surface density measurements for a subset of 17 THINGS galaxies by dealing with the short-spacing problem of the original VLA HI images. It is the same sample that Bigiel et al. (2010) used to study the relation between HI surface densities and star formation rate surface densities in galaxy outer disks, which are beyond the optical radius r25. For ten galaxies, the update is based on combining original THINGS VLA HI images with HI images taken by the single-dish FAST in the FEASTS program. The median increment of HI surface densities in outer disks is 0.15 to 0.4 dex at a given new HI surface density. Several galaxies change significantly in the shape of radial profiles HI surface densities, and seven galaxies are now more than 1-$\sigma$ below the HI size-mass relation. We update the HI star formation laws in outer disks. The median relation between HI surface densities and star formation rate surface densities based on pixelwise measurements shifts downward by around 0.15 dex because the HI surface density values shift rightward, and the scatter increases significantly. The scatter of the relation, indicating the star forming efficiency, exhibits a much stronger positive correlation with the stellar mass surface density than before. Thus, detecting the previously missed, diffuse HI due to short-spacing problem of the VLA observation is important in revealing the true condition and variation of star formation possibly regulated by stellar feedbacks in localized environment of outer disks.</description>

      <title>The Evaporating Massive Embedded Stellar Cluster IRS 13 Close to Sgr A*. II. Kinematic structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of two distinct and apparently unrelated populations of dusty stellar objects in the Nuclear Stellar Cluster (NSC) of the Milky Way, namely IRS 13 and the S-cluster, are potentially prone to a general process describing the star formation history in the Galactic Center (GC). The former cluster is thought to be entangled in the clockwise and counterclockwise disks, a large-scale stellar distribution revealed by the analysis of stars at different distances from Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole in the GC. Recently, this large-scale distribution was reported to exhibit a multi-disk structure with at least four components. Motivated by this finding, we revisit the anisotropic IRS 13 cluster and find strong evidence for a disk-like structure. An examination of about 50 individual stellar orbits reveals a new structure that does not follow any trend known in the literature. Furthermore, we investigate the possibility of an inspiral cluster undergoing star formation processes, as proposed by several authors. Using a simplified N-body simulation to reproduce our observational results, we conclude that, under certain conditions, a massive cluster can migrate from the Circum Nuclear Disk toward the inner parsec. Based on this classification, we revisit the large-scale NACO (VLT) observations of IRS 13 and find evidence for a separation of the cluster into a gravitationally stable core remnant and a dissipating part. With the velocity-resolved H30{\alpha} line and the broadband spectral energy distribution of IRS 13E3, we provide tentative support for the existence of an intermediate-mass black hole of ~ 3 x 10^26 M_sun surrounded by a hot gaseous stream.</description>

      <title>A biconical ionised gas outflow and evidence for positive feedback in NGC 7172 uncovered by MIRI/JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present observations of the type-2 Seyfert NGC7172 obtained with the medium-resolution spectrometer (MRS) of the Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) on board of the JWST. This galaxy hosts one of the lowest ionised gas mass outflow rates (Mout~0.005 M/yr) in a sample of six AGN with similar bolometric luminosities (log Lbol~44erg/s) within the Galactic Activity, Torus and Outflow Survey (GATOS). We aim to understand the properties of the ionised gas outflow, mainly using the emission lines from the neon transitions, that cover a broad range of ionisation potentials (IP) from ~20 eV to ~130 eV. We applied parametric and non-parametric methods to characterise the line emission and kinematics. The low excitation lines (IP&lt;25eV, e.g.[NeII]) trace the rotating disc emission. The high excitation lines (IP&gt;90eV, e.g.[NeV]), which are likely photoionised exclusively by the AGN, are expanding in the direction nearly perpendicular to the disc of the galaxy, with maximum projected velocities of ~350-500 km/s. In particular, [NeV] and [NeVI] lines reveal a biconical ionised gas outflow emerging N-S from the nuclear region, extending at least ~2.5"N and 3.8"S (projected distance of ~450 and 680 pc). Most of the emission arising in the northern part of the cone was not previously detected due to obscuration. Given the almost face-on orientation of the outflow and the almost edge-on orientation of the galaxy, NGC7172 may be a case of weak coupling. Nevertheless, we found evidence for positive feedback in two distinct outflowing clumps at projected distances of 3.1" and 4.3" (i.e. ~560 and 780 pc) SW from the AGN. We estimated a star formation rate in these regions using the [NeII] and [NeIII] luminosities of 0.08 M/yr, that is ~10% of that found in the circumnuclear ring. The star formation activity might have been triggered by the interaction between the ionised gas outflow and the ISM of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>ALESS-JWST: Joint (sub-)kiloparsec JWST and ALMA imaging of $z\sim3$ submillimeter galaxies reveals heavily obscured bulge formation events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present JWST NIRCam imaging targeting 13 $z\sim3$ infrared-luminous ($L_{\rm IR}\sim5\times10^{12}L_{\odot}$) galaxies from the ALESS survey with uniquely deep, high-resolution (0.08$''$$-$0.16$''$) ALMA 870$\mu$m imaging. The 2.0$-$4.4$\mu$m (observed frame) NIRCam imaging reveals the rest-frame near-infrared stellar emission in these submillimeter-selected galaxies (SMGs) at the same (sub-)kpc resolution as the 870$\mu$m dust continuum. The newly revealed stellar morphologies show striking similarities with the dust continuum morphologies at 870$\mu$m, with the centers and position angles agreeing for most sources, clearly illustrating that the spatial offsets reported previously between the 870$\mu$m and HST morphologies were due to strong differential dust obscuration. The F444W sizes are 78$\pm$21% larger than those measured at 870$\mu$m, in contrast to recent results from hydrodynamical simulations that predict larger 870$\mu$m sizes. We report evidence for significant dust obscuration in F444W for the highest-redshift sources, emphasizing the importance of longer-wavelength MIRI imaging. The majority of the sources show evidence that they are undergoing mergers/interactions, including tidal tails/plumes -- some of which are also detected at 870$\mu$m. We find a clear correlation between NIRCam colors and 870$\mu$m surface brightness on $\sim$1 kpc scales, indicating that the galaxies are primarily red due to dust -- not stellar age -- and we show that the dust structure on $\sim$kpc-scales is broadly similar to that in nearby galaxies. Finally, we find no strong stellar bars in the rest-frame near-infrared, suggesting the extended bar-like features seen at 870$\mu$m are highly obscured and/or gas-dominated structures that are likely early precursors to significant bulge growth.</description>

      <title>Forecasts and Statistical Insights for Line Intensity Mapping Cross-Correlations: A Case Study with 21cm x [CII]</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Intensity mapping -- the large-scale mapping of selected spectral lines without resolving individual sources -- is quickly emerging as an efficient way to conduct large cosmological surveys. Multiple surveys covering a variety of lines (such as the hydrogen 21cm hyperfine line, CO rotational lines, and [CII] fine structure lines, among others) are either observing or will soon be online, promising a panchromatic view of our Universe over a broad redshift range. With multiple lines potentially covering the same volume, cross-correlations have become an attractive prospect, both for probing the underlying astrophysics and for mitigating observational systematics. For example, cross correlating 21cm and [CII] intensity maps during reionization could reveal the characteristic scale of ionized bubbles around the first galaxies, while simultaneously providing a convenient way to reduce independent foreground contaminants between the two surveys. However, many of the desirable properties of cross-correlations in principle emerge only under ideal conditions, such as infinite ensemble averages. In this paper, we construct an end-to-end pipeline for analyzing intensity mapping cross-correlations, enabling instrumental effects, foreground residuals, and analysis choices to be propagated through Monte Carlo simulations to a set of rigorous error properties, including error covariances, window functions, and full probability distributions for power spectrum estimates. We use this framework to critically examine the applicability of simplifying assumptions such as the independence and Gaussianity of power spectrum errors. As worked examples, we forecast the sensitivity of near-term and futuristic 21cm-[CII] cross-correlation measurements, providing recommendations for survey design.</description>

      <title>Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM): I. a spectroscopic VLT monitoring survey of massive stars in the SMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surveys in the Milky Way and Large Magellanic Cloud revealed that the majority of massive stars will interact with companions during their lives. However, knowledge of the binary properties of massive stars at low metallicity, which approaches the conditions of the Early Universe, remains sparse. We present the Binarity at LOw Metallicity (BLOeM) campaign - an ESO large programme designed to obtain 25 epochs of spectroscopy for 929 massive stars in the SMC - the lowest metallicity conditions in which multiplicity is probed to date (Z = 0.2 Zsun). BLOeM will provide (i) the binary fraction, (ii) the orbital configurations of systems with periods P &lt; 3 yr, (iii) dormant OB+BH binaries, and (iv) a legacy database of physical parameters of massive stars at low metallicity.
  The stars are observed with the LR02 setup of the giraffe instrument of the Very Large Telescope (3960-4570A, resolving power R=6200; typical signal-to-noise ratio S/N=70-100). This paper utilises the first 9 epochs obtained over a three-month time. We describe the survey and data reduction, perform a spectral classification of the stacked spectra, and construct a Hertzsprung-Russell diagram of the sample via spectral-type and photometric calibrations. The sample covers spectral types from O4 to F5, spanning the effective temperature and luminosity ranges 6.5&lt;Teff/kK&lt;45 and 3.7&lt;log L/Lsun&lt;6.1 and initial masses 8&lt;Mini/Msun&lt;80. It comprises 159 O-type stars, 324 early B-type (B0-3) dwarfs and giants (luminosity classes V-III), 309 early B-type supergiants (II-I), and 137 late-type supergiants. At least 75 stars are Oe/Be stars: 20 O-type and 55 B-type (13% and 10% of the respective samples). In addition, it includes four high-mass X-ray binaries, three stars resembling luminous blue variables, two bloated stripped-star candidates, two candidate magnetic stars, and 74 eclipsing binaries.</description>

Abstract: NASA's Great Observatories Maturation Program (GOMAP) will advance the science definition, technology, and workforce needed for the Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO) with the goal of a Phase A start by the end of the current decade. GOMAP offers long-term cost and schedule savings compared to the 'TRL 6 by Preliminary Design Review' paradigm historically adopted by large NASA missions. Many of the key technologies in the development queue for HWO require the combined activities of 1) facility and process development for validation of technologies at the scale required for HWO and 2) deployment in the 'real world' environment of mission Integration &amp; Test prior to on-orbit operations. We present a concept for the Smallsat Technology Accelerated Maturation Platform (STAMP), an integrated facility, laboratory, and instrument prototype development program that could be supported through the GOMAP framework and applied to any of NASA's Future Great Observatories (FGOs). This brief describes the recommendation for the first entrant into this program, "STAMP-1", an ESPA Grande-class mission advancing key technologies to enable the ultraviolet capabilities of HWO. STAMP-1 would advance new broadband optical coatings, high-sensitivity ultraviolet detector systems, and multi-object target selection technology to TRL 6 with a flight demonstration. STAMP-1 advances HWO technology on an accelerated timescale, building on current ROSES SAT+APRA programs, reducing cost and schedule risk for HWO while conducting a compelling program of preparatory science and workforce development with direct benefits for HWO mission implementation in the 2030s.</description>

      <title>Abundances of neutron-capture elements in selected solar-type stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of this study is to accurately determine the abundances of Cu, Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, and Ce in selected solar-type stars. This will allow us to establish observational abundance-metallicity and abundance-age relations and to explore the reasons for the excess of Ba compared to other s-elements in younger solar-type stars. We analysed HARPS spectra of main-sequence solar-type FGK stars with metallicities from -0.15 to +0.35 dex and ages from 2 to 14 Gyr using 1D LTE synthesis and MARCS atmospheric models. In the procedure of fitting synthetic to observed line profiles, the free parameters included abundance and microturbulent and macroturbulent velocity. The macroturbulent velocity can substantially compensate for NLTE effects in the line core. We find that the abundance [X/H] increases with metallicity and age. The ratio of the abundances of s-process elements [s/Fe] increases with decreasing metallicity and age, while the [Cu/Fe] ratio increases with both metallicity and age. These observed trends agree well with published observational data and with predictions from Galactic chemical evolution models. A small [Ba/Fe] enhancement of 0.08 +/- 0.08 dex has been detected in seven younger stars with an average age of 2.8 +/- 0.6 Gyr. Compared to the abundances of other s-process elements, [Ba/Fe] is 0.07 and 0.08 dex higher than La and Ce on average, respectively. Furthermore, we find that the [Ba/Fe] ratio increases with increasing chromospheric activity. The average [Ba/Fe] for the three most active stars is 0.15 +/- 0.10 dex higher than that of the other stars. Chromospheric activity can significantly alter the physical conditions in the formation layers of the Ba lines. Our primary conclusion is that to account for the observed excess of [Ba/Fe] abundance in younger stars, it is essential to use more complex atmospheric models that incorporate magnetic structures.</description>

      <title>The Role of Helical and Non-Helical Drives on the evolution of Self-Consistent Dynamos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14810v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the self-consistent dynamo limit, the magnetic feedback on the velocity field is sufficiently strong to induce a change in the topology of the magnetic field. Consequently, the magnetic energy reaches a state of non-linear saturation. Here, we investigate the role played by helical and non-helical drives in the triggering and the eventual saturation of a self-consistent dynamo. Evidence of small-scale dynamo (SSD) activity is found for both helical and non-helical forcing, driven at the largest possible scale. Based on the spectrum analysis, we find that the evolution of kinetic energy follows Kolmogorov's $k^-{\frac{5}{3}}$ law while that of magnetic energy follows Kazantsev's $k^{\frac{3}{2}}$ scaling. Also, we have verified that the aforementioned scalings remain valid for various magnetic Prandtl numbers (Pm). Statistical analysis is found to support our numerical finds.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Extinction Sky Survey (UVESS): A mission concept for probing the interstellar medium in the Milky Way and Local Group galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2175 {\AA} bump shows considerable variations in its strength, width, and central wavelength when observed along different sightlines in the Milky Way and other galaxies. These variations offer valuable insights into the composition, size distribution, and processing of interstellar dust grains along different sightlines. This paper introduces a mission concept called UVESS (Ultraviolet Extinction Sky Survey) aimed at exploring the composition of the interstellar medium (ISM) within both the Milky Way and nearby Local Group Galaxies by mapping the variation of UV extinction curve slopes and the 2175 {\AA} feature across a majority of the sky to gain insights into the makeup of the ISM. Recent advancements in UV instrumentation and technologies pave the way for the development of high-throughput instruments in compact form factors. In this paper, we outline mission science goals and instrument concept tailored for a small satellite-based platform dedicated to the study of UV extinction.</description>

      <title>CORINOS II. JWST-MIRI detection of warm molecular gas from an embedded, disk-bearing protostar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) Mid-InfraRed Instrument (MIRI) observations of warm CO and H$_2$O gas in emission toward the low-mass protostar IRAS 15398-3359, observed as part of the CORINOS program. The CO is detected via the rovibrational fundamental band and hot band near 5 $\mu$m, whereas the H$_2$O is detected in the rovibrational bending mode at 6-8 $\mu$m. Rotational analysis indicates that the CO originates in a hot reservoir of $1551\pm135$ K, while the water is much cooler at $212\pm 2$ K. Neither the CO nor the H$_2$O line images are significantly spatially extended, constraining the emission to within $\sim$40 au of the protostar. The compactness and high temperature of the CO are consistent with an origin in the embedded protostellar disk, or a compact disk wind. In contrast, the water must arise from a cooler region and requires a larger emitting area (compared to CO) to produce the observed fluxes. The water may arise from a more extended part of the disk, or from the inner portion of the outflow cavity. Thus, the origin of the molecular emission observed with JWST remains ambiguous. Better constraints on the overall extinction, comparison with realistic disk models, and future kinematically-resolved observations may all help to pinpoint the true emitting reservoirs.</description>

      <title>Shell mergers in the late stages of massive star evolution: new insight from 3D hydrodynamic simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15544v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One-dimensional (1D) stellar evolution models are widely used across various astrophysical fields, however they are still dominated by important uncertainties that deeply affect their predictive power. Among those, the merging of independent convective regions is a poorly understood phenomenon predicted by some 1D models but whose occurrence and impact in real stars remain very uncertain. Being an intrinsically multi-D phenomenon, it is challenging to predict the exact behaviour of shell mergers with 1D models. In this work, we conduct a detailed investigation of a multiple shell merging event in a 20 M$_\odot$ star using 3D hydrodynamic simulations. Making use of the active tracers for composition and the nuclear network included in the 3D model, we study the merging not only from a dynamical standpoint but also considering its nucleosynthesis and energy generation. Our simulations confirm the occurrence of the merging also in 3D, but reveal significant differences from the 1D case. Specifically, we identify entrainment and the erosion of stable regions as the main mechanisms that drive the merging, we predict much faster convective velocities compared to the mixing-length-theory velocities, and observe multiple burning phases within the same merged shell, with important effects for the chemical composition of the star, which presents a strongly asymmetric (dipolar) distribution. We expect that these differences will have important effects on the final structure of massive stars and thus their final collapse dynamics and possible supernova explosion, subsequently affecting the resulting nucleosynthesis and remnant.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15781v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that the initial clustering of supermassive primordial black holes (SMPBHs) beyond a Poisson distribution can efficiently enhance the matter power spectrum, and thus the halo mass function. As a result, the population of initially clustered SMPBHs with $M_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^9M_\odot$ and the fraction of energy density $f_{\rm PBH}\sim 10^{-3}$ (consistent with current constraints on SMPBHs) has the potential to naturally explain high-redshift massive galaxies observed by the James Webb Space Telescope.</description>

      <title>The Dependence of Galaxy Properties on the Underlying 3D Matter Density Field at 2.0 &lt; z &lt; 2.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the environmental effect of galaxy evolution as a function of the underlying 3D dark matter density for the first time at $z=2-2.5$, in which the underlying matter density is reconstructed from observed galaxies through dynamical forward modeling techniques. Utilizing this map, we investigate the dependence of the star formation activities and galaxy types (mergers, submillimeter galaxies, active galactic nuclei, and quiescent galaxies) on the matter overdensity $\Delta_\text{local}$ and stellar mass. For the first time, we are able to probe underdense regions ($\Delta_\text{local}&lt;1$) in addition to overdensities. We find that star formation activity generally depends on the stellar mass, not the matter density. We also find evidence that: (1) an absence of mergers and submillimeter galaxies in higher-density regions but otherwise no trend across lower-density bins, (2) the increase of active galactic nuclei and quiescent galaxy prevalence as a function of matter density, and (3) the increase of all aforementioned categories with the stellar mass. These results indicate that stellar mass is the main driver of galaxy evolution at the cosmic noon. Our novel approach directly using reconstructed dark matter density maps demonstrates the new capability of the environmental effect studies in galaxy evolution at higher redshift.</description>

      <title>Cluster Population Demographics in NGC 628 Derived from Stochastic Population Synthesis Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.05912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.05912v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The physical properties of star cluster populations offer valuable insights into their birth, evolution, and disruption. However, individual stars in clusters beyond the nearest neighbours of the Milky Way are unresolved, forcing analyses of star cluster demographics to rely on integrated light, a process fraught with uncertainty. Here we infer the demographics of the cluster population in the benchmark galaxy NGC 628 using data from the Legacy Extra-galactic UV Survey (LEGUS) coupled to a novel Bayesian forward-modelling technique. Our method analyzes all 1178 clusters in the LEGUS catalogue, $\sim4$ times more than prior studies severely affected by completeness cuts. Our results indicate that the cluster mass function is either significantly steeper than the commonly-observed slope of $-2$ or is truncated at $\approx 10^{4.5}$ M$_\odot$; the latter possibility is consistent with proposed relations between truncation mass and star formation surface density. We find that cluster disruption is relatively mild for the first $\approx 200$ Myr of cluster evolution; no evidence for mass-dependent disruption is found. We find suggestive but not incontrovertible evidence that inner galaxy clusters may be more prone to disruption and outer galaxy clusters have a more truncated mass function, but confirming or refuting these findings will require larger samples from future observations of outer galaxy clusters. Finally, we find that current stellar track and atmosphere models, along with common forms for cluster mass and age distributions, cannot fully capture all features in the multidimensional photometric distribution of star clusters. While our forward-modelling approach outperforms earlier backward-modeling approaches, some systematic differences persist between observed and modelled photometric distributions.</description>

      <title>Diverse Oxygen Abundance in Early Galaxies Unveiled by Auroral Line Analysis with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present deep JWST NIRSpec observations in the sightline of MACS J1149.5+2223, a massive cluster of galaxies at $z=0.54$. We report the spectroscopic redshift of 28 sources at $3&lt;z&lt;9.1$, including 9 sources with the detection of the [OIII]4363 auroral line. Combining these with 16 [OIII]4363-detected sources from publicly available JWST data, our sample consists of 25 galaxies with robust gas-phase metallicity measurements via the direct method. We observe a positive correlation between stellar mass and metallicity, with a $\sim0.5$\,dex offset down below the local relation. Interestingly, we find a larger than expected scatter of $\sim0.3$\,dex around the relation, which cannot be explained by redshift evolution among our sample or other third parameter. The scatter increases at higher redshift, and we attribute this to the enrichment process having higher stochasticity due to shallower potential wells, more intense feedback processes, and a higher galaxy merger rate. Despite reaching to a considerably low-mass regime ($\log M_*/M_\odot \sim7.3$), our samples have metallicity of $\log$(O/H)$+12&gt;7$, i.e. comparable to the most metal poor galaxies in the local Universe. The search of primordial galaxies may be accomplished by extending toward a lower mass and/or by investigating inhomogeneities at smaller spatial scales. Lastly, we investigate potential systematics caused by the limitation of JWST's MSA observations. Caution is warranted when the target exceeds the slit size, as this situation could allow an overestimation of ``global" metallicity, especially under the presence of strong negative metallicity gradient.</description>

Abstract: We report the serendipitous multiwavelength discovery of a candidate dual black hole system with a separation of ~100 pc, in the gas-rich luminous infrared galaxy MCG-03-34-64 (z=0.016). Hubble Space Telescope/ACS observations show three distinct optical centroids in the [O III] narrow-band and F814W images. Subsequent analysis of Chandra/ACIS data shows two spatially-resolved peaks of equal intensity in the neutral Fe Ka (6.2-6.6 keV) band, while high-resolution radio continuum observations with the Very Large Array at 8.46 GHz (3.6 cm band) show two spatially-coincident radio peaks. Fast shocks as the ionizing source seem unlikely, given the energies required for production of Fe Ka. If confirmed, the separation of ~100 pc would represent the closest dual AGN reported to date with spatially-resolved, multiwavelength observations.</description>

      <title>Strong-lensing and kinematic analysis of CASSOWARY 31: can strong lensing constrain the masses of multi-plane lenses?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13205v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mass measurement for the secondary lens along the line of sight (LoS) in the multi-plane strong lens modeling of the group-scale lens CASSOWARY 31 (CSWA 31). The secondary lens at redshift $z = 1.49$ is a spiral galaxy well aligned along the LoS with the main lens at $z = 0.683$. Using the MUSE integral-field spectroscopy of this spiral galaxy, we measure its rotation velocities and determine the mass from the gas kinematics. We compare the mass estimation of the secondary lens from the lensing models to the mass measurement from kinematics, finding that the predictions from strong lensing tend to be higher. By introducing an additional lens plane at $z = 1.36$ for an overdensity known to be present, we find a mass of $\simeq 10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ enclosed within 3.3 kpc from the centroid of the spiral galaxy, approaching the estimate from kinematics. This shows that secondary-lens mass measurements from multiple-plane modeling are affected by systematic uncertainties from the degeneracies between lens planes and the complex LoS structure. Conducting a detailed analysis of the LoS structures is therefore essential to improve the mass measurement of the secondary lens.</description>

      <title>A Stellar Dynamical Mass Measurement of the Supermassive Black Hole in NGC 3258</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a stellar dynamical mass measurement of the supermassive black hole in the elliptical (E1) galaxy NGC 3258. Our findings are based on integral field unit spectroscopy from the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) observations in narrow-field mode with adaptive optics and the MUSE wide-field mode, from which we extract kinematic information by fitting the Ca II and Mg $b$ triplets, respectively. Using axisymmetric, three-integral Schwarzschild orbit library models, we fit the observed line-of-sight velocity distributions to infer the supermassive black hole mass, the $H$-band mass-to-light ratio, the asymptotic circular velocity, and the dark matter halo scale radius of the galaxy. We report a black hole mass of $(2.2 \pm 0.2)\times10^9 \ \rm M_{\scriptscriptstyle\odot}$ at an assumed distance of $31.9 \ \rm Mpc$. This value is in close agreement with a previous measurement from Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array CO observations. The consistency between these two measurements provides strong support for both the gas dynamical and stellar dynamical methods.</description>

      <title>One Small Step for $Roman$; One Giant Leap for Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06484v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The $Roman$ microlensing program can detect and fully characterize black holes (BHs) that are in orbit with about 30 million solar-type and evolved stars with periods up to the mission lifetime $P&lt;T=5$ yr, and semi-major axes $a&gt;0.2$au, i.e., $P&gt; 10$ d $(M/M_\odot)^{-1/2}$, where $M$ is the BH mass. For BH companions of about 150 million later (fainter) main-sequence stars, the threshold of detection is $a&gt;0.2$ au $\times 10^{(H_{\rm Vega}-18.5)/5}$. The present $Roman$ scheduling creates a "blind spot" near periods of $P=3.5$ yr due to a 2.3-year gap in the data. It also compromises the characterization of BHs in eccentric orbits with periods $P&gt;3$ yr and peribothra within a year of the mission midpoint. I show that one can greatly ameliorate these issues by making a small adjustment to the $Roman$ observing schedule. The present schedule aims to optimize proper-motion measurements, but the adjustment proposed here would degrade these by only 4%-9%. For many cases of $P&gt;90$ d BHs, there will be discrete and/or continuous degeneracies. For G-dwarf and evolved sources, it will be straightforward to resolve these by radial-velocity (RV) follow-up observations, but such observations will be more taxing for fainter sources. Many BH-binaries in orbits of 5 yr $&lt;P&lt;10$ yr will be reliably identified as such from the $Roman$ data, but will lack precise orbits. Nevertheless, the full orbital solutions can be recovered by combining $Roman$ astrometry with RV followup observations. BH binaries with periods 10 yr $&lt;P&lt;$ 95 yr $(M/10 M_\odot)^{1/4}$ can be detected from their astrometric acceleration, but massive multi-fiber RV monitoring would be needed to distinguish them from the astrophysical background due to stellar binaries.</description>

      <title>CircleZ: Reliable Photometric redshifts for AGN computed using only photometry from Legacy Survey Imaging for DESI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10788</link>

Abstract: (abridged)Photometric redshifts for AGN (galaxies hosting an accreting supermassive black hole in their center) are notoriously challenging and currently better computed via SED fitting, assuming that deep photometry for many wavelengths is available. However, for AGN detected all-sky, the photometry is limited and provided by different projects. This makes the task of homogenising the data challenging and is a dramatic drawback for the millions of AGN that wide surveys like SRG/eROSITA will detect. This work aims to compute reliable photometric redshifts for X-ray-detected AGN using only one dataset that covers a large area: the 10th Data Release of the Imaging Legacy Survey (LS10) for DESI. LS10 provides deep grizW1-W4 forced photometry within various apertures, thus avoids issues related to the cross-calibration of surveys. We present the results from CircleZ, a machine-learning algorithm based on a Fully Connected Neural Network. CircleZ uses training sample of 14,000 X-ray-detected AGN and utilizes multi-aperture photometry. The accuracy and the fraction of outliers reached in a test sample of 2913 AGN are 0.067 and 11.6%, respectively. The results are comparable to or better than those obtained previously for the same field but with much less effort. We further tested the stability of the results by computing the photometric redshifts for the sources detected in CSC2 and Chandra-COSMOS Legacy, reaching comparable accuracy as in eFEDS when limiting the magnitude of the counterparts with respect to the depth of LS10. The method applies to fainter samples of AGN using deeper optical data from future surveys (e.g., LSST, Euclid), granted LS10-like information on the light distribution beyond a morphological type is provided. With the paper, we release an updated version of the photometric redshifts (including errors and probability distribution function) for eROSITA/eFEDS.</description>

      <title>Acceleration fluctuations of dark matter and the origin of MOND acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05606v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on the velocity and acceleration fluctuations and distributions of cold dark matter particles that involve long-range gravitational interactions. For comparison, in the kinetic theory of gases, molecules undergo random elastic collisions involving a short-range interaction, where only velocity fluctuations are relevant that follows a Maxwellian-Boltzmann distribution. Long-range gravity requires a broad size of haloes to be formed. Hierarchical structure formation proceeds through the merging of smaller haloes to form larger haloes, which facilitates a continuous energy cascade from small- to large-scale haloes at a constant rate of $\varepsilon_u\approx -10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$. The velocity fluctuation involves a critical velocity $u_c$, and the acceleration fluctuation involves a critical acceleration $a_c$. The two critical quantities are related by the rate of the energy cascade as $\varepsilon_{u}\approx -{a_c u_c/[2(3\pi)^2]}$, where the factor $3\pi$ is from the angle of incidence during the merging. With a typical velocity dispersion of $u_c$ on the order of 500km/s at $z=0$, the critical acceleration is found to be $a_{c0}\equiv a_c(z=0) \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ at $z=0$ with a redshift dependence $a_{c} \propto (1+z)^{3/4}$ that is greater at higher redshift. This suggests that the critical acceleration $a_c$ might explain the universal acceleration $a_0 \approx 10^{-10}$m/s$^2$ in the empirical Tully-Fisher relation or modified Newtonian dynamics (MOND). The redshift evolution of $a_0 \propto (1+z)^{3/4}$ is also proposed and validated by this work, Magneticum, and EAGLE simulations. Future work on the high-redshift Tully-Fisher relation will provide more insight. A notable coincidence of dark energy density $\rho_{\Lambda} \propto {a_{c0}^{2}/G}$ might suggest an entropic origin of dark energy from the fluctuations of dark matter accelerations.</description>

      <title>Detecting the tidal heating with the generic extreme-mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15532v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The horizon of a classical black hole (BH), functioning as a one-way membrane, plays a vital role in the dynamic evolution of binary BHs, capable of absorbing fluxes entirely. Tidal heating, stemming from this phenomenon, exerts a notable influence on the production of gravitational waves(GWs). If at least one member of a binary is an exotic compact object (ECO) instead of a BH, the absorption of fluxes is expected to be incomplete and the tidal heating would be different. Thus, tidal heating can be utilized for model-independent investigations into the nature of compact object. In this paper, assuming that the extreme-mass-ratio inspiral (EMRI) contains a stellar-mass compact object orbiting around a massive ECO with a reflective surface, we compute the GWs from the generic EMRI orbits. Using the accurate and analytic flux formulas in the black hole spacetime, we adapted these formulas in the vicinity of the ECO surface by incorporating a reflectivity parameter. Under the adiabatic approximation, we can evolve the orbital parameters and compute the EMRI waveforms. The effect of tidal heating for the spinning and non-spinning objects can be used to constrain the reflectivity of the surface at the level of 10^-6 by computing the mismatch and fisher information matrix.</description>

      <title>Anomalous contribution to galactic rotation curves due to stochastic spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19459v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a proposed alternative to quantum gravity, in which the spacetime metric is treated as classical, even while matter fields remain quantum. Consistency of the theory necessarily requires that the metric evolve stochastically. Here, we show that this stochastic behaviour leads to a modification of general relativity at low accelerations. In the low acceleration regime, the variance in the acceleration produced by the gravitational field is high in comparison to that produced by the Newtonian potential, and can act as an entropic force, causing a deviation from Einstein's theory of general relativity. We show that in this "diffusion regime", the entropic force acts from a gravitational point of view, as if it were a contribution to the matter distribution. We compute modifications to the expectation value of the metric via the path integral formalism, and find an anomalous contribution which corresponds to a cosmological constant, anti-correlated with a contribution which has been used to fit galactic rotation curves without dark matter. We caution that a greater understanding of this effect is needed before conclusions can be drawn, most likely through numerical simulations, and provide a template for computing the deviation from general relativity which serves as an experimental signature of the Brownian motion of spacetime.</description>

      <title>Ba Enrichment in Gaia MS+WD Binaries: Tracing $s$-Process Element Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A large population of intermediate-separation binaries, consisting of a main-sequence (MS) star and a white dwarf (WD), has recently emerged from Gaia's third data release (DR3), posing challenges to current models of binary evolution. Here we examine the $s$-process element abundances in these systems using data from GALAH DR3. Following refined sample analysis with parameter estimates based on GALAH spectra, we find a distinct locus where enhanced $s$-process elements depend on both the WD mass and metallicity, consistent with loci identified in previous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) nucleosynthesis studies with higher $s$-process yields. Notably, these enhanced abundances show no correlation with the systems' orbital parameters, supporting a history of accretion in intermediate-separation MS+WD systems. Consequently, our results form a direct observational evidence of a connection between AGB masses and $s$-process yields. We conclude by showing that the GALAH DR3 survey includes numerous Ba dwarf stars, within and beyond the mass range covered in our current sample, which can further elucidate $s$-process element distributions in MS+WD binaries.</description>
