      <title>Proof of the Spacetime Penrose Inequality With Suboptimal Constant in the Asymptotically Flat and Asymptotically Hyperboloidal Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish mass lower bounds of Penrose-type in the setting of $3$-dimensional initial data sets for the Einstein equations satisfying the dominant energy condition, which are either asymptotically flat or asymptotically hyperboloidal. More precisely, the lower bound consists of a universal constant multiplied by the square root of the minimal area required to enclose the outermost apparent horizon. Here the outermost apparent horizon may contain both marginally outer trapped (MOTS) and marginally inner trapped (MITS) components. The proof is based on the harmonic level set approach to the positive mass theorem, combined with the Jang equation and techniques arising from the stability argument of Dong-Song \cite{Dong-Song}. As a corollary, we also obtain a version of the Penrose inequality for 3-dimensional asymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian manifolds.</description>

      <title>Allard's interior $\varepsilon$-Regularity Theorem in Alexandrov spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove Allard's Interior $\varepsilon$-Regularity Theorem for $m$-dimensional varifolds with generalized mean curvature in $L^p_{loc}$, for $p&gt;m$, in Alexandrov spaces of dimension $n$ with double-sided bounded intrinsic sectional curvature. We first give an intrinsic proof of this theorem in the case of varifolds in Riemannian manifolds of dimension $n$ whose metric tensor is at least of class $\mathcal{C}^2$, without using Nash's Isometric Embedding Theorem. This approach provides explicitly computable constants that depend only on $n$, $m$, the injectivity radius and bounds on the sectional curvature, which is essential for proving our main theorem, as we establish it through a density argument in the topological space of Riemannian manifolds with positive lower bounds on the injectivity radius and double-sided bounds on sectional curvature, equipped with the $\mathcal{C}^{1,\alpha}$ topology, for every $\alpha \in ]0,1[$ (in fact, it is enough with the $W^{2,q}$ topology for some suitable $q$ large enough).</description>

      <title>Conformally Invariant Dirac Equation with Non-Local Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a conformally invariant equation involving the Dirac operator and a non-linearity of convolution type. This non-linearity is inspired from the conformal Einstein-Dirac problem in dimension 4. We first investigate the compactness, bubbling and energy quantization of the associated energy functional then we characterize the ground state solutions of the problem on the standard sphere. As a consequence, we prove an Aubin-type inequality that assures the existence of solutions to our problem and in particular the conformal Einstein-Dirac problem in dimension 4. Moreover, we investigate the effect of a linear perturbation to our problem, leading us to a Brezis-Nirenberg type result.</description>

      <title>Sasaki-Einstein orbits in compact Hermitian symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the present papar is to study the orbits of the isotropy gourp action on an irreducible Hermitian symmetric space of compact type. Specifically, we examine the properties of these orbits as {\it CR} submanifolds of a K\"{a}hler manifold. Our focus is on the leaves of the totally real distribution, and we investigate the properties of leaves as a Riemannian submanifold. In particular, we prove that any leaf is a totally geodesic submanifold of the orbit. Additionally, we explore the conditions under which each leaf becomes a totally geodesic submanifold of the ambient space. The integrability of the complex distribution is also studied. Moreover, we analyze a contact structure of orbits where the rank of the totally real distribution is 1. We obtain a classification of the orbits that possess either a contact structure or a Sasakian structure compatible with the complex structure on the ambient space. Furthermore, we classify those Sasaki orbits that are Einstein with respect to the induced metric. Specifically, we completely detemine Sasaki-Einstein orbits.</description>

      <title>An example of non-compact totally complex submanifolds of compact quaternionic K\"{a}hler symmetric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Totally complex submanifolds of a quaternionic K\"{a}hler manifold are analogous to complex submanifolds of a K\"{a}hler manifold. In this paper, we construct an example of a non-compact totally complex submanifold of maximal dimension of a compact quaternionic K\"{a}hler symmetric space, except for quaternionic projective spaces. A compact Lie group acts on our example isometrically, and this action is of cohomogeneity one. Our example is a holomorphic line bundle over some Hermitian symmetric space of compact type. Moreover, each fiber is a totally geodesic submanifold of the ambient quaternionic K\"{a}hler symmetric space and our example is a ruled submanifold. Our construction relies on the action of a subgroup of the isometry group and a maximal totally geodesic sphere with maximal sectional curvature known as a Helgason sphere. Furthermore, we prove that there exist no compact submanifolds of the same dimension that contain our example as an open part, except where the ambient quaternionic K\"{a}hler symmetric space is a complex Grassmannian.</description>

      <title>On the completeness problem of homogeneous Lorentz 3-dimensional spaces, Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider 3-dimensional solvable Lie groups given by a semi-direct product $\mathbb{R}\ltimes_A\mathbb{R}^2$, where $A$ is a nonzero real $2\times2$ diagonalizable matrix. The completeness problem has been addressed in the literature for two limiting cases: the unimodular Lie group $\mathrm{Sol}$ and the homothetic Lie group $\mathrm{Ho}$. In this work, we solve the completeness problem of left-invariant Lorentzian metrics on the remaining Lie groups of the given form. Moreover, we show that every 3-dimensional non-unimodular Lie group has an incomplete left-invariant metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11041v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider numerical characteristics of the connected compact Riemannian manifold (M, g) such as the supremum and infimum of the scalar curvature s, Ricci curvature Ric and sectional curvature sec, as well as their applications. Below are two examples of proven results. The first statement: If (M, g) be a connected, compact Riemannian manifold of even dimension n &gt; 3 whose Ricci and sectional curvatures satisfy the strict inequality n Inf (sec) &gt; Sup (Ric), then M is diffeomorphic to the Euclidean n-dimensional sphere of some radius r or the real projective n-dimensional space. The second statement: There is no harmonic immersion of an n-dimensional connected, complete Riemannian manifold (M, g) into the Euclidean n-sphere of radius r if there exists inf(Ric) such that Inf (Ric) &gt; n/2r^2.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study Lorentzian homogeneous metrics on almost abelian Lie groups of dimensions larger than three. An almost abelian Lie group is a Lie group whose Lie algebra has a codimension one abelian ideal. Ricci-flat and non-flat conditions on the Lie algebra are derived. In particular, we generalize the four-dimensional Petrov solution to arbitrarily higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: The classification of the Einstein spaces with the Stackel metric of the (3.0) has been done. These spaces are invariant under the action of the three-parameter abelian group of motions and belong to the first type Bianchi spaces. Thus the classification of vacuum and electrovacuum Stackel spaces of all types is completed and the complete list of metrics of such spaces in privileged coordinate systems is given.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the path space of a differentiable manifold is diffeomorphic to a Fr\'echet space, endowing the path space with a linear structure. Furthermore, the base point preserving mapping space consisting of maps from a cube to a differentiable manifold is also diffeomorphic to a Fr\'echet space. As a corollary of a more general theorem, we prove that the path fibration becomes a fibre bundle for manifolds M. Additionally, we discuss the mapping space from a compact topological space to a differentiable manifold, demonstrating that this space admits the structure of a smooth Banach manifold.</description>

      <title>Wonderful Blow-Ups of Weighted Building Sets and Configuration Spaces of Filtered Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fulton and MacPherson famously constructed a configuration space that encodes infinitesimal collision data by blowing up the diagonals. We observe that when generalizing their approach to configuration spaces of filtered manifolds (e.g. jet spaces or sub-Riemannian manifolds), these blow-ups have to be modified with weights in order for the collisions to be compatible with higher-order data.
  In the present article, we provide a general framework for blowing up arrangements of submanifolds that are equipped with a weighting in the sense of Loizides and Meinrenken. We prove in particular smoothness of the blow-up under reasonable assumptions, extending a result of Li to the weighted setting. Our discussion covers both spherical and projective blow-ups, as well as the (restricted) functoriality of the construction.
  Alongside a self-contained introduction to weightings, we also give a new characterization thereof in terms of their vanishing ideals and prove that cleanly intersecting weightings locally yield a weighting.
  As our main application, we construct configuration spaces of filtered manifolds, including convenient local models. We also discuss a variation of the construction tailored to certain fiber bundles equipped with a filtration. This is necessary for the special case of jet configuration spaces, which we investigate in a future article.</description>

      <title>Standard bubbles (and other M\"obius-flat partitions) on model spaces are stable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We verify that for all $n \geq 3$ and $2 \leq k \leq n+1$, the standard $k$-bubble clusters, conjectured to be minimizing total perimeter in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\mathbb{S}^n$ and $\mathbb{H}^n$, are stable -- an infinitesimal regular perturbation preserving volume to first order yields a non-negative second variation of area modulo the volume constraint. In fact, stability holds for all standard $\textit{partitions}$, in which several cells are allowed to have infinite volume. In the Gaussian setting, any partition in $\mathbb{G}^n$ ($n\geq 2$) obeying Plateau's laws and whose interfaces are all $\textit{flat}$, is stable. Our results apply to non-standard partitions as well - starting with any (regular) flat Voronoi partition in $\mathbb{S}^n$ and applying M\"obius transformations and stereographic projections, the resulting partitions in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $\mathbb{S}^n$ and $\mathbb{H}^n$ are stable. Our proof relies on a new conjugated Brascamp-Lieb inequality on partitions with conformally flat umbilical boundary, and the construction of a good conformally flattening boundary potential.</description>

      <title>Isometric Surfaces in Isotropic 3-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the notion of isometric deformations of surfaces is straightforward for surfaces with Euclidean metric, a corresponding notion in isotropic space has been missing. By making Gauss' Theorema Egregium a necessary condition we develop a sensible notion of isometric surfaces in isotropic space. The well-known examples in Euclidean space, like isometries within the associated family of minimal surfaces, Bour's theorem, and Minding isometries, find their natural analogues in isotropic space. We also include an extensive treatment of infinitesimal flexibility, or infinitesimal deformation, of surfaces. We prove results for the isotropic displacement diagrams in analogy to its well-known counterparts in Euclidean space culminating in the existence of an isotropic Darboux wreath consisting of six surfaces. We show several interesting relations for special parametrizations involving Koenigs and Voss nets of smooth and discrete surfaces within the Darboux wreath and we encounter surfaces of constant Gaussian and mean curvature. At several occasions, we point to connections to statics as the isotropic space is a natural language to describe the Airy stress function.</description>

Abstract: Complex (affine) lines are a major object of study in complex geometry, but their symplectic aspects are not well understood. We perform a systematic study based on their associated Ahlfors currents. In particular, we generalize (by a different method) a result of Bangert on the existence of complex lines. We show that Ahlfors currents control the asymptotic behavior of families of pseudoholomorphic curves, refining a result of Demailly. Lastly, we show that the space of Ahlfors currents is convex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to investigate the fractional combinatorial Calabi flow for hyperbolic bordered surfaces. By Lyapunov theory, it is proved that the flow exists for all time and converges exponentially to a conformal factor that generates a hyperbolic surface whose lengths of boundary components are prescribed positive numbers. Furthermore, a generalized combinatorial Yamabe flow is introduced in the same geometry setting, with the long time existence and convergence established. This result yields an algorithm for searching bordered surfaces, which may accelerate convergence speed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.09361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For conformal geometries of Riemannian signature, we provide a comprehensive and explicit treatment of the core local theory for embedded submanifolds of arbitrary dimension. This is based in the conformal tractor calculus and includes a conformally invariant Gauss formula leading to conformal versions of the Gauss, Codazzi, and Ricci equations. It provides the tools for proliferating submanifold conformal invariants, as well for extending to conformally singular Riemannian manifolds the notions of mean curvature and of minimal and CMC submanifolds. A notion of distinguished submanifold is defined by asking the tractor second fundamental form to vanish. We show that for the case of curves this exactly characterises conformal geodesics (a.k.a. conformal circles) while for hypersurfaces it is the totally umbilic condition. So, for other codimensions, this unifying notion interpolates between these extremes, and we prove that in all dimensions this coincides with the submanifold being weakly conformally circular, meaning that ambient conformal circles remain in the submanifold. Stronger notions of conformal circularity are then characterised similarly and an extensive collection of examples are provided. Next we provide a very general theory and construction of quantities that are necessarily conserved along distinguished submanifolds. This first integral theory vastly generalises the results available for conformal circles in [56]. We prove that any normal solution to an equation from the class of first BGG equations yields such conserved quantities, and show that it is easy to provide explicit formulae for these. Finally we prove that the property of being distinguished is also captured by a type of moving incidence relation and use this to show that, for suitable solutions of conformal Killing-Yano equations, the zero locus of the solution is necessarily a distinguished submanifold.</description>

      <title>Topological consequences of null-geodesic refocusing and applications to $Z^x$ manifolds</title>

Abstract: Let $(M,h)$ be a connected, complete Riemannian manifold, let $x\in M$ and $l&gt;0$. Then $M$ is called a $Z^x$ manifold if all geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ and it is called a $Y^x_l$ manifold if every unit-speed geodesic starting at $x$ returns to $x$ at time $l$. It is unknown whether there are $Z^x$ manifolds that are not $Y^x_l$-manifolds for some $l&gt;0$. By the B\'erard-Bergery theorem, any $Y^x_l$ manifold of dimension at least $2$ is compact with finite fundamental group. We prove the same result for $Z^x$ manifolds $M$ for which all unit-speed geodesics starting at $x$ return to $x$ in uniformly bounded time. We also prove that any $Z^x$ manifold $(M,h)$ with $h$ analytic is a $Y^x_l$ manifold for some $l&gt;0$. We start by defining a class of globally hyperbolic spacetimes (called observer-refocusing) such that any $Z^x$ manifold is the Cauchy surface of some observer-refocusing spacetime. We then prove that under suitable conditions the Cauchy surfaces of observer-refocusing spacetimes are compact with finite fundamental group and show that analytic observer-refocusing spacetimes of dimension at least $3$ are strongly refocusing. We end by stating a contact-theoretic conjecture analogous to our results in Riemannian and Lorentzian geometry.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems and applications</title>

Abstract: This paper provides a practical approach to stochastic Lie systems, i.e. stochastic differential equations whose general solutions can be written as a function depending only on a generic family of particular solutions and some constants related to initial conditions. We correct the stochastic Lie theorem characterising stochastic Lie systems proving that, contrary to previous claims, it retains its classical form in the Stratonovich approach. Meanwhile, we show that the form of stochastic Lie systems may significantly differ from the classical one in the It\^{o} formalism. New generalisations of stochastic Lie systems, like the so-called stochastic foliated Lie systems, are devised. Subsequently, we focus on stochastic Lie systems that are Hamiltonian systems relative to different geometric structures. Special attention is paid to the symplectic case. We study their stability properties and devise the basics of a stochastic energy-momentum method. A stochastic Poisson coalgebra method is developed to derive superposition rules for Hamiltonian stochastic Lie systems. Potential applications of our results are shown for biological stochastic models, stochastic oscillators, stochastic Lotka--Volterra systems, Palomba--Goodwin models, among others. Our findings complement previous approaches by using stochastic differential equations instead of deterministic equations designed to grasp some of the features of models of stochastic nature.</description>

      <title>Obstruction Theory for Bigraded Differential Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.06590v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an obstruction theory for Hirsch extensions of cbba's with twisted coefficients. This leads to a variety of applications, including a structural theorem for minimal cbba's, a construction of relative minimal models with twisted coefficients, as well as a proof of uniqueness. These results are further employed to study automorphism groups of minimal cbba's and to characterize formality in terms of grading automorphisms.</description>
