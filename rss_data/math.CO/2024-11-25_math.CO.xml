      <title>An Amalgamation Nim with Restriction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an amalgamation Nim, players are allowed to use a move from the traditional form of Nim or to amalgamate two piles when they are not empty. No formula that describes the set of P-positions of Amalgamation Nim is known. The author gives a condition on the amalgamation of two piles. Players can amalgamate two piles only when the number of stones in these two piles is equal to or more than 2. Then, we get a formula that describes the set of P-positions for this variant of amalgamation Nim.</description>

      <title>A canonical Ramsey theorem for even cycles in random graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celebrated canonical Ramsey theorem of Erd\H{o}s and Rado implies that for $2\leq k\in \mathbb{N}$, any colouring of the edges of $K_n$ with $n$ sufficiently large gives a copy of $C_{2k}$ which has one of three canonical colour patterns: monochromatic, rainbow or lexicographic. In this paper we show that if $p=\omega(n^{-1+1/(2k-1)}\log n)$, then ${\mathbf{G}}(n,p)$ will asymptotically almost surely also have the property that any colouring of its edges induces canonical copies of $C_{2k}$. This determines the threshold for the canonical Ramsey property with respect to even cycles, up to a $\log$ factor.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of a Hamming ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the eigenvalues and the eigenspaces of the adjacency matrices of subgraphs of the Hamming cube induced by Hamming balls, and more generally, by a union of adjacent concentric Hamming spheres.
  As a corollary, we extend the range of cardinalities of subsets of the Hamming cube for which Hamming balls have essentially the largest maximal eigenvalue (among all subsets of the same size). We show that this holds even when the sets in question are large, with cardinality which is an arbitrary subconstant fraction of the whole cube.</description>

      <title>Combining the theorems of Tur\'an and de Bruijn-Erd\H os</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fix an integer $s \ge 2$. Let $\mathcal{P}$ be a set of $n$ points and let $\mathcal{L}$ be a set of lines in a linear space such that no line in $\mathcal{L}$ contains more than $(n-1)/(s-1)$ points of $\mathcal{P}$. Suppose that for every $s$-set $S$ in $\mathcal{P}$, there is a pair of points in $S$ that lies in a line from $\mathcal{L}$. We prove that $|\mathcal{L}| \ge (n-1)/(s-1)+s-1$ for $n$ large, and this is sharp when $n-1$ is a multiple of $s-1$. This generalizes the de Bruijn-Erd\H os theorem which is the case $s=2$. Our result is proved in the more general setting of linear hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Spreading in claw-free cubic graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p \in \mathbb{N}$ and $q \in \mathbb{N} \cup \lbrace \infty \rbrace$. We study a dynamic coloring of the vertices of a graph $G$ that starts with an initial subset $S$ of blue vertices, with all remaining vertices colored white. If a white vertex~$v$ has at least~$p$ blue neighbors and at least one of these blue neighbors of~$v$ has at most~$q$ white neighbors, then by the spreading color change rule the vertex~$v$ is recolored blue. The initial set $S$ of blue vertices is a $(p,q)$-spreading set for $G$ if by repeatedly applying the spreading color change rule all the vertices of $G$ are eventually colored blue. The $(p,q)$-spreading set is a generalization of the well-studied concepts of $k$-forcing and $r$-percolating sets in graphs. For $q \ge 2$, a $(1,q)$-spreading set is exactly a $q$-forcing set, and the $(1,1)$-spreading set is a $1$-forcing set (also called a zero forcing set), while for $q = \infty$, a $(p,\infty)$-spreading set is exactly a $p$-percolating set. The $(p,q)$-spreading number, $\sigma_{(p,q)}(G)$, of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of a $(p,q)$-spreading set. In this paper, we study $(p,q)$-spreading in claw-free cubic graphs. While the zero-forcing number of claw-free cubic graphs was studied earlier, for each pair of values $p$ and $q$ that are not both $1$ we either determine the $(p,q)$-spreading number of a claw-free cubic graph $G$ or show that $\sigma_{(p,q)}(G)$ attains one of two possible values.</description>

      <title>Construction of Toroidal Polyhedra corresponding to perfect Chains of wild Tetrahedra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1957, Steinhaus proved that a chain of regular tetrahedra, meeting face-to-face and forming a closed loop does not exist. Over the years, various modifications of this statement have been considered and analysed. Weakening the statement by only requiring the tetrahedra of a chain to be wild, i.e. having all faces congruent, results in various examples of such chains. In this paper, we elaborate on the construction of these chains of wild tetrahedra. We therefore introduce the notions of chains and clusters of wild tetrahedra and relate these structures to simplicial surfaces. We establish that clusters and chains of wild tetrahedra can be described by polyhedra in Euclidean 3-space. As a result, we present methods to construct toroidal polyhedra arising from chains and provide a census of such toroidal polyhedra consisting of up to 20 wild tetrahedra. Here, we classify toroidal polyhedra with respect to self-intersections and reflection symmetries. We further prove the existence of an infinite family of toroidal polyhedra emerging from chains of wild tetrahedra and present clusters of wild tetrahedra that yield polyhedra of higher genera.</description>

      <title>Reasonable Bounds for Combinatorial Lines of Length Three</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that any subset $A \subseteq [3]^n$ with $3^{-n}|A| \ge (\log\log\log\log n)^{-c}$ contains a combinatorial line of length $3$, i.e., $x, y, z \in A$, not all equal, with $x_i=y_i=z_i$ or $(x_i,y_i,z_i)=(0,1,2)$ for all $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$. This improves on the previous best bound of $3^{-n}|A| \ge \Omega((\log^* n)^{-1/2})$ of [D.H.J. Polymath, Ann. of Math. 2012].</description>

      <title>Transformation representations of diagram monoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain formulae for the minimum transformation degrees of the most well-studied families of finite diagram monoids, including the partition, Brauer, Temperley--Lieb and Motzkin monoids. For example, the partition monoid $\mathcal P_n$ has degree $1 + \frac{B(n+2)-B(n+1)+B(n)}2$ for $n\geq2$, where these are Bell numbers. The proofs involve constructing explicit faithful representations of the minimum degree, many of which can be realised as (partial) actions on projections.</description>

      <title>The independence polynomial on recursive sequences of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14791v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the zero sets of the independence polynomial on recursive sequences of graphs. We prove that for a maximally independent starting graph and a stable and expanding recursion algorithm, the zeros of the independence polynomial are uniformly bounded. Each of the recursion algorithms leads to a rational dynamical system whose formula, degree and the dimension of the space it acts upon depend on the specific algorithm. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that the qualitative behavior of the dynamics exhibit universal features that can be exploited to draw conclusions about the zero sets.</description>

      <title>On Approximability of Satisfiable $k$-CSPs: VI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove local and global inverse theorems for general $3$-wise correlations over pairwise-connected distributions. Let $\mu$ be a distribution over $\Sigma \times \Gamma \times \Phi$ such that the supports of $\mu_{xy}$, $\mu_{xz}$, and $\mu_{yz}$ are all connected, and let $f: \Sigma^n \to \mathbb{C}$, $g: \Gamma^n \to \mathbb{C}$, $h: \Phi^n \to \mathbb{C}$ be $1$-bounded functions satisfying \[ \left|\mathbb{E}_{(x,y,z) \sim \mu^{\otimes n}}[f(x)g(y)h(z)]\right| \geq \varepsilon. \] In this setting, our local inverse theorem asserts that there is $\delta :=\textsf{exp}(-\varepsilon^{-O_{\mu}(1)})$ such that with probability at least $\delta$, a random restriction of $f$ down to $\delta n$ coordinates $\delta$-correlates to a product function. To get a global inverse theorem, we prove a restriction inverse theorem for general product functions, stating that if a random restriction of $f$ down to $\delta n$ coordinates is $\delta$-correlated with a product function with probability at least $\delta$, then $f$ is $2^{-\textsf{poly}(\log(1/\delta))}$-correlated with a function of the form $L\cdot P$, where $L$ is a function of degree $\textsf{poly}(1/\delta)$, $\|L\|_2\leq 1$, and $P$ is a product function.
  We show applications to property testing and to additive combinatorics. In particular, we show the following result via a density increment argument. Let $\Sigma$ be a finite set and $S \subseteq \Sigma \times \Sigma \times \Sigma$ such that: (1) $(x, x, x) \in S$ for all $x \in S$, and (2) the supports of $S_{xy}$, $S_{xz}$, and $S_{yz}$ are all connected. Then, any set $A \subseteq \Sigma^n$ with $|\Sigma|^{-n}|A| \geq \Omega((\log \log \log n)^{-c})$ contains $x, y, z \in A$, not all equal, such that $(x_i,y_i,z_i) \in S$ for all $i$. This gives the first reasonable bounds for the restricted 3-AP problem over finite fields.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15136v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Sigma_1,\ldots,\Sigma_k$ be finite alphabets, and let $\mu$ be a distribution over $\Sigma_1 \times \dots \times \Sigma_k$ in which the probability of each atom is at least $\alpha$. We prove that if $\mu$ does not admit Abelian embeddings, and $f_i: \Sigma_i \to \mathbb{C}$ are $1$-bounded functions (for $i=1,\ldots,k$) such that \[ \left|\mathbb{E}_{(x_1,\dots,x_k) \sim \mu^{\otimes n}}\Big[f_1(x_1) \dots f_k(x_k)\Big]\right| \geq \varepsilon, \] then there exists $L\colon \Sigma_1^n\to\mathbb{C}$ of degree at most $d$ and $\|L\|_2\leq 1$ such that $|\langle f_1, L\rangle|\geq \delta$, where $d$ and $\delta&gt;0$ depend only on $k, \alpha$ and $\varepsilon$. This answers the analytic question posed by Bhangale, Khot, and Minzer (STOC 2022). We also prove several extensions of this result that are useful in subsequent applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00574v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2004, Rosas and Sagan developed the theory of symmetric functions in noncommuting variables, achieving results analogous to classical symmetric functions. On the other hand, in 2004, Desrosiers, Lapointe and Mathieu introduced the theory of symmetric functions in superspace, which involve both commuting and anticommuting variables, extending the classic theory. Here, we introduce symmetric functions in noncommuting variables in superspace. We define the classical symmetric functions in noncommuting variables to superspace: monomials, power sums, elementaries and complete homogeneous, which generalize both the ones studied by Rosas and Sagan and the ones studied by Desrosiers, Lapointe and Mathieu. We also define Schur--type functions in noncommuting variables in superspace.</description>

      <title>Seat number configuration of the box-ball system, and its relation to the 10-elimination and invariant measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.15358v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The box-ball system (BBS) is a soliton cellular automaton introduced by [TS], and it is known that the dynamics of the BBS can be linearized by several methods. Recently, a new linearization method, called the seat number configuration, is introduced by [MSSS]. The aim of this paper is fourfold. First, we introduce the $k$-skip map $\Psi_{k} : \Omega \to \Omega$, where $\Omega$ is the state space of the BBS, and show that the $k$-skip map induces a shift operator of the seat number configuration. Second, we show that the $k$-skip map is a natural generalization of the $10$-elimination, which was originally introduced by [MIT] to solve the initial value problem of the periodic BBS. Third, we generalize the notions and results of the seat number configuration and the $k$-skip map for the BBS on the whole-line. Finally, we investigate the distribution of $\Psi_{k}(\eta), \eta \in \Omega$ when the distribution of $\eta$ belongs to a certain class of invariant measures of the BBS introduced by [FG]. As an application of the above results, we obtain the long-time behavior of the integrated current of $\Psi_{k}(\eta)$ with Markov stationary initial distributions.</description>

Abstract: We develop a composition method to unearth positive $e_I$-expansions of chromatic symmetric functions $X_G$, where the subscript $I$ stands for compositions rather than integer partitions. Using this method, we derive positive and neat $e_I$-expansions for the chromatic symmetric functions of tadpoles, barbells and generalized bulls, and establish the $e$-positivity of hats. We also obtain a compact ribbon Schur analog for the chromatic symmetric function of cycles.</description>

      <title>Introducing q-deformed binomial coefficients of words</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05838v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gaussian binomial coefficients are q-analogues of the binomial coefficients of integers. On the other hand, binomial coefficients have been extended to finite words, i.e., elements of the finitely generated free monoids. In this paper we bring together these two notions by introducing q-analogues of binomial coefficients of words. We study their basic properties, e.g., by extending classical formulas such as the q-Vandermonde and Manvel's et al. identities to our setting. As a consequence, we get information about the structure of the considered words: these q-deformations of binomial coefficients of words contain much richer information than the original coefficients. From an algebraic perspective, we introduce a q-shuffle and a family q-infiltration products for non-commutative formal power series. Finally, we apply our results to generalize a theorem of Eilenberg characterizing so-called p-group languages. We show that a language is of this type if and only if it is a Boolean combination of specific languages defined through q-binomial coefficients seen as polynomials over $\mathbb{F}_p$.</description>

      <title>A note on Combinatorial Invariance of Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12834v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the concepts of an amazing hypercube decomposition and a double shortcut for it, and use these new ideas to formulate a conjecture implying the Combinatorial Invariance Conjecture of the Kazhdan--Lusztig polynomials for the symmetric group. This conjecture has the advantage of being combinatorial in nature. The appendix by Grant T. Barkley and Christian Gaetz discusses the related notion of double hypercubes and proves an analogous conjecture for these in the case of co-elementary intervals.</description>

      <title>Monomial identities in the Weyl algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20492v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by a question and some enumerative conjectures of Richard Stanley, we explore the equivalence classes of words in the Weyl algebra, $\mathbf{k} \left&lt; D,U \mid DU - UD = 1 \right&gt;$. We show that each class is generated by the swapping of adjacent *balanced subwords*, i.e., those which have the same number of $D$'s as $U$'s, and give several other characterizations, as well as a linear-time algorithm for equivalence checking.
  Armed with this, we deduce several enumerative results about such equivalence classes and their sizes. We extend these results to the class of $c$-Dyck words, where every prefix has at least $c$ times as many $U$'s as $D$'s. We also connect these results to previous work on bond percolation and rook theory, and generalize them to some other algebras.</description>

      <title>Walks, infinite series and spectral radius of graphs (an updated version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07821v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a graph G, the spectral radius \r{ho}(G) of G is the largest eigenvalue of its adjacency matrix. In this paper, we seek the relationship between \r{ho}(G) and the walks of the subgraphs of G. Especially, if G contains a complete multi-partite graph as a spanning subgraph, we give a formula for \r{ho}(G) by using an infinite series on walks of the subgraphs of G. These results are useful for the current popular spectral extremal problem.</description>

      <title>Capacity bounds on integral flows and the Kostant partition function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07838v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The type $A$ Kostant partition function is an important combinatorial object with various applications: it counts integer flows on the complete directed graph, computes Hilbert series of spaces of diagonal harmonics, and can be used to compute weight and tensor product multiplicities of representations. In this paper we study asymptotics of the Kostant partition function, improving on various previously known lower bounds and settling conjectures of O'Neill and Yip. Our methods build upon recent results and techniques of Br\"and\'en-Leake-Pak, who used Lorentzian polynomials and Gurvits' capacity method to bound the number of lattice points of transportation and flow polytopes. Finally, we also give new two-sided bounds using the Lidskii formulas from subdivisions of flow polytopes.</description>

      <title>Ricci Curvature Formula: Applications to Bonnet-Myers Sharp Irregular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15667v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish a simple formula for computing the Lin-Lu-Yau Ricci curvature on graphs. For any edge $xy$ in a simple locally finite graph $G$, the curvature $\kappa(x,y)$ can be expressed as a cost function of an optimal bijection between two blow-up sets of the neighbors of $x$ and $y$. Utilizing this approach, we derive several results including a structural theorem for the Bonnet-Myers sharp irregular graphs of diameter $3$ and a theorem on $C_3$-free Bonnet-Myers sharp graphs.</description>

      <title>On Dedekind's problem, a sparse version of Sperner's theorem, and antichains of a given size in the Boolean lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dedekind's problem, dating back to 1897, asks for the total number $\psi(n)$ of antichains contained in the Boolean lattice $B_n$ on $n$ elements. We study Dedekind's problem using a recently developed method based on the cluster expansion from statistical physics and as a result, obtain several new results on the number and typical structure of antichains in $B_n$. We obtain detailed estimates for both $\psi(n)$ and the number of antichains of size $\beta \binom{n}{\lfloor n/2 \rfloor}$ for any fixed $\beta&gt;0$. We also establish a sparse version of Sperner's theorem: we determine the sharp threshold and scaling window for the property that almost every antichain of size $m$ is contained in a middle layer of $B_n$.</description>

      <title>Stabilities of intersecting families revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem states that for $n&gt; 2k$, every intersecting family of $k$-sets of $[n]:=\{1,\ldots ,n\}$ has at most $ {n-1 \choose k-1}$ sets, and the extremal family consists of all $k$-sets containing a fixed element (called a full star). The Hilton--Milner theorem provides a stability result by determining the maximum size of a uniform intersecting family that is not a subfamily of a full star. The further stabilities were studied by Han and Kohayakawa (2017) and Huang and Peng (2024). Two families $\mathcal{F}$ and $\mathcal{G}$ are called cross-intersecting if for every $F\in \mathcal{F}$ and $G\in \mathcal{G}$, the intersection $F\cap G$ is non-empty. Let $k \geq 1, t\ge 0$ and $n \geq 2 k+t$ be integers. Frankl (2016) proved that if $\mathcal{F} \subseteq\binom{[n]}{k+t}$ and $\mathcal{G} \subseteq\binom{[n]}{k}$ are cross-intersecting families, and $\mathcal{F}$ is non-empty and $(t+1)$-intersecting, then $|\mathcal{F}|+|\mathcal{G}| \leq\binom{n}{k}-\binom{n-k-t}{k}+1$. Recently, Wu (2023) sharpened Frankl's result by establishing a stability variant. The aim of this paper is two-fold. Inspired by the above results, we first prove a further stability variant that generalizes both Frankl's result and Wu's result. Secondly, as an interesting application, we illustrate that the aforementioned results on cross-intersecting families could be used to establish the stability results of the Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem. More precisely, we present new short proofs of the Hilton--Milner theorem, the Han--Kohayakawa theorem and the Huang--Peng theorem. Our arguments are more straightforward, and it may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Color-avoiding percolation on the Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.16086v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a recently introduced model of color-avoiding percolation defined as follows. Every edge in a graph $G$ is colored in some of $k\ge 2$ colors. Two vertices $u$ and $v$ in $G$ are said to be CA-connected if $u$ and $v$ may be connected using any subset of $k-1$ colors. CA-connectivity defines an equivalence relation on the vertex set of $G$ whose classes are called CA-components.
  We study the component structure of a randomly colored Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph of constant average degree. We distinguish three regimes for the size of the largest component: a supercritical regime, a so-called intermediate regime, and a subcritical regime, in which the largest CA-component has respectively linear, logarithmic, and bounded size. Interestingly, in the subcritical regime, the bound is deterministic and given by the number of colors.</description>

      <title>The Chromatic Number of Kneser Hypergraphs via Consensus Division</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09016v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the Consensus Division theorem implies lower bounds on the chromatic number of Kneser hypergraphs, offering a novel proof for a result of Alon, Frankl, and Lov\'{a}sz (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 1986) and for its generalization by K\v{r}\'{\i}\v{z} (Trans. Amer. Math. Soc., 1992). Our approach is applied to study the computational complexity of the total search problem Kneser$^p$, which given a succinct representation of a coloring of a $p$-uniform Kneser hypergraph with fewer colors than its chromatic number, asks to find a monochromatic hyperedge. We prove that for every prime $p$, the Kneser$^p$ problem with an extended access to the input coloring is efficiently reducible to a quite weak approximation of the Consensus Division problem with $p$ shares. In particular, for $p=2$, the problem is efficiently reducible to any non-trivial approximation of the Consensus Halving problem on normalized monotone functions. We further show that for every prime $p$, the Kneser$^p$ problem lies in the complexity class $\mathsf{PPA}$-$p$. As an application, we establish limitations on the complexity of the Kneser$^p$ problem, restricted to colorings with a bounded number of colors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A set of points with finite density is constructed in $\mathbb{R}^d$, with $d\geq2$, by adding points to a Poisson process such that any line segment of length $O\left(\varepsilon^{-(d-1)}\ln\varepsilon^{-1}\right)$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$ will contain one of the points of the set within distance $\varepsilon$ of it. The constant implied by the big-$O$ notation depends on dimension only.</description>
