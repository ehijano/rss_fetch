      <title>Invariant Measures for Data-Driven Dynamical System Identification: Analysis and Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel approach for performing dynamical system identification, based upon the comparison of simulated and observed physical invariant measures. While standard methods adopt a Lagrangian perspective by directly treating time-trajectories as inference data, we take on an Eulerian perspective and instead seek models fitting the observed global time-invariant statistics. With this change in perspective, we gain robustness against pervasive challenges in system identification including noise, chaos, and slow sampling. In the first half of this paper, we pose the system identification task as a partial differential equation (PDE) constrained optimization problem, in which synthetic stationary solutions of the Fokker-Planck equation, obtained as fixed points of a finite-volume discretization, are compared to physical invariant measures extracted from observed trajectory data. In the latter half of the paper, we improve upon this approach in two crucial directions. First, we develop a Galerkin-inspired modification to the finite-volume surrogate model, based on data-adaptive unstructured meshes and Monte-Carlo integration, enabling the approach to efficiently scale to high-dimensional problems. Second, we leverage Takens' seminal time-delay embedding theory to introduce a critical data-dependent coordinate transformation which can guarantee unique system identifiability from the invariant measure alone. This contribution resolves a major challenge of system identification through invariant measures, as systems exhibiting distinct transient behaviors may still share the same time-invariant statistics in their state-coordinates. Throughout, we present comprehensive numerical tests which highlight the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of challenging system identification tasks.</description>

      <title>The Structure of the Route to the Period-three Orbit in the Collatz Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08097v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study analyzes the Collatz map through nonlinear dynamics. By embedding integers in Sharkovsky's ordering, we show that odd initial values suffice for full dynamical characterization. We introduce ``direction phases'' to partition iterations into upward and downward phases, and derive a recursive function family parameterized by upward phase counts. Consequently, a logarithmic scaling law between iteration steps and initial values is revealed, demonstrating finite-time convergence to the period-three orbit. Moreover, we establish the equivalence of the Collatz map to a binary shift map, whose ergodicity guarantees universal convergence to attractors, providing additional support for convergence. Furthermore, we identify that basins of attraction follow power-law distributions and find that odd numbers classified by upward phases follow Gamma statistics. These results offer valuable insights into the dynamics of discrete systems and their connections to number theory.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric coupling of non-chaotic Rulkov neurons: fractal attractors, quasi-multistability, and final state sensitivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although neuron models have been well-studied for their rich dynamics and biological properties, limited research has been done on the complex geometries that emerge from the basins of attraction and basin boundaries of multistable neuron systems. In this paper, we investigate the geometrical properties of the strange attractors, four-dimensional basins, and fractal basin boundaries of an asymmetrically electrically coupled system of two identical non-chaotic Rulkov neurons. We discover a quasi-multistability in the system emerging from the existence of a chaotic spiking-bursting pseudo-attractor, and we classify and quantify the system's basins of attraction, which are found to have complex fractal geometries. Using the method of uncertainty exponents, we also find that the system exhibits extreme final state sensitivity, which results in a dynamical uncertainty that could have important applications in neurobiology.</description>

      <title>Computing Chaotic Time-Averages from Few Periodic or Non-Periodic Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09626v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For appropriately chosen weights, temporal averages in chaotic systems can be approximated as a weighted sum of averages over reference states, such as unstable periodic orbits. Under strict assumptions, such as completeness of the orbit library, these weights can be formally derived using periodic orbit theory. When these assumptions are violated, weights can be obtained empirically using a Markov partition of the chaotic set. Here, we describe an alternative, data-driven approach to computing weights that allows for an accurate approximation of temporal averages from a variety of reference states, including both periodic orbits and non-periodic trajectory segments embedded within the chaotic set. For a broad class of observables, we demonstrate that weights computed with the proposed method significantly outperform those derived from periodic orbit theory or Markov models, achieving superior accuracy while requiring far fewer states -- two critical properties for applications to high-dimensional chaotic systems.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised Learning in Echo State Networks for Input Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11409v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional echo state networks (ESNs) require supervised learning to train the readout layer, using the desired outputs as training data. In this study, we focus on input reconstruction (IR), which refers to training the readout layer to reproduce the input time series in its output. We reformulate the learning algorithm of the ESN readout layer to perform IR using unsupervised learning (UL). By conducting theoretical analysis and numerical experiments, we demonstrate that IR in ESNs can be effectively implemented under realistic conditions without explicitly using the desired outputs as training data; in this way, UL is enabled. Furthermore, we demonstrate that applications relying on IR, such as dynamical system replication and noise filtering, can be reformulated within the UL framework. Our findings establish a theoretically sound and universally applicable IR formulation, along with its related tasks in ESNs. This work paves the way for novel predictions and highlights unresolved theoretical challenges in ESNs, particularly in the context of time-series processing methods and computational models of the brain.</description>
