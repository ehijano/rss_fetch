      <title>On the linearity of fundamental groups of rose and star graphs of groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a fundamental group of a graph of group where the graph is a rose or a star graph and the vertex groups are free groups, free abelian groups or right-angled Artin groups. We prove the linearity of $G$ over $\mathbb{Z}$ under various conditions on its edge groups.</description>

      <title>K-Exit for OD-Characterization of the finite Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Suppose G is a finite group, and K is a normal solvable subgroup of G. In this paper, we present a
  powerful method which is called K-Exit. Using this method, we find some members of {\pi}(G) that
  are not members of {\pi}(K) and for this purpose, we introduce the tables of K-Exit. This method
  can be applied to OD-Characterization of the finite Groups</description>

      <title>Pervasive ellipticity in locally compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A topological group is (openly) almost-elliptic if it contains a(n open) dense subset of elements generating relatively-compact cyclic subgroups. We classify the (openly) almost-elliptic connected locally compact groups as precisely those with compact maximal semisimple quotient and whose maximal compact subgroups act trivial-weight-freely on the Euclidean quotients of the closed derived series' successive layers. In particular, an extension of a compact connected group $\mathbb{K}$ by a connected, simply-connected solvable Lie group $\mathbb{L}$ is (openly) almost-elliptic precisely when the weights of the $\mathbb{K}$-action on $Lie(\mathbb{L})$ afforded by the extension are all non-trivial.</description>

      <title>On products of abelian skew braces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The main objective of this paper is to study factorisations of skew left braces through abelian subbraces. We prove a skew brace theoretical analog of the classical It\^o's theorem about product of two abelian groups: if $B = A_1A_2$ is a skew brace which is the product of two abelian skew subbraces $A_1$ and $A_2$, and $A_1$ is a left and right ideal of $B$, then the commutator ideal $[B, B]^B$ of $B$ is an abelian brace. If $A_1$ is a left (non-necessarily right) ideal of $B$, we show that there exists a strong left ideal of $B$ contained in $A_1$ or $A_2$. We also show factorisations of relevant ideals of factorised braces that are sums and products of abelian subbraces.</description>

      <title>Rigidity of pseudofunction algebras of ample groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09563v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a Hausdorff, ample groupoid $\mathcal{G}$ can be completely recovered from the $I$-norm completion of $C_c(\mathcal{G})$. More generally, we show that this is also the case for the algebra of symmetrized $p$-pseudofunctions, as well as for the reduced groupoid $L^p$-operator algebra, for $p\neq 2$.
  Our proofs are based on a new construction of an inverse semigroup built from Moore-Penrose invertible partial isometries in an $L^p$-operator algebra. Along the way, we verify a conjecture of Rako\v{c}evi\'{c} concerning the continuity of the Moore-Penrose inverse for $L^p$-operator algebras.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected Lie group and $\text{Sub}_G$ be the space of closed subgroups of $G$ equipped with the Chabauty topology. In this article, we investigate the existence of invariant random subgroups of $G$ supported on various orbits of the conjugation action of $G$ on $\text{Sub}_G$. We also find the orbit closure for each of these orbits in the case of the Lie group $G=\SL(2,\mathbb{R})\ltimes \mathbb{R}^2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.09912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper contributes to building algebraic foundations of self-organized criticality answering a previously unsolved question about the limiting structure of the extended sandpile group as well as relating it to another limit at the level of classical sandpile groups with respect to certain monomorphisms, and puts forward a concept of canonical sandpile epimorphisms, drawing an unexpected consequence about the divisibility properties of the numbers of spanning trees on rectangles.</description>

      <title>Poisson boundary of group extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.11111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.11111v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finitely generated group, the well-known Stability Problem asks whether the non-triviality of the Poisson-Furstenberg boundary (which is equivalent to the existence of non-constant bounded harmonic functions) depends on the choice of simple random walk on the group. This question was far from being understood even in the class of linear groups. Given an amenable group, e.g. a solvable group, there is no known characterisation, even a conjectural one, of when it admits a simple random walk with non-trivial boundary. We provide a characterisation of groups with non-trivial boundary for finitely generated linear groups of characteristic $p$. We prove in particular that the Stability Problem has a positive answer in this class of groups. For linear groups of characteristic $0$, we prove a sufficient condition for the triviality of the boundary which does not depend on the choice of a simple random walk. We conjecture that our sufficient condition is also necessary. Our arguments are based on a new comparison criterion for group extensions, on new $\Delta$-restriction entropy estimates and a criterion for boundary non-triviality, and on a new "cautiousness" criterion for triviality of the boundary.</description>

      <title>Coarse obstructions to cocompact cubulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09275v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide geometric methods to give bounds on the large-scale dimension of CAT(0) cube complexes quasiisometric to a given group $G$. In situations where these bounds conflict we obtain obstructions to $G$ being cocompactly cubulated. More strongly, the obstructions prevent $G$ from being a coarse median space.
  As applications, we show that many free-by-cyclic groups cannot be cocompactly cubulated, even virtually, and prove that any tubular group with a coarse median is virtually compact special. We also exhibit a group that is CAT(0), $C(6)$, and virtually special, yet is not quasiisometric to any CAT(0) cube complex. This is the first example of a $C(6)$ group that cannot be cocompactly cubulated, resolving a question of Jankiewicz and partially answering a question of Wise.</description>

      <title>Rational cohomology and Zariski dense subgroups of solvable linear algebraic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09987v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we establish results concerning the cohomology of Zariski dense subgroups of solvable linear algebraic groups. We show that for an irreducible solvable $\mathbb{Q}$-defined linear algebraic group $\mathbf{G}$, there exists an isomorphism between the cohomology rings with coefficients in a finite dimensional rational $\mathbf{G}$-module $M$ of the associated $\mathbb{Q}$-defined Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g_\mathbb{Q}}$ and Zariski dense subgroups $\Gamma \leq \mathbf{G}(\mathbb{Q})$ that satisfy the condition that they intersect the $\mathbb{Q}$-split maximal torus discretely. We further prove that the restriction map in rational cohomology from $\mathbf{G}$ to a Zariski dense subgroup $\Gamma \leq \mathbf{G}(\mathbb{Q})$ with coefficients in $M$ is an injection. We then derive several results regarding finitely generated solvable groups of finite abelian rank and their representations on cohomology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe a generalization of the concept of a pc presentation that applies to groups with a nontrivial solvable radical. Such a representation can be much more efficient in terms of memory use and even of arithmetic, than permuattion and matrix representations. We illustrate the use of such representations by constructing a maximal subgroup of the sporadic monster group and calculating its -- hitherto unknown -- character table.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition under which a monoid is non-finitely related, and a sufficient condition under which a monoid is finitely related</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We transform the method of Glasson into a sufficient condition under which a monoid is non-finitely related, add a new member to the collection of interlocking word-patterns, and use it to show that the monoid $M(ab^2a, a^2b^2)$ is non-finitely related.
  We also give a sufficient condition under which a monoid is finitely related and use it show that $M(a^2b^2)$ is finitely related. Together with the results of Glasson this completes the description of all finitely related monoids among the monoids of the form $M(W)$ where every word ${\bf u} \in W$ depends on two variables and every variable occurs twice in $\bf u$.</description>

Abstract: As defined by Guralnick and Saxl, given a nonabelian simple group $S$ and its nonidentity automorphism $x$, a natural number $\alpha_S(x)$ is the minimum number of conjugates of $x$ in $\langle x,S\rangle$ that generate a subgroup containing $S$. In this paper, for every sporadic group $S$ other than the Monster and an automorphism $x$ of $S$ of prime order, we complete the determination of the precise value of $\alpha_S(x)$.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of distal actions of automorphisms on the space of one-parameter subgroups of Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01237v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a connected Lie group $G$ and an automorphism $T$ of $G$, we consider the action of $T$ on Sub$_G$, the compact space of closed subgroups of $G$ endowed with the Chabauty topology. We study the action of $T$ on Sub$^p_G$, the closure in Sub$_G$ of the set of closed one-parameter subgroups of $G$. We relate the distality of the $T$-action on Sub$^p_G$ with that of the $T$-action on $G$ and characterise the same in terms of compactness of the closed subgroup generated by $T$ in Aut$(G)$ when $T$ acts distally on the maximal central torus and $G$ is not a vector group. We extend these results to the action of a subgroup of Aut$(G)$, and equate the distal action of any closed subgroup ${\mathcal H}$ on Sub$^p_G$ with that of every element in ${\mathcal H}$. Moreover, we show that a connected Lie group $G$ acts distally on Sub$^p_G$ by conjugation if and only if $G$ is either compact or it is isomorphic to a direct product of a compact group and a vector group. Some of our results extend those of Shah and Yadav.</description>

      <title>Countable Ordered Groups and Weihrauch Reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19229v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper continues to study the connection between reverse mathematics and Weihrauch reducibility. In particular, we study the problems formed from Maltsev's theorem on the order types of countable ordered groups. Solomon showed that the theorem is equivalent to $\mathsf{\Pi_1^1}$-$\mathsf{CA_0}$, the strongest of the big five subsystems of second order arithmetic. We show that the strength of the theorem comes from having a dense linear order without endpoints in its order type. Then, we show that for the related Weihrauch problem to be strong enough to be equivalent to $\mathsf{\hat{WF}}$ (the analog problem of $\mathsf{\Pi_1^1}$-$\mathsf{CA_0}$), an order-preserving function is necessary in the output. Without the order-preserving function, the problems are very much to the side compared to analog problems of the big five.</description>
