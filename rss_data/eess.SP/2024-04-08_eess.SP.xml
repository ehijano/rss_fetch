      <title>A Novel Terabit Grid-of-Beam Optical Wireless Multi-User Access Network With Beam Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we put forward a proof of concept for sixth generation (6G) Terabit infrared (IR) laser-based indoor optical wireless networks. We propose a novel double-tier access point (AP) architecture based on an array of arrays of vertical cavity surface emitting lasers (VCSELs) to provide a seamless grid-of-beam coverage with multi-Gb/s per beam. We present systematic design and thorough analytical modeling of the AP architecture, which are then applied to downlink system modeling using non-imaging angle diversity receivers (ADRs). We propose static beam clustering with coordinated multi-beam joint transmission (CoMB-JT) for network interference management and devise various clustering strategies to address inter-beam interference (IBI) and inter-cluster interference (ICI). Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) schemes are also adopted to handle intra-cluster interference, and the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and achievable data rate are derived. The network performance is studied in terms of spatial distributions and statistics of the downlink SINR and data rate through extensive computer simulations. The results demonstrate that data rates up to 15 Gb/s are achieved within the coverage area and a properly devised clustering strikes a balance between the sum rate and fairness depending on the number of users.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Online Resource Allocation for User Experience Improvement in Mobile Edge Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the cloud is pushed to the edge of the network, resource allocation for user experience improvement in mobile edge clouds (MEC) is increasingly important and faces multiple challenges. This paper studies quality of experience (QoE)-oriented resource allocation in MEC while considering user diversity, limited resources, and the complex relationship between allocated resources and user experience. We introduce a closed-loop online resource allocation (CORA) framework to tackle this problem. It learns the objective function of resource allocation from the historical dataset and updates the learned model using the online testing results. Due to the learned objective model is typically non-convex and challenging to solve in real-time, we leverage the Lyapunov optimization to decouple the long-term average constraint and apply the prime-dual method to solve this decoupled resource allocation problem. Thereafter, we put forth a data-driven optimal online queue resource allocation (OOQRA) algorithm and a data-driven robust OQRA (ROQRA) algorithm for homogenous and heterogeneous user cases, respectively. Moreover, we provide a rigorous convergence analysis for the OOQRA algorithm. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithms using the synthesis and YouTube datasets. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that the user complaint rate is reduced by up to 100% and 18% in the synthesis and YouTube datasets, respectively.</description>

      <title>Pushing the Limit of Range Resolution Beyond Bandwidth Constraint with Triangle FMCW</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel signal processing technique that doubles the range resolution of FMCW~(Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) sensing without increasing the required bandwidth. The proposed design overcomes the resolution limit imposed by bandwidth by exploiting the phase consistency observed in the special frequency variation of the beat signal derived from triangle FMCW. Through this approach, the resolution is doubled while maintaining high spectrum SNR. A system model for signal processing is presented, and the energy distribution of the derived beat spectrum is analyzed. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated through model-based simulations.</description>

      <title>Wi-Fi-based Personnel Identity Recognition: Addressing Dataset Imbalance with C-DDPMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless sensing technologies become increasingly prevalent due to the ubiquitous nature of wireless signals and their inherent privacy-friendly characteristics. Device-free personnel identity recognition, a prevalent application in wireless sensing, is susceptibly challenged by imbalanced channel state information (CSI) datasets. This letter proposes a novel method for CSI dataset augmentation that employs Conditional Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (C-DDPMs) to generate additional samples that address class imbalance issues. The augmentation markedly improves classification accuracies on our homemade dataset, elevating all classes to above 94%.</description>

      <title>The Use of MEMS Accelerometers for Remote Activity and Living Parameters Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper a ballistocardiographic sensor for remote monitoring of activity and vital parameters is presented. The sensor is mainly intended for use in monitoring systems supporting care of older people. It allows to detect occupancy of a piece of furniture, to which it is attached and to estimate basic vital parameters (heart and respiration rates) of the monitored person. The presented device includes three inertial sensors: two accelerometers of different parameters and prices and one reference BCG module. The device sends the measurement results to the external server over WiFi. The vital parameters are estimated based on the Continuous Wavelet Transform of the registered acceleration signals. User's presence is detected by tracking changes in acceleration measured in axes parallel to the ground.</description>

      <title>A 0.65-pJ/bit 3.6-TB/s/mm I/O Interface with XTalk Minimizing Affine Signaling for Next-Generation HBM with High Interconnect Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an I/O interface with Xtalk Minimizing Affine Signaling (XMAS), which is designed to support high-speed data transmission in die-to-die communication over silicon interposers or similar high-density interconnects susceptible to crosstalk. The operating principles of XMAS are elucidated through rigorous analyses, and its advantages over existing signaling are validated through numerical experiments. XMAS not only demonstrates exceptional crosstalk removing capabilities but also exhibits robustness against noise, especially simultaneous switching noise. Fabricated in a 28-nm CMOS process, the prototype XMAS transceiver achieves an edge density of 3.6TB/s/mm and an energy efficiency of 0.65pJ/b. Compared to the single-ended signaling, the crosstalk-induced peak-to-peak jitter of the received eye with XMAS is reduced by 75% at 10GS/s/pin data rate, and the horizontal eye opening extends to 0.2UI at a bit error rate &lt; 10$^{-12}$.</description>

      <title>Graph-based Untrained Neural Network Detector for OTFS Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inter-carrier interference (ICI) caused by mobile reflectors significantly degrades the conventional orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) performance in high-mobility environments. The orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation system effectively represents ICI in the delay-Doppler domain, thus significantly outperforming OFDM. Existing iterative and neural network (NN) based OTFS detectors suffer from high complex matrix operations and performance degradation in untrained environments, where the real wireless channel does not match the one used in the training, which often happens in real wireless networks. In this paper, we propose to embed the prior knowledge of interference extracted from the estimated channel state information (CSI) as a directed graph into a decoder untrained neural network (DUNN), namely graph-based DUNN (GDUNN). We then combine it with Bayesian parallel interference cancellation (BPIC) for OTFS symbol detection, resulting in GDUNN-BPIC. Simulation results show that the proposed GDUNN-BPIC outperforms state-of-the-art OTFS detectors under imperfect CSI.</description>

      <title>Decision Transformer for Wireless Communications: A New Paradigm of Resource Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the next generation of mobile systems evolves, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to deeply integrate with wireless communications for resource management in variable environments. In particular, deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is an important tool for addressing stochastic optimization issues of resource allocation. However, DRL has to start each new training process from the beginning once the state and action spaces change, causing low sample efficiency and poor generalization ability. Moreover, each DRL training process may take a large number of epochs to converge, which is unacceptable for time-sensitive scenarios. In this paper, we adopt an alternative AI technology, namely, the Decision Transformer (DT), and propose a DT-based adaptive decision architecture for wireless resource management. This architecture innovates through constructing pre-trained models in the cloud and then fine-tuning personalized models at the edges. By leveraging the power of DT models learned over extensive datasets, the proposed architecture is expected to achieve rapid convergence with many fewer training epochs and higher performance in a new context, e.g., similar tasks with different state and action spaces, compared with DRL. We then design DT frameworks for two typical communication scenarios: Intelligent reflecting surfaces-aided communications and unmanned aerial vehicle-aided edge computing. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed DT frameworks achieve over $3$-$6$ times speedup in convergence and better performance relative to the classic DRL method, namely, proximal policy optimization.</description>

      <title>Sensing-Resistance-Oriented Beamforming for Privacy Protection from ISAC Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the evolution of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology, a growing number of devices go beyond conventional communication functions with sensing abilities. Therefore, future networks are divinable to encounter new privacy concerns on sensing, such as the exposure of position information to unintended receivers. In contrast to traditional privacy preserving schemes aiming to prevent eavesdropping, this contribution conceives a novel beamforming design toward sensing resistance (SR). Specifically, we expect to guarantee the communication quality while masking the real direction of the SR transmitter during the communication. To evaluate the SR performance, a metric termed angular-domain peak-to-average ratio (ADPAR) is first defined and analyzed. Then, we resort to the null-space technique to conceal the real direction, hence to convert the optimization problem to a more tractable form. Moreover, semidefinite relaxation along with index optimization is further utilized to obtain the optimal beamformer. Finally, simulation results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed SR-oriented beamforming design toward privacy protection from ISAC receivers.</description>

      <title>Jammer-Resilient Time Synchronization in the MIMO Uplink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spatial filtering based on multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) processing is a promising approach to jammer mitigation. Effective MIMO data detectors that mitigate smart jammers have recently been proposed, but they all assume perfect time synchronization between transmitter(s) and receiver. However, to the best of our knowledge, there are no methods for resilient time synchronization in the presence of smart jammers. To remedy this situation, we propose JASS, the first method that enables reliable time synchronization for the single-user MIMO uplink while mitigating smart jamming attacks. JASS detects a randomized synchronization sequence based on a novel optimization problem that fits a spatial filter to the time-windowed receive signal in order to mitigate the jammer. We underscore the efficacy of the proposed optimization problem by proving that it ensures successful time synchronization under certain intuitive conditions. We then derive an efficient algorithm for approximately solving our optimization problem. Finally, we use simulations to demonstrate the effectiveness of JASS against a wide range of different jammer types.</description>

      <title>Phase Noise Detection via Expectation Propagation and Related Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of signal detection in the presence of an unknown time-varying channel parameter, receivers based on the Expectation Propagation (EP) framework appear to be very promising. EP is a message-passing algorithm based on factor graphs with an inherent ability to combine prior knowledge of system variables with channel observations. This suggests that an effective estimation of random channel parameters can be achieved even with a very limited number of pilot symbols, thus increasing the payload efficiency. However, achieving satisfactory performance often requires ad-hoc adjustments in the way the probability distributions of latent variables - both data and channel parameters - are combined and projected. Here, we apply EP to a classical problem of coded transmission on a strong Wiener phase noise channel, employing soft-input soft-output decoding. We identify its limitations and propose new strategies which reach the performance benchmark while maintaining low complexity, with a primary focus on challenging scenarios where the state-of-the-art algorithms fail.</description>

      <title>Seamlessly merging radar ranging/imaging, wireless communications, and spectrum sensing, for 6G empowered by microwave photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration of radar, wireless communications, and spectrum sensing is being investigated for 6G with an increased spectral efficiency. Microwave photonics (MWP), a technique that combines microwave engineering and photonic technology to take advantage of the wide bandwidth offered by photonics for microwave signal generation and processing is considered an effective solution for the implementation of the integration. In this paper, an MWP-assisted joint radar, wireless communications, and spectrum sensing (JRCSS) system that enables precise perception of the surrounding physical and electromagnetic environments while maintaining high-speed data communication is proposed and demonstrated. Communication signals and frequency-sweep signals are merged in the optical domain to achieve high-speed radar ranging and imaging, high-data-rate wireless communications, and wideband spectrum sensing. In an experimental demonstration, a JRCSS system supporting radar ranging with a measurement error within $\pm$ 4 cm, two-dimensional imaging with a resolution of 25 $\times$ 24.7 mm, wireless communications with a data rate of 2 Gbaud, and spectrum sensing with a frequency measurement error within $\pm$ 10 MHz in a 6-GHz bandwidth, is demonstrated.</description>

      <title>Near/Far-Field Channel Estimation For Terahertz Systems With ELAAs: A Block-Sparse-Aware Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05544</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05544v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millimeter wave/Terahertz (mmWave/THz) communication with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) offers a promising solution to meet the escalating demand for high data rates in next-generation communications. A large array aperture, along with the ever increasing carrier frequency within the mmWave/THz bands, leads to a large Rayleigh distance. As a result, the traditional plane-wave assumption may not hold valid for mmWave/THz systems featuring ELAAs. In this paper, we consider the problem of hybrid near/far-field channel estimation by taking spherical wave propagation into account. By analyzing the coherence properties of any two near-field steering vectors, we prove that the hybrid near/far-field channel admits a block-sparse representation on a specially designed orthogonal dictionary. Specifically, the percentage of nonzero elements of such a block-sparse representation decreases in the order of $1/\sqrt{N}$, which tends to zero as the number of antennas, $N$, grows. Such a block-sparse representation allows to convert channel estimation into a block-sparse signal recovery problem. Simulation results are provided to verify our theoretical results and illustrate the performance of the proposed channel estimation approach in comparison with existing state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Study on Ziv-Zakai Lower Bounds on the MMSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores Bayesian lower bounds on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) that belong to the Ziv-Zakai (ZZ) family. The ZZ technique relies on connecting the bound to an M-ary hypothesis testing problem. Three versions of the ZZ bound (ZZB) exist: the first relies on the so-called valley-filling function (VFF), the second omits the VFF, and the third, i.e., the single-point ZZB (SZZB), uses a single point maximization. The first part of this paper provides the most general version of the bounds. First, it is shown that these bounds hold without any assumption on the distribution of the estimand. Second, the SZZB bound is extended to an M-ary setting and a version of it for the multivariate case is provided. In the second part, general properties of the bounds are provided. First, it is shown that all the bounds tensorize. Second, a complete characterization of the high-noise asymptotic is provided, which is used to argue about the tightness of the bounds. Third, the low-noise asymptotic is provided for mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. Specifically, in the low-noise, it is shown that the SZZB is not always tight. In the third part, the tightness of the bounds is evaluated. First, it is shown that in the low-noise regime the ZZB bound without the VFF is tight for mixed-input distributions and Gaussian additive noise channels. Second, for discrete inputs, the ZZB with the VFF is shown to be always sub-optimal, and equal to zero without the VFF. Third, unlike for the ZZB, an example is shown for which the SZZB is tight to the MMSE for discrete inputs. Fourth, sufficient and necessary conditions for the tightness of the bounds are provided. Finally, some examples are shown in which the bounds in the ZZ family outperform other well-known Bayesian bounds, i.e., the Cram\'er-Rao bound and the maximum entropy bound.</description>

      <title>Spectral GNN via Two-dimensional (2-D) Graph Convolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04559v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spectral Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved tremendous success in graph learning. As an essential part of spectral GNNs, spectral graph convolution extracts crucial frequency information in graph data, leading to superior performance of spectral GNNs in downstream tasks. However, in this paper, we show that existing spectral GNNs remain critical drawbacks in performing the spectral graph convolution. Specifically, considering the spectral graph convolution as a construction operation towards target output, we prove that existing popular convolution paradigms cannot construct the target output with mild conditions on input graph signals, causing spectral GNNs to fall into suboptimal solutions. To address the issues, we rethink the spectral graph convolution from a more general two-dimensional (2-D) signal convolution perspective and propose a new convolution paradigm, named 2-D graph convolution. We prove that 2-D graph convolution unifies existing graph convolution paradigms, and is capable to construct arbitrary target output. Based on the proposed 2-D graph convolution, we further propose ChebNet2D, an efficient and effective GNN implementation of 2-D graph convolution through applying Chebyshev interpolation. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate both effectiveness and efficiency of the ChebNet2D.</description>

      <title>Fourier Transform-based Wavenumber Domain 3D Imaging in RIS-aided Communication Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04783v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Radio imaging is rapidly gaining prominence in the design of future communication systems, with the potential to utilize reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) as imaging apertures. Although the sparsity of targets in three-dimensional (3D) space has led most research to adopt compressed sensing (CS)-based imaging algorithms, these often require substantial computational and memory burdens. Drawing inspiration from conventional Fourier transform (FT)-based imaging methods, our research seeks to accelerate radio imaging in RIS-aided communication systems. To begin, we introduce a two-stage wavenumber domain 3D imaging technique: first, we modify RIS phase shifts to recover the equivalent channel response from the user equipment to the RIS array, subsequently employing traditional FT-based wavenumber domain methods to produce target images. We also determine the diffraction resolution limits of the system through k-space analysis, taking into account factors including system bandwidth, transmission direction, operating frequency, and the angle subtended by the RIS. Addressing the challenge of limited pilots in communication systems, we unveil an innovative algorithm that merges the strengths of both FT- and CS-based techniques by substituting the expansive sensing matrix with FT-based operators. Our simulation outcomes confirm that our proposed FT-based methods achieve high-quality images while demanding few time, memory, and communication resources.</description>

      <title>Analog-Digital Beam Focusing for Line of Sight Wide-Aperture MIMO with Spherical Wavefronts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancing high-speed wireless communication in the future relies significantly on harnessing high frequency bands effectively. These bands predominantly operate in line-of-sight (LoS) paths, necessitating well-configured antenna arrays and beamforming techniques for optimal spectrum utilization. Maximizing the potential of LoS multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, which are crucial for achieving high spectral efficiency, heavily depends on this. As the costs and power demands of mixed-signal devices in high frequency bands make a fully-digital architecture impractical for large-scale MIMO setups, our focus shifts to a hybrid analog-digital hardware configuration. Yet, analog processors' limitations restrict flexibility within arrays, necessitating a nuanced understanding of hardware constraints for optimal antenna configuration design. We explore array design that optimizes the spectral efficiency of hybrid systems, considering hardware constraints. We propose an optimal antenna configuration, leveraging the prolate matrix structure of the LoS channel between two planar arrays. Building on the optimal array configuration, we introduce a low-complexity explicit analog-digital beam focusing scheme that exploits the asymptotic behavior of the LoS channel matrix in the near-field region. Simulation results validate that the proposed antenna configuration and beam focusing scheme achieves near-optimal performance across a range of signal-to-noise ratios with low computational complexity, even under arbitrary rotations relative to the communication link.</description>

      <title>Self-Evolving Wireless Communications: A Novel Intelligence Trend for 6G and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Wireless communication is rapidly evolving, and future wireless communications (6G and beyond) will be more heterogeneous, multi-layered, and complex, which poses challenges to traditional communications. Adaptive technologies in traditional communication systems respond to environmental changes by modifying system parameters and structures on their own and are not flexible and agile enough to satisfy requirements in future communications. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel self-evolving communication framework, which consists of three layers: data layer, information layer, and knowledge layer. The first two layers allow communication systems to sense environments, fuse data, and generate a knowledge base for the knowledge layer. When dealing with a variety of application scenarios and environments, the generated knowledge is subsequently fed back to the first two layers for communication in practical application scenarios to obtain self-evolving ability and enhance the robustness of the system. In this paper, we first highlight the limitations of current adaptive communication systems and the need for intelligence, automation, and self-evolution in future wireless communications. We overview the development of self-evolving technologies and conceive the concept of self-evolving communications with its hypothetical architecture. To demonstrate the power of self-evolving modules, we compare the performances of a communication system with and without evolution. We then provide some potential techniques that enable self-evolving communications and challenges in implementing them.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.04947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce Gull, a generative multifunctional audio codec. Gull is a general purpose neural audio compression and decompression model which can be applied to a wide range of tasks and applications such as real-time communication, audio super-resolution, and codec language models. The key components of Gull include (1) universal-sample-rate modeling via subband modeling schemes motivated by recent progress in audio source separation, (2) gain-shape representations motivated by traditional audio codecs, (3) improved residual vector quantization modules for simpler training, (4) elastic decoder network that enables user-defined model size and complexity during inference time, (5) built-in ability for audio super-resolution without the increase of bitrate. We compare Gull with existing traditional and neural audio codecs and show that Gull is able to achieve on par or better performance across various sample rates, bitrates and model complexities in both subjective and objective evaluation metrics.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Anchor Pairs Selection in a TDOA-based System Through Robot Localization Error Minimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05067v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The following paper presents an adaptive anchor pairs selection method for ultra-wideband (UWB) Time Difference of Arrival (TDOA) based positioning systems. The method divides the area covered by the system into several zones and assigns them anchor pair sets. The pair sets are determined during calibration based on localization root mean square error (RMSE). The calibration assumes driving a mobile platform equipped with a LiDAR sensor and a UWB tag through the specified zones. The robot is localized separately based on a large set of different TDOA pairs and using a LiDAR, which acts as the reference. For each zone, the TDOA pairs set for which the registered RMSE is lowest is selected and used for localization in the routine system work. The proposed method has been tested with simulations and experiments. The results for both simulated static and experimental dynamic scenarios have proven that the adaptive selection of the anchor nodes leads to an increase in localization accuracy. In the experiment, the median trajectory error for a moving person localization was at a level of 25 cm.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Wideband Near-Field Sensing (NISE)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The impact of large bandwidth on near-filed sensing (NISE) is analyzed in multi-carrier systems. The fundamental Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) for wideband NISE are characterized. In particular, the closed-form CRBs are derived for both uniform linear arrays (ULAs) and uniform circular arrays (UCAs). Then, the asymptotic CRBs are analyzed. It is rigorously proved that: 1) as the number of antennas N increases, the maximum decay rates of asymptotic CRBs are 1/N for ULAs and 1/N^2 for UCAs; 2) as the number of subcarriers M increases, the asymptotic CRBs decay as 1/M^3 for both ULAs and UCAs; and 3) CRBs are inversely proportional to the beamforming gain. Based on the analytical results, two practical beamforming approaches are proposed for near-field wideband integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), namely independent and joint approaches. For the independent approach, the beamformer on each subcarrier is designed exclusively for either sensing or communication. For the joint approach, the beamformer on each subcarrier is jointly optimized for both functions through a low-complexity iterative algorithm. Finally, numerical results show that 1) large bandwidth sets an estimation error ceiling for NISE; 2) NISE performance converges to far-field sensing performance when the bandwidth is extremely large; 3) there is a tradeoff between array size and system bandwidth for achieving a given sensing performance; and 4) the simple independent beamforming approach achieves an ISAC performance close to the complex joint beamforming approach.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface Aided Target Localization With Unknown Transceiver-IRS Channel State Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrating wireless sensing capabilities into base stations (BSs) has become a widespread trend in the future beyond fifth-generation (B5G)/sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. In this paper, we investigate intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) enabled wireless localization, in which an IRS is deployed to assist a BS in locating a target in its non-line-of-sight (NLoS) region. In particular, we consider the case where the BS-IRS channel state information (CSI) is unknown. Specifically, we first propose a separate BS-IRS channel estimation scheme in which the BS operates in full-duplex mode (FDM), i.e., a portion of the BS antennas send downlink pilot signals to the IRS, while the remaining BS antennas receive the uplink pilot signals reflected by the IRS. However, we can only obtain an incomplete BS-IRS channel matrix based on our developed iterative coordinate descent-based channel estimation algorithm due to the "sign ambiguity issue". Then, we employ the multiple hypotheses testing framework to perform target localization based on the incomplete estimated channel, in which the probability of each hypothesis is updated using Bayesian inference at each cycle. Moreover, we formulate a joint BS transmit waveform and IRS phase shifts optimization problem to improve the target localization performance by maximizing the weighted sum distance between each two hypotheses. However, the objective function is essentially a quartic function of the IRS phase shift vector, thus motivating us to resort to the penalty-based method to tackle this challenge. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of our proposed target localization scheme and show that the scheme's performance can be further improved by finely designing the BS transmit waveform and IRS phase shifts intending to maximize the weighted sum distance between different hypotheses.</description>

      <title>A Riemannian Manifold Approach to Constrained Resource Allocation in ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a new resource allocation framework for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, which are expected to be fundamental aspects of sixth-generation networks. In particular, we develop an augmented Lagrangian manifold optimization (ALMO) framework designed to maximize communication sum rate while satisfying sensing beampattern gain targets and base station (BS) transmit power limits. ALMO applies the principles of Riemannian manifold optimization (MO) to navigate the complex, non-convex landscape of the resource allocation problem. It efficiently leverages the augmented Lagrangian method to ensure adherence to constraints. We present comprehensive numerical results to validate our framework, which illustrates the ALMO method's superior capability to enhance the dual functionalities of communication and sensing in ISAC systems. For instance, with 12 antennas and 30 dBm BS transmit power, our proposed ALMO algorithm delivers a 10.1% sum rate gain over a benchmark optimization-based algorithm. This work demonstrates significant improvements in system performance and contributes a new algorithmic perspective to ISAC resource management.</description>

      <title>Back to the Future: GNN-based NO$_2$ Forecasting via Future Covariates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the latest environmental concerns in keeping at bay contaminants emissions in urban areas, air pollution forecasting has been rising the forefront of all researchers around the world. When predicting pollutant concentrations, it is common to include the effects of environmental factors that influence these concentrations within an extended period, like traffic, meteorological conditions and geographical information. Most of the existing approaches exploit this information as past covariates, i.e., past exogenous variables that affected the pollutant but were not affected by it. In this paper, we present a novel forecasting methodology to predict NO$_2$ concentration via both past and future covariates. Future covariates are represented by weather forecasts and future calendar events, which are already known at prediction time. In particular, we deal with air quality observations in a city-wide network of ground monitoring stations, modeling the data structure and estimating the predictions with a Spatiotemporal Graph Neural Network (STGNN). We propose a conditioning block that embeds past and future covariates into the current observations. After extracting meaningful spatiotemporal representations, these are fused together and projected into the forecasting horizon to generate the final prediction. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time that future covariates are included in time series predictions in a structured way. Remarkably, we find that conditioning on future weather information has a greater impact than considering past traffic conditions. We release our code implementation at https://github.com/polimi-ispl/MAGCRN.</description>

      <title>On the Optimal MMSE Channel Estimation for One-Bit Quantized MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the minimum mean squared error (MMSE) channel estimator for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with one-bit quantization at the receiver side. Despite its optimality and significance in estimation theory, the MMSE channel estimator has not been fully investigated in this context due to its general non-linearity and computational complexity. Instead, the typically suboptimal Bussgang linear MMSE (BLMMSE) estimator has been widely adopted. In this work, we develop a new framework to compute the MMSE channel estimator that hinges on computation of the orthant probability of the multivariate normal distribution. Based on this framework, we determine a necessary and sufficient condition for the BLMMSE channel estimator to be optimal and equivalent to the MMSE estimator. Under the assumption of specific channel correlation or pilot symbols, we further utilize the framework to derive analytical expressions for the MMSE channel estimator that are particularly convenient for computation when certain system dimensions become large, thereby enabling a comparison between the BLMMSE and MMSE channel estimators in these cases.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free Multi-User MIMO Equalization via In-Context Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05538v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large pre-trained sequence models, such as transformers, excel as few-shot learners capable of in-context learning (ICL). In ICL, a model is trained to adapt its operation to a new task based on limited contextual information, typically in the form of a few training examples for the given task. Previous work has explored the use of ICL for channel equalization in single-user multi-input and multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this work, we demonstrate that ICL can be also used to tackle the problem of multi-user equalization in cell-free MIMO systems with limited fronthaul capacity. In this scenario, a task is defined by channel statistics, signal-to-noise ratio, and modulation schemes. The context encompasses the users' pilot sequences, the corresponding quantized received signals, and the current received data signal. Different prompt design strategies are proposed and evaluated that encompass also large-scale fading and modulation information. Experiments demonstrate that ICL-based equalization provides estimates with lower mean squared error as compared to the linear minimum mean squared error equalizer, especially in the presence of limited fronthaul capacity and pilot contamination.</description>

Abstract: Making accurate forecasts for a complex system is a challenge in various practical applications. The major difficulty in solving such a problem concerns nonlinear spatiotemporal dynamics with time-varying characteristics. Takens' delay embedding theory provides a way to transform high-dimensional spatial information into temporal information. In this work, by combining delay embedding theory and deep learning techniques, we propose a novel framework, Delay-Embedding-based Forecast Machine (DEFM), to predict the future values of a target variable in a self-supervised and multistep-ahead manner based on high-dimensional observations. With a three-module spatiotemporal architecture, the DEFM leverages deep neural networks to effectively extract both the spatially and temporally associated information from the observed time series even with time-varying parameters or additive noise. The DEFM can accurately predict future information by transforming spatiotemporal information to the delay embeddings of a target variable. The efficacy and precision of the DEFM are substantiated through applications in three spatiotemporally chaotic systems: a 90-dimensional (90D) coupled Lorenz system, the Lorenz 96 system, and the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky (KS) equation with inhomogeneity. Additionally, the performance of the DEFM is evaluated on six real-world datasets spanning various fields. Comparative experiments with five prediction methods illustrate the superiority and robustness of the DEFM and show the great potential of the DEFM in temporal information mining and forecasting</description>

      <title>Codebook-Based Beam Tracking for Conformal ArrayEnabled UAV MmWave Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.14064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) communications can potentially meet the high data-rate requirements of unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks. However, as the prerequisite of mmWave communications, the narrow directional beam tracking is very challenging because of the three-dimensional (3D) mobility and attitude variation of UAVs. Aiming to address the beam tracking difficulties, we propose to integrate the conformal array (CA) with the surface of each UAV, which enables the full spatial coverage and the agile beam tracking in highly dynamic UAV mmWave networks. More specifically, the key contributions of our work are three-fold. 1) A new mmWave beam tracking framework is established for the CA-enabled UAV mmWave network. 2) A specialized hierarchical codebook is constructed to drive the directional radiating element (DRE)-covered cylindrical conformal array (CCA), which contains both the angular beam pattern and the subarray pattern to fully utilize the potential of the CA. 3) A codebook-based multiuser beam tracking scheme is proposed, where the Gaussian process machine learning enabled UAV position/attitude predication is developed to improve the beam tracking efficiency in conjunction with the tracking-error aware adaptive beamwidth control. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed codebook-based beam tracking scheme in the CA-enabled UAV mmWave network, and demonstrate the advantages of CA over the conventional planner array in terms of spectrum efficiency and outage probability in the highly dynamic scenarios.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Reflecting Surface Assisted Integrated Sensing and Communications for mmWave Channels</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system operating at the millimeter-wave (mmWave) band. Specifically, the ISAC system combines communication and radar operations and performs, detecting and communicating simultaneously with multiple targets and users. The IRS dynamically controls the amplitude or phase of the radio signal via reflecting elements to reconfigure the radio propagation environment and enhance the transmission rate of the ISAC system. By jointly designing the radar signal covariance (RSC) matrix, the beamforming vector of the communication system, and the IRS phase shift, the ISAC system transmission rate can be improved while matching the desired waveform for radar. The problem is non-convex due to multivariate coupling, and thus we decompose it into two separate subproblems. First, a closed-form solution of the RSC matrix is derived from the desired radar waveform. Next, the quadratic transformation (QT) technique is applied to the subproblem, and then alternating optimization (AO) is employed to determine the communication beamforming vector and the IRS phase shift. For computing the IRS phase shift, we adopt both the majorization minimization (MM) and the manifold optimization (MO). Also, we derive a closed-form solution for the formulated problem, effectively decreasing computational complexity. Furthermore, a trade-off factor is introduced to balance the performance of communication and sensing. Finally, the simulations verify the effectiveness of the algorithm and demonstrate that the IRS can improve the performance of the ISAC system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.18242v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The publicly accessible dataset includes neutron and gamma-ray pulse signals for conducting pulse shape discrimination experiments. Several traditional and recently proposed pulse shape discrimination algorithms are utilized to evaluate the performance of pulse shape discrimination under raw pulse signals and noise-enhanced datasets. These algorithms comprise zero-crossing (ZC), charge comparison (CC), falling edge percentage slope (FEPS), frequency gradient analysis (FGA), pulse-coupled neural network (PCNN), ladder gradient (LG), and het-erogeneous quasi-continuous spiking cortical model (HQC-SCM). In addition to the pulse signals, this dataset includes the source code for all the aforementioned pulse shape discrimination methods. Moreover, the dataset provides the source code for schematic pulse shape discrimination performance evaluation and anti-noise performance evaluation. This feature enables researchers to evaluate the performance of these methods using standard procedures and assess their anti-noise ability under various noise conditions. In conclusion, this dataset offers a comprehensive set of resources for conducting pulse shape discrimination experiments and evaluating the performance of various pulse shape discrimination methods under different noise scenarios.</description>

      <title>Universal Approximation of Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) Systems through RNNs: Power of Randomness in Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.02464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.02464v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are known to be universal approximators of dynamic systems under fairly mild and general assumptions. However, RNNs usually suffer from the issues of vanishing and exploding gradients in standard RNN training. Reservoir computing (RC), a special RNN where the recurrent weights are randomized and left untrained, has been introduced to overcome these issues and has demonstrated superior empirical performance especially in scenarios where training samples are extremely limited. On the other hand, the theoretical grounding to support this observed performance has yet been fully developed. In this work, we show that RC can universally approximate a general linear time-invariant (LTI) system. Specifically, we present a clear signal processing interpretation of RC and utilize this understanding in the problem of approximating a generic LTI system. Under this setup, we analytically characterize the optimum probability density function for configuring (instead of training and/or randomly generating) the recurrent weights of the underlying RNN of the RC. Extensive numerical evaluations are provided to validate the optimality of the derived distribution for configuring the recurrent weights of the RC to approximate a general LTI system. Our work results in clear signal processing-based model interpretability of RC and provides theoretical explanation/justification for the power of randomness in randomly generating instead of training RC's recurrent weights. Furthermore, it provides a complete optimum analytical characterization for configuring the untrained recurrent weights, marking an important step towards explainable machine learning (XML) to incorporate domain knowledge for efficient learning.</description>

      <title>Spectral Convergence of Simplicial Complex Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological signal processing (TSP) utilizes simplicial complexes to model structures with higher order than vertices and edges. In this paper, we study the transferability of TSP via a generalized higher-order version of graphon, known as complexon. We recall the notion of a complexon as the limit of a simplicial complex sequence [1]. Inspired by the graphon shift operator and message-passing neural network, we construct a marginal complexon and complexon shift operator (CSO) according to components of all possible dimensions from the complexon. We investigate the CSO's eigenvalues and eigenvectors and relate them to a new family of weighted adjacency matrices. We prove that when a simplicial complex signal sequence converges to a complexon signal, the eigenvalues, eigenspaces, and Fourier transform of the corresponding CSOs converge to that of the limit complexon signal. This conclusion is further verified by two numerical experiments. These results hint at learning transferability on large simplicial complexes or simplicial complex sequences, which generalize the graphon signal processing framework.</description>

Abstract: Satellite communication is one of the key technologies that is enabling next-generation networks. However, nearest-satellite-supported downlink transmission may not meet a user's requirements due to limited signal strength, especially in emergent scenarios. In this paper, we investigate a coordinated multi-satellite joint transmission system from a system-level perspective, where a user can be served by multiple satellites to improve its quality-of-service (QoS). Furthermore, we analyze the coverage and rate of a typical user in the joint transmission system. Simulation and numerical results show that the introduced system achieves a higher coverage probability than the traditional nearest-satellite-supported network. Moreover, a user's ergodic rate can be maximized by selecting an appropriate number of serving satellites.</description>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) are viewed as promising technologies for future generations of wireless networks. This paper investigates the channel estimation problem in an IRS-assisted ISAC system. A deep-learning framework is proposed to estimate the sensing and communication (S&amp;C) channels in such a system. Considering different propagation environments of the S&amp;C channels, two deep neural network (DNN) architectures are designed to realize this framework. The first DNN is devised at the ISAC base station for estimating the sensing channel, while the second DNN architecture is assigned to each downlink user equipment to estimate its communication channel. Moreover, the input-output pairs to train the DNNs are carefully designed. Simulation results show the superiority of the proposed estimation approach compared to the benchmark scheme under various signal-to-noise ratio conditions and system parameters.</description>

      <title>Extreme Learning Machine-based Channel Estimation in IRS-Assisted Multi-User ISAC System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-user integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) assisted by intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been recently investigated to provide a high spectral and energy efficiency transmission. This paper proposes a practical channel estimation approach for the first time to an IRS-assisted multiuser ISAC system. The estimation problem in such a system is challenging since the sensing and communication (SAC) signals interfere with each other, and the passive IRS lacks signal processing ability. A two-stage approach is proposed to transfer the overall estimation problem into sub-ones, successively including the direct and reflected channels estimation. Based on this scheme, the ISAC base station (BS) estimates all the SAC channels associated with the target and uplink users, while each downlink user estimates the downlink communication channels individually. Considering a low-cost demand of the ISAC BS and downlink users, the proposed two-stage approach is realized by an efficient neural network (NN) framework that contains two different extreme learning machine (ELM) structures to estimate the above SAC channels. Moreover, two types of input-output pairs to train the ELMs are carefully devised, which impact the estimation accuracy and computational complexity under different system parameters. Simulation results reveal a substantial performance improvement achieved by the proposed ELM-based approach over the least-squares and NN-based benchmarks, with reduced training complexity and faster training speed.</description>

Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), and intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) are envisioned as revolutionary technologies to enhance spectral and energy efficiencies for next wireless system generations. For the first time, this paper focuses on the channel estimation problem in an IRS-assisted ISAC system. This problem is challenging due to the lack of signal processing capacity in passive IRS, as well as the presence of mutual interference between sensing and communication (SAC) signals in ISAC systems. A three-stage approach is proposed to decouple the estimation problem into sub-ones, including the estimation of the direct SAC channels in the first stage, reflected communication channel in the second stage, and reflected sensing channel in the third stage. The proposed three-stage approach is based on a deep-learning framework, which involves two different convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures to estimate the channels at the full-duplex ISAC base station. Furthermore, two types of input-output pairs to train the CNNs are carefully designed, which affect the estimation performance under various signal-to-noise ratio conditions and system parameters. Simulation results validate the superiority of the proposed estimation approach compared to the least-squares baseline scheme, and its computational complexity is also analyzed.</description>

Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is vital for accurately identifying modulation types within incoming signals, a critical task for optimizing operations within edge devices in IoT ecosystems. This paper presents an innovative approach that leverages Transformer networks, initially designed for natural language processing, to address the challenges of efficient AMR. Our transformer network architecture is designed with the mindset of real-time edge computing on IoT devices. Four tokenization techniques are proposed and explored for creating proper embeddings of RF signals, specifically focusing on overcoming the limitations related to the model size often encountered in IoT scenarios. Extensive experiments reveal that our proposed method outperformed advanced deep learning techniques, achieving the highest recognition accuracy. Notably, our model achieves an accuracy of 65.75 on the RML2016 and 65.80 on the CSPB.ML.2018+ dataset.</description>

Abstract: Upon the arrival of emerging devices, including Extended Reality (XR) and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), the traditional communication framework is approaching Shannon's physical capacity limit and fails to guarantee the massive amount of transmission within latency requirements. By jointly exploiting the context of data and its importance to the task, an emerging communication paradigm shift to semantic level and effectiveness level is envisioned to be a key revolution in Sixth Generation (6G) networks. However, an explicit and systematic communication framework incorporating both semantic level and effectiveness level has not been proposed yet. In this article, we propose a generic goal-oriented semantic communication framework for various tasks with diverse data types, which incorporates both semantic level information and effectiveness-aware performance metrics. We first analyze the unique characteristics of all data types, and summarise the semantic information, along with corresponding extraction methods. We then propose a detailed goal-oriented semantic communication framework for different time-critical and non-critical tasks. In the goal-oriented semantic communication framework, we present the goal-oriented semantic information, extraction methods, recovery methods, and effectiveness-aware performance metrics. Last but not least, we present a goal-oriented semantic communication framework tailored for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) control task to validate the effectiveness of the proposed goal-oriented semantic communication framework.</description>

Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) has been widely studied in recent years, it has emerged as a new technology which can reflect the incident signal by intelligently configuring the reflection elements, thus changing the signal propagation environment, enhancing the signals users desire and suppressing the interference between users. In this paper, we study an IRS aided multi-users wireless communication where the base station (BS) sends a variety of signals, each user receives desired signals. In order to guarantee the fairness of wireless communications, we need to maximize the minimum rates of users, subject to the power constraint of BS and the phase constraint of IRS. Prior works on IRS mainly consider optimizing BS beamforming and IRS passive beamforming, this paper also aims to optimize the IRS location. The considered problem is shown to be non-convex, we decompose the problem into two subproblems, transforming the two subproblems into a lower bound problem and using alternating optimization (AO) and successive convex approximation (SCA) to solve them, respectively. Finally, the two subproblems are optimized alternately to make the objective function value converge in an acceptable range. Simulation results verify the convergence results of our proposed algorithm, and the performance improvement compared with the benchmark scheme in wireless communication system.</description>

      <title>QoE-based Semantic-Aware Resource Allocation for Multi-Task Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2305.06543v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By transmitting task-related information only, semantic communications yield significant performance gains over conventional communications. However, the lack of mature semantic theory about semantic information quantification and performance evaluation makes it challenging to perform resource allocation for semantic communications, especially when multiple tasks coexist in the network. To cope with this challenge, we propose a quality-of-experience (QoE) based semantic-aware resource allocation method for multi-task networks in this paper. First, semantic entropy is defined to quantify the semantic information for different tasks, and the relationship between semantic entropy and Shannon entropy is analyzed. Then, we develop a novel QoE model to formulate the semantic-aware resource allocation in terms of semantic compression, channel assignment, and transmit power. The compatibility of the formulated problem with conventional communications is further demonstrated. To solve this problem, we decouple it into two subproblems and solved them by a developed deep Q-network (DQN) based method and a proposed low-complexity matching algorithm, respectively. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method, as well as its compatibility with conventional communications.</description>

Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently achieved impressive performance on various time series tasks. The most prominent advantage of SSL is that it reduces the dependence on labeled data. Based on the pre-training and fine-tuning strategy, even a small amount of labeled data can achieve high performance. Compared with many published self-supervised surveys on computer vision and natural language processing, a comprehensive survey for time series SSL is still missing. To fill this gap, we review current state-of-the-art SSL methods for time series data in this article. To this end, we first comprehensively review existing surveys related to SSL and time series, and then provide a new taxonomy of existing time series SSL methods by summarizing them from three perspectives: generative-based, contrastive-based, and adversarial-based. These methods are further divided into ten subcategories with detailed reviews and discussions about their key intuitions, main frameworks, advantages and disadvantages. To facilitate the experiments and validation of time series SSL methods, we also summarize datasets commonly used in time series forecasting, classification, anomaly detection, and clustering tasks. Finally, we present the future directions of SSL for time series analysis.</description>

      <title>K-band: Self-supervised MRI Reconstruction via Stochastic Gradient Descent over K-space Subsets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.02958v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Although deep learning (DL) methods are powerful for solving inverse problems, their reliance on high-quality training data is a major hurdle. This is significant in high-dimensional (dynamic/volumetric) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), where acquisition of high-resolution fully sampled k-space data is impractical. We introduce a novel mathematical framework, dubbed k-band, that enables training DL models using only partial, limited-resolution k-space data. Specifically, we introduce training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) over k-space subsets. In each training iteration, rather than using the fully sampled k-space for computing gradients, we use only a small k-space portion. This concept is compatible with different sampling strategies; here we demonstrate the method for k-space "bands", which have limited resolution in one dimension and can hence be acquired rapidly. We prove analytically that our method stochastically approximates the gradients computed in a fully-supervised setup, when two simple conditions are met: (i) the limited-resolution axis is chosen randomly-uniformly for every new scan, hence k-space is fully covered across the entire training set, and (ii) the loss function is weighed with a mask, derived here analytically, which facilitates accurate reconstruction of high-resolution details. Numerical experiments with raw MRI data indicate that k-band outperforms two other methods trained on limited-resolution data and performs comparably to state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods trained on high-resolution data. k-band hence obtains SoTA performance, with the advantage of training using only limited-resolution data. This work hence introduces a practical, easy-to-implement, self-supervised training framework, which involves fast acquisition and self-supervised reconstruction and offers theoretical guarantees.</description>

      <title>Reliability-Latency-Rate Tradeoff in Low-Latency Communications with Finite-Blocklength Coding</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.06769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Low-latency communication plays an increasingly important role in delay-sensitive applications by ensuring the real-time exchange of information. However, due to the constraints on the maximum instantaneous power, bounded latency is hard to be guaranteed. In this paper, we investigate the reliability-latency-rate tradeoff in low-latency communications with finite-blocklength coding (FBC). More specifically, we are interested in the fundamental tradeoff between error probability, delay-violation probability (DVP), and service rate. Based on the effective capacity (EC), we present the gain-conservation equations to characterize the reliability-latency-rate tradeoffs in low-latency systems. In particular, we investigate the low-latency transmissions over an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel and a Nakagami-$m$ fading channel. By defining the service rate gain, reliability gain, and real-time gain respectively, we further adopt the asymptotic analysis approach to reveal the fundamental reliability-latency-rate tradeoff of ultra-reliable and low-latency communications in the high signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) regime. To analytically evaluate the quality-of-service-constrained throughput of low-latency communications with FBC, an EC-approximation method is further conceived to derive the closed-form expression of quality-of-service-constrained throughput. Our results may provide some insights into the efficient scheduling of low-latency wireless communications in which statistical latency and reliability metrics are adopted.</description>

Abstract: Deep learning, in general, focuses on training a neural network from large labeled datasets. Yet, in many cases there is value in training a network just from the input at hand. This is particularly relevant in many signal and image processing problems where training data is scarce and diversity is large on the one hand, and on the other, there is a lot of structure in the data that can be exploited. Using this information is the key to deep internal-learning strategies, which may involve training a network from scratch using a single input or adapting an already trained network to a provided input example at inference time. This survey paper aims at covering deep internal-learning techniques that have been proposed in the past few years for these two important directions. While our main focus will be on image processing problems, most of the approaches that we survey are derived for general signals (vectors with recurring patterns that can be distinguished from noise) and are therefore applicable to other modalities.</description>

      <title>Multi-Antenna Towards Inband Shift Keying</title>

Abstract: We propose a new continuous phase frequency shift keying that is particularly suited for multi-antenna communications when the link budget is critical and beam alignment is problematic. It combines the constant envelope of frequency modulation with low-rate repetition coding in order to compensate for the absence of transmit beamforming. Although it is a frequency modulation, its transmit signal shows close to rectangular spectral shape. Similar to GSM's Gaussian minimum shift keying, it can be well approximated by linear modulation, when combined with differential precoding. This allows for easy coherent demodulation by means of a windowed fast Fourier transform.</description>

      <title>Detection Is Tracking: Point Cloud Multi-Sweep Deep Learning Models Revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15756</link>

Abstract: Conventional tracking paradigm takes in instantaneous measurements such as range and bearing, and produces object tracks across time. In applications such as autonomous driving, lidar measurements in the form of point clouds are usually passed through a "virtual sensor" realized by a deep learning model, to produce "measurements" such as bounding boxes, which are in turn ingested by a tracking module to produce object tracks. Very often multiple lidar sweeps are accumulated in a buffer to merge and become the input to the virtual sensor. We argue in this paper that such an input already contains temporal information, and therefore the virtual sensor output should also contain temporal information, not just instantaneous values for the time corresponding to the end of the buffer. In particular, we present the deep learning model called MULti-Sweep PAired Detector (MULSPAD) that produces, for each detected object, a pair of bounding boxes at both the end time and the beginning time of the input buffer. This is achieved with fairly straightforward changes in commonly used lidar detection models, and with only marginal extra processing, but the resulting symmetry is satisfying. Such paired detections make it possible not only to construct rudimentary trackers fairly easily, but also to construct more sophisticated trackers that can exploit the extra information conveyed by the pair and be robust to choices of motion models and object birth/death models. We have conducted preliminary training and experimentation using Waymo Open Dataset, which shows the efficacy of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Channel Estimation Considerate Precoder Design for Multi-user Massive MIMO-OFDM Systems: The Concept and Fast Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06072</link>

Abstract: The sixth-generation (6G) communication networks target peak data rates exceeding 1Tbps, necessitating base stations (BS) to support up to 100 simultaneous data streams. However, sparse pilot allocation to accommodate such streams poses challenges for users' channel estimation. This paper presents Channel Estimation Considerate Precoding (CECP), where BS precoders prioritize facilitating channel estimation alongside maximizing transmission rate. To address the computational complexity of 6G large-scale multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, we propose a computationally-efficient space-time block diagonal channel shortening (ST-BDCS) precoding scheme. By leveraging the sparse Toeplitz property of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) channels, this time-domain precoding design effectively mitigates multi-user interference in the downlink and shortens the effective channel's temporal length. Consequently, users can estimate the channels using sparse pilots. To enable fast implementation, we develop a generalized complex-valued Toeplitz matrix QR decomposition algorithm applicable to various space-time signal processing problems. Simulation results demonstrate that the ST-BDCS precoding method approximates the rate performance of conventional subcarrier-by-subcarrier precoding schemes. However, it offers the advantages of easier channel estimation for users and significantly reduced computational complexity for the BS.</description>

      <title>A Backdoor Approach with Inverted Labels Using Dirty Label-Flipping Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Audio-based machine learning systems frequently use public or third-party data, which might be inaccurate. This exposes deep neural network (DNN) models trained on such data to potential data poisoning attacks. In this type of assault, attackers can train the DNN model using poisoned data, potentially degrading its performance. Another type of data poisoning attack that is extremely relevant to our investigation is label flipping, in which the attacker manipulates the labels for a subset of data. It has been demonstrated that these assaults may drastically reduce system performance, even for attackers with minimal abilities. In this study, we propose a backdoor attack named 'DirtyFlipping', which uses dirty label techniques, "label-on-label", to input triggers (clapping) in the selected data patterns associated with the target class, thereby enabling a stealthy backdoor.</description>
