      <title>Basis set incompleteness errors in fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo calculations on non-covalent interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Basis set incompleteness error (BSIE) is a common source of error in quantum chemistry (QC) calculations, but it has not been comprehensively studied in fixed-node Diffusion Monte Carlo (FN-DMC) calculations. FN-DMC, being a projection method, is often considered minimally affected by basis set biases. Here, we show that this assumption is not always valid. While the relative error introduced by a small basis set in the total FN-DMC energy is minor, it can become significant in binding energy ($E_{\rm b}$) evaluations of weakly interacting systems. We systematically investigated BSIEs in FN-DMC-based binding energy ($E_{\rm b}$) evaluations using the A24 dataset, a well-known benchmark set of 24 non-covalently bound dimers. Contrary to common expectations, we found that BSIEs in FN-DMC evaluations of $E_{\rm b}$ are indeed significant when small localized basis sets, such as cc-pVDZ, are employed. We observed that BSIEs are larger in dimers with hydrogen-bonding interactions and smaller in dispersion-dominated interactions. We also found that augmenting the basis sets with diffuse orbitals, using counterpoise (CP) correction, or both, effectively mitigates BSIEs.</description>

      <title>Imaging the Photochemistry of the Hydrogen-Bonded Heptazine-Water Complex with Femtosecond Time-Resolved Spectroscopy: A Computational Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graphitic carbon nitride ($g$-CN) has attracted vast interest as a promising inexpensive metal-free photocatalyst for water splitting with solar photons. The heptazine (Hz) molecule is the building block of graphitic carbon nitride. The photochemistry of the Hz molecule and derivatives thereof in protic environments has been the subject of several recent experimental and computational studies. In the present work, the hydrogen-bonded Hz$\cdots$H$_2$O complex was adopted as a model system for the exploration of photoinduced electron and proton transfer processes in this complex with quasi-classical nonadiabatic trajectory simulations, using the $ab$ $initio$ ADC(2) electronic-structure method and a computationally efficient surface-hopping algorithm. The population of the optically excited bright $^1\pi\pi^*$ state of the Hz chromophore relaxes through three $^1n\pi^*$ states and a low-lying charge-transfer state, which drives proton transfer from H$_2$O to Hz, to the long-lived optically dark S$_1$($\pi\pi^*$) state of Hz. The imaging of this ultrafast and complex dynamics with femtosecond time-resolved transient absorption (TA) pump-probe (PP) spectroscopy and two-dimensional (2D) electronic spectroscopy (ES) was computationally explored in the framework of the quasi-classical doorway-window approximation. By comparison of the spectra of the Hz$\cdots$H$_2$O complex with those of the free Hz molecule, the effects of the hydrogen bond on the ultrafast internal conversion dynamics can be identified in the spectroscopic signals. Albeit the TA PP and 2D ES spectroscopies are primarily sensitive to electronic excited-state dynamics and less so to proton transfer dynamics, they nevertheless can provide mechanistic insights which can contribute to the acceleration of the optimization of photocatalysts for water splitting.</description>

      <title>Extending the atomic decomposition and many-body representation, a chemistry-motivated monomer-centered approach for machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most widely used machine learned (ML) potentials for condensed phase applications rely on many-body permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP) or atom-centered neural networks (NN). However, these approaches often lack chemical interpretability in atomistic energy decomposition and the computational efficiency of traditional force fields has not been fully achieved. Here, we present a novel method that combines aspects of both approaches, and achieves state-of-the-art balance of accuracy and force field-level speed. This method utilizes a monomer-centered representation, where the potential energy is decomposed into the sum of chemically meaningful monomeric energies. Without sophisticated neural network design, the structural descriptors of monomers are described by 1-body and 2-body effective interactions, enforced by appropriate sets of PIPs as inputs to the feed forward NN. We demonstrate the performance of this method through systematic assessments of models for gas-phase water trimer, liquid water, and also liquid CO2. The high accuracy, fast speed, and flexibility of this method provide a new route for constructing accurate ML potentials and enabling large-scale quantum and classical simulations for complex molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Real-time tracking the energy flow in cluster formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While photodissociation of molecular systems has been extensively studied, the photoinduced formation of chemical bonds remains largely unexplored. Especially for larger aggregates, the electronic and nuclear dynamics involved in the cluster formation process remain elusive. This limitation is rooted in difficulties to prepare reactants at well-defined initial conditions. Here, we overcome this hurdle by exploiting the exceptional solvation properties of helium nanodroplets. We load the droplets with Mg atoms and investigate the dynamical response of the formed Mg$_n$ aggregates to photoexcitation with time-resolved photoelectron spectroscopy. Beside the response expected for conventional Mg$_n$ clusters, consisting of a prompt signal rise and a decay characteristic for van der Waals bonds, the transient spectra also show a delayed photoelectron band peaking at 1.2 ps. This delayed signal rise is characteristic for nuclear dynamics and represents the transition of Mg$_n$ aggregates from a metastable, foam-like configuration, where Mg atoms are stabilized with a previously predicted interatomic spacing of 9.5 A, to a compact cluster. With global fitting analysis and ion-electron coincidence detection, the concerted electronic and nuclear dynamics can be tracked on a fs timescale. We find that cluster formation, proceeding with a ($450\pm180$) fs time constant, is accompanied by the population of highly-excited atomic states. We propose an energy pooling reaction in collisions of two or more excited Mg atoms during cluster formation as the mechanism leading to population of these high-lying Mg states. Additionally, conversion to kinetic energy through electronic relaxation leads to fragmentation and ejection of ionic cluster fragments from the He droplet. These results underline the potential of He droplets for time-resolved studies of bond formation and to uncover involved processes.</description>

      <title>Beyond quasi-particle self-consistent $GW$ for molecules with vertex corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the $\Sigma^{\text{BSE}}@L^{\text{BSE}}$ self-energy in the quasi-particle self-consistent $GW$ (qs$GW$) framework (qs$\Sigma^{\text{BSE}}@L^{\text{BSE}}$). Here, $L$ is the two-particle response function which we calculate by solving the Bethe-Salpeter equation with the static, first-order $GW$ kernel. The same kernel is added to $\Sigma$ directly. For a set of medium organic molecules, we show that including the vertex both in $L$ and $\Sigma$ is crucial. This approach retains the good performance of qs$GW$ for predicting first ionization potentials and fundamental gaps, while it greatly improves the description of electron affinities. Its good performance places qs$\Sigma^{\text{BSE}}@L^{\text{BSE}}$ among the best-performing electron propagator methods for charged excitations. Adding the vertex in $L$ only, as commonly done in the solid state community, leads to devastating results for electron affinities and fundamental gaps. We also test the performance of BSE@qs$GW$ and qs$\Sigma^{\text{BSE}}@L^{\text{BSE}}$ for neutral charge-transfer excitation and find both methods to perform similar. We conclude that $\Sigma^{\text{BSE}}@L^{\text{BSE}}$ is a promising approximation to the electronic self-energy beyond $GW$. We hope that future research on dynamical vertex effects, second-order vertex corrections, and full self-consistency will improve the accuracy of this method, both for charged and neutral excitation energies.</description>

      <title>Influence of light, temperature and iron oxidation state on the dissolution rate of combusted iron particles in oxalic acid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, the influence of temperature $(40-80 ^\circ\mathrm{C})$ and light exposure on the dissolution of combusted iron particles in aqueous oxalic acid $(0.45~\mathrm{mol/L})$ is experimentally investigated. Unlike previous studies, real combusted iron particles with varying fuel-to-air equivalence ratios were used instead of model oxides. In-situ video recordings reveal the evolution of particle size and morphology. Increasing temperature and short-wavelength light exposure enhance the reaction rate, with light-induced effects only becoming significant above $40 ^\circ$C for the duration of the experiments. This behavior differs significantly from hematite/maghemite oxides, attributed to the internal Fe phase structure of the combusted iron particles. At $80^\circ$C with additional light irradiation, a sudden decrease in reaction rate is observed due to solid ferrous oxide formation. While the fuel-to-air ratio induces differences in iron oxide phase composition, it does not affect the dissolution combusted iron particles significantly.</description>

      <title>Precise Determination of Excited State Rotational Constants and Black-Body Thermometry in Coulomb Crystals of Ca$^+$ and CaH$^+$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-resolution rovibronic spectroscopy of calcium monohydride molecular ions (CaH$^+$) co-trapped in a Coulomb crystal with calcium ions ($^{40}$Ca$^+$), focusing on rotational transitions in the $|X^1\Sigma^+, \nu" = 0&gt; \rightarrow |A^1\Sigma^+, \nu' = 2&gt;$ manifold. By resolving individual P and R branch transitions with record precision and using Fortrat analysis, we extract key spectroscopic constants for the excited state $|A^1\Sigma^+, \nu' = 2&gt;$, specifically, the band origin, the rotational constant, and the centrifugal correction. Additionally, we demonstrate the application of high-resolution rotational spectroscopy of CaH$^+$ presented here as an in-situ probe of local environmental temperature. We correlate the relative amplitudes of the observed transitions to the underlying thermalized ground-state rotational population distribution and extract the black-body radiation (BBR) temperature.</description>

      <title>PAL -- Parallel active learning for machine-learned potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Constructing datasets representative of the target domain is essential for training effective machine learning models. Active learning (AL) is a promising method that iteratively extends training data to enhance model performance while minimizing data acquisition costs. However, current AL workflows often require human intervention and lack parallelism, leading to inefficiencies and underutilization of modern computational resources. In this work, we introduce PAL, an automated, modular, and parallel active learning library that integrates AL tasks and manages their execution and communication on shared- and distributed-memory systems using the Message Passing Interface (MPI). PAL provides users with the flexibility to design and customize all components of their active learning scenarios, including machine learning models with uncertainty estimation, oracles for ground truth labeling, and strategies for exploring the target space. We demonstrate that PAL significantly reduces computational overhead and improves scalability, achieving substantial speed-ups through asynchronous parallelization on CPU and GPU hardware. Applications of PAL to several real-world scenarios - including ground-state reactions in biomolecular systems, excited-state dynamics of molecules, simulations of inorganic clusters, and thermo-fluid dynamics - illustrate its effectiveness in accelerating the development of machine learning models. Our results show that PAL enables efficient utilization of high-performance computing resources in active learning workflows, fostering advancements in scientific research and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Variational quantum algorithm for non-Markovian quantum dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of non-Markovian quantum dynamics plays an important role in the understanding of charge and exciton dynamics in the condensed phase environment, and yet it remains computationally expensive on classical computers. We have developed a variational quantum algorithm that is capable of simulating non-Markovian quantum dynamics. The algorithm captures the non-Markovian effect by employing the Ehrenfect trajectories in the path integral formulation and the Monte Carlo sampling of the thermal distribution. We tested the algorithm with the spin-boson model on the quantum simulator and the results match well with the exact ones. The algorithm naturally fits into the parallel computing platform of the NISQ devices and is well suited for anharmonic system-bath interactions and multi-state systems.</description>

      <title>Insights into Dermal Permeation of Skin Oil Oxidation Products from Enhanced Sampling Molecular Dynamics Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oxidation of human sebum, a lipid mixture covering our skin, generates a range of volatile and semi-volatile carbonyl compounds that contribute largely to indoor air pollution in crowded environments. Kinetic models have been developed to gain a deeper understanding of this complex multiphase chemistry, but they rely partially on rough estimates of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters, especially those describing skin permeation. Here, we employ atomistic molecular dynamics simulations to study the translocation of selected skin oil oxidation products through a model stratum corneum membrane. We find these simulations to be non-trivial, requiring extensive sampling with up to microsecond simulation times, in spite of employing enhanced sampling techniques. We identify the high degree of order and stochastic, long-lived temporal asymmetries in the membrane structure as the leading causes for the slow convergence of the free energy computations. Even after tremendous simulation efforts, substantial errors in the free energy profiles remain, which we propagate to membrane permeabilities. These errors are independent of the enhanced sampling technique employed and very likely independent of the precise membrane model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we developed a rigorous procedure for mapping the exact non-Markovian propagator to the generalized Lindblad form. It allows us to extract the negative decay rate that is the indicator of the non-Markovian effect. As a consequence, we can investigate the influence of the non-Markovian bath on the system's properties such as coherence and equilibrium state distribution. The understanding of the non-Markovian contribution to the dynamical process points to the possibility of leveraging non-Markovianity for quantum control.</description>

      <title>Diffusiophoresis in porous media saturated with a mixture of electrolytes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current theories of diffusiophoresis in porous media are limited to a porous medium saturated with a valence symmetric electrolyte. A predictive model for diffusiophoresis in porous media saturated with a valence asymmetric electrolyte, or a general mixture of valence symmetric and asymmetric electrolytes, is lacking. To close this knowledge gap, in this work we develop a mathematical model, based upon the regular perturbation method and numerical integration, to compute the diffusiophoretic mobility of a colloid in porous media saturated with a general mixture of electrolytes. We model the electrokinetics using the Poisson-Nernst-Planck equations and the fluid transport in porous media using the Brinkman equation with an electric body force. We report three novel key findings. First, we demonstrate that, in the same electrolyte concentration gradient, lowering the permeability of the porous medium can significantly weaken the colloid diffusiophoretic motion. Second, we show that, surprisingly, by using a valence asymmetric electrolyte the colloid diffusiophoretic motion in a denser porous medium can be stronger than that in a less dense porous medium saturated with a symmetric electrolyte. Third, we demonstrate that varying the composition of an electrolyte mixture does not only change the strength of the colloid diffusiophoretic motion drastically, but also qualitatively its direction. The model developed from this work can be used to understand and predict natural phenomena such as intracellular transport, as well as design technological applications such as enhanced oil recovery, nanoparticle drug delivery, and colloidal species separation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00771v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Living cells presumably employ optimized information transfer methods, enabling efficient communication even in noisy environments. As expected, the efficiency of chemical communications between cells depends on the properties of the molecular messenger. Evidence suggests that proteins from narrow ranges of molecular masses have been naturally selected to mediate cellular communications, yet the underlying communication design principles are not understood. Using a simple physical model that considers the cost of chemical synthesis, diffusion, molecular binding, and degradation, we show that optimal mass values exist that ensure efficient communication of various types of signals. Our findings provide insights into the design principles of biological communications and can be used to engineer chemically communicating biomimetic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00775v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polar polyatomic molecules provide an ideal but largely unexplored platform to encode qubits in rotational states. Here, we trap cold (100-600 mK) formaldehyde (H$_2$CO) inside an electric box and perform a Ramsey-type experiment to observe long-lived (~100 $\mu$s) coherences between symmetry-protected molecular states with opposite rotation but identical orientation, representing a quasi-hidden molecular degree of freedom. As a result, the observed qubit is insensitive to the magnitude of an external electric field, and depends only weakly on magnetic fields. Our findings provide a basis for future quantum and precision experiments with trapped cold molecules.</description>

      <title>One-step Fabrication of Sharp Platinum/Iridium Tips via Amplitude-Modulated Alternating-Current Electropolishing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The platinum/iridium (Pt/Ir) alloy tip for scanning probe microscopy (SPM) was successfully fabricated by amplitude-modulated alternating-current (AC) electropolishing. The clean tips with a radius of curvature less than 100 nm were reproducibly obtained by applying the 1000 Hz sinusoidal voltage with amplitude modulation of the sinusoidal wave of 100 Hz in $\mathrm{CaCl_2}$/$\mathrm{H_2O}$/acetone solution. The analyses by scanning electron microscopy with an energy-dispersive X-ray analyzer (SEM-EDX) and atom probe tomography (APT) showed that a uniform Pt/Ir alloy was exposed on the tip surface as a clean surface without O or Cl contamination. The STM imaging using the fabricated tip showed that it is more suitable for investigating rough surfaces than conventional as-cut tips and applicable for atomic-resolution imaging. Furthermore, we applied the fabricated tip to qPlus AFM analysis in liquid and showed that it has atomic resolution in both the horizontal and vertical directions. Therefore, it is concluded that the amplitude-modulated AC etching method reproducibly provides sharp STM/AFM tips capable of both atomic resolution and large-area analyses without complex etching setups.</description>

      <title>Simultaneously optimizing symmetry shifts and tensor factorizations for cost-efficient Fault-Tolerant Quantum Simulations of electronic Hamiltonians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In fault-tolerant quantum computing, the cost of calculating Hamiltonian eigenvalues using the quantum phase estimation algorithm is proportional to the constant scaling the Hamiltonian matrix block-encoded in a unitary circuit. We present a method to reduce this scaling constant for the electronic Hamiltonians represented as a linear combination of unitaries. Our approach combines the double tensor-factorization method of Burg et al. with the the block-invariant symmetry shift method of Loaiza and Izmaylov. By extending the electronic Hamiltonian with appropriately parametrized symmetry operators and optimizing the tensor-factorization parameters, our method achieves a 25% reduction in the block-encoding scaling constant compared to previous techniques. The resulting savings in the number of non-Clifford T-gates, which are an essential resource for fault-tolerant quantum computation, are expected to accelerate the feasiblity of practical Hamiltonian simulations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our technique on Hamiltonians of industrial and biological relevance, including the nitrogenase cofactor (FeMoCo) and cytochrome P450.</description>

      <title>Quantization of Visible Light by a Ni$_2$ Molecular Optical Resonator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantization of an optical field is a frontier in quantum optics with implications for both fundamental science and technological applications. Here, we demonstrate that a dinickel complex (Ni$_2$) traps and quantizes classical visible light, behaving as an individual quantum system or the Jaynes Cummings molecule.The composite system forms through coherently coupling the two level NiNi charge transfer transition with the local scattering field, which produces nonclassical light featuring photon anti bunching and squeezed states, as verified by a sequence of discrete photonic modes in the incoherent resonance fluorescence. Notably, in this Ni$_2$ system, the collective coupling of N molecule ensembles scales as N, distinct from the Tavis-Cummings model, which allows easy achievement of ultrastrong coupling. This is exemplified by a vacuum Rabi splitting of 1.2 eV at the resonance (3.25 eV) and a normalized coupling rate of 0.18 for the N = 4 ensemble. The resulting quantum light of single photonic modes enables driving the molecule field interaction in cavity free solution, which profoundly modifies the electronic states. Our results establish Ni$_2$ as a robust platform for quantum optical phenomena under ambient conditions, offering new pathways for molecular physics, polaritonic chemistry and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Quadruply Bonded Mo$_2$ Molecules: An Emitter-Resonator Integrated Quantum System in Free Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent decades, significant progress has been made in construction and study of individual quantum systems consisting of the basic single matter and energy particles, i.e., atoms and photons, which show great potentials in quantum computation and communication. Here, we demonstrate that the quadruply-bonded Mo$_2$ unit of the complex can trap photons of visible light under ambient conditions, producing intense local electromagnetic (EM) field that features squeezed states, photon antibunching, and vacuum Rabi splitting. Our results show that both the electronic and vibrational states of the Mo$_2$ molecule are modified by coherent coupling with the scattered photons of the Mo$_2$ unit, as evidenced by the Rabi doublet4 and the Mollow triplet in the incoherent resonance fluorescence and the Raman spectra. The Mo$_2$ molecule, acting as an independent emitter-resonator integrated quantum system, allows optical experiments to be conducted in free space, enabling fundamental quantum phenomena to be observed through conventional spectroscopic instrumentation. This provides a new platform for study of field effects and quantum electrodynamics (QED) in the optical domain. The insights gained from this study advance our understanding in metal-metal bond chemistry, molecular physics and quantum optics, with applications in quantum information processing, optoelectronic devices and control of chemical reactivity.</description>

      <title>Discontinuous structural transitions in fluids with competing interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores how competing interactions in the intermolecular potential of fluids affect their structural transitions. The study employs a versatile potential model with a hard core followed by two constant steps, representing wells or shoulders, analyzed in both one-dimensional (1D) and three-dimensional (3D) systems. Comparing these dimensionalities highlights the effect of confinement on structural transitions. Exact results are derived for 1D systems, while the Rational-Function Approximation is used for unconfined 3D fluids. Both scenarios confirm that when the steps are repulsive, the wavelength of the oscillatory decay of the total correlation function evolves with temperature either continuously or discontinuously. In the latter case, a discontinuous oscillation crossover line emerges in the temperature--density plane. For an attractive first step and a repulsive second step, a Fisher--Widom line appears. Although the 1D and 3D results share common features, dimensionality introduces differences: these behaviors occur in distinct temperature ranges, require deeper wells, or become attenuated in 3D. Certain features observed in 1D may vanish in 3D. We conclude that fluids with competing interactions exhibit a rich and intricate pattern of structural transitions, demonstrating the significant influence of dimensionality and interaction features.</description>

      <title>Solving one-body ensemble N-representability problems with spin</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle is fundamental to understanding electronic quantum systems. It namely constrains the expected occupancies $n_i$ of orbitals $\varphi_i$ according to $0 \leq n_i \leq 2$. In this work, we first refine the underlying one-body $N$-representability problem by taking into account simultaneously spin symmetries and a potential degree of mixedness $\boldsymbol w$ of the $N$-electron quantum state. We then derive a comprehensive solution to this problem by using basic tools from representation theory, convex analysis and discrete geometry. Specifically, we show that the set of admissible orbital one-body reduced density matrices is fully characterized by linear spectral constraints on the natural orbital occupation numbers, defining a convex polytope $\Sigma_{N,S}(\boldsymbol w) \subset [0,2]^d$. These constraints are independent of $M$ and the number $d$ of orbitals, while their dependence on $N, S$ is linear, and we can thus calculate them for arbitrary system sizes and spin quantum numbers. Our results provide a crucial missing cornerstone for ensemble density (matrix) functional theory.</description>

      <title>Series Expansion of a Scalable Hermitian Excitonic Renormalization Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Utilizing the sparsity of the electronic structure problem, fragmentation methods have been researched for decades with great success, pushing the limits of ab initio quantum chemistry ever further. Recently, this set of methods was expanded to include a fundamentally different approach called excitonic renormalization, providing promising initial results. It builds a supersystem Hamiltonian in a second-quantized-like representation from transition-density tensors of isolated fragments, contracted with biorthogonalized molecular integrals. This makes the method fully modular in terms of the quantum chemical methods applied to each fragment and enables massive truncation of the state-space required. Proof-of-principle tests have previously shown that an excitonically renormalized Hamiltonian can efficiently scale to hundreds of fragments, but the ad hoc approach to building the Hamiltonian was not scalable to larger fragments. On the other hand, initial tests of the originally proposed modular Hamiltonian build, presented here, have shown the accuracy to be poor on account of its non-Hermitian character. In this study, we bridge the gap between these with an operator expansion that is shown to converge rapidly, tending towards a Hermitian Hamiltonian while retaining the modularity, yielding an accurate, scalable method. The accuracy is tested here for a beryllium dimer. At distances near equilibrium and longer, the zeroth-order method is comparable to CCSD(T), and the first-order method to FCI. The second-order method agrees with FCI for distances well up the inner repulsive wall of the potential. Deviations occurring at shorter bond distances are discussed along with approaches to scaling to larger fragments.</description>

      <title>Continuum model of strong light-matter coupling for molecular polaritons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Strong coupling between light and matter generates hybrid polariton modes. We present a continuum formalism that expresses the polariton modes in terms of light and matter densities of states (DOS). We derive exact expressions for the light and matter DOS for a planar cavity containing a strongly dispersive dielectric. We show that these DOS depend exclusively on the linear response of the cavity components, i.e., the reflectance of the mirrors and the susceptibility of the dielectric. We further show that, within the strong coupling regime, the light and matter DOS are well-approximated by coupled mode theory. Altogether, our continuum formalism offers a unified treatment of polaritons that connects the framework of light-matter coupling with that of linear dispersion.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of photophysical aggregates in conjugated polymers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14675v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photophysical aggregates are ubiquitous in many solid-state microstructures adopted by conjugated polymers, in which $\pi$ electrons interact with those in other polymer chains or those in other chromophores along the chain. These interactions fundamentally define the electronic and optical properties of the polymer film. While valuable insight can be gained from linear excitation and photoluminescence spectra, nonlinear coherent excitation spectral lineshapes provide intricate understanding on the electronic couplings that define the aggregate and their fluctuations. Here, we discuss the coherent two-dimensional excitation lineshape of a model hairy-rod conjugated polymer. At zero population waiting time, we find a $\pi/2$ phase shift between the 0-0 and 0-1 vibronic peaks in the real and imaginary components of the complex coherent spectrum, as well as a dynamic phase rotation with population waiting time over timescales that are longer than the optical dephasing time. We conjecture that these are markers of relaxation of the photophysical aggregate down the tight manifold of the exciton band. These results highlight the potential for coherent spectroscopy via analysis of the complex spectral lineshape to become a key tool to develop structure-property relationships in complex functional materials.</description>
