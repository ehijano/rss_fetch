      <title>Realising all countable groups as quasi-isometry groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given any countable group $G$, we construct uncountably many quasi-isometry classes of proper geodesic metric spaces with quasi-isometry group isomorphic to $G$. Moreover, if the group $G$ is a hyperbolic group, the spaces we construct are hyperbolic metric spaces.
  We make use of a rigidity phenomenon for quasi-isometries exhibited by many symmetric spaces, called strong quasi-isometric rigidity. Our method involves the construction of new examples of strongly quasi-isometrically rigid spaces, arising as graphs of strongly quasi-isometrically rigid rank-one symmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>Uniformly affine actions on Banach spaces: growth of cocycles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate growth properties of cocycles with values in uniformly bounded representations on super-reflexive Banach spaces; this includes $L^p$-spaces for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ as well as Hilbert spaces. We then study the generalized Hilbert compression of cocycles arising in this setting for the Property (T) groups $\mathrm{Sp}(n,1)$, $n\ge 2$, and establish the existence of uniformly Lipschitz affine actions with optimal growth.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.06934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the profinite genus of HNN-extensions whose associated subgroups are finite. We give precise formulas for the number of isomorphism classes of HNN(G,H,K,t,f) and of its profinite completion and compute the profinite genus of such an HNN-extension HNN(G,H,K,t,f). We also list various situations when HNN(G,H,K,t,f) is determined by its profinite completion.</description>

      <title>Center-freeness of finite-step solvable groups arising from anabelian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Anabelian geometry suggests that, for suitably geometric objects, their \'etale fundamental group determines the object up to isomorphism. From a group-theoretic viewpoint, this philosophy requires rigidity properties of the associated \'etale fundamental groups, which often follow from their center-freeness. In fact, some profinite groups arising from anabelian geometry are center-free. In the present paper, we investigate how such center-freeness behaves when passing to maximal $m$-step solvable quotients for any integer $m\geq 2$. In particular, we show that the maximal $m$-step solvable quotient of the geometric \'etale fundamental group of a hyperbolic curve over a field of characteristic $0$ is center-free. Furthermore, we show that this implies the injectivity statement, i.e., the rigidity property, of the $m$-step solvable Grothendieck conjecture.</description>

      <title>$A_3$-formality for Demushkin groups at odd primes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07551v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a weak form of formality for differential graded algebras, called $A_3$-formality, for the cohomology of pro-p Demushkin groups at odd primes p. We show that the differential graded $\mathbb{F}_p$-algebras of continuous cochains of Demushkin groups with q-invariant not equal 3 are $A_3$-formal, whereas Demushkin groups with q-invariant 3 are not $A_3$-formal. We prove these results by an explicit computation of the Benson-Krause-Schwede canonical class in Hochschild cohomology.</description>

      <title>Semisimple algebraic groups over real closed fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a self-contained introduction to linear algebraic and semialgebraic groups over real closed fields, and we generalize several key results about semisimple Lie groups to algebraic and semialgebraic groups over real closed fields. We prove that a torus in a semisimple algebraic group is maximal $\mathbb{R}$-split if and only if it is maximal $\mathbb{F}$-split for real closed fields $\mathbb{F}$. For the $\mathbb{F}$-points we formulate and prove the Iwasawa-decomposition $KAU$, the Cartan-decomposition $KAK$ and the Bruhat-decomposition $BWB$. For unipotent subgroups we prove the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, facilitating the analysis of root groups. We give a proof of the Jacobson-Morozov Lemma about subgroups whose Lie algebra is isomorphic to $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ for algebraic groups and a version for the $\mathbb{F}$-points, when the root system is reduced. We describe the rank 1 subgroups which are the semisimple parts of Levi-subgroups. We prove a semialgebraic version of Kostant's convexity theorem. The main tool used is a model theoretic transfer principle that follows from the Tarski-Seidenberg theorem.</description>

      <title>Quiver presentations for band algebras are defined over the integers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.06587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A band is a semigroup in which each element is idempotent. In recent years, there has been a lot of activity on the representation theory of the subclass of left regular bands due to connections to Markov chains associated to hyperplane arrangements, oriented matroids, matroids and CAT(0) cube complexes. We prove here that the integral semigroup algebra of a band is isomorphic to the integral path algebra of a quiver modulo an admissible ideal. This leads to a uniform bound quiver presentation for band algebras over all fields. Also, we answer a question of Margolis, Saliola and Steinberg by proving that the integral semigroup algebra of a CW left regular band is isomorphic to the quotient of the integral path algebra of the Hasse diagram of its support semilattice modulo the ideal generated by the sum of all paths of length two. This includes, for example, hyperplane face semigroup algebras.</description>

      <title>Idempotents and Powers of Ideals in Quandle Rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.07057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article addresses two central problems in the theory of quandle rings. First, motivated by Conjecture 3.10 in Internat. J. Math. 34 (2023), no. 3, Paper No. 2350011: for a semi-latin quandle $X$, every nonzero idempotent in the integral quandle ring $\mathbb{Z}[X]$ necessarily corresponds to an element of $X$, we investigate idempotents in quandle rings of semi-latin quandles. Precisely, we prove that if the ground ring is an integral domain with unity, then the quandle ring of Core($\mathbb{Z}$) admits only trivial idempotents. Second, powers of augmentation ideals in quandle rings have only been computed in few cases previously. We extend the computations to include dihedral quandles and commutative quandles. Finally, we examine idempotents in quandle rings of $2$-almost latin quandles and apply these results to compute the automorphism groups of their integral quandle rings.</description>

Abstract: We study $\mathbb Z_2\times\mathbb Z_2$ bi-graded Lie algebras. We describe their properties in relation to Lie superalgebras with some compatible structures. Then we focus on the approach to the Lie group--algebra correspondence based on Harish-Chandra pairs and provide some examples of application of it in the bi-graded setting.</description>

      <title>Semi-boolean and Yosida $\ell$-groups, Martinez and Yosida frames, and the $G+B$ construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class of semi-boolean $\ell$-groups was introduced in 1968 by A. Bigard. These are the $\ell$-groups $G$ in which the principal convex $\ell$-subgroup $G(a)$ generated by any $a \in G$ is equal to the polar $a^{\perp \perp}$. Examples include all hyperarchimedean $\ell$-groups and all existentially closed abelian $\ell$-groups. Ordered by inclusion, the set of convex $\ell$-subgroups of a semi-boolean $\ell$-group is a \Mart frame (an algebraic frame with FIP in which every element is a $d$-element). Related are the Yosida $\ell$-groups, i.e., the $\ell$-groups whose frame of convex $\ell$-subgroups is a Yosida frame (an algebraic frame with FIP in which every compact element is a meet of maximal elements). Applying results on \Mart frames and Yosida frames, we obtain new characterizations of the semi-boolean and Yosida $\ell$-groups, show that the former constitute a radical class and the latter do not, and present new examples with special properties. To build some of our examples, we introduce the $G+B$ construction for $\ell$-groups, an adaptation of the $A+B$ construction from commutative algebra.</description>

      <title>Stabilized automorphism groups and full groups of odometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we show that the stabilized automorphism group of free exact odometers arising from actions of finitely generated residually finite groups coincides with the topological full group of the odometer acting on itself by right multiplication. We then prove that two free exact odometers have isomorphic stabilized automorphism groups if and only if they have isomorphic clopen subgroups of the same index. As a consequence, continuous orbit equivalence implies isomorphic stabilized automorphism groups, while for free $\mathbb{Z}^d$-odometers, isomorphic stabilized automorphism groups imply orbit equivalence. In general, neither continuous orbit equivalence nor orbit equivalence is equivalent to having isomorphic stabilized automorphism groups.</description>

      <title>Twisted commutativity and conjugacy ratio in groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18980v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the degree of twisted commutativity and the twisted conjugacy ratio of a finitely generated group $G$. The degree of twisted commutativity $\mathrm{tdc}_X(\varphi, G)$ generalises the degree of commutativity of $G$, by measuring the density of pairs of elements with trivial twisted commutators in the ball of radius $n$ of $G$, as $n \rightarrow \infty$, where the twisting is done with respect to an endomorphism $\varphi$ of $G$. We compute $\mathrm{tdc}_X(\varphi, G)$ for several classes of groups, including virtually abelian groups, groups of subexponential growth, and free groups.
  We then study the twisted conjugacy ratio $\mathrm{tcr}_{X}(\varphi, G)$, which is the limit at infinity of the quotient of the twisted conjugacy and standard growth functions. We compute $\mathrm{tcr}_{X}(\varphi, G)$ for virtually abelian groups, and give examples of groups of exponential growth such that $\mathrm{tcr}_{X}(\varphi, G) = 0$.</description>

Abstract: We exhibit two examples of convex cocompact subgroups of the isometry groups of real hyperbolic spaces with limit set a Pontryagin sphere: one generated by $50$ reflections of $\mathbb{H}^4$, and the other by a rotation of order $21$ and a reflection of $\mathbb{H}^6$. For each of them, we also locate convex cocompact subgroups with limit set a Menger curve.</description>
