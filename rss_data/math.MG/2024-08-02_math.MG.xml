      <title>On the Genus of One Degree of Freedom Planar Linkages via Tropical Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on studying the configuration spaces of graphs realised in $\mathbb C^2$, such that the configuration space is, after normalisation, one dimensional. If this is the case, then the configuration space is, generically, a smooth complex curve, and can be seen as a Riemann surface. The property of interest in this paper is the genus of this curve. Using tropical geometry, we give an algorithm to compute this genus. We provide an implementation in Python and give various examples.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz extensions from spaces of nonnegative curvature into CAT(1) spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00564</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00564v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that complete $\text{CAT}(\kappa)$ spaces of sufficiently small radii possess metric cotype 2 and metric Markov cotype 2. This generalizes the previously known result for complete $\text{CAT}(0)$ spaces. The generalization involves extending the variance inequality known for barycenters in $\text{CAT}(0)$ spaces to an inequality analogous to one for 2-uniformly convex Banach spaces, and demonstrating that the barycenter map on such spaces is Lipschitz continuous on the corresponding Wasserstein 2 space. By utilizing the generalized Ball extension theorem by Mendel and Naor, we obtain an extension result for Lipschitz maps from Alexandrov spaces of nonnegative curvature into $\text{CAT}(\kappa)$ spaces whose image is contained in a subspace of sufficiently small radius, thereby weakening the curvature assumption in the well-known Lipschitz extension theorem for Alexandrov spaces by Lang and Schr\"oder. As an additional application, we obtain that $\ell_p$ spaces for $p &gt; 2$ cannot be uniformly embedded into any $\text{CAT}(\kappa)$ space with sufficiently small diameter.</description>

      <title>Comments on the regularity of harmonic maps between singular spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00479v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we are going to establish H\"older continuity of harmonic maps from an open set $\Omega$ in an ${\rm RCD}(K,N)$ space valued into a ${\rm CAT}(\kappa)$ space, with the constraint that the image of $\Omega$ via the map is contained in a sufficiently small ball in the target. Building on top of this regularity and assuming a local Lipschitz regularity of the map, we establish a weak version of the Bochner-Eells-Sampson inequality in such a non-smooth setting. Finally we study the boundary regularity of such maps.</description>

      <title>Liouville quantum gravity metrics are not doubling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We observe that non-doubling metric spaces can be characterized as those that contain arbitrarily large sets of approximately equidistant points and use this to show that, for $\gamma \in (0,2]$, the $\gamma$-Liouville quantum gravity metric is almost surely not doubling and thus cannot be quasisymmetrically embedded into any finite-dimensional Euclidean space. This generalizes the corresponding result of Troscheit for the Brownian map (which is equivalent to the case $\gamma = \sqrt{8/3}$).</description>

      <title>The Weighted $L^p$ Minkowski Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Minkowski problem in convex geometry concerns showing a given Borel measure on the unit sphere is, up to perhaps a constant, some type of surface area measure of a convex body. Two types of Minkowski problems in particular are an active area of research: $L^p$ Minkowski problems, introduced by Lutwak and (Lutwak,Yang, and Zhang), and weighted Minkowski problems, introduced by Livshyts. For the latter, the Gaussian Minkowski problem, whose primary investigators were (Huang, Xi and Zhao), is the most prevalent. In this work, we consider weighted surface area in the $L^p$ setting. We propose a framework going beyond the Gaussian setting by focusing on rotational invariant measures, mirroring the recent development of the Gardner-Zvavitch inequality for rotational invariant, log-concave measures. Our results include existence for all $p \in \mathbb R$ (with symmetry assumptions in certain instances). We also have uniqueness for $p \geq 1$ under a concavity assumption. Finally, we obtain results in the so-called $small$ $mass$ $regime$ using degree theory, as instigated in the Gaussian case by (Huang, Xi and Zhao). Most known results for the Gaussian Minkowski problem are then special cases of our main theorems.</description>
