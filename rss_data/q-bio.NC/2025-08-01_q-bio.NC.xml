      <title>Place-cell heterogeneity underlies power-laws in hippocampal activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Power-law scaling in coarse-grained data suggests critical dynamics, but the true source of this scaling often remains unclear. Here, we analyze neural activity recorded during spatial navigation, reproducing power-law scaling under a phenomenological renormalization group (PRG) procedure that clusters units by activity similarity. Such scaling was previously linked to criticality. Here, we show that the iterative nature of the procedure itself leads to the emergence of power laws when applied to heterogeneous, non-interacting units obeying spatially structured activity without requiring critical interactions. Furthermore, the scaling exponents produced by heteregeneous non-interacting units match the observed exponents in recorded neural data. A simplified version of the PRG further reveals how heterogeneity smooths transitions across scales, mimicking critical behavior. The resulting exponents depend systematically on system and population size, predictions confirmed by subsampling the data.</description>

      <title>Alpha-Z divergence unveils further distinct phenotypic traits of human brain connectivity fingerprint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate identification of individuals from functional connectomes (FCs) is critical for advancing individualized assessments in neuropsychiatric research. Traditional methods, such as Pearson's correlation, have limitations in capturing the complex, non-Euclidean geometry of FC data, leading to suboptimal performance in identification performance. Recent developments have introduced geodesic distance as a more robust metric; however, its performance is highly sensitive to regularization choices, which vary by spatial scale and task condition. To address these challenges, we propose a novel divergence-based distance metric, the Alpha-Z Bures-Wasserstein divergence, which provides a more flexible and geometry-aware framework for FC comparison. Unlike prior methods, our approach does not require meticulous parameter tuning and maintains strong identification performance across multiple task conditions and spatial resolutions. We evaluate our approach against both traditional (e.g., Euclidean, Pearson) and state-of-the-art manifold-based distances (e.g., affine-invariant, log-Euclidean, Bures-Wasserstein), and systematically investigate how varying regularization strengths affect geodesic distance performance on the Human Connectome Project dataset. Our results show that the proposed method significantly improves identification rates over traditional and geodesic distances, particularly when optimized regularization is applied, and especially in high-dimensional settings where matrix rank deficiencies degrade existing metrics. We further validate its generalizability across resting-state and task-based fMRI, using multiple parcellation schemes. These findings suggest that the new divergence provides a more reliable and generalizable framework for functional connectivity analysis, offering enhanced sensitivity in linking FC patterns to cognitive and behavioral outcomes.</description>

      <title>A complex network perspective on brain disease</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If brain anatomy and dynamics have a genuine complex network structure as it has become standard to posit, it is also reasonable to assume that such a structure should play a key role not only in brain function but also in brain dysfunction. However, exactly how network structure is implicated in brain damage and whether at least some pathologies can be thought of as "network diseases" is not entirely clear. Here we discuss ways in which a complex network representation can help characterising brain pathology, but also subjects' vulnerability to and likelihood of recovery from disease. We show how the way disease is defined is related to the way function is defined and this, in turn, determines which network property may be functionally relevant to brain disease. Thus, addressing brain disease "networkness" may shed light not only on brain pathology, with potential clinical implications, but also on functional brain activity, and what is functional in it.</description>

      <title>Neural Autoregressive Modeling of Brain Aging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22954</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22954v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Brain aging synthesis is a critical task with broad applications in clinical and computational neuroscience. The ability to predict the future structural evolution of a subject's brain from an earlier MRI scan provides valuable insights into aging trajectories. Yet, the high-dimensionality of data, subtle changes of structure across ages, and subject-specific patterns constitute challenges in the synthesis of the aging brain. To overcome these challenges, we propose NeuroAR, a novel brain aging simulation model based on generative autoregressive transformers. NeuroAR synthesizes the aging brain by autoregressively estimating the discrete token maps of a future scan from a convenient space of concatenated token embeddings of a previous and future scan. To guide the generation, it concatenates into each scale the subject's previous scan, and uses its acquisition age and the target age at each block via cross-attention. We evaluate our approach on both the elderly population and adolescent subjects, demonstrating superior performance over state-of-the-art generative models, including latent diffusion models (LDM) and generative adversarial networks, in terms of image fidelity. Furthermore, we employ a pre-trained age predictor to further validate the consistency and realism of the synthesized images with respect to expected aging patterns. NeuroAR significantly outperforms key models, including LDM, demonstrating its ability to model subject-specific brain aging trajectories with high fidelity.</description>

      <title>Neural Energy Landscapes Predict Working Memory Decline After Brain Tumor Resection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Surgical resection is the primary treatment option for brain tumor patients, but it carries the risk of postoperative cognitive dysfunction. This study investigates how tumor-induced alterations in presurgical neural dynamics relate to postoperative working memory decline. We analyzed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) of brain tumor patients before surgery and extracted energy landscapes of high-order brain interactions. We then examined the relation between these energy features and postoperative working memory performance using statistical and machine learning (random forest) models. Patients with lower postoperative working memory scores exhibited fewer but more extreme transitions between local energy minima and maxima, whereas patients with higher scores showed more frequent but less extreme shifts. Furthermore, the presurgical high-order energy features were able to accurately predict postoperative working memory decline with a mean accuracy of 90\%, F1 score of 87.5\%, and an AUC of 0.95. Our study suggests that the brain tumor-induced disruptions in high-order neural dynamics before surgery are predictive of postoperative working memory decline. Our findings pave the path for personalized surgical planning and targeted interventions to mitigate cognitive risks associated with brain tumor resection.</description>

      <title>Pixel Embedding Method for Tubular Neurite Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Automatic segmentation of neuronal topology is critical for handling large scale neuroimaging data, as it can greatly accelerate neuron annotation and analysis. However, the intricate morphology of neuronal branches and the occlusions among fibers pose significant challenges for deep learning based segmentation. To address these issues, we propose an improved framework: First, we introduce a deep network that outputs pixel level embedding vectors and design a corresponding loss function, enabling the learned features to effectively distinguish different neuronal connections within occluded regions. Second, building on this model, we develop an end to end pipeline that directly maps raw neuronal images to SWC formatted neuron structure trees. Finally, recognizing that existing evaluation metrics fail to fully capture segmentation accuracy, we propose a novel topological assessment metric to more appropriately quantify the quality of neuron segmentation and reconstruction. Experiments on our fMOST imaging dataset demonstrate that, compared to several classical methods, our approach significantly reduces the error rate in neuronal topology reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Breaking the mould of Social Mixed Reality -- State-of-the-Art and Glossary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article explores a critical gap in Mixed Reality (MR) technology: while advances have been made, MR still struggles to authentically replicate human embodiment and socio-motor interaction. For MR to enable truly meaningful social experiences, it needs to incorporate multi-modal data streams and multi-agent interaction capabilities. To address this challenge, we present a comprehensive glossary covering key topics such as Virtual Characters and Autonomisation, Responsible AI, Ethics by Design, and the Scientific Challenges of Social MR within Neuroscience, Embodiment, and Technology. Our aim is to drive the transformative evolution of MR technologies that prioritize human-centric innovation, fostering richer digital connections. We advocate for MR systems that enhance social interaction and collaboration between humans and virtual autonomous agents, ensuring inclusivity, ethical design and psychological safety in the process.</description>

      <title>Unable to Forget: Proactive Interference Reveals Working Memory Limits in LLMs Beyond Context Length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08184v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information retrieval in Large Language Models (LLMs) is increasingly recognized as intertwined with generation capabilities rather than mere lookup. While longer contexts are often assumed to improve retrieval, the effects of intra-context interference remain understudied. To address this, we adapt the proactive interference (PI) paradigm from cognitive science, where earlier information disrupts recall of newer updates. In humans, susceptibility to such interference is inversely linked to working memory capacity. We introduce PI-LLM, an evaluation that sequentially streams semantically related key-value updates and queries only the final values. Although these final values are clearly positioned just before the query, LLM retrieval accuracy declines log-linearly toward zero as interference accumulates; errors arise from retrieving previously overwritten values. Attempts to mitigate interference via prompt engineering (e.g., instructing models to ignore earlier input) yield limited success. These findings reveal a fundamental constraint on LLMs' ability to disentangle interference and flexibly manipulate information, suggesting a working memory bottleneck beyond mere context access. This calls for approaches that strengthen models' ability to suppress irrelevant content during retrieval.</description>
