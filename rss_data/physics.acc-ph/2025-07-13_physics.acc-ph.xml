      <title>Theoretical study of the ECRIPAC accelerator concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electron Cyclotron Resonance Ion Plasma ACcelerator (ECRIPAC) is an original concept for a plasma-based particle accelerator able to generate pulsed ion beams with adjustable energy, targeting mostly medical applications. In a complementary letter (Cernuschi et al., arXiv:2507.07827) we thoroughly reviewed and corrected the current literature on the subject, including also an original theoretical investigation on the influence of several physical parameters on the accelerator stability. This study led to the proposal of a compact demonstrator device, which has been validated through Monte Carlo simulations. The present paper provides a detailed and more extended explanation of the ECRIPAC working principle and physics, including mathematical derivations for several physical formulas. Moreover, several other parameters have been included in the accelerator stability study, providing an overview of achievable external fields and plasma characteristics allowing a stable ion acceleration.</description>

      <title>Differentiable simulations for particle tracking in accelerators: analysis, benchmarking and optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimization of beamlines and lattices is a common problem in accelerator physics, which is usually solved with semi-analytical methods and numerical optimization routines. However, these are usually of the gradient-free or finite-differences type, whose computational cost grows quickly with the number of optimization parameters. On the other hand, the cost of gradient-based optimization can scale well with the number of parameters, but only if the computation of the gradient is itself efficient (e.g. not via finite differences, which are inefficient). Recently, there has been an emergence of so-called "differentiable" codes that efficiently provide gradients. Nevertheless, analysis and benchmarking comparisons of these techniques have largely been absent from the literature.
  In this work, we develop our own differentiable code, via auto-differentiation. We analyze and benchmark differentiability against finite differences in two test cases, a space-charge FODO cell from the literature and a realistic future beamline at CERN. The analyses and benchmarking are done both theoretically and empirically. Finally, we embed the gradient provided by the differentiable code in gradient-based optimization routines and compare with gradient-free methods. This work offers the first such analysis and benchmarking and thus contributes towards the development of more efficient and performant particle accelerators.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Superconducting Nb Film Cavities by Mitigating Medium-Field Q-Slope Through Annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Niobium films are of interest in applications in various superconducting devices, such as superconducting radiofrequency cavities for particle accelerators and superconducting qubits for quantum computing. In this study, we addressed the persistent medium-field Q-slope issue in Nb film cavities, which, despite their high-quality factor at low RF fields, exhibit a significant Q-slope at medium RF fields compared to bulk Nb cavities. Traditional heat treatments, effective in reducing surface resistance and mitigating the Q-slope in bulk Nb cavities, are challenging for niobium-coated copper cavities. To overcome this challenge, we employed DC biased high-power impulse magnetron sputtering to deposit niobium film onto a 1.3 GHz single-cell elliptical bulk niobium cavity, followed by annealing treatments aimed at modifying the properties of the niobium film. In-situ annealing at 340 {\deg}C increased the quench field from 10.0 to 12.5 MV/m. Vacuum furnace annealing at 600 {\deg}C and 800 {\deg}C for 3 hours resulted in a quench field increase of 13.5 and 15.3 MV/m, respectively. Further annealing at 800 {\deg}C for 6 hours boosted the quench field to 17.5 MV/m. Additionally, the annealing treatments significantly reduced the field dependence of the surface resistance. However, increasing the annealing temperature to 900 {\deg}C induced a Q-switch phenomenon in the cavity. The analysis of RF performance and material characterization before and after annealing has provided critical insights into how the microstructure and impurity levels in Nb films influence the evolution of the Q-slope in Nb film cavities. Our findings highlight the significant roles of hydrides, high local misorientation, and lattice and surface defects in driving field-dependent losses.</description>

      <title>Angular momentum dynamics of vortex particles in accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments with spin-polarized beams of leptons and hadrons typically employ plane-wave states with definite momenta and energies. In contrast, vortex states represent cylindrical waves carrying a well-defined orbital angular momentum projection along the propagation direction. This projection can be arbitrarily large, endowing such particles with magnetic moments orders of magnitude greater than those of plane-wave states. Consequently, vortex particles could complement - or even replace - spin-polarized beams in high-energy collisions, enabling access to observables beyond the reach of the conventional states. Although relativistic vortex beams have yet to be realized, we investigate the radiative and non-radiative dynamics of angular momentum for vortex particles in accelerators. We compute the timescale for angular momentum loss via photon emission, finding it significantly longer than typical acceleration times. The non-radiative dynamics is governed by precession, with the orbital angular momentum precessing at a frequency markedly different from that of spin. Similar to spin tunes in circular accelerators, this can induce resonances that disrupt the beam's orbital momentum - occurring far more frequently for vortex beams than for spin-polarized ones. Thus, vortex particle acceleration can be more feasible in linacs, while Siberian snakes could serve as a tool for angular momentum manipulations.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbit Structure and Helicity Anomaly in Relativistic Electron Vortex Beams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08493v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relativistic electron vortex beam (REVB) has attracted increasing attention due to its nontrivial spin-orbit structure recently. As relativistic electrons are governed by the Dirac equation, exact solutions to this equation provide the most reliable starting point for understanding angular momentum characteristics of REVBs. In this work, a set of exact eigensolutions of the Dirac equation are derived in a complex cylindrical coordinate system using a generalized series expansion method. We demonstrate that the eigenstate carries net angular momentum with the vortex charge being the quantum number of the total angular momentum along the propagation direction and deduce the explicit expression for the intrinsic spin-orbit coupling strength. Furthermore, we show that helicity, which exhibits anomaly in the vortex state, can serve as a practical characterizing quantity for the REVB. This work lays a theoretical foundation for further exploration of REVBs in both theory and experiment.</description>

      <title>Design of an Active Thomson Parabola for the detection of ions accelerated by laser: Numerical simulations and characterization of different solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05220</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article describes the development of an active Thomson Parabola ion spectrometer designed to measure the energy spectra of different multi-MeV ion species generated in laser-plasmas interactions. To do so, GEANT4 optical simulations were carried out in order to design and build a spectrometer based on scintillator detectors capable of operating at rates comparable with the highest achievable at any existing or upcoming high intensity laser facilities. Details on the different configurations simulated and their characterization are discussed.</description>
