      <title>Interaction between cell membranes and protein inclusions in the large-deformation regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biological membranes are dynamic surfaces whose shape and function are critically influenced by protein inclusions (PIs). While membrane deformations induced by PIs have been extensively studied in the small-deformation regime, a variety of processes involves strong membrane deformations. We investigate the interaction between lipid membranes and PIs in the large deformation (LD) regime, with the finite-element method. We develop an approximate analytical solution that captures key features of the LD regime. We show that the force exerted by the membrane on a PI displays a non-monotonic behavior with respect to the PI vertical displacement. The qualitative features of this force appear to be independent of the protein geometry. For two interacting PIs, the membrane-mediated potential exhibits sub-power-law decay with inter-protein distance, reflecting the complex nature of the elastic medium. The interaction potential shows that conical PIs with identical and opposite orientations repel and attract, respectively, confirming the analogy between PI orientation and electric charge, in the LD regime. In the presence of membrane flows, we identify a characteristic velocity that separates two regimes in which bending rigidity and viscous effects dominate, respectively, implying the onset of flow-induced deformations above such velocity threshold. Overall, our results provide quantitative predictions for membrane-protein systems in biologically relevant scenarios involving LDs, with implications for protein sorting, clustering, and membrane trafficking.</description>

      <title>Swelling-Induced Stress-Assisted Transfer of Nanodiamond Arrays with a PVA Carrier Tape for Conformal Bio-Integrated Sensing and Labelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The conformal integration of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center nanodiamond arrays onto soft, hydrated, curvilinear biological interfaces remain a fundamental challenge for in vivo quantum sensing and imaging. Conventional transfer techniques often fail due to reliance on high temperature, corrosive chemicals, or mechanical peeling, leading to pattern damage, low fidelity, or poor biocompatibility. Here, we report a transfer strategy utilizing polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) carrier soluble tape, enabling rapid, residue-free, high-fidelity transfer of nanodiamond patterns onto diverse biointerfaces. The success of this method is rooted in a unique "hydrate-soften-expand-self-peel" mechanism of the soluble tape with PVA backing. In situ mechanical tracking reveals non-uniform PVA swelling upon hydration generates transient local normal and shear stresses at the interface. These stresses delaminate the tape within 3 minutes at room temperature while promoting adhesion of the nanodiamond array to the substrate. In contrast, conventional water-soluble tapes with composite structures undergo passive dissolution and collapse, causing residue contamination and reduced efficiency. Leveraging this mechanism, we achieve conformal patterning on ultra-soft hydrogels (~0.6 kPa) and highly curved bio-surfaces (hair, 100 {\mu}m^-1). Additionally, we demonstrate a dual-identity verification system integrating data storage and physical unclonable functions on a hydrogel contact lens. This work provides a versatile tool for bio-interface engineering and a general framework for gentle, efficient transfer of functional nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>On the effect of force on DNA in the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15792v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a numerical study of the dynamics of DNA double helix breakage under the influence of external forces using the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois (PBD) model. The PBD model represents DNA as a chain of nonlinearly coupled oscillators, which makes it possible to analyze the processes of melting and mechanical denaturation. The main focus is on cases where an external force is applied to the terminal or central site of a DNA molecule, simulating stretching at a constant rate. The critical force required to break hydrogen bonds, which depends on the point of application of the force, is calculated. It is found that the denaturation process occurs stepwise, with characteristic peaks in the force-time graphs. The phenomenon of hysteresis under periodic exposure to external forces is also studied, which is important for understanding energy losses and heating of the system.</description>

      <title>In vitro binding energies capture Klf4 occupancy across the human genome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transcription factors (TFs) regulate gene expression by binding to specific genomic loci determined by DNA sequence. Their sequence specificity is commonly summarized by a consensus binding motif. However, eukaryotic genomes contain billions of low-affinity DNA sequences to which TFs associate with a sequence-dependent binding energy. We currently lack insight into how the genomic sequence defines this spectrum of binding energies and the resulting pattern of TF localization. Here, we set out to obtain a quantitative understanding of sequence-dependent TF binding to both motif and non-motif sequences. We achieve this by first pursuing accurate measurements of physical binding energies of the human TF Klf4 to a library of short DNA sequences in a fluorescence-anisotropy-based bulk competitive binding assay. Second, we show that the highly non-linear sequence dependence of Klf4 binding energies can be captured by combining a linear model of binding energies with an Ising model of the coupled recognition of nucleotides by a TF. We find that this statistical mechanics model parametrized by our in vitro measurements captures Klf4 binding patterns on individual long DNA molecules stretched in the optical tweezer, and is predictive for Klf4 occupancy across the entire human genome without additional fit parameters.</description>

      <title>Effects of 2.45 GHz radiofrequency upon Leuconostoc mesenteroides Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase enzymatic activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.11382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this report we evaluate the effect in the enzyme activity of Glucose 6-phosphate Dehydrogenase from Leuconostoc mesenteroides by irradiation with 2.45 GHz radiofrequency at a power output of 0.1 W during a 91 h period. The results show that the RF irradiation preserves the activity of treated samples of this enzyme with respect to a non-treated sample that instead suffer an increased rate of activity loss. Our estimates indicate that the enzyme activation is due to a non-thermal effect. The results are consistent with reports about the effect of 2.45 GHz radiation upon other enzymatic systems.</description>

      <title>Three-Dimensional Volumetric Reconstruction of Native Chilean Pollen via Lens-Free Digital In-line Holographic Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents a robust methodology for the 3D volumetric reconstruction of native Chileanpollen grains, specifically Gevuina avellana (hazel),Conium maculatum (hemloc) and Anthemis cotula (chamomile). Using a lens-free Digital In-line Holographic Microscopy (DLHM) system, we capture complex interference patterns that are numerically reconstructed using the Kirchhoff-Helmholtz transform. Our results demonstrate that this label-free approach provides high-fidelity morphological characterization and nanometric precision in biophysical parameter extraction, offering a scalable alternative for automated melissopalynology and environmental monitoring.</description>

      <title>Optical Manipulation of Erythrocytes via Evanescent Waves: Assessing Glucose-Induced Mobility Variations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15502v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamics of red blood cells (RBCs) under the influence of evanescent waves generated by total internal reflection (TIR). Using a 1064 nm laser system and a dual-chamber prism setup, we quantified the mobility of erythrocytes in different glucose environments. Our methodology integrates automated tracking via TrackMate\c{opyright} to analyze over 60 trajectory sets. The results reveal a significant decrease in mean velocity, from 11.8 {\mu}m/s in 5 mM glucose to 8.8 {\mu}m/s in 50 mM glucose (p = 0.019). These findings suggest that evanescent waves can serve as a non-invasive tool to probe the mechanical properties of cell membranes influenced by biochemical changes.</description>

      <title>Multimodal Imaging System Combining Hyperspectral and Laser Speckle Imaging for In Vivo Hemodynamic and Metabolic Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the development and validation of a novel multimodal optical imaging platform that integrates hyperspectral imaging (HSI) and laser speckle contrast imaging (LSCI) to enable real-time, non-invasive mapping of tissue oxygenation, perfusion and metabolism, via blood flowmetry and targeting of oxy- (HbO2), deoxyhemoglobin (HHb), as well as oxidized cytochrome-c-oxidase (oxCCO). The system architecture features a single high-speed camera and dual optical path, with synchronized alternating illumination: a filtered, supercontinuum laser for HSI and a He-Ne laser for LSCI. The system performances were evaluated through in vivo experiments on rat spinal cord under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, revealing coherent physiological changes in hemodynamics, metabolism and relative blood flow index (rBFI). These results demonstrate the potential of the platform for functional tissue imaging and quantitative dynamic monitoring of both oxygen delivery and consumption.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Kramers' Law: Hasselmann's Program and AMOC Tipping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18904v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In bistable dynamical systems driven by Wiener processes, the widely used Kramers' law relates the strength of the noise forcing to the average time it takes to see a noise-induced transition from one attractor to the other. We extend this law to bistable systems forced by fast chaotic dynamics, which we argue is in some cases a more realistic modeling approach than unbounded noise forcing. Transitions similar to the noise-driven case can only occur if the amplitude of the chaotic forcing is large enough. If this is the case, in our numerical example - a reduced-order model of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) - we observe the chaotic Kramers' law to hold even when the chaotic forcing is far from the stochastic limit. We discuss the limitations of the chaotic Kramers' law, how to address the numerical issues associated with the timescale separation, and give a possible explanation for the dynamics of recently found AMOC collapses and recoveries in complex climate models.</description>

      <title>Elasticity without a reference state: continuum mechanics of active tension nets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08968v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A constitutive relation between stress and strain relative to a reference state is the basic assumption of elasticity theory. However, in living matter, stress is governed by (motor molecule) activity rather than a constitutive law. What paradigm takes the place of elasticity in this setting? Here, we derive a continuum theory of active mechanics by taking the continuum limit of the Active Tension Network model of 2d epithelia. Instead of a reference state, we start from a prescribed active force configuration, encoded in a Riemannian "tension metric". Intuitively, one expects cells to adjust their positions to achieve force balance by rearranging local sources of active stress. More precisely, the cell positions define an embedding of the tension metric into 2d physical space, which determines the macroscopic physical stress. For free boundaries, tissue adopts a certain intrinsically defined shape, the force-balanced embedding with minimal internal stress. Boundary forces then deform this embedding. The resulting stress transformation yields an effective stress-strain relation. Key elements of elasticity hence emerge from a "stress-only" starting point, explaining how tissue shape can be adiabatically controlled by active stress during morphogenesis. Plastic behavior arises from topological cell rearrangement, which we represent by a continuous reparameterization of the tension metric, providing a principled continuum theory of emergent elasto-plastic flow. To express this physics, we use the mathematics of isothermal coordinates and quasi-conformal maps. An explicit coarse-graining study, described in a companion paper, substantiates the results of our continuum analysis. The present theory elucidates the unconventional mechanics of living tissues and may apply to 2d active and granular materials more generally.</description>
