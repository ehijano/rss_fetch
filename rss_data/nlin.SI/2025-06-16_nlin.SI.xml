      <title>Discrete Lagrangian multiforms for ABS equations II: tetrahedron and octahedron equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.16845v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present four types of discrete Lagrangian 2-form associated to the integrable quad equations of the ABS list. These include the triangle Lagrangian that has traditionally been used in the Lagrangian multiform description of ABS equations, the trident Lagrangian that was central to Part I of this paper, and two Lagrangians that have not been studied in the multiform setting. Two of the Lagrangian 2-forms have the quad equations, or a system equivalent to the quad equations, as their Euler-Lagrange equations, and one produces the tetrahedron equations. This is in contrast to the well-established Lagrangian 2-form for these equations, which produces equations that are weaker than the quad equations (they are equivalent to two octahedron equations).
  We use relations between the Lagrangian 2-forms to prove that the system of quad equations is equivalent to the combined system of tetrahedron and octahedron equations. Furthermore, for each of the Lagrangian 2-forms, we study the double zero property of the exterior derivative. In particular, this gives a possible variational interpretation to the octahedron equations.</description>

      <title>Discrete Lagrangian multiforms for ABS equations I: quad equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Discrete Lagrangian multiform theory is a variational perspective on lattice equations that are integrable in the sense of multidimensional consistency. The Lagrangian multiforms for the equations of the ABS classification formed the start of this theory, but the Lagrangian multiforms that are usually considered in this context produce equations that are slightly weaker than the ABS equations. In this work, we present alternative Lagrangian multiforms that have Euler-Lagrange equations equivalent to the ABS equations.
  In addition, the treatment of the ABS Lagrangian multiforms in the existing literature fails to acknowledge that the complex functions in their definitions have branch cuts. The choice of branch affects both the existence of an additive three-leg form for the ABS equations and the closure property of the Lagrangian multiforms. We give counterexamples for both these properties, but we recover them by including integer-valued fields, related to possible the branch choices, in the action sums.</description>

      <title>Solutions to an autonomous discrete KdV equation via Painlev\'e-type ordinary difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hirota's discrete KdV equation is a well-known integrable two-dimensional partial difference equation regarded as a discrete analogue of the KdV equation. In this paper, we show that a variation of Hirota's discrete KdV equation with an additional parameter admits two types of exact solutions: discrete Painlev\'e transcendent solutions and periodic solutions described by Painlev\'e-type ordinary difference equations.</description>
