      <title>Barely alternating real almost chains and extension operators for compact lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assume $\text{MA}(\kappa)$. We show that for every real chain of size $\kappa$ in the quotient Boolean algebra $P(\omega)/fin$ we can find an almost chain of representatives such that every $n\in\omega$ oscillates at most three times along the almost chain. This is used to show that for every countable discrete extension of a separable compact line $K$ of weight $\kappa$ there exists an extension operator $E:C(K)\longrightarrow C(L)$ of norm at most three.</description>

      <title>Truth and collection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Answering a question of Kaye, we show that the compositional truth theory with a full collection scheme is conservative over Peano Arithmetic. We demonstrate it by showing that countable models of compositional truth which satisfy the internal induction or collection axioms can be end-extended to models of the respective theory.</description>

      <title>Base-extension Semantics for S5 Modal Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a proof-theoretic semantics -- in particular, a base-extension semantics -- for multi-agent S5 modal logic (and hence also for the usual unindexed S5). Following the inferentialist interpretation of logic, this gives us a semantics in which validity is based on proof rather than truth. In base-extension semantics, the validity of formulae is generated by provability in a `base' of atomic rules and an inductive definition of the validity of the connectives. Base-extension semantics for many interesting logics has been explored by several authors and, in particular, a base-extension semantics for the modal logics K, KT, K4, and S4 has been developed by the present authors. Here, we give a base-extension semantics for multi-agent S5 with $\square_a$, for an agent a, as our primary operators, framed as the knowledge operator K_a. Similarly to Kripke semantics, we make use of relational structure between bases, allowing us to establish a correspondence between certain bases and worlds. We use this to establish the appropriate soundness and completeness results. We conclude by discussing how this semantics can be extended to Dynamic Epistemic Logics (DEL) starting with Public Announcement Logic (PAL).</description>

      <title>Projectivity meets Uniform Post Interpolant: Classical and Intuitionistic Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we examine the interplay between projectivity (in the sense that was introduced by S. Ghilardi) and uniform post-interpolant for the classical and intuitionistic propositional logic. More precisely, we explore whether a projective substitution of a formula is equivalent to its uniform post interpolant, assuming the substitution leaves the variables of the interpolant unchanged. We show that in classical logic, this holds for all formulas. Although such a nice property is missing in intuitionistic logic, we provide Kripke semantical characterization for propositions with this property. As a main application of this, we show that the unification type of some extensions of intuitionistic logic are finitary. At the end, we study admissibility for intuitionistic logic, relative to some sets of formulae. The first author of this paper, recently considered a particular case of this relativised admissibility and found it useful in characterizing the provability logic of Heyting Arithmetic.</description>

      <title>Dependence Logics in Temporal Settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.07839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.07839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many forms of dependence manifest themselves over time, with behavior of variables in dynamical systems as a paradigmatic example. This paper studies temporal dependence in dynamical systems from a logical perspective, by enriching a minimal modal base logic of static functional dependencies. We first introduce a logic for dynamical systems featuring temporalized variables, provide a complete axiomatic proof calculus, and show that its satisfiability problem is decidable. Then, to capture explicit reasoning about dynamic transition functions, we enhance the framework with function symbols and term identity. Next we combine temporalized variables with a modality for next-time truth from standard temporal logic, where modal correspondence analysis reveals the principles needed for a complete and decidable logic of timed dynamical systems supporting reductions between the two ways of referring to time. Our final result is an axiomatization of a general decidable logic of dependencies in arbitrary dynamical systems. We conclude with a brief outlook on how the systems introduced here mesh with richer temporal logics of system behavior, and with dynamic topological logic.</description>
