      <title>Spiderwebs on the Sphere and an Isoperimetric Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Here we present a rigidity result in a global (semi-global, homotopy) setting for a restrictive class of polytopes, those that can be inscribed in a unit sphere, with some additional conditions. The proof of the rigidity result for cabled frameworks on the surface of the sphere uses classical isoperimetric ideas.</description>

      <title>On face angles of tetrahedra with a given base</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let us consider the set $\Omega (\triangle ABC)$ of all tetrahedra $ABCD$ with a given non-degenerate base $ABC$ in $\mathbb{E}^3$ and $D$ lying outside the plane $ABC$. Let us denote by $\Sigma(\triangle ABC)$ the set $\left\{\Bigl(\cos \overline{\alpha},\cos \overline{\beta},\cos \overline{\gamma} \Bigr)\in \mathbb{R}^3\,|\, ABCD \in \Omega (\triangle ABC)\right\}$, where $\overline{\alpha}=\angle BDC$, $\overline{\beta}=\angle ADC$, and $\overline{\gamma}=\angle ADB$. The paper is devoted to the problem of determining of the closure of $\Sigma(\triangle ABC)$ in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and its boundary.</description>

      <title>PyRigi -- a general-purpose Python package for the rigidity and flexibility of bar-and-joint frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present PyRigi, a novel Python package designed to study the rigidity properties of graphs and frameworks. Among many other capabilities, PyRigi can determine whether a graph admits only finitely many ways, up to isometries, of being drawn in the plane once the edge lengths are fixed, whether it has a unique embedding, or whether it satisfied such properties even after the removal of any of its edges. By implementing algorithms from the scientific literature, PyRigi enables the exploration of rigidity properties of structures that would be out of reach for computations by hand. With reliable and robust algorithms, as well as clear, well-documented methods that are closely connected to the underlying mathematical definitions and results, PyRigi aims to be a practical and powerful general-purpose tool for the working mathematician interested in rigidity theory. PyRigi is open source and easy to use, and awaits researchers to benefit from its computational potential.</description>

      <title>A Paley-Wiener-Schwartz Theorem for smooth valuations on convex functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22464v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous dually epi-translation invariant valuations on convex functions are characterized in terms of the Fourier-Laplace transform of the associated Goodey-Weil distributions. This description is used to obtain integral representations of the smooth vectors of the natural representation of the group of translations on the space of these valuations. As an application, a complete classification of all closed and affine invariant subspaces is established, yielding density results for valuations defined in terms of mixed Monge-Amp\`ere operators.</description>

      <title>On Boundaries of $\varepsilon$-neighbourhoods of Planar Sets: Singularities, Global Structure, and Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.13515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.13515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the geometry, topological properties and smoothness of the boundaries of closed $\varepsilon$-neighbourhoods $E_\varepsilon = \{x \in \mathbb{R}^2 \, : \, \textrm{dist}(x, E) \leq \varepsilon \}$ of compact planar sets $E \subset \mathbb{R}^2$. We develop a novel technique for analysing the boundary, and use this to obtain a classification of singularities (i.e.~non-smooth points) on $\partial E_\varepsilon$ into eight categories. We show that the set of singularities is either countable or the disjoint union of a countable set and a closed, totally disconnected, nowhere dense set. Furthermore, we characterise, in terms of local geometry, those $\varepsilon$-neighbourhoods whose complement $\overline{\mathbb{R}^2 \setminus E_\varepsilon}$ is a set with positive reach. It is known that for all bounded $E \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and all $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, the boundary $\partial E_\varepsilon$ is $(d-1)$-rectifiable. Improving on this, we identify a sufficient condition for the boundary to be uniformly rectifiable, and provide an example of a planar $\varepsilon$-neighbourhood that is not Ahlfors regular. In terms of the topological structure, we show that for a compact set $E$ and $\varepsilon &gt; 0$ the boundary $\partial E_\varepsilon$ can be expressed as a disjoint union of an at most countably infinite union of Jordan curves and a possibly uncountable, totally disconnected set of singularities. Finally, we show that curvature is defined almost everywhere on the Jordan curve subsets of the boundary.</description>

      <title>On creating convexity in high dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$, we define \begin{align*} \mathrm{conv}_k(A) := \left\{ \lambda_1 s_1 + \cdots + \lambda_k s_k : \lambda_i \in [0,1], \sum_{i=1}^k \lambda_i = 1 , s_i \in A \right\} \end{align*} to be the set of vectors in $\mathbb{R}^n$ that can be written as a $k$-fold convex combination of vectors in $A$. Let $\gamma_n$ denote the standard Gaussian measure on $\mathbb{R}^n$. We show that for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there exists a subset $A$ of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with Gaussian measure $\gamma_n(A) \geq 1- \varepsilon$ such that for all $k = O_\varepsilon(\sqrt{\log \log(n)})$, $\mathrm{conv}_k(A)$ contains no convex set $K$ of Gaussian measure $\gamma_n(K) \geq \varepsilon$. This provides a negative resolution to a stronger version of a conjecture of Talagrand. Our approach utilises concentration properties of random copulas and the application of optimal transport techniques to the empirical coordinate measures of vectors in high dimensions.</description>

      <title>Robust Representation and Estimation of Barycenters and Modes of Probability Measures on Metric Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the problem of defining and estimating statistics for distributions on spaces such as Riemannian manifolds and more general metric spaces. The challenge comes, in part, from the fact that statistics such as means and modes may be unstable: for example, a small perturbation to a distribution can lead to a large change in Fr\'echet means on spaces as simple as a circle. We address this issue by introducing a new merge tree representation of barycenters called the barycentric merge tree (BMT), which takes the form of a measured metric graph and summarizes features of the distribution in a multiscale manner. Modes are treated as special cases of barycenters through diffusion distances. In contrast to the properties of classical means and modes, we prove that BMTs are stable -- this is quantified as a Lipschitz estimate involving optimal transport metrics. This stability allows us to derive a consistency result for approximating BMTs from empirical measures, with explicit convergence rates. We also give a provably accurate method for discretely approximating the BMT construction and use this to provide numerical examples for distributions on spheres and shape spaces.</description>
