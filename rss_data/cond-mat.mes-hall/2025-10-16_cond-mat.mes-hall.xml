      <title>Spontaneous Breaking of the SU(3) Flavor Symmetry in a Quantum Hall Valley Nematic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Two-dimensional quantum materials can host original electronic phases that arise from the interplay of electronic correlations, symmetry and topology. In particular, the spontaneous breaking of internal symmetry that acts simultaneously on the pseudospin and the spatial degree of freedom realizes a nematic ordering. We report evidence of a quantum Hall valley nematic phase with an underlying SU(3) order parameter space obtained by a spontaneous polarization between the threefold degenerate valley pseudospins in Pb1-xSnxSe quantum wells. In the presence of a Zeeman field, we demonstrate a further control of the nematic ordering with an explicit symmetry breaking. Evidence of both spontaneous and explicit SU(3) symmetry breaking, reminiscent of the quark flavor paradigm, is of fundamental interest to shape the many body physics in a SU(3) system.</description>

      <title>Unconventional criticality in $O(D)$-invariant loop-constrained Landau theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the critical behavior of a Landau-type theory for ferroelectrics in which the polarization order parameter $\vec{P}$ is subject to a divergence-free constraint, such that only loop-like polarization configurations contribute to the partition function. This constraint forces the number of components of the field $\vec{P}$ to equal the spatial dimensionality $D$, allowing a natural extension of the present theory to $O(N)$ models with $N=D$. Renormalization group analysis reveals critical behavior beyond the conventional Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. In particular, the order parameter acquires a remarkably large anomalous dimension, with $\eta\approx 0.239$ in three dimensions -- significantly exceeding the value $\eta\approx 0.034$ typical of the $O(3)$ universality class. This is due to an emergent gauge symmetry originating with the local constraint.</description>

      <title>Comparative study of phonon-limited carrier transport in the Weyl semimetal TaAs family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic first-principles study of phonon-limited transport in the TaAs family of Weyl semimetals using the ab initio Boltzmann transport equation. The calculated electrical conductivities show excellent agreement with experimental data for high-quality samples, confirming that transport in these systems is predominantly limited by phonon scattering. Among the four compounds, NbP achieves the highest conductivity, governed primarily by its large Fermi velocities that offset its stronger scattering rates. In contrast, TaAs displays the lowest conductivity, linked to reduced carrier pockets and limited carrier velocities. Additionally, NbP conductivity remains largely unaffected by small hole or electron doping, whereas TaAs exhibits pronounced electron-hole asymmetry. NbAs and TaP show intermediate behavior, reflecting their Fermi surface topologies and scattering phase space. These findings provide microscopic insight into the transport mechanisms of the TaAs family and emphasize the critical role of phonons, doping, and carrier dynamics in shaping their electronic response.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified mechanistic understanding of the electrical response of bipolar nanofluidic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bipolar nanoporous membranes and bipolar nanochannels are used in water desalination and energy-harvesting systems that provide clean water and green energy, respectively. The growing need for both requires continuous improvement of their performance. However, the underlying physics of these complex systems is still not fully understood, making empirical optimization slow and inefficient. In this work, we combine theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to develop a unified framework for improving the design of nanofluidic devices. We show that the system response is governed by the interplay between the applied voltage and a parameter $\eta$, which depends on the ratio of geometry and surface charge densities of both charged regions. At low voltages, the response is mostly determined by $\eta$, allowing its dependence to be represented by a simplified phase space. At high voltages, this phase space becomes oversimplified. To demonstrate the framework's robustness, we scan a range of configurations, from unipolar channels (single charged region) to bipolar channels (positive and negative segments). We compare the numerically simulated current-voltage responses with three theoretical models, which are limiting scenarios within the phase space, and explain the observed deviations. These findings can help reduce the time and resources required to optimize nanofluidic devices and improve the interpretation of experiments and simulations.</description>

      <title>Mapping Temperature Using Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electronic devices are engineered at increasingly smaller length scales; new metrologies to understand nanoscale thermodynamics are needed. Temperature and pressure are fundamental thermodynamic quantities whose nanoscale measurement is challenging as physical contact inevitably perturbs the system. Here we demonstrate Kikuchi diffraction thermometry (KDTh), a non-contact scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique capable of mapping nanoscale temperatures and pressures. KDTh detects local volumetric lattice changes in crystalline samples by precisely fitting Kikuchi patterns. Temperature changes are deduced using the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). We map lattice parameters and temperatures on Joule-heated graphite by rastering a 5.5-nm electron probe across the sample. Our parameter precision is ~0.01% and our temperature sensitivity is 2.2 K/$\sqrt{Hz}$. KDTh offers advanced sensitivity by fitting the entire Kikuchi pattern, even beyond the precision measured in transmission electron microscopy. KDTh can operate in both transmission (transmission Kikuchi diffraction, TKD) and reflection (electron backscatter diffraction, EBSD) modes.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Ehrenfest Dynamics with Topological and Geometric Phase Effects and the curious case of Elliptical intersection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive computational framework for simulating nonadiabatic molecular dynamics with explicit inclusion of geometric phase (GP) effects. Our approach is based on a generalized two-level Hamiltonian model that can represent various electronic state crossings - conical intersections, avoided crossings, and elliptic intersections - through appropriate parameterization. We introduce a novel prelooping trajectory initialization scheme, allowing us to encode the memory as an initial phase accumulated due to the adiabatic evolution over the potential energy surface. This is a unified framework to handle different types of level crossings by incorporating Berry curvature-based force corrections to Ehrenfest dynamics, ensuring accurate representation of topological effects. For conical intersections, our method incorporates the theoretically expected phase pi, while for elliptic intersections, it yields a parametrically tunable but loop radius (energy) independent phase different from pi. We also include an eccentricity parameter (e) in the diabatic coupling to model more realistic molecular systems. Numerical simulations demonstrate the consistency of our approach with theoretical predictions for mixing of states and inhibition from mixing due to geometric phase effects. This framework provides a valuable tool for studying quantum-classical interactions in molecular systems where geometric phase effects play a significant role. The elliptical intersection and geometric phase effect opens avenue for the design and discovery of degenerate materials. It produces a fresh look to help develop a new kind of spectroscopy and potential qubit applications. This simple Hamiltonian reveals a pathological phase protection effect E = kr, where k is real, that has great utility in a new spectroscopy design.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Flux-induced Higher-order Topological Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Higher-order topological superconductivity typically depends on spin-orbit interaction, and often necessitates well designed sample structures, nodal superconducting pairings or complex magnetic order. In this work, we propose a model that incorporates a Zeeman field, antiferromagnetic order, and $s$-wave superconducting pairing, all without the need for spin-orbit interaction. In a two-dimensional system, we realize a second-order topological superconductor by utilizing a staggered flux, provided that the Zeeman field is oriented perpendicular to the magnetic order moments. In three-dimensional systems, we achieve second- and third-order topological superconductors in theory, through stacking the two-dimensional second-order topological superconductor.</description>

      <title>Electric field-induced spin-valley locking in twisted bilayer buckled honeycomb materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A twisted honeycomb bilayer exhibits a moir\'e superstructure that is composed of a hexagonal arrangement of AB and BA stacked domains separated by domain boundaries. In the case of twisted bilayer graphene, the application of an electric field normal to the bilayer leads to the opening of inverted band gaps in the AB and BA stacked domains. The inverted band gaps result in the formation of a two-dimensional triangular network of counterpropagating valley protected helical domain boundary states, also referred to as the quantum valley Hall effect. Owing to spin-orbit coupling and buckling, the quantum valley Hall effect in twisted bilayer silicene and germanene is more complex than in twisted bilayer graphene. We found that there is a range of electric fields for which the spin degree of freedom is locked to the valley degree of freedom of the electrons in the quantum valley Hall states, resulting in a stronger topological protection. For electric fields smaller than the aforementioned range the twisted bilayer does not exhibit the quantum valley Hall effect, whereas for larger electric fields the spin-valley locking is lifted and the emergent quantum valley Hall states are only valley-protected.</description>

      <title>Linearly polarized light enables chiral edge transport in quasi-2D Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Floquet engineering with high-frequency light offers dynamic control over topological phases in quantum materials. While in 3D Dirac systems circularly polarized light is known to induce topological phase transitions via gap opening, linearly polarized light (LPL) has generally been considered ineffective. Here we show that in quasi-2D Dirac materials the second-order momentum term arising from the intersurface coupling can induce a topological phase transition under LPL, leading to chiral edge channels. Considering an ultrathin Bi$_2$Se$_3$ film as a representative system, we show that this transition occurs at experimentally accessible light intensities. Our results thus promote quasi-2D materials as viable platforms for light-controlled topological phases, expanding the potential of Floquet topological engineering.</description>

      <title>Cryogenic temperature dependence and hysteresis of surface-trap-induced gate leakage in GaN high-electron-mobility transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work provides a detailed mapping of various mechanisms of surface-trap-induced gate leakage in GaN HEMTs across a temperature range from room to cryogenic levels. Two-dimensional variable-range hopping is observed at small gate bias. Under higher reverse gate bias, the leakage is dominated by the Poole--Frenkel emission above 220 K, but gradually transitions to the trap-assisted tunneling below 220 K owing to the frozen-trap effect. The trap barrier height extracted from the gate leakage current under the upward gate sweep is 0.65 V, which is 12\% higher than that from the downward sweep. The gate leakage current as a function of the gate bias exhibits clockwise hysteresis loops above 220 K but counterclockwise ones below 220 K. This remarkable opposite hysteresis phenomenon is thoroughly explained by the trap mechanisms.</description>

      <title>The fate of disorder in twisted bilayer graphene near the magic angle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14567v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In disordered lattices, itinerant electrons typically undergo Anderson localization due to random phase interference, which suppresses their motion. By contrast, in flat-band systems where electrons are intrinsically localized owing to their vanishing group velocity, the role of disorder remains elusive. Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) at the magic angle $\sim 1.1^\circ$ provides a representative flat-band platform to investigate this problem. Here, we perform an atomistic tight-binding quantum transport calculation on the interplay between disorder and flat-bands in TBG devices. This non-phenomenological approach provides direct evidence that moderate disorder enhances conductance, whereas stronger disorder restores localization, revealing a disorder-driven delocalization-to-localization transport behavior. The underlying physical mechanism is understood by an effective inter-moir{\'e} tunneling strength via spectral flow analysis of a disordered TBG cylinder. Moreover, by comparing magic-angle and large-angle TBG, we demonstrate qualitatively distinct disorder responses tied to the presence of flat-bands. Our quantitative results highlight the unconventional role of disorder in flat-band moir{\'e} materials and offer insights into the observation of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall effect in disordered moir{\'e} systems.</description>

      <title>Precision of an autonomous demon exploiting nonthermal resources and information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14578v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-dot systems serve as nanoscale heat engines exploiting thermal fluctuations to perform a useful task. Here, we investigate a multi-terminal triple-dot system, operating as a refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold electronic contact. In contrast to standard heat engines, this system exploits a nonthermal resource. This has the intriguing consequence that cooling can occur without extracting energy from the resource on average -- a seemingly demonic action -- while, however, requiring the resource to fluctuate. Using full counting statistics and stochastic trajectories, we analyze the performance of the device in terms of the cooling-power precision, employing performance quantifiers motivated by the thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations. We focus on two regimes with large output power, which are based on two operational principles: exploiting information on one hand and the nonthermal properties of the resource on the other. We show that these regimes significantly differ in precision. In particular, the regime exploiting the nonthermal properties of the resource can have cooling-power fluctuations that are suppressed with respect to the input fluctuations by an order of magnitude. We also substantiate the interpretation of the two different working principles by analyzing cross-correlations between input and output heat currents and information flow.</description>

      <title>Magnetic D-brane solitons: skyrmion strings ending on a N\'eel wall in chiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions extended to three dimensions form string-like objects whose fundamental role remains largely unexplored. We show that skyrmion strings can terminate on a N\'eel-type domain wall (DW), realizing a magnetic analogue of a Dirichlet(D)-brane soliton. While an isolated N\'eel DW tends to rotate into a Bloch DW, the N\'eel DW is stabilized when a skyrmion string ends on it. Unlike field-theory D-branes, the Bloch-type DMI produces linear rather than logarithmic DW bending, and the strings retain finite width far from the DW, circumventing singular behavior. Furthermore, the repulsive interaction between strings allows periodic multi-junction solutions, yielding a square lattice of alternating strings and local DW deformations. These results establish magnetic skyrmion strings as fundamental strings that can end on a D-brane.</description>

      <title>Quantum beats of exciton-polarons in CsPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14695v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Exciton-phonon interactions govern the energy level spectrum and thus the optical response in semiconductors. In this respect, lead-halide perovskite nanocrystals represent a unique system, for which the interaction with optical phonons is particularly strong, giving rise to a ladder of multiple exciton states which can be optically excited with femtosecond pulses. We establish a new regime of coherent exciton-polaron dynamics with exceptionally long coherence times (T2 ~300 ps) in an ensemble of CsPbI3 nanocrystals embedded in a glass matrix. Using transient two-pulse photon echo at 2 K temperature, we observe quantum beats between the exciton-polaron states. Within a four-level model, we directly quantify the exciton-phonon coupling strength through the Huang-Rhys factors of 0.05-0.1 and 0.02-0.04 for low-energy optical phonons with energies of 3.2 and 5.1 meV, respectively. The pronounced size dependence of both coupling strengths and phonon lifetimes offers a path to tune the optical transitions between polaron states and to tailor the coherent optical dynamics in perovskite semiconductors for solid-state quantum technologies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14721v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quantum and quantum-relativistic effects associated with the noise power spectrum and the fluctuation--dissipation relation between current--noise spectra and linear--response conductance at low frequencies of the electromagnetic field. At high frequencies, vacuum catastrophe is shown to be avoided by the presence of Casimir force. At low frequencies, the quantum effect associated with one--dimensional structures under the conditions of ballistic transport typical at the nanometric scale length are briefly reviewed in terms of a universal quasi-particle approach. The case of a photon gas inside an appropriate black-body cavity is found to provide a physical interpretation of the lines spectra of atomic elements within an exact statistical approach based on a physical interpretation of the fine structure constant, $\alpha =1/137.0560$.</description>

      <title>Disorder-assisted Spin-Filtering at Metal/Ferromagnet Interfaces: An Alternative Route to Anisotropic Magnetoresistance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal interface-scattering mechanism that produces a sizable anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) in metal/ferromagnet bilayers (e.g., Pt/YIG) without invoking bulk spin or orbital Hall currents. In a $\delta$-layer model with interfacial exchange and Rashba spin-orbit coupling, charge transfer at a high-quality interface creates a spin-selective phase condition (interfacial spin filtering) that suppresses backscattering for one spin projection while enhancing momentum relaxation for the other. The resulting resistance anisotropy peaks at an optimal metal thickness of a few nanometers, quantitatively reproducing the thickness and angular dependences typically attributed to spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR), as well as its characteristic magnitude. Remarkably, the maximal AMR scales linearly with the smaller of the two coupling strengths - exchange or spin-orbit, highlighting a mechanism fundamentally distinct from SMR. Our scattering formulation maps onto Boltzmann boundary conditions and predicts other clear discriminants from SMR, including strong sensitivity to interfacial charge transfer and disorder.</description>

      <title>Electron transport in junctions between altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate electron transport in junctions between the two AMs in strong and weak altermagnetic phases. The charge and spin conductivities are analyzed as functions of angle between the N\'eel vectors of the two AMs $\theta$. In the strong AM regime, the charge conductivity vanishes as $\theta \to \pi$, while in the weak AM phase it remains finite. Introducing a normal metal between two AMs leads to Fabry-P\'erot-type oscillations in charge conductivity. In the strong phase, transport is dominated by up-spin electrons, whereas both spin channels contribute in the weak phase. These results highlight the potential of AM-based heterostructures for spintronic applications, such as spin filters, and quantum interference-based spintronic devices, where tunable spin-dependent transport and interference effects can be utilized in electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Electric field controlled second-order anomalous Hall effect in altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Altermagnets are a recently discovered class of compensated magnets with momentum-dependent spin splittings and unusual transport properties, even without a net magnetization. In the presence of combined four-fold rotation and time-reversal ($C_4\mathcal{T}$) symmetry, linear and also second-order, driven by a Berry curvature dipole, anomalous Hall responses are forbidden in any pure $d$-wave altermagnet. Nevertheless, here we find that the nontrivial quantum metric of the occupied Bloch states allows for an electric field induced Berry curvature dipole, which generates a strong and tunable second-order Hall current, enabling it to be switched on or off by simply adjusting the relative orientation between the symmetry-reducing dc field and the ac probe field. Specifically, we investigate the electric field induced second-order anomalous Hall response in a two-dimensional Rashba-coupled hybrid altermagnet that interpolates between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ ($B_{1g}$) and $d_{xy}$ ($B_{2g}$) altermagnet symmetry, motivated by recent proposals for mixed-symmetry states. Crucially, the nonlinear signal is highly sensitive to the underlying symmetry of the altermagnetic order at specific doping levels, offering a purely electrical method to distinguish distinct altermagnetic orders. Our results position hybrid altermagnets as a promising platform for controllable nonlinear transport and spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion behavior in attractive-repulsive square array of pinning centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the driven dynamics of a single skyrmion in a square lattice of mixed pinning sites, where attractive and repulsive defects coexist using a particle-based model. The mixed landscape yields directional locking at $\theta_{\rm sk}=-45^\circ$ and flow at locked angles near the intrinsic skyrmion Hall angle. By mapping defect strengths, we show that weaker attraction lowers the depinning threshold, whereas stronger repulsion stabilizes and broadens the $-45^\circ$ locking plateau. Moreover, combinations of attractive and repulsive defect strengths allows control of directional lockings and their force ranges. Defect size further tunes the response, selecting among $-45^\circ$, $-50^\circ$, $-55^\circ$, and $\approx-59^\circ$. These results establish mixed pinning as a practical knob to steer skyrmion trajectories and the effective Hall response, providing design guidelines for skyrmion-based memory and logic devices.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear near-field spectroscopy of exciton-polaritons in a van der Waals layered waveguide</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Layered van der Waals materials offer novel opportunities for on-chip waveguiding and development of integrated photonic circuits. In the strong light-matter coupling regime, their nonlinear response can be significantly enhanced, which is crucial for developing active photonic devices. However, probing the nonlinearity of waveguide modes in subwavelength-thick structures is challenging as they are not directly accessible from far-field. Here we apply a novel nonlinear near-field spectroscopic technique based on a GaP solid immersion lens and femtosecond laser excitation to study nonlinearity of guided modes in monolayer WS$_2$ encapsulated in hBN under the strong light-matter coupling regime. We reveal formation of exciton-polaritons with $\sim 50$ meV Rabi splitting and demonstrate a pump-induced transition from strong to weak coupling. Our results show that exciton resonance saturation and broadening lead to an efficient nonlinear response of guided polaritons, which can be employed for developing compact van der Waals photonic switches and modulators.</description>

      <title>A large spin-splitting altermagnet designed from the hydroxylated MBene monolayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of altermagnets is fundamentally important for advancing spintronic device technology, but remains unpractical for the weak spin splitting in most cases, especially in two-dimensional materials. Based on spin group symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, a novel hydroxyl rotation strategy in collinear antiferromagnets has been proposed to design altermagnets. This approach achieves a large chirality-reversible spin splitting exceeding $1130$ meV in $\alpha_{60}$-Mn$_2$B$_2$(OH)$_2$ monolayer. The system also exhibits intrinsic features of a node-line semimetal in the absence of spin-orbit coupling. Besides, the angles of hydroxyl groups serve as the primary order parameter, which can switch on/off the altermagnetism coupled with the ferroelastic mechanism. The corresponding magnetocrystalline anisotropy have also been modulated. Moreover, an interesting spin-related transport property with the spin-polarized conductivity of 10$^{19}$ $\Omega^{-1}m^{-1}s^{-1}$ also emerges. These findings uncover the hydroxyl rotation strategy as a versatile tool for designing altermagnetic node-line semimetals and opening new avenues for achieving exotic chemical and physical characteristics associated with large spin splitting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14193v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets have garnered great interest due to their non-relativistic spin splitting and novel physical properties. However, the control of altermagnetic states remains underexplored. Here, we propose a new multiferroic state, i.e. ferroelastic altermagnetic state, in which ferroelastic strain couples directly to the spin-splitting. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we identify the ferroelastic $d$-wave altermagnetism of puckered pentagonal CoSe$_2$ monolayer. Interestingly, uniaxial stress can induce a ferroelastic phase transition, accompanied by a $90^\circ$ rotation of the spin-splitting bands. Cooperative rotation of the lattice and N\'eel vectors preserves the sign of Kerr angle, whereas noncooperative rotation reverses it. Our work provides a general strategy for manipulating altermagnetism in multiferroic systems and opens new avenues for exploring emergent magnetoelastic phenomena.</description>

      <title>Identification of formation of amorphous Si phase in SiOxNy films produced by plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peculiarities of formation of inclusions of amorphous Si (a-Si) phase in Si-rich Si oxynitride films grown by plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) are studied by combined Raman scattering and infrared (IR) absorption spectroscopy. The Raman scattering results identify presence of a-Si phase in the studied films at the relative Si content exceeding a threshold value of about 0.4. The a-Si amount correlates with the concentration of hydrogen in the films, the presence of which is detected by characteristic IR absorption bands corresponding to Si-H bending (about 660 cm-1) and stretching (a composite band in the range of about 1900-2400 cm-1) vibrations. The method of deconvolution of IR absorbance spectra in the range of about 600 to 1300 cm-1 developed earlier is used to reliably separate the IR band at about 660 cm-1. This band is identified to origin from the amorphous Si phase within the studied Si oxynitride films. This makes it possible to propose IR spectroscopy with analysis of the low-wavenumber part of the spectra as an efficient method of identifying phase composition of Si-rich Si oxynitride films. The obtained results contribute to understanding of the regularities of formation of phase compositions of PECVD grown Si oxynitride films and are useful for controlling the films properties for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Crossed surface flat bands in three-dimensional superconducting altermagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14724v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting altermagnets have proven to be a promising ground for emergent phenomena but their study has involved two dimensional systems. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface flat bands due to the underlying symmetries. We find that these crossed flat bands appear at zero energy in the surface along $z$ due to the superconducting nodal lines in the $xy$-plane, while the number of corners is determined by the crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance of zero-energy arcs in the surface along $x$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the crossed surface flat bands, surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give rise to distinct signals in charge conductance, hence offering a solid way for their detection and paving the way for realizing higher dimensional topological phases using altermagnets.</description>

      <title>A universal description of Mott insulators: Characterizing quantum phases beyond broken symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14951v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using Mott insulators as a prototypical example, we demonstrate a dynamics-based characterization of quantum phases of matter through a general N-body renormalization group framework. The essential "Mott-ness" turns out to be characterized by a change of size-scaling of the effective intra- momentum repulsions between long-lived emergent "eigen-particles" that encodes the dynamics of two-body bound states in the high-energy sector. This directly offers a universal characterization at long space-time scale for the corresponding class of Mott insulators through a uniform single occupation of all momenta, and otherwise Mott metals. This universal description naturally paves the way to topological Mott insulators and is straightforward to extend to bosonic Mott systems. More generally, this demonstration exemplifies a generic paradigm of characterizing quantum phases of matter through their distinct dynamics beyond broken symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A ring of capacitively coupled transmons threaded by a synthetic magnetic field is studied as a realization of a strongly interacting bosonic system. The synthetic flux is imparted through a specific Floquet modulation scheme based on a suitable periodic sequence of Lorentzian pulses that are known as 'Levitons'. Such scheme has the advantage to preserve the translation invariance of the system and to work at the qubit sweet spots. We employ this system to demonstrate the concept of fractional values of flux quanta. Although such fractionalization phenomenon was originally predicted for bright solitons in cold atoms, it may be in fact challenging to access with that platform. Here, we show how fractional flux quanta can be read out in the absorption spectrum of a suitable 'scattering experiment' in which the qubit ring is driven by microwaves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11927v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Excitonic states of tightly-bound electron-hole pairs dominate the optical response in a growing class of two-dimensional (2D) materials and their van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) a useful guidance for the excitonic spectrum is the analogy with the states in the 2D hydrogen atom. From our symmetry analysis and solving the Bethe-Salpeter equations we find a much richer picture for excitons and predict their tunable resonant s-p mixing. The resonance is attained when the subband splitting matches the energy difference between the 1s and 2p+ (or 2p-) excitons, resulting in the anticrossing of the spectral lines in the absorption as a function of the subband splitting. By focusing on TMDs modified by magnetic proximity, and gated 3R-stacked bilayer TMD, we corroborate the feasibility of such tunable spin splitting. The resulting tunable and bright s-p excitons provide unexplored opportunities for their manipulation and enable optical detection of Rashba or interlayer coupling in vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08582v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Thouless pump, a cornerstone of topological physics, enables unidirectional quantized wave/particle transport via geometric Berry phase engineering in periodically driven systems. While decades of research have been dedicated to monopole-mediated pumping, mechanisms governed by higher-order singularities like Berry dipoles remain unexplored. Here, we report the experimental demonstration of a Berry-dipole-mediated returning Thouless pump (RTP) in a 1D acoustic waveguide array achieved through adiabatic encircling of a Berry dipole singularity. During this adiabatic cycle, an initial edge-localized mode first delocalizes into the bulk and eventually returns to the original edge, marking the characteristic signature of the RTP. Notably, this RTP exhibits an interesting feature of pseudospin flipping. The demonstrated RTP contrasts sharply with the well-studied monopole-governed pumps that feature unidirectional transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study topological properties of static and dynamic
  Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models with staggered further neighbor hopping terms
  of different extents are investigated. Topological characterization
  of the static chiral models is established in terms of
  conventional winding number while Floquet topological character is
  studied by a pair of winding numbers.
  With the increase of extent of further neighbor terms topological phases
  with higher winding numbers are found to emerge in both static and dynamic
  systems. Topological phase diagrams of static models for four different
  extents of further neighbor terms are presented, which has been generalized
  for arbitrary extent afterwards. Similarly, Floquet topological
  phase diagrams of four such dynamic models have been presented.
  For every model four different parametrizations of hopping terms
  are introduced which
  exhibits different patterns of topological phase diagrams.
  In each case emergence of `0' and `$\pi$' energy edge states
  is noted and they are found to consistent to the
  bulk-boundary correspondence rule applicable for chiral topological systems.</description>

Abstract: It is established that the Morin transition, a spin reorientation in hematite, is shifted to lower temperatures with decreasing nanoparticle volume. However, our findings indicate an opposite effect in a series of hematite nanospindles: The particles, synthesized by hydrothermal decomposition of iron(III) chloride solution, with aspect ratios $p$ between $1.0$ and $5.2$ (long axis ca. $70$--$290$ nm) display decreasing Morin transition temperatures $T_{\text{Morin}}$ upon increasing $p$, despite the volume increase. Their inner morphology, determined via (HR)STEM and XRD, shows that they are formed by the epitactical fusion of primary particles, perfectly aligned in terms of crystallographic orientation. Combining magnetometry and M\"ossbauer spectroscopy, we uncover the correlation between particle shape, magnetic properties, and in particular the Morin transition: While more spherical particles undergo said transition at about $200$ K, $T_{\text{Morin}}$ decreases upon higher nanospindle elongation, while also being broadened and showing a wider thermal hysteresis. Our measurements reveal complete suppression of the Morin transition beyond a critical threshold $p \gtrapprox 1.5$, indicating stabilization of the weak ferromagnetic (WFM) state with net particle magnetic moment within the hematite basal plane, despite such behavior being unexpected based on shape anisotropy considerations. For the correlated, magnetic field-dependent spin-flop transition, a comparable trend in particle aspect ratio is detected. We have demonstrated the presence of intermediate spin alignment states that deviate both from the low-temperature antiferromagnetic (AFM) and high-temperature WFM spin structure for slightly elongated particles, likely being connected to the suppression of the Morin transition observed for $p \gtrapprox 1.5$.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit interaction in tubular prismatic nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07677v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We theoretically study the spin-orbit interaction in the outer regions of core-shell nanowires that can act as tubular, prismatic conductors. The polygonal cross section of these wires induces non-uniform electron localization along the wire perimeter. In particular, low-energy electrons accumulate in the corner regions, and in the case of narrow shells, conductive channels form along the sharp edges. In contrast, higher-energy electrons are shifted toward the facets. These two groups of states may be separated by large energy gaps, which can exceed the room-temperature energy in the case of triangular geometries. We compare the impact of spin-orbit interaction on the corner and side states of hexagonal and triangular shells grown on hexagonal cores as well as on triangular shells grown on triangular cores. We find that the spin-orbit splitting, and thus the degeneracy of energy states at finite wave vectors, strongly depend on the tube's geometry. We demonstrate that the weak spin-orbit coupling observed in clean wires can be significantly enhanced if the intermixing of core and shell materials takes place. Moreover, we show that the energy spectrum in the presence of spin-orbit interaction allows for estimating the interaction between states and shows that triangular shells can act as three independent wires in the low-energy regime, while they behave as interacting systems at higher-energy ranges.</description>

      <title>Phonon- and magnon-mediated decoherence of a magnonic qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the decoherence of magnonic qubits in small ferromagnetic insulators and compute the relaxation and dephasing rates due to magnon-phonon and magnon-magnon interactions. We combine a Bloch--Redfield description with Keldysh non-equilibrium field theory to find explicit expressions for the rates. For a quadratic dispersion and assuming a uniform mode defines the qubit, we find that decay into two phonons is the only allowed relaxation process at zero temperature. The low resonance frequency and heavy unit cell strongly suppress this process in yttrium-iron-garnet. We also find that the dephasing rate scales with the inverse of size and damping of the magnet, and could become large for small and clean magnets. Our calculation thus provides additional insight into the viability of magnon-based quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Spin Currents in Rashba Altermagnets: From Equilibrium to Nonlinear Regimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate equilibrium (background), linear, and nonlinear spin currents in two-dimensional Rashba spin-orbit coupled altermagnet systems, using a modified spin current operator that includes anomalous velocity from non-zero Berry curvature. The background spin current, stemming from spin-orbit coupling and modulated by the altermagnet term ($t_j$), exhibits in-plane polarization, increases linearly with Fermi energy ($\epsilon_F$), and is enhanced by both the altermagnet ($t_j$) and the Rashba parameter ($\lambda$). Linear spin current is always transverse with out-of-plane polarization and can be viewed as Spin Hall current, primarily driven by band velocity, with $t_j$ enabling a band-induced contribution (previously absent in simple Rashba systems ($t_j=0$)). This highlights altermagnet system as a promising source of spin Hall current generation. For linear spin Hall current, its band contribution's magnitude increases linearly with $\epsilon_F$, while the magnitude of anomalous component saturates at higher $\epsilon_F$. Further, the magnitude of spin Hall current is enhanced by $t_j$ but reduced by $\lambda$. Nonlinear spin currents feature both longitudinal and transverse components with in-plane polarization. Both the nonlinear longitudinal spin current from band velocity and the nonlinear transverse spin current from anomalous velocity initially decrease with $\epsilon_F$ before saturating at higher $\epsilon_F$. Importantly, $t_j$ reduces these currents while $\lambda$ enhances them. Meanwhile, the nonlinear transverse current from band velocity increases and then saturates with $\epsilon_F$, enhanced by $\lambda$ and showing non-monotonic variation with $t_j$. These findings highlight the tunability of spin current behavior through Rashba and altermagnet parameters, offering insights for spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>A One-Particle Density Matrix Framework for Mode-Shell Correspondence: Characterizing Topology in Amorphous Higher-Order Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a framework for characterizing higher-order topological phases directly from the one-particle density matrix, without any reference to an underlying Hamiltonian. Our approach extends the mode-shell correspondence, originally formulated for single-particle Hamiltonians, to Gaussian states subject to chiral constraints. In this correspondence, the mode index counts topological boundary modes, while the shell index quantifies the bulk topology in a region surrounding the modes, providing a bulk-boundary diagnostic. In one-dimensional topological insulators, the shell index reduces to the local chiral marker, recovering the winding number in the translation-invariant limit. We apply the mode-shell correspondence to a $C_4$-symmetric higher-order topological insulator with a chiral constraint and show that a fractional shell index implies that the higher-order phase is intrinsic. The one-particle density matrix is formulated in real space, so the mode-shell correspondence also applies to models without translation invariance. By introducing structural disorder into the $C_4$-symmetric higher-order insulator, we show that the mode-shell correspondence remains a meaningful diagnostic in amorphous structures. The mode-shell correspondence generalizes to interacting states with a gapped bulk spectrum in the one-particle density matrix, providing a practical and diverse route to characterize higher-order topology from the quantum state itself.</description>

      <title>Coupling Magnons to an Opto-Electronic Parametric Oscillator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as versatile modular components for quantum signal transduction and sensing applications owing to their capability of connecting distinct quantum platforms. To date, the majority of the magnonic systems have been explored in a local, near-field scheme, due to the close proximity required for realizing a strong coupling between magnons and other excitations. This constraint greatly limits the applicability of magnons in developing remotely-coupled, distributed quantum network systems. On the contrary, opto-electronic architectures hosting self-sustained oscillations has been a unique platform for longhaul signal transmission and processing. Here, we integrated an opto-electronic oscillator with a magnonic oscillator consisting of a microwave waveguide and a Y3Fe5O12(YIG) sphere, and demonstrated strong and coherent coupling between YIG's magnon modes and the opto-electronic oscillator's characteristic photon modes - revealing the hallmark anti-crossing gap in the measured spectrum. In particular, the photon mode is produced on-demand via a nonlinear, parametric process as stipulated by an external seed pump. Both the internal cavity phase and the external pump phase can be precisely tuned to stabilize either degenerate or nondegenerate auto-oscillations. Our result lays out a new, hybrid platform for investigating long-distance coupling and nonlinearity in coherent magnonic phenomena, which may be find useful in constructing future distributed hybrid magnonic systems.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Charge Noise Sources in Quantum Dot Spin Qubits via Impedance Spectroscopy, DLTS, and C-V Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10861v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The coherence and fidelity of quantum dot (QD) spin qubits are fundamentally limited by charge noise arising from electrically active trap states at oxide interfaces, heterostructure boundaries, and within the bulk semiconductor. These traps introduce electrostatic fluctuations that couple to the qubit via spin-orbit interactions or charge-sensitive confinement potentials, leading to dephasing and gate errors. In this work, we present a general trap characterization framework for identifying and quantifying the spectral signatures of these trap states using AC impedance spectroscopy, deep-level transient spectroscopy (DLTS), and conventional capacitance-voltage (C-V) analysis. While our case study focuses on strained Ge/SiGe quantum well heterostructures, the approach is broadly applicable to other material systems and qubit types. We demonstrate that each class of traps (oxide interface, quantum well interface, and bulk) exhibits distinct fingerprints across frequency- and time-domain measurements. Oxide traps dominate the low-frequency conductance peaks and appear strongly in Nyquist and transient spectra. QW interface traps, despite being nearly invisible at low densities in conventional C-V and AC impedance analysis, are clearly resolved through multi-exponential decay signatures in time-domain response. Bulk traps contribute to high-frequency admittance and steady-state leakage currents. By correlating each trap type to its characteristic time constant, spatial location, and spectral impact, we provide a diagnostic toolset for disentangling noise sources that degrade qubit performance. This unified methodology bridges traditional defect metrology with emerging qubit noise analysis and enables material- and process-level strategies for coherence optimization in scalable quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Josephson diode effect via a non-equilibrium Rashba system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05671v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A non-equilibrium state in a Rashba system under an in-plane magnetic field is identified as the origin of the Josephson diode effect. This state is induced by a current bias--necessary for measuring the current-voltage characteristics--which shifts the Fermi momentum away from equilibrium. This essential mechanism has been overlooked in previous studies. This oversight stems from the implicit assumption that the equilibrium-based formulations are sufficient to describe Josephson effect. We formulate the Josephson coupling via the non-equilibrium Rashba system under current bias using a tunneling Hamiltonian, where the Rashba system is modeled as one-dimensional. When the magnetic field is applied perpendicular to the current, the Josephson coupling becomes asymmetric, giving rise to the diode effect. The magnitude and sign of this effect depend on the distance between the superconducting electrodes $d$, the in-plane magnetic field, and the spin-orbit coupling strength. Our results clarify the microscopic origin of the Josephson diode effect, which can be optimized by tuning $d$.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in hydrogen lithography on silicon surfaces now enable the fabrication of complex and error-free atom-scale circuitry. The structure of atomic wires, the most basic and common circuit elements, plays a crucial role at this scale, as the exact position of each atom matters. As such, the characterization of atomic wire geometries is critical for identifying the most effective configurations. In this study, we employed low-temperature (4.5 K) scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to systematically fabricate and characterize six planar wire configurations made up of silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on the H-Si(100) surface. Crucially, the characterization was performed at the same location and under identical tip conditions, thereby eliminating artifacts due to the local environment to reveal true electronic differences among the line configurations. By performing dI/dV line spectroscopy on each wire, we reveal their local density of states (LDOS) and demonstrate how small variations in wire geometry affect orbital hybridization and induce the emergence of new electronic states. Complementarily, we deploy density functional theory (DFT) and non-equilibrium Green's functions to compute the LDOS and evaluate transmission coefficients for the most promising wire geometries. Our results indicate that dimer and wider wires exhibit multiple discrete mid-gap electronic states which could be exploited for signal transport or as custom quantum dots. Furthermore, wider wires benefit from additional current pathways and exhibit increased transmission, while also demonstrating enhanced immunity to hydrogen defects.</description>

      <title>Efficient $GW$ band structure calculations using Gaussian basis functions and application to atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.18411v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a $GW$ space-time algorithm for periodic systems in a Gaussian basis including spin-orbit coupling. We employ lattice summation to compute the irreducible density response and the self-energy, while we employ $k$-point sampling for computing the screened Coulomb interaction. Our algorithm enables accurate and computationally efficient quasiparticle band structure calculations for atomically thin transition-metal dichalcogenides. For monolayer MoS$_\text{2}$, MoSe$_\text{2}$, WS$_\text{2}$, and WSe$_\text{2}$, computed $GW$ band gaps agree on average within 50 meV with plane-wave-based reference calculations. $G_0W_0$ band structures are obtained in less than two days on a laptop (Intel i5, 192 GB RAM) or in less than 30 minutes using 1024 cores. Overall, our work provides an efficient and scalable framework for $GW$ calculations on atomically thin materials.</description>
