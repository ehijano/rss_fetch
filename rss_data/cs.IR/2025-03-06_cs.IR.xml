      <title>Optimizing open-domain question answering with graph-based retrieval augmented generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02922v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we benchmark various graph-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems across a broad spectrum of query types, including OLTP-style (fact-based) and OLAP-style (thematic) queries, to address the complex demands of open-domain question answering (QA). Traditional RAG methods often fall short in handling nuanced, multi-document synthesis tasks. By structuring knowledge as graphs, we can facilitate the retrieval of context that captures greater semantic depth and enhances language model operations. We explore graph-based RAG methodologies and introduce TREX, a novel, cost-effective alternative that combines graph-based and vector-based retrieval techniques. Our benchmarking across four diverse datasets highlights the strengths of different RAG methodologies, demonstrates TREX's ability to handle multiple open-domain QA types, and reveals the limitations of current evaluation methods.
  In a real-world technical support case study, we demonstrate how TREX solutions can surpass conventional vector-based RAG in efficiently synthesizing data from heterogeneous sources. Our findings underscore the potential of augmenting large language models with advanced retrieval and orchestration capabilities, advancing scalable, graph-based AI solutions.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic and Extrinsic Factor Disentanglement for Recommendation in Various Context Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03524v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recommender systems, the patterns of user behaviors (e.g., purchase, click) may vary greatly in different contexts (e.g., time and location). This is because user behavior is jointly determined by two types of factors: intrinsic factors, which reflect consistent user preference, and extrinsic factors, which reflect external incentives that may vary in different contexts. Differentiating between intrinsic and extrinsic factors helps learn user behaviors better. However, existing studies have only considered differentiating them from a single, pre-defined context (e.g., time or location), ignoring the fact that a user's extrinsic factors may be influenced by the interplay of various contexts at the same time. In this paper, we propose the Intrinsic-Extrinsic Disentangled Recommendation (IEDR) model, a generic framework that differentiates intrinsic from extrinsic factors considering various contexts simultaneously, enabling more accurate differentiation of factors and hence the improvement of recommendation accuracy. IEDR contains a context-invariant contrastive learning component to capture intrinsic factors, and a disentanglement component to extract extrinsic factors under the interplay of various contexts. The two components work together to achieve effective factor learning. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate IEDR's effectiveness in learning disentangled factors and significantly improving recommendation accuracy by up to 4% in NDCG.</description>

      <title>Decoupled Recommender Systems: Exploring Alternative Recommender Ecosystem Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender ecosystems are an emerging subject of research. Such research examines how the characteristics of algorithms, recommendation consumers, and item providers influence system dynamics and long-term outcomes. One architectural possibility that has not yet been widely explored in this line of research is the consequences of a configuration in which recommendation algorithms are decoupled from the platforms they serve. This is sometimes called "the friendly neighborhood algorithm store" or "middleware" model. We are particularly interested in how such architectures might offer a range of different distributions of utility across consumers, providers, and recommendation platforms. In this paper, we create a model of a recommendation ecosystem that incorporates algorithm choice and examine the outcomes of such a design.</description>

      <title>Addressing Overprescribing Challenges: Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Medication Recommendation Tasks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medication recommendation systems have garnered attention within healthcare for their potential to deliver personalized and efficacious drug combinations based on patient's clinical data. However, existing methodologies encounter challenges in adapting to diverse Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems and effectively utilizing unstructured data, resulting in limited generalization capabilities and suboptimal performance. Recently, interest is growing in harnessing Large Language Models (LLMs) in the medical domain to support healthcare professionals and enhance patient care. Despite the emergence of medical LLMs and their promising results in tasks like medical question answering, their practical applicability in clinical settings, particularly in medication recommendation, often remains underexplored.
  In this study, we evaluate both general-purpose and medical-specific LLMs for medication recommendation tasks. Our findings reveal that LLMs frequently encounter the challenge of overprescribing, leading to heightened clinical risks and diminished medication recommendation accuracy. To address this issue, we propose Language-Assisted Medication Recommendation (LAMO), which employs a parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach to tailor open-source LLMs for optimal performance in medication recommendation scenarios. LAMO leverages the wealth of clinical information within clinical notes, a resource often underutilized in traditional methodologies. As a result of our approach, LAMO outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods by over 10% in internal validation accuracy. Furthermore, temporal and external validations demonstrate LAMO's robust generalization capabilities across various temporal and hospital contexts. Additionally, an out-of-distribution medication recommendation experiment demonstrates LAMO's remarkable accuracy even with medications outside the training data.</description>

      <title>ExpertGenQA: Open-ended QA generation in Specialized Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generating high-quality question-answer pairs for specialized technical domains remains challenging, with existing approaches facing a tradeoff between leveraging expert examples and achieving topical diversity. We present ExpertGenQA, a protocol that combines few-shot learning with structured topic and style categorization to generate comprehensive domain-specific QA pairs. Using U.S. Federal Railroad Administration documents as a test bed, we demonstrate that ExpertGenQA achieves twice the efficiency of baseline few-shot approaches while maintaining $94.4\%$ topic coverage. Through systematic evaluation, we show that current LLM-based judges and reward models exhibit strong bias toward superficial writing styles rather than content quality. Our analysis using Bloom's Taxonomy reveals that ExpertGenQA better preserves the cognitive complexity distribution of expert-written questions compared to template-based approaches. When used to train retrieval models, our generated queries improve top-1 accuracy by $13.02\%$ over baseline performance, demonstrating their effectiveness for downstream applications in technical domains.</description>

      <title>Zero-Shot Multi-Label Classification of Bangla Documents: Large Decoders Vs. Classic Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bangla, a language spoken by over 300 million native speakers and ranked as the sixth most spoken language worldwide, presents unique challenges in natural language processing (NLP) due to its complex morphological characteristics and limited resources. While recent Large Decoder Based models (LLMs), such as GPT, LLaMA, and DeepSeek, have demonstrated excellent performance across many NLP tasks, their effectiveness in Bangla remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we establish the first benchmark comparing decoder-based LLMs with classic encoder-based models for Zero-Shot Multi-Label Classification (Zero-Shot-MLC) task in Bangla. Our evaluation of 32 state-of-the-art models reveals that, existing so-called powerful encoders and decoders still struggle to achieve high accuracy on the Bangla Zero-Shot-MLC task, suggesting a need for more research and resources for Bangla NLP.</description>

      <title>Semi-Supervised In-Context Learning: A Baseline Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Most existing work in data selection for In-Context Learning (ICL) has focused on constructing demonstrations from ground truth annotations, with limited attention given to selecting reliable self-generated annotations. In this work, we propose a three-step semi-supervised ICL framework: annotation generation, demonstration selection, and semi-supervised inference. Our baseline, Naive-SemiICL, which prompts select high-confidence self-generated demonstrations for ICL prompting, outperforms a 16-shot baseline by an average of 9.94% across 16 datasets. We further introduce IterPSD, an annotation approach that refines pseudo-demonstrations iteratively, achieving up to 6.8% additional gains in classification tasks. Lastly, we reveal a scaling law for semi-supervised ICL, where models achieve optimal performance with over 1,000 demonstrations.</description>

      <title>A Predict-Then-Optimize Customer Allocation Framework for Online Fund Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the rapid growth of online investment platforms, funds can be distributed to individual customers online. The central issue is to match funds with potential customers under constraints. Most mainstream platforms adopt the recommendation formulation to tackle the problem. However, the traditional recommendation regime has its inherent drawbacks when applying the fund-matching problem with multiple constraints. In this paper, we model the fund matching under the allocation formulation. We design PTOFA, a Predict-Then-Optimize Fund Allocation framework. This data-driven framework consists of two stages, i.e., prediction and optimization, which aim to predict expected revenue based on customer behavior and optimize the impression allocation to achieve the maximum revenue under the necessary constraints, respectively. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets from an industrial online investment platform validate the effectiveness and efficiency of our solution. Additionally, the online A/B tests demonstrate PTOFA's effectiveness in the real-world fund recommendation scenario.</description>

      <title>Long-Sequence Recommendation Models Need Decoupled Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Lifelong user behavior sequences are crucial for capturing user interests and predicting user responses in modern recommendation systems. A two-stage paradigm is typically adopted to handle these long sequences: a subset of relevant behaviors is first searched from the original long sequences via an attention mechanism in the first stage and then aggregated with the target item to construct a discriminative representation for prediction in the second stage. In this work, we identify and characterize, for the first time, a neglected deficiency in existing long-sequence recommendation models: a single set of embeddings struggles with learning both attention and representation, leading to interference between these two processes. Initial attempts to address this issue with some common methods (e.g., linear projections -- a technique borrowed from language processing) proved ineffective, shedding light on the unique challenges of recommendation models. To overcome this, we propose the Decoupled Attention and Representation Embeddings (DARE) model, where two distinct embedding tables are initialized and learned separately to fully decouple attention and representation. Extensive experiments and analysis demonstrate that DARE provides more accurate searches of correlated behaviors and outperforms baselines with AUC gains up to 0.9% on public datasets and notable improvements on Tencent's advertising platform. Furthermore, decoupling embedding spaces allows us to reduce the attention embedding dimension and accelerate the search procedure by 50% without significant performance impact, enabling more efficient, high-performance online serving. Code in PyTorch for experiments, including model analysis, is available at https://github.com/thuml/DARE.</description>

      <title>Beyond Content Relevance: Evaluating Instruction Following in Retrieval Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23841v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instruction-following capabilities in LLMs have progressed significantly, enabling more complex user interactions through detailed prompts. However, retrieval systems have not matched these advances, most of them still relies on traditional lexical and semantic matching techniques that fail to fully capture user intent. Recent efforts have introduced instruction-aware retrieval models, but these primarily focus on intrinsic content relevance, which neglects the importance of customized preferences for broader document-level attributes. This study evaluates the instruction-following capabilities of various retrieval models beyond content relevance, including LLM-based dense retrieval and reranking models. We develop InfoSearch, a novel retrieval evaluation benchmark spanning six document-level attributes: Audience, Keyword, Format, Language, Length, and Source, and introduce novel metrics -- Strict Instruction Compliance Ratio (SICR) and Weighted Instruction Sensitivity Evaluation (WISE) to accurately assess the models' responsiveness to instructions. Our findings indicate that although fine-tuning models on instruction-aware retrieval datasets and increasing model size enhance performance, most models still fall short of instruction compliance.</description>

Abstract: This demo paper introduces AirSense-R, a privacy-preserving mobile application that delivers real-time, pollution-aware recommendations for urban points of interest (POIs). By merging live air quality data from AirSENCE sensor networks in Bari (Italy) and Cork (Ireland) with user preferences, the system enables health-conscious decision-making. It employs collaborative filtering for personalization, federated learning for privacy, and a prediction engine to detect anomalies and interpolate sparse sensor data. The proposed solution adapts dynamically to urban air quality while safeguarding user privacy.

      <title>MAPS: Motivation-Aware Personalized Search via LLM-Driven Consultation Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01711</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01711v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Personalized product search aims to retrieve and rank items that match users' preferences and search intent. Despite their effectiveness, existing approaches typically assume that users' query fully captures their real motivation. However, our analysis of a real-world e-commerce platform reveals that users often engage in relevant consultations before searching, indicating they refine intents through consultations based on motivation and need. The implied motivation in consultations is a key enhancing factor for personalized search. This unexplored area comes with new challenges including aligning contextual motivations with concise queries, bridging the category-text gap, and filtering noise within sequence history. To address these, we propose a Motivation-Aware Personalized Search (MAPS) method. It embeds queries and consultations into a unified semantic space via LLMs, utilizes a Mixture of Attention Experts (MoAE) to prioritize critical semantics, and introduces dual alignment: (1) contrastive learning aligns consultations, reviews, and product features; (2) bidirectional attention integrates motivation-aware embeddings with user preferences. Extensive experiments on real and synthetic data show MAPS outperforms existing methods in both retrieval and ranking tasks.</description>

      <title>A Simplified Retriever to Improve Accuracy of Phenotype Normalizations by Large Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have shown improved accuracy in phenotype term normalization tasks when augmented with retrievers that suggest candidate normalizations based on term definitions. In this work, we introduce a simplified retriever that enhances LLM accuracy by searching the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) for candidate matches using contextual word embeddings from BioBERT without the need for explicit term definitions. Testing this method on terms derived from the clinical synopses of Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), we demonstrate that the normalization accuracy of a state-of-the-art LLM increases from a baseline of 62.3% without augmentation to 90.3% with retriever augmentation. This approach is potentially generalizable to other biomedical term normalization tasks and offers an efficient alternative to more complex retrieval methods.</description>

      <title>Beyond Matryoshka: Revisiting Sparse Coding for Adaptive Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many large-scale systems rely on high-quality deep representations (embeddings) to facilitate tasks like retrieval, search, and generative modeling. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) recently emerged as a solution for adaptive embedding lengths, but it requires full model retraining and suffers from noticeable performance degradations at short lengths. In this paper, we show that sparse coding offers a compelling alternative for achieving adaptive representation with minimal overhead and higher fidelity. We propose Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR), a method that sparsifies pre-trained embeddings into a high-dimensional but selectively activated feature space. By leveraging lightweight autoencoding and task-aware contrastive objectives, CSR preserves semantic quality while allowing flexible, cost-effective inference at different sparsity levels. Extensive experiments on image, text, and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CSR consistently outperforms MRL in terms of both accuracy and retrieval speed-often by large margins-while also cutting training time to a fraction of that required by MRL. Our results establish sparse coding as a powerful paradigm for adaptive representation learning in real-world applications where efficiency and fidelity are both paramount.

Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have advanced in integrating diverse modalities but frequently suffer from hallucination. A promising solution to mitigate this issue is to generate text with citations, providing a transparent chain for verification. However, existing work primarily focuses on generating citations for text-only content, overlooking the challenges and opportunities of multimodal contexts. To address this gap, we introduce MCiteBench, the first benchmark designed to evaluate and analyze the multimodal citation text generation ability of MLLMs. Our benchmark comprises data derived from academic papers and review-rebuttal interactions, featuring diverse information sources and multimodal content. We comprehensively evaluate models from multiple dimensions, including citation quality, source reliability, and answer accuracy. Through extensive experiments, we observe that MLLMs struggle with multimodal citation text generation. We also conduct deep analyses of models' performance, revealing that the bottleneck lies in attributing the correct sources rather than understanding the multimodal content.</description>

      <title>OkraLong: A Flexible Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Long-Text Query Processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02603</link>

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) encounter challenges in efficiently processing long-text queries, as seen in applications like enterprise document analysis and financial report comprehension. While conventional solutions employ long-context processing or Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), they suffer from prohibitive input expenses or incomplete information. Recent advancements adopt context compression and dynamic retrieval loops, but still sacrifice critical details or incur iterative costs. To address these limitations, we propose OkraLong, a novel framework that flexibly optimizes the entire processing workflow. Unlike prior static or coarse-grained adaptive strategies, OkraLong adopts fine-grained orchestration through three synergistic components: analyzer, organizer and executor. The analyzer characterizes the task states, which guide the organizer in dynamically scheduling the workflow. The executor carries out the execution and generates the final answer. Experimental results demonstrate that OkraLong not only enhances answer accuracy but also achieves cost-effectiveness across a variety of datasets.</description>
