      <title>The role of the nucleus for cell mechanics: an elastic phase field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.12777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.12777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nucleus of eukaryotic cells typically makes up around 30% of the cell volume and has significantly different mechanics, which can make it effectively up to ten times stiffer than the surrounding cytoplasm. Therefore it is an important element for cell mechanics, but a quantitative understanding of its mechanical role during whole cell dynamics is largely missing. Here we demonstrate that elastic phase fields can be used to describe dynamical cell processes in adhesive or confining environments in which the nucleus acts as a stiff inclusion. We first introduce and verify our computational method and then study several applications of large relevance. For cells on adhesive patterns, we find that nuclear stress is shielded by the adhesive pattern. For cell compression between two parallel plates, we obtain force-compression curves that allow us to extract an effective modulus for the cell-nucleus composite. For micropipette aspiration, the effect of the nucleus on the effective modulus is found to be much weaker, highlighting the complicated interplay between extracellular geometry and cell mechanics that is captured by our approach. We also show that our phase field approach can be used to investigate the effects of viscoelasticity and cortical tension.</description>

      <title>Clonal dynamics of surface-driven growing tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01923v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The self-organization of cells into complex tissues relies on a tight coordination of cell behavior. Identifying the cellular processes driving tissue growth is key to understanding the emergence of tissue forms and devising targeted therapies for aberrant growth, such as in cancer. Inferring the mode of tissue growth, whether it is driven by cells on the surface or cells in the bulk, is possible in cell culture experiments, but difficult in most tissues in living organisms (in vivo). Genetic tracing experiments, where a subset of cells is labeled with inheritable markers have become important experimental tools to study cell fate in vivo. Here, we show that the mode of tissue growth is reflected in the size distribution of the progeny of marked cells. To this end, we derive the clone-size distributions using analytical calculations in the limit of negligible cell migration and cell death, and we test our predictions with an agent-based stochastic sampling technique. We show that for surface-driven growth the clone-size distribution takes a characteristic power-law form with an exponent determined by fluctuations of the tissue surface. Our results show how the mode of tissue growth can be inferred from genetic tracing experiments.</description>
