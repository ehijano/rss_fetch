      <title>Influence of Orbit and Mass Constraints on Reflected Light Characterization of Directly Imaged Rocky Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Survey strategies for upcoming exoplanet direct imaging missions have considered varying assumptions of prior knowledge. Precursor radial velocity surveys could have detected nearby exo-Earths and provided prior orbit and mass constraints. Alternatively, a direct imaging mission performing astrometry could yield constraints on orbit and phase angle of target planets. Understanding the impact of prior mass and orbit information on planetary characterization is crucial for efficiently recognizing habitable exoplanets. To address this question, we use a reflected-light retrieval tool to infer the atmospheric and bulk properties of directly imaged Earth-analogs while considering varying levels of prior information and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Because of the strong correlation between the orbit-related parameters and the planetary radius, prior information on the orbital distance and planetary phase yield tight constraints on the planetary radius: from $R_{\rm{p}}=2.95^{+2.69}_{-1.95}~R_{\oplus}$ without prior knowledge, to $R_{\rm{p}}=1.01^{+0.33}_{-0.19}~R_{\oplus}$ with prior determination of the orbit for $\rm{SNR}=20$ in the visible/near-infrared spectral range, thus allowing size determination from reflected light observations. However, additional knowledge of planet mass does not notably enhance radius ($R_{\rm{p}}=0.98^{+0.17}_{-0.14}~R_{\oplus}$) or atmospheric characterization. Also, prior knowledge of the mass alone does not yield a tight radius constraint ($R_{\rm{p}}=1.64^{+1.29}_{-0.80}~R_{\oplus}$) nor improves atmospheric composition inference. By contrast, because of its sensitivity to gas column abundance, detecting a Rayleigh scattering slope or bounding Rayleigh opacity helps to refine gas mixing ratio inferences without requiring prior mass knowledge. Overall, apart from radius determination, increasing the SNR is more beneficial than additional prior observations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Constitutive Neural Network for Large Deformation Poromechanics Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.15549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.15549v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the problem of large-strain consolidation in poromechanics with deep neural networks (DNN). Given different material properties and different loading conditions, the goal is to predict pore pressure and settlement. We propose a novel method "multi-constitutive neural network" (MCNN) such that one model can solve several different constitutive laws. We introduce a one-hot encoding vector as an additional input vector, which is used to label the constitutive law we wish to solve. Then we build a DNN which takes $(\hat{X}, \hat{t})$ as input along with a constitutive law label and outputs the corresponding solution. It is the first time, to our knowledge, that we can evaluate multi-constitutive laws through only one training process while still obtaining good accuracies. We found that MCNN trained to solve multiple PDEs outperforms individual neural network solvers trained with PDE in some cases.</description>
