      <title>Dynamics of Quantum Systems in Classical Nonequilibrium Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamics of a quantum system coupled to a classical environment and subject to constraints that drive it out of equilibrium is described. The evolution of the system is governed by the quantum-classical Liouville equation. Rather than evaluating the evolution of the mixed quantum-classical density operator, we derive exact equations of motion for the nonequilibrium average values of a set of operators or variables, along with correlation function expressions for the dissipative coefficients that enter these equations. These equations are obtained by requiring that the exact nonequilibrium averages are equal to local nonequilibrium averages that depend on auxiliary fields whose values satisfy evolution equations obtained using projection operator methods. The results are illustrated by deriving reaction-diffusion equations coupled to fluid hydrodynamic equations for a dilute solution of quantum particles that can exist in two metastable states. Nonequilibrium steady states are discussed along with the reaction rate and diffusion correlation functions that characterize such states.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in the Simplicial Ising Model on Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phase transitions in the simplicial Ising model on hypergraphs, in which the energy within each hyperedge (group) is lowered only when all the member spins are unanimously aligned. The Hamiltonian of the model is equivalent to a weighted sum of lower-order interactions, evoking an Ising model defined on a simplicial complex. Using the Landau free energy approach within the mean-field theory, we identify diverse phase transitions depending on the sizes of hyperedges. Specifically, when all hyperedges have the same size $q$, the nature of the transitions shifts from continuous to discontinuous at the tricritical point $q=4$, with the transition temperatures varying nonmonotonically, revealing the ambivalent effects of group size $q$. Furthermore, if both pairwise edges and hyperedges of size $q&gt;2$ coexist in a hypergraph, novel scenarios emerge, including mixed-order and double transitions, particularly for $q&gt;8$. Adopting the Bethe--Peierls method, we investigate the interplay between pairwise and higher-order interactions in achieving global magnetization, illuminating the multiscale nature of the higher-order dynamics.</description>

      <title>Nonequilibrium steady-state dynamics of Markov processes on graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an analytic approach for the steady-state dynamics of Markov processes on locally tree-like graphs. It is based on the definition of a probability distribution for infinite edge trajectories in terms of infinite matrix products. For homogeneous ensembles on regular graphs, the distribution is parametrized by a single $d\times d\times r^2$ tensor, where $r$ is the number of states per variable and $d$ is the matrix-product bond dimension. While the approach becomes exact in the large-$d$ limit, it usually produces extremely accurate results even for small $d$. The $d^2r^2$ parameters are found by solving a fixed point equation, for which we provide an efficient belief-propagation procedure. We apply it to a variety of models, including Ising-Glauber dynamics with symmetric and asymmetric couplings and the SIS model. Even for small $d$, the results are compatible with Monte Carlo estimates and accurately reproduce known exact solutions. The method gives access to accurate temporal correlations which, in some regimes, may be virtually impossible to estimate by sampling.</description>

      <title>Inertial Dynamics of Run-and-Tumble Particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a single inertial run-and-tumble particle on a straight line. The motion of this particle is characterized by two intrinsic time-scales, namely, an inertial and an active time-scale. We show that interplay of these two time-scales leads to the emergence of four distinct regimes, characterized by different dynamical behaviour of mean-squared displacement and survival probability. We analytically compute the position distributions in these regimes when the two time-scales are well separated. We show that in the large-time limit, the distribution has a large deviation form and compute the corresponding large deviation function analytically. We also find the persistence exponents in the different regimes theoretically. All our results are supported with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Geometric theory of (extended) time-reversal symmetries in stochastic processes -- Part II: field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the time-reversal properties of a generic Markovian stochastic field dynamics with Gaussian noise. We introduce a convenient functional geometric formalism that allows us to straightforwardly generalize known results from finite dimensional systems to the case of continuous fields. We give, at field level, full reversibility conditions for three notions of time-reversal defined in the first article of this two-part series, namely T-, MT-, and EMT-reversibility. When the noise correlator is invertible, these reversibility conditions do not make reference to any generically unknown function like the stationary probability, and can thus be verified systematically. Focusing on the simplest of these notions, where only the time variable is flipped upon time reversal, we show that time-reversal symmetry breaking is quantified by a single geometric object: the vorticity two-form, which is a two-form over the functional space $\mathbb{F}$ to which the field belongs. Reversibility then amounts to the cancellation of this vorticity two-form. This condition applies at distributional level and can thus be difficult to use in practice. For fields that are defined on a spatial domain of dimension $d=1$, we overcome this problem by building a basis of the space of two-forms $\Omega^2(\mathbb{F})$. Reversibility is then equivalent to the vanishing of the vorticity's coordinates in this basis, a criterion that is readily applicable to concrete examples. Furthermore, we show that this basis provides a natural direct-sum decomposition of $\Omega^2(\mathbb{F})$, each subspace of which is associated with a distinctive kind of phenomenology. This decomposition enables a classification of celebrated out-of-equilibrium phenomena, ranging from non-reciprocal (chaser/chased) interactions to the flocking of active agents, dynamical reaction-diffusion patterns, (...)</description>

      <title>Higher-order Ising model on hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-dyadic higher-order interactions affect collective behavior in various networked dynamical systems. Here we discuss the properties of a novel Ising model with higher-order interactions and characterize its phase transitions between the ordered and the disordered phase. By a mean-field treatment, we show that the transition is continuous when only three-body interactions are considered but becomes abrupt when interactions of higher orders are introduced. Using a Georges-Yedidia expansion to go beyond a na\"ive mean-field approximation, we reveal a quantitative shift in the critical point of the phase transition, which does not affect the universality class of the model. Finally, we compare our results with traditional $p$-spin models with many-body interactions. Our work unveils new collective phenomena on complex interacting systems, revealing the importance of investigating higher-order systems beyond three-body interactions.</description>

      <title>Critical heat current fluctuations in Curie-Weiss model in and out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In some models of nonequilibrium phase transitions, fluctuations of the analyzed currents have been observed to diverge with system size. To assess whether this behavior is universal across phase transitions, we examined heat current fluctuations in the Curie-Weiss model, a paradigmatic model of the paramagnetic-ferromagnetic phase transition, coupled to two thermal baths. This model exhibits phase transitions driven by both the temperature and the magnetic field. We find that at the temperature-driven phase transition, the heat current noise consists of two contributions: the equilibrium part, which vanishes with system size, and the nonequilibrium part, which diverges with system size. For small temperature differences, this leads to nonmonotonic scaling of fluctuations with system size. In contrast, at the magnetic-field-driven phase transition, heat current fluctuations do not diverge when observed precisely at the phase transition point. Instead, out of equilibrium, the noise is enhanced at the magnetic field values away but close to the phase transition point, due to stochastic switching between two current values. The maximum value of noise increases exponentially with system size, while the position of this maximum shifts towards the phase transition point. Finally, on the methodological side, the paper demonstrates that current fluctuations in large systems can be effectively characterized by combining a path integral approach for macroscopic fluctuations together with an effective two-state model describing subextensive transitions between the two macroscopic states involved in the phase transition.</description>

      <title>Deterministic many-body dynamics with multifractal response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamical systems can display a plethora of ergodic and ergodicity breaking behaviors, ranging from simple periodicity to ergodicity and chaos. Here we report an unusual type of non-ergodic behavior in a many-body discrete-time dynamical system, specifically a multi-periodic response with multi-fractal distribution of equilibrium spectral weights at all rational frequencies. This phenomenon is observed in the momentum-conserving variant of the newly introduced class of the so-called parity check reversible cellular automata, which we define with respect to an arbitrary bi-partite lattice. Although the models display strong fragmentation of phase space of configurations, we demonstrate that the effect qualitatively persists within individual fragmented sectors, and even individual typical many-body trajectories. We provide detailed numerical analysis of examples on 2D (honeycomb, square) and 3D (cubic) lattices.</description>

      <title>Machine learning force-field model for kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of itinerant Ising magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19780v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a scalable machine learning (ML) framework for large-scale kinetic Monte Carlo (kMC) simulations of itinerant electron Ising systems. As the effective interactions between Ising spins in such itinerant magnets are mediated by conducting electrons, the calculation of energy change due to a local spin update requires solving an electronic structure problem. Such repeated electronic structure calculations could be overwhelmingly prohibitive for large systems. Assuming the locality principle, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is developed to directly predict the effective local field and the corresponding energy change associated with a given spin update based on Ising configuration in a finite neighborhood. As the kernel size of the CNN is fixed at a constant, the model can be directly scalable to kMC simulations of large lattices. Our approach is reminiscent of the ML force-field models widely used in first-principles molecular dynamics simulations. Applying our ML framework to a square-lattice double-exchange Ising model, we uncover unusual coarsening of ferromagnetic domains at low temperatures. Our work highlights the potential of ML methods for large-scale modeling of similar itinerant systems with discrete dynamical variables.</description>

      <title>Reply to Comment on 'The Law of Entropy Increase and the Meissner Effect'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Jorge Hirsch, in his Comment on my article published in Entropy, agrees that the conventional BCS theory of superconductivity contradicts the second law of thermodynamics. He tries to prove that this theory cannot be valid because of this contradiction, since the Meissner effect is consistent with the second law of thermodynamics, according to his alternative theory of superconductivity, which can explain how the persistent currents can be annihilated before the resistance appearance. First of all I draw attention on experimental facts according to which the persistent currents observed in rings can be not annihilated not only before but even after the resistance appearance, in accordance with the conventional theory of superconductivity and contrary to the second law of thermodynamics. Hirsch's proof of the consistency of the Meissner effect with the second law of thermodynamics is based on mistakes provoked by ignoring the contradictions between books on superconductivity and the false analogy of the Gorter cycle with the Carnot cycle. In fact, Hirsch did not refute, but confirmed the conclusion made in my article about the contradiction of the Meissner effect to the second law of thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>All 4 x 4 solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we complete the classification of 4 x 4 solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation. Regular solutions were recently classified and in this paper we find the remaining non-regular solutions. We present several new solutions, then consider regular and non-regular Lax operators and study their relation to the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We show that for regular solutions there is a correspondence, which is lost in the non-regular case. In particular, we find non-regular Lax operators whose R-matrix from the fundamental commutation relations is regular but does not satisfy the Yang-Baxter equation. These R-matrices satisfy a modified Yang-Baxter equation instead.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic operators in $c=0$ bulk CFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18696v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Kac operators (e.g. energy operator) in percolation and self-avoiding walk bulk CFTs with central charge $c=0$. The proper normalizations of these operators can be deduced at generic $c$ by requiring the finiteness and reality of the three-point constants in cluster and loop model CFTs. At $c=0$, Kac operators become zero-norm states and the bottom fields of logarithmic multiplets, and comparison with $c&lt;1$ Liouville CFT suggests the potential existence of arbitrarily high rank Jordan blocks. We give a generic construction of logarithmic operators based on Kac operators and focus on the rank-2 pair of the energy operator mixing with the hull operator. By taking the $c\to 0$ limit, we compute some of their conformal data and use this to investigate the operator algebra at $c=0$. Based on cluster decomposition, we find that, contrary to previous belief, the four-point correlation function of the bulk energy operator does not vanish at $c=0$, and a crucial role is played by its coupling to the rank-3 Jordan block associated with the second energy operator. This reveals the intriguing way zero-norm operators build long-range higher-point correlations through the intricate logarithmic structures in $c=0$ bulk CFTs.</description>

      <title>A self-consistent quasilinear theory for collisionless relaxation to universal quasi-steady state attractors in cold dark matter halos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless self-gravitating systems, e.g., cold dark matter halos, harbor universal density profiles despite the intricate non-linear physics of hierarchical structure formation, the origin of which has been a persistent mystery. To solve this problem, we develop a self-consistent quasilinear theory (QLT) in action-angle space for the collisionless relaxation of driven, inhomogeneous, self-gravitating systems by perturbing the governing Vlasov-Poisson equations. We obtain a quasilinear diffusion equation (QLDE) for the secular evolution of the mean distribution function $f_0$ of a halo due to linear fluctuations (induced by random perturbations in the force field) that are collectively dressed by self-gravity, a phenomenon described by the response matrix. Unlike previous studies, we treat collective dressing up to all orders. Well-known halo density profiles $\rho(r)$ commonly observed in $N$-body simulations, including the $r^{-1}$ NFW cusp, an Einasto central core, and the $r^{-1.5}$ prompt cusp, emerge as quasi-steady state attractor solutions of the QLDE. The $r^{-1}$ cusp is a constant flux steady-state solution for a constantly accreting massive halo perturbed by small-scale white noise fluctuations induced by substructure. It is an outcome of the universal nature of collisionless relaxation: lower energy particles attract more particles, gain higher effective mass and get less accelerated by the fluctuating force field. The zero-flux steady state solution for an isolated halo is an $f_0$ that is flat in energy, and the corresponding $\rho(r)$ can either be cored or an $r^{-1.5}$ cusp depending on the inner boundary condition. The latter forms around a central dense object, e.g., a compact subhalo or a black hole. We demonstrate for the first time that these halo profiles emerge as quasi-steady state attractors of collisionless relaxation described by a self-consistent QLT.</description>

      <title>Noninvertible Symmetry-Enriched Quantum Critical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Noninvertible symmetry generalizes traditional group symmetries, advancing our understanding of quantum matter, especially one-dimensional gapped quantum systems. In critical lattice models, it is usually realized as emergent symmetries in the corresponding low-energy conformal field theories. In this work, we study critical lattice models with the noninvertible Rep($D_8$) symmetry in one dimension. This leads us to a new class of quantum critical points (QCP), noninvertible symmetry-enriched QCPs, as a generalization of known group symmetry-enriched QCPs. They are realized as phase transitions between one noninvertible symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase and another different one or spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase. We identify their low-energy properties and topological features through the Kennedy-Tasaki (KT) duality transformation. We argue that distinct noninvertible symmetry-enriched QCPs can not be smoothly connected without a phase transition or a multi-critical point.</description>

      <title>Quadrupole gauge theory: anti-Higgs mechanism and elastic dual</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the duality between elasticity and fracton gauge theory, we study an extension of the gauge group that includes the quadrupole moment. Remarkably, we find that spontaneous breaking of the quadrupole symmetry increases the number of massless excitations. This result appears to challenge the well-established paradigm, according to which gauge fields acquire mass through the Higgs mechanism, and the would-be Goldstone bosons are rendered massive. We refer to this phenomenon as the anti-Higgs mechanism. Furthermore, in the standard treatment of the fracton-elasticity duality, the conservation of quadrupole moment is incorporated ad hoc in order to restrict the motion of dislocations to glide along their Burgers vectors. Our study clarifies the origin of the quadrupole symmetry in the dual theory of elasticity, demonstrating that quadrupole gauge theory is not a priori dual to elastic solids but rather to a distinct class of systems, which we dub incompressible crystals. We argue, however, that the phenomenology of ordinary elasticity is recovered after the quadrupole symmetry is Higgsed and an incompressible crystal undergoes a phase transition to a compressible solid state.</description>

      <title>Machine learning the Ising transition: A comparison between discriminative and generative approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The detection of phase transitions is a central task in many-body physics. To automate this process, the task can be phrased as a classification problem. Classification problems can be approached in two fundamentally distinct ways: through either a discriminative or a generative method. In general, it is unclear which of these two approaches is most suitable for a given problem. The choice is expected to depend on factors such as the availability of system knowledge, dataset size, desired accuracy, computational resources, and other considerations. In this work, we answer the question of how one should approach the solution of phase-classification problems by performing a numerical case study on the thermal phase transition in the classical two-dimensional square-lattice ferromagnetic Ising model.</description>

      <title>Fundamental bounds on precision and response for quantum trajectory observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The precision and response of trajectory observables offer valuable insights into the behavior of nonequilibrium systems. For classical systems, trade-offs between these characteristics and thermodynamic costs, such as entropy production and dynamical activity, have been established through uncertainty relations. Quantum systems, however, present unique challenges, where quantum coherence can enhance precision and violate classical uncertainty relations. In this study, we derive trade-off relations for stochastic observables in Markovian open quantum systems. Specifically, we present three key results: (i) a quantum generalization of the thermo-kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the relative fluctuations of currents in terms of entropy production and dynamical activity; (ii) a quantum inverse uncertainty relation, which constrains the relative fluctuations of arbitrary counting observables based on their instantaneous fluctuations and the spectral gap of the symmetrized Liouvillian; and (iii) a quantum response kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the response of observables to kinetic perturbations in terms of dynamical activity. These fundamental bounds, validated numerically using a three-level maser, provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between precision, response, and thermodynamic costs in quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Adaptive dynamics of Ising spins in one dimension leveraging Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A one-dimensional flocking model using active Ising spins is studied, where the system evolves through the reinforcement learning approach \textit{via} defining state, action, and cost function for each spin. The orientation of spin with respect to its neighbouring spins defines its state. The state of spin is updated by altering its spin orientation in accordance with the $\varepsilon$-greedy algorithm (action) and selecting a finite step from a uniform distribution to update position. The $\varepsilon$ parameter is analogous to the thermal noise in the system. The cost function addresses cohesion among the spins. By exploring the system in the plane of the self-propulsion speed and $\varepsilon$ parameter, four distinct phases are found: disorder, flocking, flipping, and oscillatory. In the flipping phase, a condensed flock reverses its direction of motion stochastically. The mean reversal time $\langle T \rangle $ exponentially decays with $\varepsilon$. A new phase, an oscillatory phase, is also found, which is a chaotic phase with a positive Lyapunov exponent.
  The findings obtained from the reinforcement learning approach for the active Ising model system exhibit similarities with the outcomes of other conventional techniques, even without defining any explicit interaction among the spins.</description>

      <title>R\'enyi complexity in mean-field disordered systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Configurational entropy, or complexity, plays a critical role in characterizing disordered systems such as glasses, yet its measurement often requires significant computational resources. Recently, R\'enyi entropy, a one-parameter generalization of Shannon entropy, has gained attention across various fields of physics due to its simpler functional form, making it more practical for measurements. In this paper, we compute the R\'enyi version of complexity for prototypical mean-field disordered models, including the random energy model, its generalization, referred to as the random free energy model, and the $p$-spin spherical model. We first demonstrate that the R\'enyi complexity with index $m$ is related to the free energy difference for a generalized annealed Franz-Parisi potential with $m$ clones. Detailed calculations show that for models having one-step replica symmetry breaking (RSB), the R\'enyi complexity vanishes at the Kauzmann transition temperature $T_K$, irrespective of $m&gt;1$, while RSB solutions are required even in the liquid phase. This study strengthens the link between R\'enyi entropy and the physics of disordered systems and provides theoretical insights for its practical measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A model for a lattice of coupled cat maps has been recently introduced. This new and specific choice of the coupling makes the description especially easy and nontrivial quantities as Lyapunov exponents determined exactly. We studied the ergodic property of the dynamics along such a chain for a local perturbation. While the perturbation spreads across a front growing ballistically, the position and momentum profiles show large fluctuations due to chaos leading to diffusive transport in the phase space. It provides an example where the diffusion can be directly inferred from the microscopic chaos.</description>

      <title>Collective decision-making with heterogeneous biases: Role of network topology and susceptibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The ability of groups to make accurate collective decisions depends on a complex interplay of various factors, such as prior information, biases, social influence, and the structure of the interaction network. Here, we investigate a spin model that accounts for heterogeneous preferences and enables control over the non-linearity of social interactions. Building on previous results for complete graphs and regular 2D lattices, we investigate how the modification of network topology towards (sparse) random graphs can affect collective decision-making. We use two different measures of susceptibility to assess the responsiveness of the system to internal and external perturbations. In particular, we investigate how the maximum of susceptibility depends on network connectivity. Based on our findings, we discuss how collective systems might adapt to changes in environmental fluctuations by adjusting their network structure or the nature of their social interactions in order to remain in the region of maximal susceptibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In disordered Hermitian systems, localization of energy eigenstates prohibits wave propagation. In non-Hermitian systems, however, wave propagation is possible even when the eigenstates of Hamiltonian are exponentially localized by disorders. We find in this regime that non-Hermitian wave propagation exhibits novel universal scaling behaviors without Hermitian counterpart. Furthermore, our theory demonstrates how the tail of imaginary-part density of states dictates wave propagation in the long-time limit. Specifically, for the three typical classes, namely the Gaussian, the uniform, and the linear imaginary-part density of states, we obtain logarithmically suppressed sub-ballistic transport, and two types of subdiffusion with exponents that depend only on spatial dimensions, respectively. Our work highlights the fundamental differences between Hermitian and non-Hermitian Anderson localization, and uncovers unique universality in non-Hermitian wave propagation.</description>

      <title>Bethe $M$-layer construction on the Ising model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01171v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In statistical physics, one of the standard methods to study second order phase transitions is the renormalization group that usually leads to an expansion around the corresponding fully connected solution. Unfortunately, often in disordered models, some important finite dimensional second-order phase transitions are qualitatively different or absent in the corresponding fully connected model: in such cases the standard expansion fails. Recently, a new method, the $M$-layer one, has been introduced that performs an expansion around a different soluble mean field model: the Bethe lattice one. This new method has been already used to compute the upper critical dimension $D_U$ of different disordered systems such as the Random Field Ising model or the Spin glass model with field. If then one wants to go beyond and construct an expansion around $D_U$ to understand how critical quantities get renormalized, the actual computation of all the numerical factors is needed. This next step has still not been performed, being technically more involved. In this paper we perform this computation for the ferromagnetic Ising model without quenched disorder, in finite dimensions: we show that, at one-loop order inside the $M$-layer approach, we recover the continuum quartic field theory and we are able to identify the coupling constant $g$ and the other parameters of the theory, as a function of macroscopic and microscopic details of the model such as the lattice spacing, the physical lattice dimension and the temperature. This is a fundamental step that will help in applying in the future the same techniques to more complicated systems, for which the standard field theoretical approach is impracticable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of integrability breaking on the relaxation dynamics of the (double) sine-Gordon model. Compared to previous studies, we apply an alternative viewpoint motivated by open-system physics by separating the phase field into homogeneous and inhomogeneous parts, describing a quantum pendulum (subsystem) and an interacting phononic bath (environment). To study the relaxation dynamics in the model, we perform quantum quenches using the mini-superspace-based truncated Hamiltonian approach developed recently and simulate the real-time evolution of various entanglement measures and the energy transfer between the subsystem and its environment. Our findings demonstrate that in the presence of integrability-breaking perturbations, the relaxation dynamics is substantially faster, signalled by the increase of entanglement and energy transfer between the quantum pendulum and the phonon bath.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the statistics of the first-passage time (FPT) to a fractal self-similar boundary of the Koch snowflake. When the starting position is fixed near the absorbing boundary, the FPT distribution exhibits an apparent power-law decay over a broad range of timescales, culminated by an exponential cut-off. By extensive Monte Carlo simulations, we compute the local persistence exponent of the survival probability and reveal its log-periodic oscillations in time due to self-similarity of the boundary. The effect of the starting point onto this behavior is analyzed in depth. Theoretical bounds on the survival probability are derived from the analysis of diffusion in a circular sector. Physical rationales for the refined structure of the survival probability are presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2302.04021v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Particles in a crowded environment exhibit slow anomalous diffusion, and their efficient manipulation is important in controlling transport phenomena in complex materials. Skyrmions and half-skyrmions, spatially localized quasiparticles observed in magnetic systems and liquid crystals, also exhibit diffusive motion. They exhibit normal diffusion in dilute conditions. However, the cooperative dynamics and diffusion of skyrmions and half-skyrmions in their condensed liquid, hexatic, and crystalline phases are elusive. Here we show in the half-skyrmion condensed phases that the fusion and fission of half-skyrmions, not their diffusion, are responsible for the primary structural relaxation. The fusion and fission occur due to the non-conserved nature of the quasiparticle number density. The diffusion, which contributes to the secondary structural relaxation, is suppressed by cages formed by surrounding half-skyrmions, whereas enhanced by Mermin-Wagner fluctuation characteristic to two-dimensional systems, leading to subdiffusive motion. Large displacement of half-skyrmions is locally excited by fusion-fission and bond-breaking between adjacent half-skyrmions via heterogeneous elastic fields. Furthermore, the motion of half-skyrmions couples with transverse and longitudinal sound wave excitation differently, where the transverse sound wave is more attenuated than the longitudinal one due to the coupling between transverse sound wave and half-skyrmion deformation. We also discuss the {relationship} between half-skyrmion diffusion in our system and skyrmion diffusion in magnetic systems. Our result provides a qualitative difference in dynamical properties between half-skyrmion gaseous and condensed phases, suggesting the efficient manipulation of high-density half-skyrmions and skyrmions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05417v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article we investigate no-resonance conditions for quantum many body chaotic systems and random matrix models. No-resonance conditions are properties of the spectrum of a model, usually employed as a theoretical tool in the analysis of late time dynamics. The first order no-resonance condition holds when a spectrum is non-degenerate, while higher order no-resonance conditions imply sums of an equal number of energies are non-degenerate outside of permutations of the indices. This resonance condition is usually assumed to hold for quantum chaotic models. In this work we use several tests from random matrix theory to demonstrate that the statistics of sums of eigenvalues, that are of interest to due to the no-resonance conditions, have Poisson statistics, and lack level repulsion. This result is produced for both a quantum chaotic Hamiltonian as well as the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble and Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble. This implies some models may have violations of the no-resonance condition or "near" violations. We finish the paper by generalizing important bounds in quantum equilibration theory to cases where the no-resonance conditions are violated, and to the case of random matrix models.</description>

      <title>Universal validity of the second law of information thermodynamics</title>

Abstract: Adiabatic measurements, followed by feedback and erasure protocols, have often been considered as a model to embody Maxwell's Demon paradox and to study the interplay between thermodynamics and information processing. Such studies have led to the conclusion, now widely accepted in the community, that Maxwell's Demon and the second law of thermodynamics can peacefully coexist because any gain provided by the demon must be offset by the cost of performing the measurement and resetting the demon's memory to its initial state. Statements of this kind are collectively referred to as second laws of information thermodynamics and have recently been extended to include quantum theoretical scenarios. However, previous studies in this direction have made several assumptions, particularly about the feedback process and the demon's memory readout, and thus arrived at statements that are not universally applicable and whose range of validity is not clear. In this work, we fill this gap by precisely characterizing the full range of quantum feedback control and erasure protocols that are overall consistent with the second law of thermodynamics. This leads us to conclude that the second law of information thermodynamics is indeed universal: it must hold for any quantum feedback control and erasure protocol, regardless of the measurement process involved, as long as the protocol is overall compatible with thermodynamics. Our comprehensive analysis not only encompasses new scenarios but also retrieves previous ones, doing so with fewer assumptions. This simplification contributes to a clearer understanding of the theory.</description>

Abstract: The transport of conserved quantities like spin and charge is fundamental to characterizing the behavior of quantum many-body systems. Numerically simulating such dynamics is generically challenging, which motivates the consideration of quantum computing strategies. However, the relatively high gate errors and limited coherence times of today's quantum computers pose their own challenge, highlighting the need to be frugal with quantum resources. In this work we report simulations on quantum hardware of infinite-temperature energy transport in the mixed-field Ising chain, a paradigmatic many-body system that can exhibit a range of transport behaviors at intermediate times. We consider a chain with $L=12$ sites and find results broadly consistent with those from ideal circuit simulators over 90 Trotter steps, containing up to 990 entangling gates. To obtain these results, we use two key problem-tailored insights. First, we identify a convenient basis$\unicode{x2013}$the Pauli $Y$ basis$\unicode{x2013}$in which to sample the infinite-temperature trace and provide theoretical and numerical justifications for its efficiency relative to, e.g., the computational basis. Second, in addition to a variety of problem-agnostic error mitigation strategies, we employ a renormalization strategy that compensates for global nonconservation of energy due to device noise. We discuss the applicability of the proposed sampling approach beyond the mixed-field Ising chain and formulate a variational method to search for a sampling basis with small sample-to-sample fluctuations for an arbitrary Hamiltonian. This opens the door to applying these techniques in more general models.</description>

      <title>Understanding orientational disorder in crystalline assemblies of hard convex polyhedra</title>

Abstract: Spontaneous self-assembly of hard convex polyhedra are known to form orientationally disordered crystalline phases, where particle orientations do not follow the same pattern as the positional arrangement of the crystal. A distinct type of orientational phase with discrete rotational mobility has been reported in hard particle systems. In this paper, we present a new analysis method for characterizing orientational phase of a crystal, which is based on algorithmic detection of unique orientations. Using this method we collected complete statistics of discrete orientations along the Monte Carlo simulation trajectories and observed that particles were equally partitioned among them, with specific values of pairwise orientational differences. These features remained constant across the pressure range and did not depend on rotational mobility. The discrete mobility was characteristic of a distinct equilibrium thermodynamic phase, qualitatively different from the freely rotating plastic phase with continuous orientations. The high pressure behavior with frozen particle orientations was part of that the same description and not a non-equilibrium arrested state. We introduced a precise notion of orientational order and demonstrated that the system was maximally disordered at the level of unit cell, even though individual particles could only take few discrete orientations. We report the existence of this phase in five polyhedral shapes and in systematically curated shape families constructed around two of them. The symmetry mismatch between the particle and the crystallographic point groups was found to be a predictive indicator for the occurrence of this phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the impact of volume exclusion on the local assembly of linear physical networks, where nodes and links are hard-core rigid objects. To do so, we introduce a minimal 3D model that helps us zoom into confined regions of these networks whose distant parts are sequentially connected by links with a very large aspect ratio. We show that the kinetics of link adhesion is logarithmic, as opposed to the algebraic growth in lower dimensions, and we attribute this qualitatively different behavior to a spontaneous delay of depletion forces caused by the 3D nature of the problem. Equally important, we find that this slow kinetics is metastable, allowing us to analytically predict an algebraic growth due to the formation of local bundles. Our findings offer a benchmark to study the local assembly of physical networks, with implications for non-equilibrium nest-like packings.</description>

      <title>Mixed-state quantum anomaly and multipartite entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17357v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement measures of many-body states have been increasingly useful to characterize phases of matter. Here we explore a surprising connection between mixed state entanglement and 't Hooft anomaly. More specifically, we consider lattice systems in $d$ space dimensions with anomalous symmetry $G$ where the anomaly is characterized by an invariant in the group cohomology $H^{d+2}(G,U(1))$. We show that any mixed state $\rho$ that is strongly symmetric under $G$, in the sense that $G\rho\propto\rho$, is necessarily $(d+2)$-nonseparable, i.e. is not the mixture of tensor products of $d+2$ states in the Hilbert space. Furthermore, such states cannot be prepared from any $(d+2)$-separable states using finite-depth local quantum channels, so the nonseparability is long-ranged in nature. We provide proof of these results in $d\leq1$, and plausibility arguments in $d&gt;1$. The anomaly-nonseparability connection thus allows us to generate simple examples of mixed states with nontrivial long-ranged multipartite entanglement. In particular, in $d=1$ we found an example of intrinsically mixed quantum phase, in the sense that states in this phase cannot be two-way connected to any pure state through finite-depth local quantum channels. We also analyze mixed anomaly involving both strong and weak symmetries, including systems constrained by the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type of anomaly. We find that, while strong-weak mixed anomaly in general does not constrain quantum entanglement, it does constrain long-range correlations of mixed states in nontrivial ways. Namely, such states are not symmetrically invertible and not gapped Markovian, generalizing familiar properties of anomalous pure states.</description>

      <title>On harvesting physical predictions from asymptotically safe quantum field theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08541v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Asymptotic safety is a powerful mechanism for obtaining a consistent and predictive quantum field theory beyond the realm of perturbation theory. It hinges on an interacting fixed point of the Wilsonian renormalization group flow which controls the microscopic dynamics. Connecting the fixed point to observations requires constructing the set of effective actions compatible with this microscopic dynamics. Technically, this information is stored in the UV-critical surface of the fixed point. In this work, we describe a novel approach for extracting this information based on analytical and pseudo-spectral methods. Our construction is illustrated at the level of the two-dimensional Ising model and easily generalizes to any asymptotically safe quantum field theory. It also constitutes an important step towards setting up a well-founded swampland program within the gravitational asymptotic safety program.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional correlation propagation dynamics with a cluster discrete phase-space method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18594v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonequilibrium dynamics of highly-controlled quantum systems is a challenging issue in statistical physics and quantum many-body physics, relevant to recent experimental developments of analog and digital quantum simulations. In this work, we develop a discrete phase-space approach for general SU($N$) spin systems that utilizes cluster mean field equations, which capture non-trivial quantum correlations inside each cluster, beyond the capability of the standard discrete truncated Wigner approximation for individual classical spins. Our formalism, based on a cluster phase-point operator, enables efficient numerical samplings of cluster phase-space variables, where the total number of noise variables for a direct product state is independent of the specific way in which the entire system is divided into multiple equally sized finite clusters. We numerically demonstrate that the cluster discrete truncated Wigner approximation (C-dTWA) method can reproduce key results in a recent experiment on correlation propagation dynamics in a two dimensional Bose-Hubbard system. We further compare the results of C-dTWA for clusters of $2\times 2$ sites with those from a two-dimensional tensor network method and discuss that both approaches agree very well in the short-time region, where the energy conservation is well maintained in the tensor network simulations. Since we formulate the C-dTWA method in a general form, it has the potential for application to various dynamical problems in isolated and open quantum systems, even in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Resetting Mitigates Latent Gradient Bias of SGD from Label Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00396v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Giving up and starting over may seem wasteful in many situations such as searching for a target or training deep neural networks (DNNs). Our study, though, demonstrates that resetting from a checkpoint can significantly improve generalization performance when training DNNs with noisy labels. In the presence of noisy labels, DNNs initially learn the general patterns of the data but then gradually memorize the corrupted data, leading to overfitting. By deconstructing the dynamics of stochastic gradient descent (SGD), we identify the behavior of a latent gradient bias induced by noisy labels, which harms generalization. To mitigate this negative effect, we apply the stochastic resetting method to SGD, inspired by recent developments in the field of statistical physics achieving efficient target searches. We first theoretically identify the conditions where resetting becomes beneficial, and then we empirically validate our theory, confirming the significant improvements achieved by resetting. We further demonstrate that our method is both easy to implement and compatible with other methods for handling noisy labels. Additionally, this work offers insights into the learning dynamics of DNNs from an interpretability perspective, expanding the potential to analyze training methods through the lens of statistical physics.</description>

      <title>How to define temperature in active systems?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We are used to measure temperature with a thermometer and we know from everyday life that different types of thermometers measure the same temperature. This experience can be based on equilibrium thermodynamics, which explains the equivalence of different possibilities to define temperature. In contrast, for systems out of equilibrium such as active matter, measurements performed with different thermometers can generally lead to different temperature values. In the present work, we systematically compare different possibilities to define temperature for active systems. Based on simulations and theory for inertial active Brownian particles, we find that different temperatures generally lead to different temperature values, as expected. Remarkably, however, we find that different temperatures not only lead to the same values near equilibrium (low P\'eclet number or high particle mass), but even far from equilibrium, several different temperatures approximately coincide. In particular, we find that the kinetic temperature, the configurational temperature, and temperatures based on higher moments of the velocity distribution constitute a class of temperatures that all assume very similar values over a wide parameter range. Notably, the effective temperature and temperatures exploiting the virial theorem, the Stokes-Einstein relation, or a harmonic confinement form a second class of temperatures whose values approximately coincide with each other but which strongly differ from those of the first class. Finally, we identify advantages and disadvantages of the different possibilities to define temperature and discuss their relevance for measuring the temperature of active systems.</description>

      <title>Thermal and Quantum Phase Transitions of the $\phi^4$ Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The critical behaviour of the classical (thermal) phase transition (CPT) of the Ising model is in the same universality class of the quantum phase transition (QPT) of the $\phi^4$ Quantum Field Theory (QFT). Our goal in this work is to map out the QPT-CPT diagram of the $\phi^4$ QFT, and to revisit its relation to the well-known QPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model. To this aim, we propose a modification of the usual finite-temperature Renormalization Group (RG) approach by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale, $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ where $k_T$ is the running cutoff for thermal, and $k$ is for the quantum fluctuations. Once introduced this dimesionless temperature $\tau$, we investigate the consequences on the thermal RG approach for the $\phi^4$ model and construct its QPT-CPT phase diagram. Finally, we formulate requirements for the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the $\phi^4$ theory based on known properties of the QPT-CPT phase diagram of the Ising model.</description>
