      <title>Magnetized Shocks Mediated by Radiation from Leptonic and Hadronic Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Shocks in astrophysical transients are key sites of particle acceleration. If the shock upstream is optically thick, radiation smoothens the velocity discontinuity at the shock (radiation-mediated shocks). However, in mildly magnetized outflows, a collisionless subshock can form, enhancing the efficiency of particle acceleration. We solve the hydrodynamic equations of a steady-state, radiation-mediated shock together with the radiative transfer equations accounting for electron and proton acceleration. Our goal is to explore the impact of the magnetic field and non-thermal radiation on the shock structure and the resulting spectral distribution of photons. To this purpose, we assume a relativistic upstream fluid velocity ($\Gamma_u = 10$) and investigate shock configurations with variable upstream magnetization ($\sigma_u = 0$, $10^{-8}$, $10^{-4}$, $0.1$, and $0.3$). We find that synchrotron self-absorption alters the shock profile for $\sigma_u \gtrsim 10^{-8}$, with resulting changes up to $100\%$ in the bulk Lorentz factor at the shock; for $\sigma_u \gtrsim 0.1$, a prominent subshock forms. The spectral energy distributions of upstream- and downstream-going photons are also altered. Radiative processes linked to accelerated protons are responsible for a high-energy ($\gtrsim 10$ GeV) tail in the photon spectrum; however, the radiation flux and pressure are negligibly affected with consequent minor impact on the shock structure. Our work highlights the importance of coupling the shock hydrodynamics to the transport of photons, electrons, protons, and intermediate particles to forecast the multi-messenger emission from astrophysical transients.</description>

      <title>Excitation of molecular hydrogen by cosmic-ray protons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy cosmic rays ($E\lesssim 1$ GeV) are responsible for the ionisation and heating of molecular clouds. While the role of supra-thermal electrons produced in the ionisation process in inducing excitation of the ambient gas (mostly molecular hydrogen) has been studied in detail, the role of primary cosmic-ray nuclei (protons and heavier nuclei) has been generally neglected. Here, we introduce, for the first time, cross sections for proton impact on H$_2$, calculated using the semi-classical implementation of the molecular convergent close-coupling method. Our findings show that proton-induced H$_2$ excitation is comparable in magnitude to that caused by electrons. We discuss the possible implications on the estimate of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate from observations in the near-infrared domain and on the cosmic-ray-induced H$_2$ ultraviolet luminescence. We also derive a new approximated analytical parameterisation of the spectrum of secondary electrons that can be easily incorporated in numerical codes.</description>

      <title>Normal or transitional? The evolution and properties of two type Ia supernovae in the Virgo cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are among the most precise cosmological distance indicators used to study the expansion history of the Universe. The vast increase of SN Ia data due to large-scale astrophysical surveys has led to the discovery of a wide variety of SN Ia sub-classes, such as transitional and fast-declining SNe Ia. However, their distinct photometric and spectroscopic properties differentiate them from the population of normal SNe Ia such that their use as cosmological tools remains challenged. Here, we present a high-cadenced photometric and spectroscopic dataset of two SNe Ia, SNe 2020ue and 2020nlb, which were discovered in the nearby Virgo cluster of galaxies. Our study shows that SN 2020nlb is a normal SN Ia whose unusually red color is intrinsic, arising from a lower photospheric temperature rather than interstellar reddening, providing clear evidence that color diversity among normal SNe Ia can have a physical origin. In contrast, SN 2020ue has photometric properties, such as color evolution and light-curve decay rate, similar to those of transitional SNe, spectroscopically it is more aligned with normal SNe Ia. This is evident from spectroscopic indicators such as the pseudo-equivalent width of \ion{Si}{II} lines. Thus, such SNe Ia that are photometrically at the edge of the standard normal SNe Ia range may be missed in cosmological SNe Ia samples. Our results highlight that spectroscopic analysis of SNe Ia around peak brightness is crucial for identifying intrinsic color variations and constructing a more complete and physically homogeneous SN Ia sample for precision cosmology.</description>

      <title>XRISM Observations of Accretion Disk Corona in Cyg X-2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the high-resolution X-ray spectrum of the Z-source Cygnus X-2, obtained with X-Ray Imaging and Spectroscopy Mission (XRISM). The observations have enabled a precise characterization of the Fe-K emission lines from the accretion disk corona (ADC) and a possible detection of an ultra-fast outflow (UFO). The ADC component has at least two distinct regions. The Fe-K emission lines are remarkably broad, with a velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v=2300^{+900}_{-700}$~km~s$^{-1}$. This can be larger than what was observed in previous Chandra observations ($1120\pm870$~km~s$^{-1}$) and recent XRISM observations of the similar Z-source GX 340+0 (360--800~km~s$^{-1}$). Furthermore, we marginally detect a blueshifted absorption feature, which we identify as either \ion{Fe}{26} or \ion{Fe}{25}, with outflow velocities of $-0.29c$ or $-0.26c$, respectively. The mass loss rate is $\dot{M}\sim10^{-8}M_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$. Our findings suggest that the ADC in Cyg X-2 has a kinematically active environment with a high degree of turbulence and kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Particle Astrophysics with High and Ultrahigh Energy Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize recent results of the observations of high (1 TeV-100 PeV) and ultrahigh ($\geq 100$ PeV) energy neutrinos, including the detection of a diffuse cosmic high-energy neutrino background, the identification of the first neutrino source candidates, and the observation of high-energy neutrinos from the Galactic plane. These findings open a new window to the universe by enabling the use of neutrinos to probe the cosmos that are otherwise inaccessible via photons. Although the origins of most detected neutrinos remain uncertain, we highlight several distinctive features of their sources that have emerged from current observations.</description>

      <title>Broadband Spectral Analysis of 1ES2344+514: A Multi-epoch study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of the multi-epoch broadband spectral study of 1ES 2344+514 and study the evolution of physical parameters. We used nearly simultaneous data obtained from 2017 June 6 to 2022 August 6 (MJD 57910 -- 59797) in optical, UV, X-ray and $\gamma$-ray wavebands from various instruments including Swift-UVOT, Swift-XRT, NuSTAR, AstroSat (SXT and LAXPC), Fermi-LAT, and TeV flux from MAGIC. During 2017 July, 1ES 2344+514 appeared to be in the highest flaring state compared to other periods. We used the 0.5 -- 7.0 keV and 3.0 -- 20.0 keV data, respectively, from SXT and LAXPC of AstroSat and also 0.3 -- 8.0 keV and 3.0 -- 79.0 keV data, respectively, from Swift-XRT and NuSTAR. A joint fit between SXT and LAXPC, and between Swift-XRT and NuSTAR has been done for constraining the synchrotron peak. A clear shift in the synchrotron peak has been observed, which included 1ES 2344+514 in the HSP BL Lac family. A `harder-when-brighter' trend is observed in X-rays, and the opposite trend, i.e., `softer-when-brighter', is seen in the $\gamma$-rays. The multi-epoch broad-band spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of this source were built and studied to get an idea of the radiation processes. The SEDs were fitted using a steady-state leptonic one-zone synchrotron+SSC model, and the fitted parameters of the emission region are consistent with those of other TeV BL Lacs. In this study, we found a weak correlation tendency between bolometric luminosity and magnetic field (B), as well as between bolometric luminosity and the break Lorentz factor ($\gamma_{break}$).</description>

      <title>Can the Efron-Petrosian Method Recover the Inverse-Square Distance Law for Simulated Radio Pulsar Fluxes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00784v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We test whether the Efron-Petrosian (E-P) method can recover the inverse-square law dependence of the radio pulsar flux, using a synthetic catalog generated according to the specifications of the Parkes multi-beam survey using the {\tt PsrPopPy} software. We find that the E-P method cannot reproduce the inverse-square law, except over a narrow range of flux thresholds and even here we don't get pristine agreement. The main reason for the deviation is that the synthetic radio pulsar catalog is truncated based on a cut on the pulsar signal to noise ratio (SNR), which has a non-linear dependence on the flux along with plenty of scatter. We show that the disagreement is exacerbated as we raise the SNR threshold. We then demonstrate that if we create a synthetic catalog based on a flux cut (instead of an SNR-based threshold), we can recover the true distance exponent, with an accuracy ranging from pristine agreement to within $\pm 1 \sigma$ depending on the chosen flux threshold.</description>

      <title>Tidal disruption and evaporation of rubble-pile and monolithic bodies as a source of flaring activity in Sgr A^\star$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sgr A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, exhibits frequent short-duration flares with luminosity greater than 1e34 erg/s across multiple wavelengths. The origin of the flares is still unknown. We revisited the role of small planetary bodies, originally from the stellar disk, and their tidally disrupted fragments as a source of flaring activity in Sgr A*. We refined previous models by incorporating material strength constraints on the tidal disruption limit and by evaluating the evaporation dynamics of the resulting fragments. We analyzed the tidal fragmentation and gas-induced fragmentation of small planetary bodies with rubble-pile and monolithic structures. Using constraints from recent space missions (e.g., NASA OSIRIS-REx and JAXA Hayabusa2), we estimated the survivability of fragments under aerodynamic heating and computed their expected luminosity from ablation, modeled as fireball flares analogous to meteor events.
  We find that planetary fragments can approach as close as 8 gravitational radii, consistent with observed flare locations. The fireball model yields luminosities from 1e34 to 1e36 erg/s for fragments whose parent bodies are a few kilometers in size. The derived flare frequency vs. luminosity distribution follows a power law with index 1.83, in agreement with observed values (1.65 - 1.9), while the flare duration scales as L^(-1/3), consistent with observations. We consider the young stars around Sgr A* as the planetary reservoir. Given a small-body population analogous in mass to the primordial Kuiper belt and the common existence of close-in super-Earths and long-period Neptunes, we show that this planetary reservoir can supply the observed flares.</description>

      <title>Images of shadow and thin accretion disk around Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the shadow and optical appearance of Bardeen black hole (BH) immersed in perfect-fluid dark matter (PFDM). Using the EHT data, we find that the DM parameter is restricted to a narrow allowed range, confined to values of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1}-10^{-2})$. Additionally, we observed that increasing the DM parameter substantially enlarges the photon sphere, the critical impact parameter, and thus the shadow radius, whereas the magnetic charge $g$ produces only negligible corrections. The DM component also modifies the optical appearance of the accretion disk: higher $b$ systematically suppresses the observed radiation intensity and reduces image brightness, while changes in $g$ yield only marginal effects. Subsequently, using the Novikov-Thorne thin disk model, we analyze primary and secondary images, observed flux, and redshift patterns, showing that PFDM noticeably alters image size and brightness whereas magnetic charge has a negligible influence. No blueshifted regions appear in any configuration. These results highlight several promising observational signatures for testing DM environments and nonlinear electrodynamic effects around BHs.</description>

      <title>Thermal conduction and thermopower of inner crusts of magnetized neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the thermal conductivity and thermoelectric power (thermopower) of the inner crust of compact stars across a broad temperature-density domain relevant for proto-neutron stars, binary neutron-star mergers, and accreting neutron stars. The analysis covers the transition from a semi-degenerate to a highly degenerate electron gas and assumes temperatures above the melting threshold of the nuclear lattice, such that nuclei form a liquid. The transport coefficients are obtained by solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation in the relaxation-time approximation, fully incorporating the anisotropies generated by non-quantizing magnetic fields. Electron scattering rates include (i) dynamical screening of the electron-ion interaction in the hard-thermal-loop approximation of QED, (ii) ion-ion correlations within a one-component plasma, and (iii) finite nuclear-size effects. As an additional refinement, we evaluate electron-neutron scattering induced by the coupling of electrons to the anomalous magnetic moment of free neutrons; this contribution is found to be subdominant throughout the parameter range explored. To assess the sensitivity of transport coefficients to the underlying microphysics, we perform calculations for several inner-crust compositions obtained from different nuclear interactions and many-body methods. Across most of the crust, variations in relaxation times and in the components of the anisotropic thermal-conductivity and thermopower tensors reach up to factors 3-4 and 1.5-2, respectively, with the exception of the region where pasta phases are expected. These results provide updated, composition-dependent microphysical inputs for dissipative magneto-hydrodynamic simulations of warm neutron stars and post-merger remnants, where anisotropic heat and charge transport are of critical importance.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Orbital Variations in Binary Radio Pulsars from Lense-Thirring Precession</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A future measurement of Lense-Thirring (LT) precession using a binary radio pulsar is expected to yield the pulsar's moment of inertia ($I_{\rm p}$). However, most of the known pulsar-binary systems expected to provide this opportunity will exhibit linear variations in the orbital elements due to LT precession that are difficult to separate from variations induced by other mechanisms. In this work, we demonstrate that the pulsar-timing signature of LT precession for an arbitrary orbital orientation produces nonlinear orbital variations; if detected, these nonlinear variations provide a means to constrain $I_{\rm p}$ without the need for timing-independent measurements of orbital geometry or distance. We show through simulations that these signatures are indeed detectable in pulsar-binary systems with an appropriate combination of timing precision and orbital geometry. Our simulations also show that nonlinear orbital variations from LT precession are expected to be detectable in PSR J1757$-$1854 after only 15 yr of dedicated timing.</description>

      <title>Impact of positrons on electrical conductivity of hot and dense astrophysical plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of positrons on the outer crusts of neutron stars and the interiors of white dwarfs, introducing them as a novel component in both the composition of matter and in transport processes. We solve a system of coupled Boltzmann kinetic equations for the electron and positron distribution functions in the relaxation-time approximation, taking into account electron-ion, positron-ion, and electron-positron collisions. The relevant scattering matrix elements are calculated from one-plasmon exchange diagrams, with in-medium polarization tensors derived within hard-thermal-loop effective theory. Numerical results are obtained for matter composed of carbon nuclei. We find that the conductivity rises with temperature, following a power law sigma proportional to the 4th power of T in the semi-degenerate regime and sigma proportional to T in the nondegenerate regime, due to the intense creation of thermal electron-positron pairs and the resulting collisions among them. These results highlight the importance of including positrons in the transport properties of heated, dense astrophysical plasmas.</description>

Abstract: 1H 0323+342 is the nearest gamma-ray narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy (z=0.063). Its X-ray spectrum (0.3-10 keV) is characterised by significant spectral variability observed by many authors, with a backbone with photon index ~2 occasionally superimposed by a hard tail. This spectral variability has been interpreted as the interplay between the X-ray corona and the relativistic jet. The X-ray fluxes in the 0.3-10 keV energy band are generally around ~10^-11 erg cm^-2 s^-1, making it easier to get sufficient statistics even with short exposures. Here I present a reanalysis of all the available X-ray observations with Swift (181 obs), XMM-Newton (7 obs), Chandra (1 obs), and Suzaku (2 obs) performed between 2006 and 2025. Possible interpretations are proposed and discussed.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Supernova Engines in the 3C 397 and W49B Supernova Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the supernova remnants (SNRs) 3C 397 and W49B has long been a subject of debate, with prior studies offering conflicting interpretations between thermonuclear and core-collapse scenarios. To help settle this debate, we present a systematic, spatially resolved, spectroscopic analysis of both remnants using XMM-Newton. By applying multi-component thermal models, we derive key physical properties including elemental abundances, ejecta temperatures, ambient densities, and explosion energetics. We compare the inferred metal abundance ratios to a wide range of core-collapse and thermonuclear nucleosynthesis models, including new models whose explosion energies differ from the canonical value of $10^{51}$ ergs. We find that the observed Fe/Si and Ca/Si ratios in both SNRs are best matched by certain thermonuclear models. However, no model fully reproduces the complete set of observed abundance patterns. In 3C 397, high Fe enrichment and spatial abundance variations suggest interaction with a dense progenitor environment, and W49B's composition is overall consistent with a thermonuclear origin; however both require a low energy ($\sim 10^{50}$ erg) supernova explosion. We additionally map the Fe K$\alpha$ line centroid energies and find a spread, with W49B falling within the core-collapse region -- highlighting both environmental complexity and the limitations of this diagnostic for supernova classification. Our results highlight the need for caution in relying on any single diagnostic or nucleosynthesis model for supernova typing, underscore the need for improved nucleosynthesis models, and motivate future high-resolution, high-throughput observations.</description>

      <title>Multi-frequency radio-continuum study of the LMC SNR N206 (Goat's Eye) and its "zig-zag" PWN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new radio-continuum observations of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) supernova remnant (SNR) N206, which we give the name "Goat's Eye". Goat's Eye contains an interior radio structure that is likely a pulsar wind nebula (PWN), which we analyse in further detail. We use new radio observations from the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) telescope, as well as several archival radio observations, to calculate spectral indices, and find a steep spectral index for the whole SNR ($\alpha = -0.60\pm0.02$), and a flatter spectral index for the PWN ($\alpha = -0.16\pm0.03$). We also measure the polarisation and magnetic field properties of the PWN. Previously reported as a linear structure, the new observations show an unusual "zig-zag"-like structure, visible in radio-continuum total intensity, linear polarisation, and magnetic field orientations. The origin of this zig-zag structure is unclear, but we propose some origin scenarios that will require further observations to differentiate between.</description>

      <title>Non-detection of FAST and Parkes follow-up observation for 27 Parkes discovered FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To investigate whether apparently non-repeating Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are truly one-off transients, we conducted systematic follow-up observations of 27 out of 81 non-repeating FRBs identified in the Parkes Transient Database. Using 59.0 hours of data from the Parkes Ultra-Wideband Low (UWL) receiver and 6.3 hours from the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) 19-beam receiver, we searched for repeated bursts from these sources. No additional bursts were detected from any of the 27 FRBs. Combining these non-detections with prior archival observations, we derived stringent upper limits on their repetition rates above 1 Jy under two statistical models: Poisson process constraints range from $\sim10^{-3.5}$ to $10^{-1.9}\,\mathrm{h^{-1}}$, while Weibull process constraints range from $\sim10^{-3.4}$ to $10^{-1.5}\,\mathrm{h^{-1}}$. These limits are approximately an order of magnitude stricter than those reported in previous studies. By applying consistent observational setups and analytical methodologies across all sources, the derived rate limits converge to a narrow, well-defined range. This suggests that these FRBs form a relatively homogeneous population with extremely low intrinsic activity rates.</description>

      <title>Similar Fermi-GBM sGRBs to GW/sGRB 170817A in MeV-GeV energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rate of observed gravitational waves (GWs) from neutron star-neutron star (NS-NS) mergers detected by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO) indicates the existence of more than one short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) similar to GW/sGRB 170817A within the total gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) recorded by satellite detectors such as BATSE, Fermi-Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (Fermi-GBM), and Swift-Burst Alert Telescope (Swift-BAT). We investigated sGRBs in the Fermi-GBM dataset based on their MeV-GeV $\gamma$-ray emission features, to identify sGRBs similar to sGRB 170817A. Any addition of such events can impact the rate of NS-NS CBC events observed by LIGO. SGRB 170817A exhibits two distinct emission components: a non-thermal peak and a thermal component. We adopted a multifaceted approach to identify analogous sGRBs, which involved computing the hardness ratios $HR_{1}$ and $HR_{2}$ and then clustering them via the K-means algorithm. Our further studies reveal the presence of eight such events in Fermi-GBM data, which will enable us to calculate the rate of electromagnetic (EM) counterparts associated with LIGO GW events (GW+sGRB events) across all observing runs. Giving an estimation, by the end of the $O_4$ LIGO run, there could be nearly 5 GW+sGRB events. Deviation from this number may raise concerns about our understanding of the evolution of such events over distance.</description>

      <title>The impact of Solar magnetic field configurations on the production of gamma rays at the Solar disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sun produces a steady signal of high-energy gamma rays through interactions of Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) with its atmosphere. Observations with Fermi-LAT and HAWC have revealed a gamma-ray flux significantly higher than early theoretical predictions, with unexpected temporal and spectral features that suggest a crucial role of the solar magnetic field. In this work, we model GCR-induced gamma-ray emission at the solar disk using the CRPropa framework with realistic hadronic interactions, chromospheric density profiles, and several magnetic field configurations over the solar cycle. This allows us to quantify the gamma-ray emission of the entire solar disk for different phases of the solar activity cycle and we present, for the first time, maps of the production locations of gamma rays on the solar surface. We consider both mono-energetic and realistic power-law injection spectra in a simplified dipole-quadrupole current sheet model and potential-field source surface (PFSS) extrapolations for Carrington rotations during solar maximum and minimum. Our results show that magnetic mirroring and large-scale field topology strongly affect the spectral shape and spatial distribution of the emission, with slightly enhanced fluxes predicted at solar minimum. While our simulated baseline fluxes remain below observations, additional effects, such as heavier nuclei, Parker-field mirroring, and deeper atmospheric interactions, could result in further enhancements of fluxes closer to observational values. Hadronic interactions do not only produce gamma rays but also neutrinos. We estimate the expected neutrino flux from the Sun based on our gamma-ray predictions. We find that the expected flux is slightly below current upper limits from IceCube.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inferences on covariant density functionals from multimessenger astrophysical data: The influences of parametrizations of density dependent couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Covariant density functionals have been successfully applied to the description of finite nuclei and dense nuclear matter. These functionals are often constructed by introducing density dependence into the nucleon-meson couplings, typically through functions that depend only on the vector, i.e., proper baryon density. In this work, we employ a Bayesian framework to investigate how different parametrizations, characterized by distinct functional forms and by their dependencies on vector and scalar densities, affect the properties of dense matter and compact stars. Our analysis demonstrates that although all considered parametrizations yield broadly comparable inferences, the differences in the equation of state and the symmetry energy remain significant at suprasaturation densities, reflecting the sensitivity to the chosen functional form of the density dependence. We find that allowing the nuclear saturation properties in the isoscalar channel, including the skewness coefficient $Q_{sat}$, to be freely adjusted provides adequate flexibility for the current modeling of nuclear and neutron star matter. In contrast, the isovector channel requires further refinement, with freedom extended at least up to the curvature coefficient $K_{sym}$ to capture variations in the symmetry energy and particle composition at high densities. This work advances prior studies by implementing a rational-function parametrization of the density dependence, informed and constrained by multimessenger astrophysical observations.</description>

      <title>Type IIP SN 2024bch: Hydrodynamic model, shock breakout, and circumstellar interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The well-observed type IIP SN 2024bch with the short plateau is shown to be an outcome of the red supergiant explosion with the presupernova mass of 14-15 Msun, the explosion energy of 2x10^{51} erg, and presupernova radius of 1250 Rsun. The early gamma-ray escape demonstrated by the radioactive tail is due to the large Ni-56 extension up to 7400 km/s. The early-time spectral evolution indicates the presence of the circumstellar dense confined envelope with the mass of 0.003-0.006 Msun within 6x10^{14} cm. The deceleration of the outermost ejecta implies the wind with the mass-loss rate of about 6x10^{-4} Msun/yr. The inferred mass-loss rate is by one-two order larger compared to most of type IIP supernovae, but comparable to the wind of type IIL SN 1998S. The asymmetry of the broad H-alpha component on day 144 powered by the circumstellar interaction is the outcome of the Thomson scattering and absorption in the Paschen continuum in the unshocked ejecta.</description>

      <title>From Black Hole to Galaxy: Neural Operator: Framework for Accretion and Feedback Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling how supermassive black holes co-evolve with their host galaxies is notoriously hard because the relevant physics spans nine orders of magnitude in scale-from milliparsecs to megaparsecs--making end-to-end first-principles simulation infeasible. To characterize the feedback from the small scales, existing methods employ a static subgrid scheme or one based on theoretical guesses, which usually struggle to capture the time variability and derive physically faithful results. Neural operators are a class of machine learning models that achieve significant speed-up in simulating complex dynamics. We introduce a neural-operator-based ''subgrid black hole'' that learns the small-scale local dynamics and embeds it within the direct multi-level simulations. Trained on small-domain (general relativistic) magnetohydrodynamic data, the model predicts the unresolved dynamics needed to supply boundary conditions and fluxes at coarser levels across timesteps, enabling stable long-horizon rollouts without hand-crafted closures. Thanks to the great speedup in fine-scale evolution, our approach for the first time captures intrinsic variability in accretion-driven feedback, allowing dynamic coupling between the central black hole and galaxy-scale gas. This work reframes subgrid modeling in computational astrophysics with scale separation and provides a scalable path toward data-driven closures for a broad class of systems with central accretors.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of Stability Criteria for Multi-Fluid Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01640v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a rigorous proof establishing the mathematical equivalence between two independent criteria for the marginal stability of multi-fluid relativistic stars: the dynamical criterion based on the vanishing of the fundamental radial pulsation mode's eigenfrequency, and the static criterion derived from the geometric alignment of mass and particle number gradients in the parameter space. Leveraging this equivalence, we introduce a powerful and computationally efficient framework as an upgraded version of the critical curve method, to systematically map the stability boundaries for multi-fluid mixed stars across the entire parameter space of central pressures. Our analysis, applied to a variety of nuclear and dark matter equations of state, reveals the existence of stable region in the observable mass-radius diagram. By resolving degeneracies with 3-dimensional Mass-Radius-Pressure diagrams, we provide a complete topological view of the ensemble. This work supplies a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting multi-messenger astronomical observations and constraining the properties of dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01641v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Concerning the stability of two-fluid star models, we prove the rigorous equivalence of two independent determining methods for mixed stars, after a brief review of the hybrid star case. Our derivations apply to general multi-fluid cases, and here we take dark matter admixed neutron star models for example, demonstrating a stability boundary distinct from the single-fluid case. Stable configurations form a surface in the three-dimensional parameter space of (either) central pressure, mass, and radius, which yields a group containing stable mixed stars. This group includes twin stars with identical masses and radii but different interior structures. These results can help interpret compact star observations and constrain dark matter properties through astrophysics.</description>

      <title>An outflow from the X-ray corona as the origin of millimeter emission from radio-quiet AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of radio-quiet active galactic nuclei (RQAGN) have shown the presence of millimeter emission, whose origin remains unknown, from within parsec scales of the central black hole. We argue that the mm emission comes from a spatially extended region that is magnetically connected to the compact X-ray corona, in analogy to the solar wind and corona. We present an analytic model scaled to corona values in which non-equipartition electrons from multiple heights along an extended conical outflow shape the mm emission. In this model, the 100 GHz emission originates from within $\lesssim10^4$ gravitational radii ($r_g$) of the central black hole, though the projected distance from the black hole can be as low as $50r_g$ depending on the line-of-sight. Our model predicts a flat emission spectrum $F_{\nu}\sim{\rm const}$ and a mm-to-X-ray luminosity ratio $L_{\rm mm}/L_X\sim10^{-4}$, consistent with observations. These quantities depend weakly on the underlying electron power-law distribution function and black hole mass. We demonstrate this model's plausibility using a general relativistic magneto-hydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulation of a thin accretion disc as a case study. Our model highlights the need to study continual dissipation along the outflow to connect the X-ray- and mm-emitting regions.</description>

      <title>LST-1 follow-up of the exceptionally bright gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On 9 October 2022, the brightest gamma-ray burst (GRB) ever recorded (GRB 221009A) was detected. Its remarkably bright emission, partially due to its close distance to Earth ($z\sim0.15$), makes this GRB a unique event. The outstanding characteristics of GRB 221009A, including the TeV detection by the LHAASO experiment, triggered deep follow-up observations of the source across all wavebands, including very-high-energy gamma rays with the first Large-Sized Telescope (LST-1) of the future Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory. LST-1 observations started about one day after the onset of the prompt emission, under strong moonlight conditions. This resulted in a hint of a signal with a statistical significance of about 4$\sigma$. The monitoring of this source continued until the end of November 2022. This constitutes the deepest observation campaign performed on a GRB with LST-1. Here we show the results of this follow-up campaign.</description>

      <title>Letelier black hole immersed in an electromagnetic universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate a static, spherically symmetric black hole solution surrounded by a cloud of strings and immersed in an electromagnetic universe. By deriving the event horizon from the lapse function, we demonstrate that both the string cloud parameter and the electromagnetic background parameter significantly modify the horizon radius compared to the Schwarzschild case. Consequently, thermodynamic quantities-including the Hawking temperature, Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, and heat capacity-become explicit functions of these additional parameters, with the heat capacity exhibiting divergences that signal phase transitions. We analyze the motion of massive test particles in this spacetime, deriving the effective potential and calculating the innermost stable circular orbit radius, which governs the inner edge of accretion disks and influences orbital stability. Scalar perturbations are examined through the associated effective potential, and quasinormal mode frequencies are computed using the sixth-order WKB approximation; the negative imaginary parts confirm the stability of the black hole under such perturbations. We also study the photon sphere structure, black hole shadow radius, and photon trajectories, showing how the interplay between string clouds and the electromagnetic background shapes the optical properties of this spacetime. Finally, we investigate weak gravitational lensing phenomena by deriving the deflection angle for both massive particles and photons using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem applied to the optical geometry. The results exhibit notable deviations from the Schwarzschild geometry, with the string cloud enhancing the deflection through a $(1-\alpha)^{-1}$ factor while the electromagnetic parameter introduces competing corrections at second order.</description>

      <title>Interstellar Ices as Carriers of Supernova Material to the Early Solar System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary materials show systematic variations in their nucleosynthetic isotope compositions that resonate with orbital distance. The origin of this pattern remains debated, limiting how these isotopic signatures can be used to trace the precursors of terrestrial planets. Here we test the hypothesis that interstellar ices carried supernova-produced nuclides by searching for a supernova nucleosynthetic fingerprint in aqueous alteration minerals from carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous chondrite meteorites. We focus on zirconium, a refractory element that includes the neutron-rich isotope $^{96}$Zr formed in core-collapse supernovae. Leaching experiments reveal extreme $^{96}$Zr enrichments in alteration minerals, showing that they incorporated supernova material hosted in interstellar ices. We show that the Solar System's zirconium isotope variability reflects mixing between these ices and an ice-free rocky component. Finally, the presence of supernova nuclides in a volatile carrier supports models where the Solar System's nucleosynthetic variability was imparted by thermal processing of material in the protoplanetary disk and during planetary accretion.</description>

      <title>Astro-Animation -- How Artists and Scientists Envision the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For several years, students at an art college, working with NASA astronomers, have produced animations inspired by research on black holes, dark matter and more. They can be whimsical or poetic but still constrained by scientific rigour. The animations are used for scientific outreach and are freely available. Our program received a positive assessment through an evaluation we undertook. We are now planning a mobile STEAM exhibition to engage teenagers from underrepresented communities who may not typically consider STE(A)M for their studies. "Science anxiety" has been reported to be a significant barrier to learning. Mixing animation with astronomy can stimulate interest in STEAM, making science engaging in an unconventional way. One component would be activities where participants create artistic responses to astronomy. We undertook a workshop at a local city-run school, specialising in the arts for ages 14-17, to brainstorm the art/science activities. There we gave short scientific presentations leading to art activities: a giant colouring wall with projected celestial phenomena, a stop-motion station, and colouring images of comet 67P to produce an animation. Surveys before and after the activities showed positive responses. The hand of the artist has long been an important concept in animation (Crafton 1991). In a film entitled "The Movements of the Universe", this concept is adapted to the hands of scientists. Combining animation, filmed interviews at NASA (including a Nobel prize winner), and the scientists' hands, bring unexpected feelings of dream and humour to the audience. In this paper we explore three different viewpoints of these activities from a scientist, an animator, and an animation student.</description>

      <title>Green Bean galaxies and the fading echoes of AGN activity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Green Bean is a rare type of galaxy which represents a short-lived phase in the life cycle of active galactic nuclei (AGN), characterised by large-scale, powerful ionised clouds in the circumgalactic medium. Recent studies demonstrate that these extended ionised structures may reflect fading signatures of past AGN activity, often manifested in the form of large-scale ionisation cones. The analysis of their observational properties provides unique constraints on AGN lifetimes, feedback mechanisms, and transitions between radiative and kinetic modes of activity. In this paper we announce the first results of the project dedicated to the long-slit spectroscopic and scanning Fabry-Perot interferometric observations of Green Bean galaxies at the Russian 6-m telescope with SCORPIO-2 multi-mode instrument. We describe the data reduction and spectral fitting procedures that allow one to characterise ionisation conditions in extended gaseous regions of the galaxy SDSSJ095100.54+051026.7.</description>

      <title>Possible quasi-periodic optical oscillations of ZTF blazars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00871</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00871v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Based on the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF), we selected 10 blazars as our sample sources. Among these, we found four blazars (J 0923.5+4125, J 1221.3+3010, J 1503.5+4759, and J 1652.7+4024) showing possible indications of quasi periodic oscillations (QPOs) modulation. We conducted a detailed analysis of their optical light curves (g- and r-bands) over the past five years using the root mean square (RMS)-Flux relation, flux distribution, and QPO detection methods to investigate their variability characteristics. A linear RMS-Flux relation is present in both bands, and their flux distributions follow a log-normal form. This suggests that optical variability may arise from multiplicative, nonlinear processes across different timescales and flux states. Further QPO analysis using the weighted wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), and autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) methods identified candidate periodic signals in four blazars. J 0923.5+4125 (period $\sim$ 205 days) and J 1221.3+3010 ($\sim$ 630 days) show local significances of $\sim 3 \sigma$, whereas J 1503.5+4759 ($\sim$ 38.5 days) and J 1652.7+4024 ($\sim$ 48 days) reach $\sim 4 \sigma$. After accounting for the look-elsewhere effect, the global significances for J 1503.5+4759 in the g- and r-bands are $\sim 2.7 \sigma$, while for J 1652.7+4024 they are approximately $\sim 2.5 \sigma$ in both bands. These two blazars warrant further monitoring and investigation.</description>

      <title>Probing the Scalar Hair of Rotating Horndeski Black Holes through Thick Disk Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.00917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Horizon-scale images of black holes provide a potential probe of fundamental physics, including tests of gravity and black hole hair. To assess the impact of scalar hair on accretion-flow imaging self-consistently, we construct an analytical model of a geometrically thick, magnetized disk around a rotating hairy black hole in Horndeski theory and analyze its 230 GHz image morphology. We find that scalar hair modestly alters the inflow and magnetic-field structure but strengthens gravitational redshift, markedly reducing the total flux and lensed ring brightness through relativistic transfer and spectral-shift effects. Moreover, we highlight a previously unexplored channel: the maximum interferometric diameter of the first photon ring responds strongly to the hair parameter but shows little dependence on accretion-flow details, making it a promising observable for constraining black-hole hair with future space-based interferometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the wideband paradigm of pulsar timing, the time of arrival of a pulsar pulse is measured simultaneously with the corresponding dispersion measure from a frequency-resolved integrated pulse profile. We present a new method for performing wideband measurements that rigorously accounts for measurement noise. We demonstrate this method using observations of PSR J2124$-$3358 made as part of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array experiment using the upgraded Giant Metre-wave Radio Telescope, and show that our method produces more realistic measurement uncertainty estimates compared to the existing wideband measurement method.</description>

      <title>Mass transfer stability for AM CVn binaries with white dwarf donors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Double white dwarf binaries (DWDBs) with Helium components are progenitors to AM CVn binary systems. Their Galactic production rate may be given by the number of stably mass transferring DWDBs in the Milky Way. The theoretical criteria for stable mass transfer in DWDBs is calculated assuming that component white dwarfs are completely cold and degenerate. Respective fractions of surviving AM CVn and DWDB which merge are then calculated by applying this criteria to population synthesis estimates for Galactic DWDB. However, emerging observations of the local DWDB population suggest that Helium white dwarf (He WD) components are typically hot, and only partially degenerate when they begin mass transferring. Using recent numerical simulations of He WD donors in DWDBs, we qualitatively describe a temperature dependent stable mass transfer criteria for Galactic DWDBs. Mass transfer is even more stable than previously thought, or equivalently, DWDB mergers are even rarer. Realistic finite temperature treatments will deepen the dearth in observed AM CVn binaries compared to DWDB merger products.</description>

Abstract: We propose a resonant annihilation as a way to reconcile the WIMP annihilation cross sections in a recently reported gamma ray signal from the Milky Way halo with that for the freeze-out and the upper limit from dwarf galaxies. We perform a simple model-independent analysis based on this hypothesis and determine the required parameters. We also present a simple particle-physics model that can accommodate them.</description>

      <title>No Love for black holes: tightest constraints on tidal Love numbers of black holes from GW250114</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tidal Love numbers of black holes, zero in classical general relativity for Kerr black holes in vacuum, become non-vanishing in the presence of exotic matter or in alternative theories of gravity, making them a powerful probe of fundamental physics. The gravitational-wave event GW250114, observed with an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio, provides a unique opportunity to test this prediction. By analyzing this event, we conclude that the data is consistent with the binary black hole hypothesis, and we place a 90\% upper limit on the effective tidal deformability of $\tilde{\Lambda} &lt; 34.8$. These bounds imply that any environment surrounding the black holes must contribute less than $\sim 7\times 10^{-3}$ of their mass, and they rule out some models of boson stars. Our findings provide the strongest observational constraints yet on black hole tidal deformability and show that the data remain fully consistent with the Kerr black hole prediction of vanishing tidal Love numbers.</description>

      <title>Ab-Initio General-Relativistic Neutrino-Radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations of Long-Lived Neutron Star Merger Remnants to Neutrino Cooling Timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13709v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform the first 3D ab-initio general-relativistic neutrino-radiation hydrodynamics of a long-lived neutron star merger remnant spanning a fraction of its cooling time scale. We find that neutrino cooling becomes the dominant energy loss mechanism after the gravitational-wave dominated phase (${\sim}20\ {\rm ms}$ postmerger). Electron flavor anti-neutrino luminosity dominates over electron flavor neutrino luminosity at early times, resulting in a secular increase of the electron fraction in the outer layers of the remnant. However, the two luminosities become comparable ${\sim}20{-}40\ {\rm ms}$ postmerger. A dense gas of electron anti-neutrinos is formed in the outer core of the remnant at densities ${\sim}10^{14.5}\ {\rm g}\ {\rm cm}^{-3}$, corresponding to temperature hot spots. The neutrinos account for ${\sim}10\%$ of the lepton number in this region. Despite the negative radial temperature gradient, the radial entropy gradient remains positive and the remnant is stably stratified according to the Ledoux criterion for convection. A massive accretion disk is formed from the material squeezed out of the collisional interface between the stars. The disk carries a large fraction of the angular momentum of the system, allowing the remnant massive neutron star to settle to a quasi-steady equilibrium within the region of possible stable rigidly rotating configurations. The remnant is differentially rotating, but it is stable against the magnetorotational instability. Other MHD mechanisms operating on longer timescales are likely responsible for the removal of the differential rotation. Our results indicate the remnant massive neutron star is thus qualitatively different from a protoneutron stars formed in core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <title>Back from the dead: AT2019aalc as a candidate repeating TDE in an AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17419v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. To date, three nuclear transients have been associated with high-energy neutrino events. These transients are generally thought to be powered by tidal disruptions of stars (TDEs) by massive black holes. However, AT2019aalc, hosted in a Seyfert-1 galaxy, was not yet classified due to a lack of multiwavelength observations. Interestingly, the source has re-brightened 4 years after its discovery. Aims. Our aim is to constrain the physical mechanism responsible for the second optical flare, which may also provide clues to the origin of the initial event. Methods. We conducted a multi-wavelength monitoring program (from radio to X-rays) of AT2019aalc during its re-brightening in 2023/2024. Results. The observations revealed multiple X-ray flares during the second optical flaring episode of the transient and a uniquely bright UV counterpart. The second flare, similarly to the first one, is also accompanied by IR dust echo emission. A long-term radio flare is found with an inverted spectrum. Optical spectroscopic observations reveal the presence of Bowen Fluorescence lines and strong high-ionization coronal lines indicating an extreme level of ionization in the system. Conslusions. The results suggest that the transient can be classified as a Bowen Fluorescence Flare (BFF), a relatively new sub-class of flaring active galactic nuclei (AGN). AT2019aalc can be also classified as an extreme coronal line emitter (ECLE). We found that, in addition to AT2019aalc, another BFF AT2021loi is spatially coincident with a high-energy neutrino event. We propose a repeating TDE scenario within an AGN framework to explain the multi-wavelength properties of AT2019aalc and suggest a possible connection among ECLEs, BFFs, and TDEs occurring in AGNs.</description>

      <title>A Leptonic Interpretation of the UHE Gamma-ray Emission from V4641 Sgr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the microquasar V4641 Sgr and its surrounding is detected at TeV-PeV gamma-ray band. Interestingly, the spectrum follows a power-law function continuing up to 0.8 PeV as reported by LHAASO, and the morphology of the emission appears a puzzling elongated structure. In this work, we propose that the elongated UHE emission from V4641 Sgr could originate from the inverse Compton radiation of electrons with a very hard spectrum, which may result from shear acceleration mechanism in the jets driven by V4641 Sgr. We also calculate the corresponding X-ray synchrotron emission from the same electron population, predicting the potential range of non-thermal X-ray flux of the source. The recent observation by XRISM toward the central part of the UHE source could pose a constraint on the model parameters. In the future, a full coverage of the source by sensitive X-ray instrument and high-resolution TeV-PeV gamma-ray instrument may provide a critical test of the model.</description>

      <title>Binary Neutron Star Mergers: Multi-Messenger Systematics and Prospects with Next-Generation Facilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.20258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-messenger astronomy was galvanized by the detection of gravitational waves (GWs) from the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW170817 and electromagnetic (EM) emission from the subsequent kilonova and short gamma ray burst. Maximizing multi-messenger constraints on these systems requires combining models of the progenitors and products of BNS mergers within a single framework. Motivated by GW170817, we create a combined model that relate the progenitor astrophysics of a BNS population with their GW observability and localizability, kilonova light curves, gamma-ray burst afterglow flux, and kilonova remnant evolution. We compute the BNS merger rate by convolving metallicity-dependent star-formation history with population-synthesis predictions, and we sample realistic populations to evaluate their GW and EM observables and joint detection rates. We find that next-generation detectors will typically observe BNS mergers with GW network signal-to-noise ratios of $\sim$ 10 to 20, 90th-percentile sky areas of order $\sim$ 10 deg$^2$, and kilonova $i$-band magnitudes spanning $\sim$ 23 to 33. The variation of the merger rate with respect to the common-envelope efficiency is shown in the GW and EM observables and the resulting multi-messenger detection yield, demonstrating how uncertainties propagate into all stages of joint GW+EM forecasting. Across the models examined, no more than $\sim$ 4% of BNS mergers are detectable simultaneously by a two-Cosmic-Explorer plus one-Einstein-Telescope network and by both Roman (in a $K$-like band) and Rubin ($i$ and $g$ bands). These results show that assumptions underlying the combination of progenitor evolution and source observables will constitute key multi-messenger modeling systematics for inference of astrophysical, nuclear, and fundamental physics from future datasets.</description>

      <title>The New Status Qvo? SN 2021qvo is Another 2003fg-like Type Ia Supernova with a Rising Light-Curve Bump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, multiple Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) have been observed with ''bumps'' in their rising light curves shortly after explosion. Here, we present SN 2021qvo: a SN Ia that exhibits a clear early bump in photometry obtained by the Young Supernova Experiment. Photometric and spectroscopic observations of SN 2021qvo show that it has a broader light curve, higher peak luminosity, shallower Si II $\lambda$5972 pseudo-equivalent width, and lower ejecta velocities than normal SNe Ia, which are all consistent with the characteristics of the 2003fg-like (often called ''super-Chandrasekhar") SN subtype. Including SN 2021qvo, just four known 2003fg-like SNe Ia have sufficient pre-peak data to reveal a rising light-curve bump, and all four have bump detections. Host-galaxy analysis reveals that SN 2021qvo exploded in a low-mass galaxy ${\rm log}(M_{\ast}/M_{\odot}) = 7.83^{+0.17}_{-0.24}$, also consistent with other members of this class. The current leading early-bump 2003fg-like SN Ia progenitor model involves an interaction between the circumstellar material (CSM) and the SN ejecta. We test the validity of this theory by modeling the early bump and subsequent light-curve evolution of SN 2021qvo with the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients. We find that the bump can be modeled with a best-fit CSM mass in the range $M_\mathrm{CSM}=3.31-8.51 \times 10^{-3} M_\odot$. SN 2021qvo adds to the small but growing number of 2003fg-like SNe Ia with rising light-curve bumps; as the number of these SNe Ia with CSM estimates continues to grow, population-level inferences about the CSM distribution will be able to constrain the progenitor scenario for these SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>SN2023syz and SN2025cbj: Two Type IIn Supernovae Associated with IceCube High-energy Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Type IIn supernovae (SNe IIn) are a subclass of core-collapse SNe in which strong interactions occur between the ejecta and dense circumstellar material, creating ideal conditions for the production of high-energy neutrinos. This makes them promising candidate sources of neutrinos. In this work, we conduct an association study between 163 SNe IIn observed by the Zwicky Transient Facility and 138 neutrino alert events detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory. After excluding alerts with poor localization, we find two SNe that are spatiotemporally coincident with neutrino events. IC231027A and IC250421A coincide with the positions of SN2023syz and SN2025cbj, respectively, within their localization uncertainties, and the neutrino arrival times are delayed by 38 days and 61 days relative to the discovery times of the corresponding SNe. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we estimate that the probability of such two coincidences occurring by chance in our sample is $p \sim 0.67\%$, suggesting that they may originate from genuine physical associations, though the result is not yet statistically significant. Our model calculations, however, indicate that the likelihood of a neutrino originating from IC231027A is low, implying that the association between IC231027A and SN2023syz is likely coincidental. Nevertheless, under optimistic parameters, the probability of detecting a neutrino from the whole SNe IIn sample could reach $\gtrsim6\%$, indicating that detecting neutrino emission from the SNe population may be possible. Our study provides a systematic analysis, combining statistical analysis and model calculations, to assess whether interacting supernovae can serve as potential sources of neutrino emission.</description>

      <title>Binary black holes gone MAD: Magnetically arrested minidisks around nonspinning black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate the formation of magnetically arrested minidisks (MAM) around equal-mass, nonspinning binary black holes with magnetohydrodynamic simulations of circumbinary disk accretion in full 3+1 general relativity. The initial separation of $d\sim 30\,M$ allows the black holes to host large minidisks that suppress the total rest-mass accretion rate variability, which is modulated primarily at $\sim 1.6 \, f_{\rm orb}$. Each black hole horizon saturates with dimensionless magnetic flux $\phi \sim 30$. Magnetic reconnection near the horizons drives recurrent eruptions which are expected to drive flaring in the infrared and X-ray bands. Our results establish MAMs as a new outcome of circumbinary disk accretion, and a promising source of novel electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational waves from binary black holes.</description>

      <title>Exploring the connection between compact object mergers and fast X-ray transients: The cases of LXT 240402A &amp; EP250207b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13015v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The connection between compact object mergers and some extragalactic fast X-ray transients (FXRTs) has long been hypothesized, but never ultimately established. In this work, we investigate two FXRTs, the LEIA X-ray Transient LXT 240402A and the Einstein Probe EP250207b, whose precise positions lie close to nearby ($z\!\lesssim\!0.1$) quiescent galaxies with negligible probability of chance coincidence, identifying them as particularly promising cases of merger-driven explosions in the local Universe. We used Chandra to derive accurate localizations for both events and secure otherwise ambiguous associations with their optical counterparts. Deep optical and near-infrared observations with VLT, GTC, and LBT were performed to characterize the surrounding environment and search for kilonova emission, the hallmark of neutron star mergers. Complementary early-time X-ray monitoring with Swift and Einstein Probe was used to constrain the non-thermal afterglow. We find that both FXRTs remain compatible with a compact binary merger progenitor, which produced low-mass ejecta and kilonova emission subdominant to the afterglow. However, alternative explanations such as a distant ($z\!\gtrsim\!1$) core-collapse supernova cannot be conclusively ruled out.</description>

      <title>Formation of millisecond pulsar-helium star binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05075v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: PSR J1928+1815, the first recycled pulsar-helium (He) star binary discovered by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope, consists of a 10.55 ms pulsar and a companion star with mass $1-1.6\,M_{\sun}$ in a 0.15-day orbit. Theoretical studies suggest that this system originated from a neutron star (NS) intermediate-mass or high-mass X-ray binary that underwent common envelope (CE) evolution, leading to the successful ejection of the giant envelope. The traditional view is that hypercritical accretion during the CE phase may have recycled the NS. However, the specific mechanism responsible for accelerating its spin period remains uncertain due to the complex processes involved in CE evolution.In this study, we investigate the influence of Roche lobe overflow (RLO) accretion that takes place prior to the CE phase on the spin evolution of NSs. Our primary objective is to clarify how this process affects the spin characteristics of pulsars. We utilized the stellar evolution code \texttt{MESA} and the binary population synthesis code \texttt{BSE} to model the formation and evolution of NS-He star binaries. We calculated the distributions of the orbital period, He star mass, NS spin period, and magnetic field for NS + He star systems in the Galaxy. Our results indicate that RLO accretion preceding the CE phase could spin up NSs to millisecond periods through super-Eddington accretion. Considering a range of CE efficiencies $\alpha_{\rm CE}$ from 0.3 to 3, we estimate the birthrate (total number) of NS + He star systems in our Galaxy to be 5.2$\times 10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$ (626 systems) to 1.9$\times 10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ (2684 systems).</description>

Abstract: Taking advantage of the most recent measurements by means of high-resolution radio observations and other multiwavelength campaigns, it is possible to elaborate a detailed map of the narrow-line Seyfert 1 Galaxy 1H 0323+342. This map will open the possibility of intriguing hypotheses about the generation of high-energy gamma rays in the narrow-line region.</description>

      <title>Hybrid stars with large quark cores within the parity doublet model and modified NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17859v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the parity doublet model (PDM) for hadronic matter and a modified Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model for quark matter, we investigate the potential existence of two- and three-flavor quark matter in neutron star cores. Both models respect chiral symmetry, and a sharp first-order phase transition is implemented via Maxwell construction. We find stable neutron stars with quark cores within a specific parameter space that satisfies current astronomical observations. Typical neutron stars with masses around $1.4 \ M_\odot$ may possess deconfined quark matter in their centers. The hybrid star scenario with a two-flavor quark core offers enough parameter space to allow the neutron stars with large quark cores exceeding $\sim 1\ M_\odot$, and allow the early deconfinement position before $2\ \rho_0$, where $\rho_0$ is the nuclear saturation density. The observations of gravitational wave event GW170817 suggest a relatively large chiral invariant mass $m_0=600\ \rm MeV$ in the PDM for scenarios involving three-flavor quark matter cores. The maximum mass of the hybrid star with a quark core is found to be approximately $2.2\ M_\odot$ for both two- or three-flavor quark matter in their centers.</description>

      <title>Dipole Polarizability of Finite Nuclei as a Probe of Neutron Stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17143v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nuclear ground state and collective excitation properties provide a means to probe the nuclear matter equation of state and establish connections between observables in finite nuclei and neutron stars. Specifically, the electric dipole polarizability, measured with high precision in various neutron-rich nuclei, serves as a robust constraint on the density dependence of the symmetry energy. In this Letter, we employ a class of relativistic energy density functionals in a twofold process: first, to link the electric dipole polarizability from recent experiments to the slope of the symmetry energy, and second, to translate this information into constraints on the tidal deformability and radii of neutron stars, in connection with multimessenger astrophysical observations from pulsars and binary neutron stars. We provide compelling evidence that the electric dipole polarizability represents a key nuclear observable to probe the neutron-star properties. By significantly reducing the uncertainties in the mass-radius plane, our findings also align with recent multimessenger observations.</description>

      <title>On the Fate of Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20453v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the stability and possible fates of Little Red Dots, under the stellar-only interpretation of their observational features. This is performed by a combination of analyzing the relevant timescales in their stellar dynamics and also, the application of recent numerical results on the evolution of the densest stellar systems. We find that these objects typically have tage ~ tcoll &lt; trelax, therefore, in an unexplored regime never observed before for a stellar system and potentially, highly unstable to runaway collisions. We study different scenarios for the evolution of Little Red Dots and conclude that in a fair fraction of those systems, the formation of a massive black hole by runaway collisions seems unavoidable, in all the possibilities studied within the stellar-only interpretation. This evolutionary path would naturally explain many of the problematic characteristics of Little Red Dots, including that these objects are probably transient in the history of the Universe, that most of them would not emit X-rays since they would not yet have become massive black holes, and once they do, they would constitute a significant portion of the mass of the Little Red Dots. We conclude that Little Red Dots are the most favourable known places to find a recently formed massive black hole seed, or in the process of formation, most probably formed directly in the supermassive range</description>

      <title>MHDuet : a high-order General Relativistic Radiation MHD code for CPU and GPU architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present MHDuet, an open source evolution code for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics with neutrino transport. The code solves the full set of Einstein equations coupled to a relativistic, magnetized fluid with an M1 neutrino radiation scheme using advanced techniques, including adaptive mesh and large eddy simulation techniques, to achieve high accuracy. The Simflowny platform generates the code from a high-level specification of the computational system, producing code that runs with either the SAMRAI or AMReX infrastructure. The choice of AMReX enables compilation and execution on GPUs, running an order of magnitude faster than on CPUs at the node level. We validate the code against benchmark tests, reproducing previous results obtained with the SAMRAI infrastructure, and demonstrate its capabilities with simulations of neutron stars employing realistic tabulated equations of state. Resolution studies clearly demonstrate convergence faster than second order in the grid spacing. Scaling tests reveal excellent strong and weak scaling performance when running on GPUs. The goal of the code is to provide a powerful tool for studying the dynamics of compact objects within multi-messenger astrophysics.</description>
