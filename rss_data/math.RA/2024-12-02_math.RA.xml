      <title>Generating Sets of Stochastic Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of a generating set for stochastic matrices -- a subset of matrices whose repeated composition generates the entire set. Understanding such generating sets requires specifying the "indivisible elements" and "building blocks" within the set, which serve as fundamental components of the generation process. Expanding upon prior studies, we develop a framework that formalizes divisibility in the context of stochastic matrices. We provide a sufficient condition for divisibility that is shown to be necessary in dimension $n=3$, while for $n=2$, all stochastic matrices are shown to be divisible. Using these results, we construct generating sets for dimensions $2$ and $3$ by specifying the indivisible elements, and, importantly, we give an upper bound for the number of factors required from the generating set to produce the entire semigroup.</description>

      <title>Intersection of subspaces in $A^2$ for a three-dimensional division algebra $A$ over a finite field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a three-dimensional nonassociative division algebra over a finite field. Let $A$ act on the space $A^2$ by left multiplication. For a nonzero vector $v$ in $A^2$ we have a three-dimensional subspace $Av$ in $A^2$. This paper concerns about possible dimension of the intersection of $Av$ and $Av'$ for $v, v'$ in $A^2$. One of our results is that there exists a two-dimensional intersection if and only if $A$ is isotopic to a commutative algebra. We use a classical theorem that A is a twisted field of Albert.</description>

      <title>Hopf braces and semi-abelian categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hopf braces have been introduced as a Hopf-theoretic generalization of skew braces. Under the assumption of cocommutativity, these algebraic structures are equivalent to matched pairs of actions on Hopf algebras, that can be used to produce solutions of the quantum Yang-Baxter equation. We prove that the category of cocommutative Hopf braces is semi-abelian and strongly protomodular. In particular, this implies that the main homological lemmas known for groups, Lie algebras and other classical algebraic structures also hold for cocommutative Hopf braces. Abelian objects are commutative and cocommutative Hopf algebras, that form an abelian Birkhoff subcategory of the category of cocommutative Hopf braces. Moreover, we show that the full subcategories of "primitive Hopf braces" and of "skew braces" form an hereditary torsion theory in the category of cocommutative Hopf braces, and that "skew braces" are also a Birkhoff subcategory and a localization of the latter category. Finally, we describe central extensions and commutators for cocommutative Hopf braces.</description>

      <title>Adjointness of generalized Sasaki operations in posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19347v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sasaki projection and its dual were introduced as a mapping from the lattice of closed subspaces of a Hilbert space onto one of its segments. In a previous paper the authors showed that the Sasaki operations induced by the Sasaki projection and its dual form an adjoint pair in every orthomodular lattice. Later on the authors described large classes of algebras in which Sasaki operations can be defined and form an adjoint pair. The aim of the present paper is to extend these investigations to bounded posets with a unary operation. We introduce the so-called generalized Sasaki projection and its dual as well as the so-called generalized Sasaki operations induced by them. When treating these projections and operations we consider only so-called saturated posets, i.e. posets having the property that above any lower bound of two elements there is at least one maximal lower bound and below any upper bound of two elements there is at least one minimal upper bound. We prove that the generalized Sasaki operations are well-defined if and only if the poset in question is orthogonal. We characterize adjointness of the generalized Sasaki operations in different ways and show that adjointness is possible only if the unary operation is a complementation. Finally, we prove that in every saturated orthomodular poset the generalized Sasaki operations form an adjoint pair.</description>

      <title>Polynomial integrable systems from cluster structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing polynomial integrable systems with respect to linearizations of Poisson varieties that admit log-canonical coordinate systems. Our construction is in particular applicable to Poisson varieties with compatible cluster or generalized cluster structures. As examples, we consider an arbitrary standard complex semi-simple Poisson Lie group $G$ with the Berenstein-Fomin-Zelevinsky cluster structure, nilpotent Lie subgroups of $G$ associated to elements of the Weyl group of $G$, identified with Schubert cells in the flag variety of $G$ and equipped with the standard cluster structure (defined by Geiss-Leclerc-Schr\"oer in the simply-laced case), and the dual Poisson Lie group of ${\rm GL}(n, \mathbb C)$ with the Gekhtman-Shapiro-Vainshtein generalized cluster structure. In each of the three cases, we show that every extended cluster in the respective cluster structure gives rise to a polynomial integrable system on the respective Lie algebra with respect to the linearization of the Poisson structure at the identity element. For some of the integrable systems thus obtained, we further show that all their Hamiltonian flows are complete.</description>

      <title>Tropical representations and valuated matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore several facets of tropical subrepresentations of a linear representation of a group over the tropical semifield $\mathbb{T}$. A key role in the study of tropical subrepresentations is played by two types of modules over a semiring: weakly free and quasi-free modules. We also investigate subgroups of $\text{GL}_n(K)$ for $K=\mathbb{T}$, $ \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, and automorphisms of weakly free modules and tropical prevarieties defined by tropical linear equations. As an application of our results, we provide an intrinsic description of tropical subrepresentation via certain quasi-free modules, and prove that a tropical subrepresentation is equivalent to a valuated matroidal representation.</description>

      <title>Contraderived categories of CDG-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07021v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For any CDG-ring $B^\bullet=(B^*,d,h)$, we show that the homotopy category of graded-projective (left) CDG-modules over $B^\bullet$ is equivalent to the quotient category of the homotopy of graded-flat CDG-modules by its full triangulated subcategory of flat CDG-modules. The contraderived category (in the sense of Becker) $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bctr}}(B^\bullet{-}\mathbf{Mod})$ is the common name for these two triangulated categories. We also prove that the classes of cotorsion and graded-cotorsion CDG-modules coincide, and the contraderived category of CDG-modules is equivalent to the homotopy category of graded-flat graded-cotorsion CDG-modules. Assuming the graded ring $B^*$ to be graded right coherent, we show that the contraderived category $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bctr}}(B^\bullet{-}\mathbf{Mod})$ is compactly generated and its full subcategory of compact objects is anti-equivalent to the full subcategory of compact objects in the coderived category of right CDG-modules $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{bco}}(\mathbf{Mod}{-}B^\bullet)$. Specifically, the latter triangulated category is the idempotent completion of the absolute derived category of finitely presented right CDG-modules $\mathsf D^{\mathsf{abs}}(\mathbf{mod}{-}B^\bullet)$.</description>

      <title>Affine subspaces of matrices with rank in a range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of finding the maximal dimension of linear or affine subspaces of matrices whose rank is constant, or bounded below, or bounded above, has attracted many mathematicians from the sixties to the present day. The problem has caught also the attention of algebraic geometers since vector spaces of matrices of constant rank $r$ give rise to vector bundle maps whose images are vector bundles of rank $r$. Moreover there is a link with the so called ``rank metric codes'', since a constant rank $r$ subspace of $K^{n \times n}$ can be viewed as a constant weight $r$ rank metric code; it can be interesting to study also the maximal dimension of the subspaces of $K^{n \times n}$ whose elements have rank in a range $[s,r]$, since such subspaces obviously give rank metric codes with weights in $[s,r]$. In this paper, with the main purpose to get an organic result including the ones on spaces of matrices with constant rank, the ones on spaces of matrices with rank bounded below and the ones on spaces of matrices with rank bounded above and to generalize a previous result on real matrices with constant rank to matrices on a more general field, we study the maximal dimension of affine subspaces of matrices whose rank is between two numbers under mild assumptions on the field. We get also a result on antisymmetric matrices and on matrices in row echelon form.</description>

      <title>The Algebraic and Geometric Classification of Compatible Pre-Lie Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10947v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a method to obtain the algebraic classification of compatible pre-Lie algebras from the classification of pre-Lie algebras of the same dimension. We use this method to obtain the algebraic classification of complex 2-dimensional compatible pre-Lie algebras. As a byproduct, we obtain the classification of complex 2-dimensional compatible commutative associative, compatible associative and compatible Novikov algebras. In addition, we consider the geometric classification of varieties of cited algebras, that is the description of its irreducible components.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02670v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study $\mathcal{O}$-operators and post-Lie products over the same Lie algebra compatible in a certain sense. We prove that the group product corresponding to the formal integration of the Lie algebra, which is adjacent to the sum of two compatible post-Lie products, can be factorized in a way reminiscent of the classical Semenov-Tian-Shanskii factorization. In the second part, we explore applications in non-commutative probability. We introduce new transforms that facilitate the computation of conditionally free and conditionally monotone multiplicative convolutions involving operator-valued non-commutative distributions.</description>

      <title>Double extension of flat pseudo-Riemannian $F$-Lie algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02130v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We define the concept of a flat pseudo-Riemannian $F$-Lie algebra and construct its corresponding double extension. This algebraic structure can be interpreted as the infinitesimal analogue of a Frobenius Lie group devoid of Euler vector fields. We show that the double extension provides a framework for generating all weakly flat Lorentzian non-abelian bi-nilpotent $F$-Lie algebras possessing one dimensional light-cone subspaces. A similar result can be established for nilpotent Lie algebras equipped with flat scalar products of signature $(2,n-2)$ where $n\geq 4$. Furthermore, we use this technique to construct Poisson algebras exhibiting compatibility with flat scalar products.</description>
