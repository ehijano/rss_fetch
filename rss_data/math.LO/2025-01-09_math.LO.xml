      <title>$G$-systems and 4E Cognitive Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a class dynamical systems called $G$-systems equipped with a coupling operation. We use $G$-systems to define the notions of dependence (borrowed from dependence logic) and causality (borrowed from Pearl) for dynamical systems. As a converse to coupling we define decomposition or ``reducibility''. We give a characterization of reducibility in terms of the dependence "atom". We do all this with the motivation of developing mathematical foundations for 4E cognitive science, see introductory sections.</description>

      <title>On Conway's Numbers and Games, the Von Neumann Universe, and Pure Set Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04412v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We take up Dedekind's question ''Was sind und was sollen die Zahlen?'' (''What are numbers, and would should they be?''), with the aim to describe the place that Conway's (Surreal) Numbers and Games take, or deserve to take, in the whole of mathematics. Rather than just reviewing the work of Conway, and subsequent one by Gonshor, Alling, Ehrlich, and others, we propose a new setting which puts the theory of surreal numbers onto the firm ground of ''pure'' set theory. This approach is closely related to Gonshor's one by ''sign expansions'', but appears to be significantly simpler and clearer, and hopefully may contribute to realizing that ''surreal'' numbers are by no means surrealistic, goofy or wacky. They could, and probably should, play a central role in mathematics. We discuss the interplay between the various approaches to surreal numbers, and analyze the link with Conway's original approach via Combinatorial Game Theory (CGT). To clarify this, we propose to call pure set theory the algebraic theory of pure sets, or in other terms, of the algebraic structures of the von Neumann universe. This topic may be interesting in its own right: it puts CGT into a broad context which has a strong ''quantum flavor'', and where Conway's numbers (as well as their analogue, the nimbers) arise naturally.</description>

      <title>Categories of orthosets and adjointable maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An orthoset is a non-empty set together with a symmetric and irreflexive binary relation $\perp$, called the orthogonality relation. An orthoset with 0 is an orthoset augmented with an additional element 0, called falsity, which is orthogonal to every element. The collection of subspaces of a Hilbert space that are spanned by a single vector provides a motivating example.
  We say that a map $f \colon X \to Y$ between orthosets with 0 possesses the adjoint $g \colon Y \to X$ if, for any $x \in X$ and $y \in Y$, $f(x) \perp y$ if and only if $x \perp g(y)$. We call $f$ in this case adjointable. For instance, any bounded linear map between Hilbert spaces induces a map with this property. We discuss in this paper adjointability from several perspectives and we put a particular focus on maps preserving the orthogonality relation.
  We moreover investigate the category OS of all orthosets with 0 and adjointable maps between them. We especially focus on the full subcategory iOS of irredundant orthosets with 0. iOS can be made into a dagger category, the dagger of a morphism being its unique adjoint. iOS contains dagger subcategories of various sorts and provides in particular a framework for the investigation of projective Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Bass modules and embeddings into free modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the free module of infinite rank $R^{(\kappa)}$ purely embeds every $\kappa$-generated flat left $R$-module iff $R$ is left perfect. Using a Bass module corresponding to a descending chain of principal right ideals, we construct a model of the theory $T$ of $R^{(\kappa)}$ whose projectivity is equivalent to left perfectness, which allows to add a `stronger' equivalent condition: $R^{(\kappa)}$ purely embeds every $\kappa$-generated flat left $R$-module which is a model of $T$.
  We extend the model-theoretic construction of this Bass module to arbitrary descending chains of pp formulas, resulting in a `Bass theory' of pure-projective modules. We put this new theory to use by, among other things, reproving an old result of Daniel Simson about pure-semisimple rings and Mittag-Leffler modules.
  This paper is a condensed version, solely about modules, of our larger work arXiv:2407.15864, with two new results added about cyclically presented modules (Cor.14) and finitely presented cyclic modules (Rem.15).</description>

      <title>Computability of Brjuno-like functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his seminal paper from 1936, Alan Turing introduced the concept of non-computable real numbers and presented examples based on the algorithmically unsolvable Halting problem. We describe a different, analytically natural mechanism for the appearance of non-computability. Namely, we show that additive sampling of orbits of certain skew products over expanding dynamics produces Turing non-computable reals. We apply this framework to Brjuno-type functions to demonstrate that they realize bijections between computable and lower-computable numbers, generalizing previous results of M. Braverman and the second author for the Yoccoz-Brjuno function to a wide class of examples, including Wilton's functions and generalized Brjuno functions.</description>

      <title>Matroid intersection and packing/covering conjectures are true in the class of finitary matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given two finite matroids on the same ground set, a celebrated result of Edmonds says that the ground set can be partitioned into two disjoint subsets in a manner that there is a common independent set in both matroids whose intersection with the first subset spans that subset in the first matroid, and whose intersection with the second subset spans that subset in the second matroid.
  There is a longstanding conjecture regarding the situation of two matroids defined on the same infinite ground set. Infinite matroids were only recently axiomatized in the early 2010s in the work of Bruhn et al., while the conjecture had been proposed during the 1990s for the class of structures that are now called finitary matroids, which are matroids all of whose circuits are finite sets.
  The packing/covering conjecture, due to Bowler and Carmesin, is a related conjecture in the sense that it is true in the class of all matroids if and only if the matroid intersection conjecture is true in the class of all matroids. Given any family of matroids on the same ground set, the conjecture asks if it is possible to partition the ground set into two disjoint subsets in a way such that the corresponding family of matroids restricted to the first subset admits a packing while the family of matroids contracted to the second subset admits a covering.
  We prove both of these conjectures in the class of finitary matroids. Our main tool is nonstandard analysis, specifically the technique of iterated nonstandard extensions. Roughly, we first embed any infinite matroid inside a hyperfinite matroid defined on a subset of the nonstandard extension of the original ground set, and we iteratively nonstandardly extend the hyperfinite structure again in order to prove results in the internal universe that can be directly transferred to obtain results about the matroid(s) we started with.</description>

      <title>Sufficient conditions for local tabularity of a polymodal logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.07213v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: On relational structures and on polymodal logics, we describe operations which preserve local tabularity. This provides new sufficient semantic and axiomatic conditions for local tabularity of a modal logic. The main results are the following.
  We show that local tabularity does not depend on reflexivity. Namely, given a class $\mathcal{F}$ of frames, consider the class $\mathcal{F}^\mathrm{r}$ of frames, where the reflexive closure operation was applied to each relation in every frame in $\mathcal{F}$. We show that if the logic of $\mathcal{F}^\mathrm{r}$ is locally tabular, then the logic of $\mathcal{F}$ is locally tabular as well.
  Then we consider the operation of sum on Kripke frames, where a family of frames-summands is indexed by elements of another frame. We show that if both the logic of indices and the logic of summands are locally tabular, then the logic of corresponding sums is also locally tabular.
  Finally, using the previous theorem, we describe an operation on logics that preserves local tabularity: we provide a set of formulas such that the extension of the fusion of two canonical locally tabular logics with these formulas is locally tabular.</description>

      <title>E-ideals in exponential polynomial ring</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.14347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate exponential ideals within the context of exponential polynomial rings over exponential fields. We establish two distinct notions of maximality for exponential ideals and explore their relationship to primeness.
  These three concepts--prime, maximal, and E-maximal--are shown to be independent, in contrast to the classical scenario. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, over an algebraically closed field K, the correspondence between points of $K^n$ and maximal exponential ideals of the ring of exponential polynomials breaks down. Finally, we introduce and characterize exponential radical ideals.
  We investigate exponential ideals in the exponential polynomial ring over an exponential field. We study two notions of maximality for exponential ideals, and relate them to primeness. These three notions are independent, unlike in the classical case. We also show that over an algebraically closed field K the correspondence between points of K^n and maximal ideals of the ring of exponential polynomials does not hold.</description>

      <title>Two-layered logics for probabilities and belief functions over Belnap--Dunn logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12953v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is an extended version of an earlier submission to WoLLIC 2023. We discuss two-layered logics formalising reasoning with probabilities and belief functions that combine the Lukasiewicz $[0,1]$-valued logic with Baaz $\triangle$ operator and the Belnap--Dunn logic. We consider two probabilistic logics that present two perspectives on the probabilities in the Belnap--Dunn logic: $\pm$-probabilities and $\mathbf{4}$-probabilities. In the first case, every event $\phi$ has independent positive and negative measures that denote the likelihoods of $\phi$ and $\neg\phi$, respectively. In the second case, the measures of the events are treated as partitions of the sample into four exhaustive and mutually exclusive parts corresponding to pure belief, pure disbelief, conflict and uncertainty of an agent in $\phi$. In addition to that, we discuss two logics for the paraconsistent reasoning with belief and plausibility functions. They equip events with two measures (positive and negative) with their main difference being whether the negative measure of $\phi$ is defined as the belief in $\neg\phi$ or treated independently as the plausibility of $\neg\phi$. We provide a sound and complete Hilbert-style axiomatisation of the logic of $\mathbf{4}$-probabilities and establish faithful translations between it and the logic of $\pm$-probabilities. We also show that the satisfiability problem in all logics is $\mathsf{NP}$-complete.</description>

      <title>Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, Maximum Deconstructibility, and torsion classes generated by groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deconstructibility is an often-used sufficient condition on a class $\mathcal{C}$ of modules that allows one to carry out homological algebra \emph{relative to $\mathcal{C}$}. The principle \textbf{Maximum Deconstructibility (MD)} asserts that a certain necessary condition for a class to be deconstructible is also sufficient. MD implies, for example, that the classes of Gorenstein Projective modules, Ding Projective modules, their relativized variants, and all torsion classes are deconstructible over any ring. MD was known to follow from Vop\v{e}nka's Principle and imply the existence of an $\omega_1$-strongly compact cardinal. We prove that MD is equivalent to Vop\v{e}nka's Principle, and to the assertion that each torsion class of abelian groups is generated by a single group within the class (yielding the converse of a theorem of G\"obel and Shelah).</description>
