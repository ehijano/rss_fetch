      <title>Thermal Inverse design for resistive micro-heaters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an inverse design scheme for resistive heaters. By adjusting the spatial distribution of a binary electrical resistivity map, the scheme enables objective-driven optimization of heaters to achieve pre-defined steady-state temperature profiles. The approach can be fully automated and is computationally efficient since it does not entail extensive iterative simulations of the entire heater structure. The design scheme offers a powerful solution for resistive heater device engineering in applications spanning electronics, photonics, and microelectromechanical systems.</description>

      <title>Multipath Signal-Selective Metasurface: Passive Time-Varying Interlocking Mechanism to Vary Spatial Impedance for Signals with the Same Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic (EM) multipath interference is difficult to address with passive approaches due to two physical restrictions - the shared frequency of the initial and interfering signals and their variable incident angles. Thus, to address multipath interference, the spatial impedance must be adjusted in response to the incident angles of multiple signals with the same frequency, which is impossible with classic linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. We present a design concept for metasurface-based spatial filters to overcome LTI behavior and suppress multipath interference signals using a time-varying interlocking mechanism without any active biasing systems. The proposed devices are coupled to the first incoming wave to adjust the spatial impedance and suppress delayed waves in the time domain, which is validated numerically and experimentally. This study opens a new avenue for passive yet time-varying selective EM metasystems, enabling the adjustment of spatially complicated EM waves and fields even at the same frequency.</description>

      <title>A design of magnetic tunnel junctions for the deployment of neuromorphic hardware for edge computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrically readable complex dynamics of robust and scalable magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) offer promising opportunities for advancing neuromorphic computing. In this work, we present an MTJ design with a free layer and two polarizers capable of computing the sigmoidal activation function and its gradient at the device level. This design enables both feedforward and backpropagation computations within a single device, extending neuromorphic computing frameworks previously explored in the literature by introducing the ability to perform backpropagation directly in hardware. Our algorithm implementation reveals two key findings: (i) the small discrepancies between the MTJ-generated curves and the exact software-generated curves have a negligible impact on the performance of the backpropagation algorithm, (ii) the device implementation is highly robust to inter-device variation and noise, and (iii) the proposed method effectively supports transfer learning and knowledge distillation. To demonstrate this, we evaluated the performance of an edge computing network using weights from a software-trained model implemented with our MTJ design. The results show a minimal loss of accuracy of only 0.1% for the Fashion MNIST dataset and 2% for the CIFAR-100 dataset compared to the original software implementation. These results highlight the potential of our MTJ design for compact, hardware-based neural networks in edge computing applications, particularly for transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Plasticity-induced crack closure identification during fatigue crack growth in AA2024-T3 by using high-resolution digital image correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02560v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fatigue crack growth in ductile materials is primarily driven by the interaction between damaging and shielding mechanisms. In the Paris regime, the predominant mechanism for retardation is plasticity-induced crack closure (PICC). However, some of the mechanisms behind this phenomenon are still unclear. Identifying and separating the three-dimensional aspect from other shielding aspects during experiments is extremely complex. In this paper, we analyze the crack opening kinematics based on local crack opening displacement measurements in both 2D high-resolution digital image correlation data and 3D finite element simulations. The results confirm that the crack opening stress intensity factor Kop differs along the crack path. We present a new method to determine Kop at the crack front allowing us to identify PICC as the predominant shielding mechanism in fatigue crack growth experiments. Furthermore, this work contributes to the discussion on the damage-reducing effect of PICC, since we find that the influence on fatigue damage in the plastic zone remains negligible when the crack is closed and crack surface contact is directed towards the surface.</description>

      <title>Frequency-domain Parallel Computing Using Single On-Chip Nonlinear Acoustic-wave Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiply-accumulation (MAC) is a crucial computing operation in signal processing, numerical simulations, and machine learning. This work presents a scalable, programmable, frequency-domain parallel computing leveraging gigahertz (GHz)-frequency acoustic-wave nonlinearities. By encoding data in the frequency domain, a single nonlinear acoustic-wave device can perform a billion arithmetic operations simultaneously. A single device with a footprint of 0.03 mm$^2$ on lithium niobate (LN) achieves 0.0144 tera floating-point operations per second (TFLOPS), leading to a computing area density of 0.48 TFLOPS/mm$^2$ and a core power efficiency of 0.14 TFLOPS/Watt. As applications, we demonstrate multiplications of two 16-by-16 matrices and convolutional imaging processing of 128-by-128-pixel photos. Our technology could find versatile applications in near-sensor signal processing and edge computing.</description>

      <title>Ventilated noise-insulating metamaterials inspired by sonic black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02731v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Acoustic black holes represent a special class of metastructures allowing efficient absorption based on the slow sound principle. The decrease of the wave speed is associated with the spatial variation of acoustic impedance, while the absorption properties are linked to thermoviscous losses induced by the local resonances of the structure. While most of the developments in the field of sonic black holes are dedicated to one-dimensional structures, the current study is concerned with their two-dimensional counterparts. It is shown that the change of the dimensionality results in the change of noise insulation mechanism, which relies on the opening of band-gaps rather then thermoviscous losses. The formation of band-gaps is associated with the strong coupling between the resonators constituting the considered structures. Numerically and experimentally it is shown than the structure is characterized by broad stop-bands in transmission spectra, while the air flow propagation is still allowed. In particular, a realistic application scenario is considered, in which the acoustic noise and the air flow are generated by a fan embedded into a ventilation duct. The obtained results pave the way towards the development of next-level ventilated metamaterials for efficient noise control.</description>

      <title>Green's Function Approach to Model Vibrations of Beams with Spatiotemporally Modulated Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The forced time harmonic response of a spatiotemporally-modulated elastic beam of finite length with light damping is derived using a novel Green's function approach. Closed-form solutions are found that highlight unique mode coupling effects that are induced by spatiotemporal modulation, such as split resonances that are tunable with the modulation parameters. These effects of order unity are caused by spatiotemporal modulation with small amplitude appropriately scaled to the magnitude of the light damping. The scalings identified here between the modulation amplitude, the damping, and the inner range of frequency near the modified resonances, translate over to more complicated and higher dimensional elastic systems.</description>

      <title>Silicon Nitride Photonic Waveguide-Based Young's Interferometer for Molecular Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Devices based on photonic integrated circuits play a crucial role in the development of low-cost, high-performance, industry-scale manufacturable sensors. We report the design, fabrication, and application of a silicon nitride waveguide-based integrated photonic sensor in Young's interferometer configuration combined with Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor (CMOS) imaging detection. We use a finite-difference time-domain method to analyze the performance of the sensor device and optimize the sensitivity of the fundamental transverse-electric (TE) mode. We develop a low-cost fabrication method for the photonic sensor chip, using photolithography-compatible dimensions, and produce the sensing region with wet-etching of silicon dioxide. We demonstrate the sensor's functioning by measuring the optical phase shift with glucose concentration in an aqueous solution. We obtain consistent interference patterns with fringe visibility exceeding 0.75 and measure the phase differences for glucose concentrations in the 10 ug/ml order, corresponding to the order of 10^7 molecules in the sensing volume. We envision extending this work to functionalized surface sensors based on molecular binding. Our work will impact biosensing applications and, more generally, the fabrication of interferometric-based photonic devices.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectricity at a gallium-mercury liquid metal interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present experimental evidence of a thermoelectric effect at the interface between two liquid metals. Using superimposed layers of mercury and gallium in a cylindrical vessel operating at room temperature, we provide a direct measurement of the electric current generated by the presence of a thermal gradient along a liquid-liquid interface. At the interface between two liquids, temperature gradients induced by thermal convection lead to a complex geometry of electric currents, ultimately generating current densities near boundaries that are significantly higher than those observed in conventional solid-state thermoelectricity. When a magnetic field is applied to the experiment, an azimuthal shear flow, exhibiting opposite circulation in each layer, is generated. Depending on the value of the magnetic field, two different flow regimes are identified, in good agreement with a model based on the spatial distribution of thermoelectric currents, which has no equivalent in solid systems. Finally, we discuss various applications of this new effect, such as the efficiency of liquid metal batteries.</description>

      <title>Low-characteristic-impedance superconducting tadpole resonators in the sub-gigahertz regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02558v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a simple and versatile resonator design based on a short strip of a typical coplanar waveguide shorted at one end to the ground and shunted at the other end with a large parallel-plate capacitor. Due to the shape of the structure, we coin it the tadpole resonator. The design allows tailoring the characteristic impedance of the resonator to especially suit applications requiring low values. We demonstrate characteristic impedances ranging from $Z_c = 2\,{\Omega}$ to $10\,{\Omega}$ and a frequency range from $f_0 = 290\,\mathrm{MHz}$ to $1.1\,\mathrm{GHz}$ while reaching internal quality factors of order $Q_{\mathrm{int}} = 8.5\times 10^3$ translating into a loss tangent of $\tan({\delta}) = 1.2\times 10^{-4}$ for the aluminium oxide used as the dielectric in the parallel plate capacitor. We conclude that these tadpole resonators are well suited for applications requiring low frequency and low charactersitic impedance while maintaining a small footprint on chip. The low characteristic impedance of the tadpole resonator renders it a promising candidate for achieving strong inductive coupling to other microwave components.</description>

      <title>Fibration symmetry-breaking supports functional transitions in a brain network engaged in language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02674v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In his book 'A Beautiful Question', physicist Frank Wilczek argues that symmetry is 'nature's deep design,' governing the behavior of the universe, from the smallest particles to the largest structures. While symmetry is a cornerstone of physics, it has not yet been found widespread applicability to describe biological systems, particularly the human brain. In this context, we study the human brain network engaged in language and explore the relationship between the structural connectivity (connectome or structural network) and the emergent synchronization of the mesoscopic regions of interest (functional network). We explain this relationship through a different kind of symmetry than physical symmetry, derived from the categorical notion of Grothendieck fibrations. This introduces a new understanding of the human brain by proposing a local symmetry theory of the connectome, which accounts for how the structure of the brain's network determines its coherent activity. Among the allowed patterns of structural connectivity, synchronization elicits different symmetry subsets according to the functional engagement of the brain. We show that the resting state is a particular realization of the cerebral synchronization pattern characterized by a fibration symmetry that is broken in the transition from rest to language. Our findings suggest that the brain's network symmetry at the local level determines its coherent function, and we can understand this relationship from theoretical principles.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and synchronization from whole-neural activity in {\it C. elegans} connectome: Integration of functional and structural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical behavior of complex systems from their underlying network architectures is a long-standing question in complexity theory. Therefore, many metrics have been devised to extract network features like motifs, centrality, and modularity measures. It has previously been proposed that network symmetries are of particular importance since they are expected to underly the synchronization of a system's units, which is ubiquitously observed in nervous system activity patterns. However, perfectly symmetrical structures are difficult to assess in noisy measurements of biological systems, like neuronal connectomes. Here, we devise a principled method to infer network symmetries from combined connectome and neuronal activity data. Using nervous system-wide population activity recordings of the \textit{C.elegans} backward locomotor system, we infer structures in the connectome called fibration symmetries, which can explain which group of neurons synchronize their activity. Our analysis suggests functional building blocks in the animal's motor periphery, providing new testable hypotheses on how descending interneuron circuits communicate with the motor periphery to control behavior. Our approach opens a new door to exploring the structure-function relations in other complex systems, like the nervous systems of larger animals.</description>

      <title>Electrical control of topological 3Q state in an intercalated van der Waals antiferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02710v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets have opened a new avenue of novel opportunities covering various interesting phases. Co1/3TaS2-an intercalated metallic vdW antiferromagnet-is one of the latest important additions to the growing list of materials due to its unique triple-Q (3Q) ground state possessing topological characteristics. Careful bulk characterisations have shown the ground state of CoxTaS2 to be a rare 3Q tetrahedral structure for x less than 1/3. The uniqueness of this ground state arises from the dense real-space Berry curvature due to scalar spin chirality, giving rise to a noticeable anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we demonstrate that we can control this topological phase via gating. Using three kinds of CoxTaS2 devices with different Co compositions, we have established that we can cover the whole 3Q topological phase with ionic gating. This work reports a rare demonstration of electrical gating control of layered antiferromagnetic metal. More importantly, our work constitutes one of the first examples of the electrical control of the scalar spin chirality using antiferromagnetic metal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02713v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new thermodynamic limit for the open circuit voltage of solar cells that includes thermalization is obtained in terms of photon entropy. A simple graphical construction makes it possible to link this limit to the existing limits for single junction cells due to Trivich and Flinn, Shockley and Queisser and W\"urfel, and the thermodynamic Carnot-type limit for hot-carrier solar cell. At the fundamental level, this limit points to similarity between photovoltaic and thermoelectric energy conversion.</description>

Abstract: High-quality (Q)-factor optical resonators with extreme temporal coherence are of both technological and fundamental importance in optical metrology, continuous-wave lasing, and semiconductor quantum optics. Despite extensive efforts in designing high-Q resonators across different spectral regimes, the experimental realization of very large Q-factors at visible wavelengths remains challenging due to the small feature size that is sensitive to fabrication imperfections, and thus is typically implemented in integrated photonics. In the pursuit of free-space optics with the benefits of large space-bandwidth product and massive parallel operations, here we design and fabricate a visible-wavelength etch-free metasurface with minimized fabrication defects and experimentally demonstrate a million-scale ultrahigh-Q resonance. A new laser-scanning momentum-space-resolved spectroscopy technique with extremely high spectral and angular resolution is developed to characterize the record-high Q-factor as well as the dispersion of the million-Q resonance in free space. By integrating monolayer WSe2 into our ultrahigh-Q meta-resonator, we further demonstrate laser-like highly unidirectional and narrow-linewidth exciton emission, albeit without any operating power density threshold. Under continuous-wave laser pumping, we observe pump-power-dependent linewidth narrowing at room temperature, indicating the potential of our meta-optics platform in controlling coherent quantum light-sources. Our result also holds great promise for applications like optical sensing, spectral filtering, and few-photon nonlinear optics.</description>

      <title>Blochnium-Based Josephson Junction Parametric Amplifiers: Superior Tunability and Linearity</title>

Abstract: The weak quantum signal amplification is an essential task in quantum computing. In this study, a recently introduced structure of Josephson junctions array called Blochnium (N series Quarton structure) is utilized as a parametric amplifier. We begin by theoretical deriving the system's Lagrangian, quantum Hamiltonian, and then analyze the dynamics using the quantum Langevin equation. By transforming these equations into the Fourier domain and employing the input-output formalism, leading metric indicators of the parametric amplifier become calculated. The new proposed design offers significant advantages over traditional designs due to its ability to manipulate nonlinearity. This premier feature enhances the compression point (P1dB) of the amplifier dramatically, and also provides its tunability across a broad band. The enhanced linearity, essential for quantum applications, is achieved through effective nonlinearity management, which is theoretically derived. Also, the ability to sweep the C-band without significant spectral overlap is crucial for frequency multiplexing in scalable quantum systems. Simulation results show that Blochnium parametric amplifiers can reach to a signal gain around 25 dB with a compression point better than of -92 dBm. Therefore, our proposed parametric amplifier, with its superior degree of freedom, surpasses traditional designs like arrays of Josephson junctions, making it a highly promising candidate for advanced quantum computing applications.</description>

      <title>pH-Sensitive Ultra-thin Oxide-Liquid Metal System: Understanding the Fundamental Sensing Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09843</link>

Abstract: The pH response of liquid metal (eutectic GaInSn) in the form of a pendant drop is investigated and the sensitivity of 92.96 mV in the pH range from 4 to 10 is obtained. Unlike the fundamental limit of pH sensitivity of 59.1 mV in an electrolyte-site binding surface, the super-Nernstian pH sensitivity originated from a spontaneous electrochemical reaction associated with an enhanced ionic exchange at the ultra-thin (1-3 nm) Ga2O3-electrolyte interface which is purely driven by thermodynamics, rendering to the lowest system energy possible involving gallate and bi-gallate ions. A unified Nernst equation is derived by introducing an ion-exchange factor x to explain superNernstian pH sensitivity and found a direct link between pH sensitivity and Pourbaix pH-Potential formulations. It is found that Nernstian sensitivity of 59.1 mV occurs only for symmetric ion exchange (x=1) reaction, whereas asymmetric ion exchanges could result in sensitivity far beyond the Nernst sensitivity. Our findings have great scientific significance, which could redefine the conventional concept of the ion sensing mechanism in a solid-state electrochemical sensor and push forward the future development of the 2D oxide-based electrochemical sensor.</description>

      <title>Tandem Photovoltaics from 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenides on Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10470v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The demand for high-efficiency photovoltaic systems necessitates innovations that transcend the efficiency limitations of single-junction solar cells. This study investigates a tandem photovoltaic architecture comprising a top-cell with a transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) superlattice absorber and a bottom-cell of crystalline silicon (c-Si), focusing on optimizing the light absorption and electrical performance of the combined structure. Through the transfer matrix method and electrical simulations, we optimized the geometry of the superlattice, determining that a siz-layer MoSe2 configuration with a 40 nm SiO2 antireflective layer maximizes photon absorption while mitigating additional weight and preserving the cell's structural integrity. The results show that the optimized TMDC superlattice significantly improves the PCE of the tandem design to 28.96%, and increase of 5.68% over the original single-junction c-Si solar cell's efficiency. This advancement illustrates the potential of TMDC material in next-generation solar cells and presents a promising avenue for the development of highly efficient, tandem photovoltaic systems via van der Waals integration of the top cell on c-Si</description>
