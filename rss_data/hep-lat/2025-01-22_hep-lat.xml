      <title>Analyzing the Higgs-confinement transition with non-local operators on the lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study non-local operators for analyzing the Higgs-confinement phase transition in lattice gauge theory. Since the nature of the Higgs-confinement phase transition is topological, its order parameter is the expectation value of non-local operators, such as loop and surface operators. There exist several candidates for the non-local operators. Adopting the charge-2 Abelian Higgs model, we test numerical simulation of conventional ones, the Polyakov loop and the 't Hooft loop, and an unconventional one, the Aharonov-Bohm phase defined by the Wilson loop wrapping around a vortex line.</description>

      <title>Staggered Fermions with Chiral Anomaly Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the implications of the quantized vectorial and axial charges in the lattice Hamiltonian of multi-flavor staggered fermions in $(1+1)$ dimensions. These lattice charges coincide with those of the $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$ global symmetries of Dirac fermions in the continuum limit, whose perturbative chiral anomaly matches the non-Abelian Onsager algebra on the lattice. In this note, we focus on the lattice models that flow to continuum quantum field theories of Dirac fermions that are free from the perturbative chiral anomaly between $U(1)_V$ and $U(1)_A$. In a lattice model that flows to two Dirac fermions, we identify quadratic Hamiltonian deformations that can gap the system while fully preserving both the vectorial and axial charges on the lattice. These deformations flow to the usual symmetry-preserving Dirac mass terms in the continuum. Additionally, we propose a lattice model that flows to the chiral fermion $3-4-5-0$ model in the continuum by using these lattice charges, and we discuss the multi-fermion interactions that can generate a mass gap in the paradigm of symmetric mass generation.</description>

      <title>Symmetries and Anomalies of Hamiltonian Staggered Fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We review the shift, time reversal and phase symmetries of Hamiltonian staggered fermions and their connection to continuum symmetries concentrating in particular on the case of massless fermions and (3+1) dimensions. We construct operators using the staggered fields that implement these symmetries on finite lattices. We show that it is possible to build shift symmetries that commute with time reversal by combining the elementary shifts with the phase symmetry. In general these symmetries do not form a mutually commuting set and the system suffers from 't Hooft anomalies. However, in the case where the phase symmetry is broken to $Z_4$ by four fermion interactions we find that these lattice anomalies cancel. The naive continuum limit of this anomaly free lattice model has the symmetries and matter representations of the Pati-Salam GUT.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories: emergent properties from Tensor Network methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis develops advanced Tensor Network (TN) methods to address Hamiltonian Lattice Gauge Theories (LGTs), overcoming limitations in real-time dynamics and finite-density regimes. A novel dressed-site formalism is introduced, enabling efficient truncation of gauge fields while preserving gauge invariance for both Abelian and non-Abelian theories. This formalism is successfully applied to SU(2) Yang-Mills LGTs in two dimensions, providing the first TN simulations of this system and revealing critical aspects of its phase diagram and non-equilibrium behavior, such as a Quantum Many-Body (QMB) scarring dynamics. A generalization of the dressed-site formalism is proposed through a new fermion-to-qubit mapping for general lattice fermion theories, revealing powerful for classical and quantum simulations. Numerical innovations, including the use of optimal space-filling curves such as the Hilbert curve to preserve locality in high-dimensional simulations, further enhance the efficiency of these methods. Together with high-performance computing techniques, these advances open current and future development pathways toward optimized, efficient, and faster simulations on scales comparable to Monte Carlo state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>In-medium bottomonium properties from lattice NRQCD calculations with extended meson operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the temperature dependence of bottomonium correlators in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with the aim to constrain in-medium properties of bottomonia at high temperature. The lattice calculations are performed using HISQ action with physical strange quark mass and light quark masses twenty times smaller than the strange quark mass at two lattice spacings $a=0.0493$ fm and $0.0602$ fm, and temporal extents $N_{\tau}=16-30$, corresponding to the temperatures $T=133-250$ MeV. We use a tadpole-improved NRQCD action including spin-dependent $v^6$ corrections for the heavy quarks and extended meson operators in order to be sensitive to in-medium properties of the bottomonium states of interest. We find that within estimated errors the bottomonium masses do not change compared to their vacuum values for all temperatures under our consideration; however, we find different nonzero widths for the various bottomonium states.</description>

      <title>Chiral condensates and screening masses of neutral pseudoscalar mesons from lattice QCD at physical quark masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of temperature $T$ and external magnetic fields $eB$ on the chiral condensates and screening masses of neutral pseudoscalar mesons, including $\pi^0$, $K^0$, and $\eta_{s\bar{s}}^0$, in (2+1)-flavor lattice QCD with physical quark masses. The chiral condensates are intrinsically connected to the screening masses via Ward-Takahashi identities, with the latter characterizing the inverse of the spatial correlation length in the pseudoscalar channel. Using highly improved staggered quarks, we perform simulations on lattices with temporal extents $N_\tau = 8, 12, 16$ and an aspect ratio of 4, covering five temperatures from 145 MeV to 166 MeV. For each temperature, eight magnetic field strengths are simulated, reaching up to $eB \sim 0.8$ GeV$^2$. These simulations allow us to provide continuum estimates for the chiral condensates and screening masses. We observe intricate behavior in the light ($ud$), strange-light ($ds$) and strange ($s$) quark condensates as functions of the magnetic field and temperature, reflecting the competition between magnetic catalysis and inverse magnetic catalysis effects. This complex behavior is also mirrored in the screening masses of the neutral pseudoscalar mesons. Notably, the screening masses of $\pi^0$ and $K^0$ exhibit a non-monotonic dependence on $eB$, closely following the variations in their corresponding chiral condensates. Meanwhile, the screening mass of $\eta_{s\bar{s}}^0$ decreases monotonically with increasing $eB$. These findings provide valuable insights for understanding the behavior of QCD in a thermomagnetic medium and can serve as benchmarks for low-energy QCD models and effective theories.</description>

      <title>Center vortices and the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ conformal window</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel approach for estimating the lower end of the $\mathrm{SU}(3)$ conformal window is presented through the study of center vortex geometry and its dependence on the number of fermion flavors $N_f$. Values ranging from $N_f = 2$--$8$ are utilized to infer an upper limit for vortex behavior in the low $N_f$ phase, which may inform the transition to the conformal window. The simulations are performed at a single lattice spacing and pion mass, both fixed for all $N_f$. Visualizations of the center vortex structure in three-dimensional slices of the lattice reveal a growing roughness in the vortex matter as a function of $N_f$, embodied by an increase in the density of vortex matter in the percolating cluster and a simultaneous reduction in secondary clusters disconnected from the percolating cluster in 3D slices. This is quantified by various bulk properties, including the vortex and branching point densities. A correlation of the vortex structure reveals a turning point near $N_f \simeq 5$ past which a randomness in the vortex field becomes the dominant aspect of its evolution with $N_f$. As a byproduct, extrapolations to the vortex content of a uniform-random gauge field provide a critical point at which there must be a drastic shift in vacuum field structure. A precise estimate for the critical value is extracted as $N_f^* = 11.43(16)(17)$, close to various other estimates.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of fractional topological charge in $SU(N)$ gauge theory coupled with $\mathbb{Z}_N$ 2-form gauge fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pure $SU(N)$ gauge theory with a $\theta$ term has the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ $1$-form global symmetry. When this symmetry is gauged, it is formally established that the topological charge becomes fractional. In this talk, we generate gauge configurations using the HMC method with coupling to the gauged $\mathbb{Z}_N$ $2$-form gauge field. After smoothing these configurations via the gradient flow method, we numerically confirm that the topological charge has a fractional value. We also anticipate that these higher-form fields can solve the topological freezing problem.</description>

      <title>The QCD Equation of State with $N_f=3$ flavours up to the electro-weak scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Equation of State of Quantum Chromodynamics with $N_f=3$ flavours is determined non-perturbatively in the range of temperatures between $3$ and $165$ GeV with a precision of about $0.5$-$1.0\%$. The calculation is carried out by numerical simulations of lattice gauge theory discretized \`a la Wilson with shifted boundary conditions in the compact direction. At each given temperature the entropy density is computed at several lattice spacings in order to extrapolate the results to the continuum limit. Taken at face value, data point straight to the Stefan-Boltzmann value by following a linear behaviour in the strong coupling constant squared. They are also compatible with the known perturbative formula supplemented by higher order terms in the coupling constant, a parameterization which describes well our data together with those present in the literature down to $500$ MeV.</description>

      <title>Initial tensor construction for the tensor renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to construct the initial tensor representation of partition functions and observables for the tensor renormalization group (TRG). The TRG is a numerical calculation technique that utilizes a tensor network representations of physical quantities to investigate physical properties without encountering the sign problem. To apply the TRG, it is essential to construct a locally connected tensor network suitable for recursive coarse-graining. We present a systematic approach for translating a general tensor representation of the partition function to this form. Furthermore, we show the dependence of TRG algorithms on the choice of the initial tensor network representation and propose an improvement of TRG algorithms in this respect</description>

      <title>The role of the chiral anomaly in polarized deeply inelastic scattering III: Wess-Zumino-Witten contributions and chiral Ward identities for finite quark mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend our prior results on the worldline computation of the axial vector-vector-vector (AVV) triangle anomaly in polarized deeply inelastic scattering (DIS) to the finite mass case by computing in addition the pseudoscalar-vector-vector (PVV) triangle graph. For the well-studied QED case, we show explicitly how the off-forward AVV pole exactly cancels an identical PVV pole. We then demonstrate the dramatic difference in QCD due to the chiral condensate, which qualitatively modifies anomalous Ward identities. As in the massless case, the anomaly pole in QCD is canceled by the dynamics of a primordial isosinglet pseudoscalar $\bar \eta$-meson, whose Wess-Zumino-Witten coupling to the topological charge density shifts the pole to the physical $\eta^\prime$ mass, with the finite quark mass contribution differing by $O(10\%)$ from the Witten-Veneziano formula. We obtain a compact analytic expression for the finite mass corrections to Shore and Veneziano's result that the proton's net quark helicity $\Delta \Sigma\propto \sqrt{\chi_{\rm QCD}' |_{m=0}(0)}$, the forward slope of the topological susceptibility in the chiral limit, and show they are of the order of a few percent. Our prior prediction that the polarized DIS structure function $g_1$ is quenched by sphaleron-like topological transitions at small $x$ is unaffected by quark mass effects. Our results illustrate how worldline computations of anomalous processes, in synergy with lattice computations and nonet chiral perturbation theory, can uncover novel nonperturbative features of QCD at the Electron-Ion collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.10532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With Bayesian inference, we investigate the impact of recent near-threshold $J/\psi$ production measurements by the $J/\psi$ 007 experiment and GlueX collaboration on the extraction of proton's gravitational form factors. We apply the generalized parton distribution framework at the next-to-leading order and demonstrate a stable expansion for the near-threshold kinematics. We find that the experimental constraints are in good agreement with the state-of-the-art lattice simulations, where negative $C_q(t)$ and $C_g(t)$ are strongly preferred. This highlights a great potential to extract them from future high-precision experiments.</description>

      <title>Decays of the light hybrid meson $1^{\mathrm{-+}}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The full width of the light isovector hybrid meson $H_{\mathrm{V}}$ with spin-parities $1^{\mathrm{-+}}$ and content $(\overline{u}gu-\overline{d}gd)/ \sqrt{2}$ is evaluated by considering the decays $H_{\mathrm{V}} \to \rho^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$, $b_1^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$, $f_1(1285)\pi$, $f_1(1420)\pi$, $ \eta \pi$, and $\eta^{\prime} \pi$. To calculate the partial widths of these channels, we use QCD three-point sum rule method which is necessary to determine strong couplings at the corresponding hybrid-meson-meson vertices. It turns out that the main contribution to the full width $\Gamma[H_{\mathrm{ V}}]=109.7 \pm 16.0$ of the hybrid meson comes from the processes $H_{ \mathrm{V}} \to \rho^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}$ partial width of which amounts to $ \approx 67~\mathrm{MeV}$. The effects of the decays $H_{\mathrm{V}} \to b_1\pi $ and $H_{\mathrm{V}} \to f_1\pi, f_1^{\prime} \pi$ are also sizeable: Their partial widths are equal to $13~\mathrm{MeV}$ and $20~ \mathrm{MeV}$, respectively. The decays to $\eta \pi$ and $\eta^{\prime} \pi$ mesons are subdominant reactions, nevertheless they form $\approx 9\%$ of the full width $\Gamma[H_{\mathrm{V}}]$. Results obtained in this work may be interesting to unravel the tangle of predictions about $H_{\mathrm{V}}$ existing in the literature, as well as useful in analyses of different resonances.</description>

      <title>Improving thermal state preparation of Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with reinforcement learning on quantum hardware</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, known for its strong quantum correlations and chaotic behavior, serves as a key platform for quantum gravity studies. However, variationally preparing thermal states on near-term quantum processors for large systems (N&gt;12, where N is the number of Majorana fermions) presents a significant challenge due to the rapid growth in the complexity of parameterized quantum circuits. This paper addresses this challenge by integrating reinforcement learning (RL) with convolutional neural networks, employing an iterative approach to optimize the quantum circuit and its parameters. The refinement process is guided by a composite reward signal derived from entropy and the expectation values of the SYK Hamiltonian. This approach reduces the number of CNOT gates by two orders of magnitude for systems N&gt;10 compared to traditional methods like first-order Trotterization. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the RL framework in both noiseless and noisy quantum hardware environments, maintaining high accuracy in thermal state preparation. This work contributes to the advancement of a scalable, RL-based framework with applications for computations of thermal out-of-time-order correlators in quantum many-body systems and quantum gravity studies on near-term quantum hardware.</description>

      <title>Composite quarks and leptons with embedded QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a model of quark and lepton compositeness based on an $SU(15)$ gauge interaction that confines chiral preons, which are also charged under the weakly-coupled $SU(4)_{\rm PS} \times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ gauge group. The breaking of the latter, down to the Standard Model group, is achieved by scalar $SU(15)$ bound states at a scale in the $30 - 100$ TeV range. The embedding of the QCD gauge group in $SU(4)_{\rm PS} $ slows down the running of $\alpha_s$ in the UV. We estimate the effects of the strongly-coupled $SU(15)$ dynamics on the running of the $SU(4)_{\rm PS} \times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ gauge couplings, which likely remain perturbative beyond the compositeness scale of about $10^3 - 10^4$ TeV, and even above a unification scale. A composite vectorlike lepton doublet acquires a mass in the TeV range probed at future colliders, and an extended Higgs sector arises from 6-preon bound states.</description>

      <title>Nucleon electric dipole form factor in QCD vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the QCD instanton vacuum, the C-even and C-odd nucleon Pauli form factors receive a large contribution from the underlying ensemble of pseudoparticles, that is sensitive to a finite QCD vacuum angle $\theta$. This observation is used to derive explicitly the electric dipole form factor for light quark flavors, and estimate the proton and neutron electric dipole moment induced by a small CP violating $\theta$. The results are in the range of some recently reported lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Nucleon and singly heavy baryons from the QCD instanton vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an effective chiral theory for the nucleon, based on the low-energy effective QCD partition function from the QCD instanton vacuum. We fully consider the momentum-dependent dynamical quark mass whose value at the zero virtuality of the quark is determined by the gap equation from the instanton vacuum, $M_0=359$ MeV. The nucleon emerges as a state of $N_c$ valence quarks bound by the pion mean field, which was created self-consistently by the $N_c$ valence quarks. In the large Euclidean time, the classical nucleon mass is evaluated by minimizing the sum of the $N_c$ discrete-level energies and the Dirac-continuum energy: $M_{\text{cl}}=1.2680$ GeV. The pion mean-field solution turns out broader than the local chiral quark-soliton model. The zero-mode quantization furnishes the nucleon with proper quantum numbers such as the spin and isospin. We compute the moment of inertia $I=1.3853$ fm by using the self-consistent mean-field solution, which yields the $\Delta -N$ mass splitting $M_{\Delta-N} =213.67$ MeV. In the same manner, singly heavy baryons can be described as a bound state of the $N_c-1$ valence quarks with the corresponding pion mean field, with the heavy quark regarded as a static color source. The mass splitting of the singly heavy baryons is obtained to be $M_{\Sigma_Q-\Lambda_Q}=206.20$ MeV, which are in good agreement with the experimental data. The effective chiral theory developed in the present work will provide a solid theoretical framework to investigate gluonic observables of both the light and singly heavy baryons.</description>

      <title>Impact of extreme magnetic fields on the QCD topological susceptibility in the vicinity of the crossover region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00796v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the first determination of the topological susceptibility from lattice QCD in the presence of strong background magnetic fields. Our simulations employ 2+1 flavours of stout improved staggered quarks with physical masses and cover a broad range of temperatures and magnetic field values. The results are extrapolated to the continuum limit using four different lattice spacings and an eigenvalue reweighting technique to reduce discretisation errors. For low temperatures, our calculations show an enhancement of the topological susceptibility due to the magnetic field, compatible with predictions from chiral perturbation theory. At high temperatures, we observe the impact of inverse magnetic catalysis on the susceptibility.</description>

      <title>Steps Toward Quantum Simulations of Hadronization and Energy-Loss in Dense Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A framework for simulating the real-time dynamics of composite particles in a simple model of dense matter that is amenable to quantum computers is developed. As a demonstration, we perform classical simulations of heavy-hadrons propagating through a dense medium in the Schwinger model. Measurements of the time-dependent energy and charge density are used to identify mechanisms responsible for energy loss and hadron production (hadronization). A study of entanglement dynamics highlights the importance of quantum coherence between the particles that make up the dense medium. Throughout this work, care is taken to isolate, and remove, phenomena that arise solely from a finite lattice spacing. It is found that signatures of entanglement are more sensitive to lattice artifacts than other observables. Toward quantum simulations, we present an efficient method and the corresponding quantum circuits for preparing ground states in the presence of heavy mesons. These circuits are used to estimate the resources required to simulate in-medium energy loss and hadronization in the Schwinger model using quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Landscape of QCD Vacuum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00318v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We found new solutions of the sourceless Yang-Mills equation describing the superposition of chromomagnetic vortices of oppositely oriented magnetic fluxes. These gauge field configurations have constant energy densities and are separated by potential barriers forming a complicated landscape. It is suggested that the solutions describe the condensate of chromomagnetic vortices and represent a dual analog of the Cooper pairs condensate in a superconductor. In the presence of an Abelian field and in a particular limit the solutions reduce to the flat connections of zero energy density and are forming a complicated potential landscape of the QCD vacuum. A possible tunnelling transition between these superfluxon flat configurations and the flat configurations with non-vanishing Chern-Pontryagin index will wash out the CP violating $\theta$ angle to zero, dynamically restoring CP symmetry.</description>

      <title>Evidence of a CP broken deconfined phase in 4D SU(2) Yang-Mills theory at $\theta =\pi$ from imaginary $\theta$ simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03683</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03683v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of CP symmetry in 4D SU($N$) pure Yang-Mills theory at $\theta=\pi$ has recently attracted much attention in the context of the higher-form symmetry and the 't Hooft anomaly matching condition. Here we use Monte Carlo simulations to study the $N=2$ case, which is interesting since it is the case opposite to the large-$N$ limit, where explicit calculations are available. In order to circumvent the severe sign problem due to the $\theta$ term for real $\theta$, we first obtain results at imaginary $\theta$, where the sign problem is absent, and make an analytic continuation to real $\theta$. We use the stout smearing in defining the $\theta$ term in the action to be used in our simulations. Thus we obtain the expectation value of the topological charge and the deconfining temperature at $\theta=\pi$, and provide an evidence that the CP symmetry, which is spontaneously broken at low temperature, gets restored \emph{strictly above} the deconfining temperature. This conclusion is consistent with the anomaly matching condition and yet differs from the prediction in the large-$N$ limit.</description>
