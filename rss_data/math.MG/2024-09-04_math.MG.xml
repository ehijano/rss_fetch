      <title>Approximation of spherical convex bodies of constant width $\pi/2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $C\subset \mathbb{S}^2$ be a spherical convex body of constant width $\tau$. It is known that (i) if $\tau&lt;\pi/2$ then for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there exists a spherical convex body $C_\varepsilon$ of constant width $\tau$ whose boundary consists only of arcs of circles of radius $\tau$ such that the Hausdorff distance between $C$ and $C_\varepsilon$ is at most $\varepsilon$; (ii) if $\tau&gt;\pi/2$ then for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there exists a spherical convex body $C_\varepsilon$ of constant width $\tau$ whose boundary consists only of arcs of circles of radius $\tau-\frac{\pi}{2}$ and great circle arcs such that the Hausdorff distance between $C$ and $C_\varepsilon$ is at most $\varepsilon$. In this paper, we present an approximation of the remaining case $\tau=\pi/2$, that is, if $\tau=\pi/2$ then for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$ there exists a spherical polytope $\mathcal{P}_\varepsilon$ of constant width $\pi/2$ such that the Hausdorff distance between $C$ and $\mathcal{P}_\varepsilon$ is at most $\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Complex and Quaternionic Analogues of Busemann's Random Simplex and Intersection Inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend two celebrated inequalities by Busemann -- the random simplex inequality and the intersection inequality -- to both complex and quaternionic vector spaces. Our proof leverages a monotonicity property under symmetrization with respect to complex or quaternionic hyperplanes. Notably, we demonstrate that the standard Steiner symmetrization, contrary to assertions in a paper by Grinberg, does not exhibit this monotonicity property.</description>

      <title>Zonal valuations on convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A complete classification of all zonal, continuous, and translation invariant valuations on convex bodies is established. The valuations obtained are expressed as principal value integrals with respect to the area measures. The convergence of these principal value integrals is obtained from a new weighted version of an inequality for the volume of spherical caps due to Firey. For Minkowski valuations, this implies a refinement of the convolution representation by Schuster and Wannerer in terms of singular integrals. As a further application, a new proof of the classification of $\mathrm{SO}(n)$-invariant, continuous, and dually epi-translation invariant valuations on the space of finite convex functions by Colesanti, Ludwig, and Mussnig is obtained.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of Translational Tiling of the 4-dimensional Space with a Set of 4 Polyhypercubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Greenfeld and Tao disproof the conjecture that translational tilings of a single tile can always be periodic [Ann. Math. 200(2024), 301-363]. In another paper [to appear in J. Eur. Math. Soc.], they also show that if the dimension $n$ is part of the input, the translational tiling for subsets of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with one tile is undecidable. These two results are very strong pieces of evidence for the conjecture that translational tiling of $\mathbb{Z}^n$ with a monotile is undecidable, for some fixed $n$. This paper shows that translational tiling of the $3$-dimensional space with a set of $5$ polycubes is undecidable. By introducing a technique that lifts a set of polycubes and its tiling from $3$-dimensional space to $4$-dimensional space, we manage to show that translational tiling of the $4$-dimensional space with a set of $4$ tiles is undecidable. This is a step towards the attempt to settle the conjecture of the undecidability of translational tiling of the $n$-dimensional space with a monotile, for some fixed $n$.</description>

      <title>Fitting trees to $\ell_1$-hyperbolic distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building trees to represent or to fit distances is a critical component of phylogenetic analysis, metric embeddings, approximation algorithms, geometric graph neural nets, and the analysis of hierarchical data. Much of the previous algorithmic work, however, has focused on generic metric spaces (i.e., those with no a priori constraints). Leveraging several ideas from the mathematical analysis of hyperbolic geometry and geometric group theory, we study the tree fitting problem as finding the relation between the hyperbolicity (ultrametricity) vector and the error of tree (ultrametric) embedding. That is, we define a vector of hyperbolicity (ultrametric) values over all triples of points and compare the $\ell_p$ norms of this vector with the $\ell_q$ norm of the distortion of the best tree fit to the distances. This formulation allows us to define the average hyperbolicity (ultrametricity) in terms of a normalized $\ell_1$ norm of the hyperbolicity vector. Furthermore, we can interpret the classical tree fitting result of Gromov as a $p = q = \infty$ result. We present an algorithm HCCRootedTreeFit such that the $\ell_1$ error of the output embedding is analytically bounded in terms of the $\ell_1$ norm of the hyperbolicity vector (i.e., $p = q = 1$) and that this result is tight. Furthermore, this algorithm has significantly different theoretical and empirical performance as compared to Gromov's result and related algorithms. Finally, we show using HCCRootedTreeFit and related tree fitting algorithms, that supposedly standard data sets for hierarchical data analysis and geometric graph neural networks have radically different tree fits than those of synthetic, truly tree-like data sets, suggesting that a much more refined analysis of these standard data sets is called for.</description>

      <title>Finite dimensionality of Besov spaces and potential-theoretic decomposition of metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of a metric measure space $(X,d,\mu)$, we explore the potential-theoretic implications of having a finite-dimensional Besov space. We prove that if the dimension of the Besov space $B^\theta_{p,p}(X)$ is $k&gt;1$, then $X$ can be decomposed into $k$ number of irreducible components (Theorem 1.1). Note that $\theta$ may be bigger than $1$, as our framework includes fractals. We also provide sufficient conditions under which the dimension of the Besov space is $1$. We introduce critical exponents $\theta_p(X)$ and $\theta_p^{\ast}(X)$ for the Besov spaces. As examples illustrating Theorem 1.1, we compute these critical exponents for spaces $X$ formed by glueing copies of $n$-dimensional cubes, the Sierpi\'{n}ski gaskets, and of the Sierpi\'{n}ski carpet.</description>

      <title>Exponential polynomials and identification of polygonal regions from Fourier samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01432v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Consider the set $E(D, N)$ of all bivariate exponential polynomials $$ f(\xi, \eta) = \sum_{j=1}^n p_j(\xi, \eta) e^{2\pi i (x_j\xi+y_j\eta)}, $$ where the polynomials $p_j \in \mathbb{C}[\xi, \eta]$ have degree $&lt;D$, $n\le N$ and where $x_j, y_j \in \mathbb{T} = \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$. We find a set $A \subseteq \mathbb{Z}^2$ that depends on $N$ and $D$ only and is of size $O(D^2 N \log N)$ such that the values of $f$ on $A$ determine $f$. Notice that the size of $A$ is only larger by a logarithmic quantity than the number of parameters needed to write down $f$.
  We use this in order to prove some uniqueness results about polygonal regions given a small set of samples of the Fourier Transform of their indicator function. If the number of different slopes of the edges of the polygonal region is $\le k$ then the region is determined from a predetermined set of Fourier samples that depends only on $k$ and the maximum number of vertices $N$ and is of size $O(k^2 N \log N)$. In the particular case where all edges are known to be parallel to the axes the polygonal region is determined from a set of $O(N \log N)$ Fourier samples that depends on $N$ only.
  Our methods are non-constructive.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this note is to prove that every real-valued Lipschitz function on a Banach space can be pointwise approximated on a given $\sigma$-compact set by smooth cylindrical functions whose asymptotic Lipschitz constants are controlled. This result has applications in the study of metric Sobolev and BV spaces: it implies that smooth cylindrical functions are dense in energy in these kinds of functional spaces defined over any weighted Banach space.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.07887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The standard convex closed hull of a set is defined as the intersection of all images, under the action of a group of rigid motions, of a half-space containing the given set. In this paper we propose a generalisation of this classical notion, that we call a $(K,\mathbb{H})$-hull, and which is obtained from the above construction by replacing a half-space with some other convex closed subset $K$ of the Euclidean space, and a group of rigid motions by a subset $\mathbb{H}$ of the group of invertible affine transformations. The main focus is put on the analysis of $(K,\mathbb{H})$-convex hulls of random samples from $K$.</description>

      <title>Connections and Finsler geometry of the structure group of a JB-algebra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.09208v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We endow the Banach-Lie structure group $Str(V)$ of an infinite dimensional JB-algebra $V$ with a left-invariant connection and Finsler metric, and we compute all the quantities of its connection. We show how this connection reduces to $G(\Omega)$, the group of transformations that preserve the positive cone $\Omega$ of the algebra $V$, and to $Aut(V)$, the group of Jordan automorphisms of the algebra. We present the cone $\Omega$ as an homogeneous space for the action of $G(\Omega)$, therefore inducing a quotient Finsler metric and distance. With the techniques introduced, we prove the minimality of the one-parameter groups in $\Omega$ for any symmetric gauge norm in $V$. We establish that the two presentations of the Finsler metric in $\Omega$ give the same distance there, which helps us prove the minimality of certain paths in $G(\Omega)$ for its left-invariant Finsler metric.</description>

Abstract: Let $X_1,\cdots,X_m$ be vector fields satisfying H\"ormander's Lie bracket generating condition on a smooth manifold $M$. We generalise Connes's tangent groupoid, by constructing a completion of the space $M\times M\times \mathbb{R}_+^\times$ using the sub-Riemannian metric. We use our space to calculate all the tangent cones of the sub-Riemannian metric in the sense of the Gromov-Hausdorff distance. This generalises a result of Bella\"iche.</description>

      <title>Coarse group theoretic study on stable mixed commutator length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08618v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a group and $N$ a normal subgroup of $G$. We study the large scale behavior, not the exact values themselves, of the stable mixed commutator length $scl_{G,N}$ on the mixed commutator subgroup $[G,N]$; when $N=G$, $scl_{G,N}$ equals the stable commutator length $scl_G$ on the commutator subgroup $[G,G]$. For this purpose, we regard $scl_{G,N}$ not only as a function from $[G,N]$ to $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$, but as a bi-invariant metric function $d^+_{scl_{G,N}}$ from $[G,N]\times [G,N]$ to $\mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$. Our main focus is coarse group theoretic structures of $([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})$. Our preliminary result (the absolute version) connects, via the Bavard duality, $([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})$ and the quotient vector space of the space of $G$-invariant quasimorphisms on $N$ over one of such homomorphisms. In particular, we prove that the dimension of this vector space equals the asymptotic dimension of $([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})$.
  Our main result is the comparative version: we connect the coarse kernel, formulated by Leitner and Vigolo, of the coarse homomorphism $\iota_{G,N}\colon ([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G,N}})\to ([G,N],d^+_{scl_{G}})$; $y\mapsto y$, and a certain quotient vector space $W(G,N)$ of the space of invariant quasimorphisms. Assume that $N=[G,G]$ and that $W(G,N)$ is finite dimensional with dimension $\ell$. Then we prove that the coarse kernel of $\iota_{G,N}$ is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^{\ell}$ as a coarse group. In contrast to the absolute version, the space $W(G,N)$ is finite dimensional in many cases, including all $(G,N)$ with finitely generated $G$ and nilpotent $G/N$. As an application of our result, given a group homomorphism $\varphi\colon G\to H$ between finitely generated groups, we define an $\mathbb{R}$-linear map `inside' the groups, which is dual to the naturally defined $\mathbb{R}$-linear map from $W(H,[H,H])$ to $W(G,[G,G])$ induced by $\varphi$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, based on the ideas of Blagojevi\'c, Karasev &amp; Magazinov, we consider an extension of the center transversal theorem to mass assignments with an improved Rado depth. In particular we substitute the marginal of a measure by a more general concept called a mass assignment over a flag manifold. Our results also allow us to solve the main problem proposed by Blagojevi\'c, Karasev &amp; Magazinov in a linear subspace of lower dimension, as long as it is contained in a high-dimensional enough ambient space.</description>

      <title>Ahlfors regularity of continua that minimize maxitive set functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09251v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The primary objective of this paper is to establish the Ahlfors regularity of minimizers of set functions that satisfy a suitable maxitive condition on disjoint unions of sets. Our analysis focuses on minimizers within continua of the plane with finite one-dimensional Hausdorff measure. Through quantitative estimates, we prove that the length of a minimizer inside the ball centered at one of its points is comparable to the radius of the ball. By operating within an abstract framework, we are able to encompass a diverse range of entities, including spectral functionals defined in terms of the eigenvalues of elliptic operators, the inradius, and the maximum of the torsion function. These entities are of interest for several applications, such as structural engineering, urban planning, and quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Fixed and Periodic Points of the Intersection Body Operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08171v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The intersection body $IK$ of a star-body $K$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ was introduced by E. Lutwak following the work of H. Busemann, and plays a central role in the dual Brunn-Minkowski theory. We show that when $n \geq 3$, $I^2 K = c K$ iff $K$ is a centered ellipsoid, and hence $I K = c K$ iff $K$ is a centered Euclidean ball, answering long-standing questions by Lutwak, Gardner, and Fish-Nazarov-Ryabogin-Zvavitch. To this end, we recast the iterated intersection body equation as an Euler-Lagrange equation for a certain volume functional under radial perturbations, derive new formulas for the volume of $I K$, and introduce a continuous version of Steiner symmetrization for Lipschitz star-bodies, which (surprisingly) yields a useful radial perturbation exactly when $n\geq 3$.</description>
