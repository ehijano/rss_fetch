      <title>Personalized Diffusion Model Reshapes Cold-Start Bundle Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bundle recommendation aims to recommend a set of items to each user. However, the sparser interactions between users and bundles raise a big challenge, especially in cold-start scenarios. Traditional collaborative filtering methods do not work well for this kind of problem because these models rely on interactions to update the latent embedding, which is hard to work in a cold-start setting. We propose a new approach (DisCo), which relies on a personalized Diffusion backbone, enhanced by disentangled aspects for the user's interest, to generate a bundle in distribution space for each user to tackle the cold-start challenge. During the training phase, DisCo adjusts an additional objective loss term to avoid bias, a prevalent issue while using the generative model for top-$K$ recommendation purposes. Our empirical experiments show that DisCo outperforms five comparative baselines by a large margin on three real-world datasets. Thereby, this study devises a promising framework and essential viewpoints in cold-start recommendation.

      <title>An Alternative to FLOPS Regularization to Effectively Productionize SPLADE-Doc</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learned Sparse Retrieval (LSR) models encode text as weighted term vectors, which need to be sparse to leverage inverted index structures during retrieval. SPLADE, the most popular LSR model, uses FLOPS regularization to encourage vector sparsity during training. However, FLOPS regularization does not ensure sparsity among terms - only within a given query or document. Terms with very high Document Frequencies (DFs) substantially increase latency in production retrieval engines, such as Apache Solr, due to their lengthy posting lists. To address the issue of high DFs, we present a new variant of FLOPS regularization: DF-FLOPS. This new regularization technique penalizes the usage of high-DF terms, thereby shortening posting lists and reducing retrieval latency. Unlike other inference-time sparsification methods, such as stopword removal, DF-FLOPS regularization allows for the selective inclusion of high-frequency terms in cases where the terms are truly salient. We find that DF-FLOPS successfully reduces the prevalence of high-DF terms and lowers retrieval latency (around 10x faster) in a production-grade engine while maintaining effectiveness both in-domain (only a 2.2-point drop in MRR@10) and cross-domain (improved performance in 12 out of 13 tasks on which we tested). With retrieval latencies on par with BM25, this work provides an important step towards making LSR practical for deployment in production-grade search engines.</description>

      <title>ThinkRec: Thinking-based recommendation via LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15091v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled more semantic-aware recommendations through natural language generation. Existing LLM for recommendation (LLM4Rec) methods mostly operate in a System 1-like manner, relying on superficial features to match similar items based on click history, rather than reasoning through deeper behavioral logic. This often leads to superficial and erroneous recommendations. Motivated by this, we propose ThinkRec, a thinking-based framework that shifts LLM4Rec from System 1 to System 2 (rational system). Technically, ThinkRec introduces a thinking activation mechanism that augments item metadata with keyword summarization and injects synthetic reasoning traces, guiding the model to form interpretable reasoning chains that consist of analyzing interaction histories, identifying user preferences, and making decisions based on target items. On top of this, we propose an instance-wise expert fusion mechanism to reduce the reasoning difficulty. By dynamically assigning weights to expert models based on users' latent features, ThinkRec adapts its reasoning path to individual users, thereby enhancing precision and personalization. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that ThinkRec significantly improves the accuracy and interpretability of recommendations. Our implementations are available in anonymous Github: https://github.com/Yu-Qi-hang/ThinkRec.</description>

      <title>Robust Relevance Feedback for Interactive Known-Item Video Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Known-item search (KIS) involves only a single search target, making relevance feedback-typically a powerful technique for efficiently identifying multiple positive examples to infer user intent-inapplicable. PicHunter addresses this issue by asking users to select the top-k most similar examples to the unique search target from a displayed set. Under ideal conditions, when the user's perception aligns closely with the machine's perception of similarity, consistent and precise judgments can elevate the target to the top position within a few iterations. However, in practical scenarios, expecting users to provide consistent judgments is often unrealistic, especially when the underlying embedding features used for similarity measurements lack interpretability. To enhance robustness, we first introduce a pairwise relative judgment feedback that improves the stability of top-k selections by mitigating the impact of misaligned feedback. Then, we decompose user perception into multiple sub-perceptions, each represented as an independent embedding space. This approach assumes that users may not consistently align with a single representation but are more likely to align with one or several among multiple representations. We develop a predictive user model that estimates the combination of sub-perceptions based on each user feedback instance. The predictive user model is then trained to filter out the misaligned sub-perceptions. Experimental evaluations on the large-scale open-domain dataset V3C indicate that the proposed model can optimize over 60% search targets to the top rank when their initial ranks at the search depth between 10 and 50. Even for targets initially ranked between 1,000 and 5,000, the model achieves a success rate exceeding 40% in optimizing ranks to the top, demonstrating the enhanced robustness of relevance feedback in KIS despite inconsistent feedback.</description>

      <title>Reranking with Compressed Document Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15394</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15394v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Reranking, the process of refining the output of a first-stage retriever, is often considered computationally expensive, especially with Large Language Models. Borrowing from recent advances in document compression for RAG, we reduce the input size by compressing documents into fixed-size embedding representations. We then teach a reranker to use compressed inputs by distillation. Although based on a billion-size model, our trained reranker using this compressed input can challenge smaller rerankers in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency, especially for long documents. Given that text compressors are still in their early development stages, we view this approach as promising.</description>

      <title>MIRB: Mathematical Information Retrieval Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical Information Retrieval (MIR) is the task of retrieving information from mathematical documents and plays a key role in various applications, including theorem search in mathematical libraries, answer retrieval on math forums, and premise selection in automated theorem proving. However, a unified benchmark for evaluating these diverse retrieval tasks has been lacking. In this paper, we introduce MIRB (Mathematical Information Retrieval Benchmark) to assess the MIR capabilities of retrieval models. MIRB includes four tasks: semantic statement retrieval, question-answer retrieval, premise retrieval, and formula retrieval, spanning a total of 12 datasets. We evaluate 13 retrieval models on this benchmark and analyze the challenges inherent to MIR. We hope that MIRB provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating MIR systems and helps advance the development of more effective retrieval models tailored to the mathematical domain.</description>

      <title>Distance Adaptive Beam Search for Provably Accurate Graph-Based Nearest Neighbor Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearest neighbor search is central in machine learning, information retrieval, and databases. For high-dimensional datasets, graph-based methods such as HNSW, DiskANN, and NSG have become popular thanks to their empirical accuracy and efficiency. These methods construct a directed graph over the dataset and perform beam search on the graph to find nodes close to a given query. While significant work has focused on practical refinements and theoretical understanding of graph-based methods, many questions remain. We propose a new distance-based termination condition for beam search to replace the commonly used condition based on beam width. We prove that, as long as the search graph is navigable, our resulting Adaptive Beam Search method is guaranteed to approximately solve the nearest-neighbor problem, establishing a connection between navigability and the performance of graph-based search. We also provide extensive experiments on our new termination condition for both navigable graphs and approximately navigable graphs used in practice, such as HNSW and Vamana graphs. We find that Adaptive Beam Search outperforms standard beam search over a range of recall values, data sets, graph constructions, and target number of nearest neighbors. It thus provides a simple and practical way to improve the performance of popular methods.</description>

      <title>Privacy Preserving Conversion Modeling in Data Clean Room</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the realm of online advertising, accurately predicting the conversion rate (CVR) is crucial for enhancing advertising efficiency and user satisfaction. This paper addresses the challenge of CVR prediction while adhering to user privacy preferences and advertiser requirements. Traditional methods face obstacles such as the reluctance of advertisers to share sensitive conversion data and the limitations of model training in secure environments like data clean rooms. We propose a novel model training framework that enables collaborative model training without sharing sample-level gradients with the advertising platform. Our approach introduces several innovative components: (1) utilizing batch-level aggregated gradients instead of sample-level gradients to minimize privacy risks; (2) applying adapter-based parameter-efficient fine-tuning and gradient compression to reduce communication costs; and (3) employing de-biasing techniques to train the model under label differential privacy, thereby maintaining accuracy despite privacy-enhanced label perturbations. Our experimental results, conducted on industrial datasets, demonstrate that our method achieves competitive ROCAUC performance while significantly decreasing communication overhead and complying with both advertiser privacy requirements and user privacy choices. This framework establishes a new standard for privacy-preserving, high-performance CVR prediction in the digital advertising landscape.</description>

      <title>CRAFT: Training-Free Cascaded Retrieval for Tabular QA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14984v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Table Question Answering (TQA) involves retrieving relevant tables from a large corpus to answer natural language queries. Traditional dense retrieval models, such as DTR and ColBERT, not only incur high computational costs for large-scale retrieval tasks but also require retraining or fine-tuning on new datasets, limiting their adaptability to evolving domains and knowledge. In this work, we propose $\textbf{CRAFT}$, a cascaded retrieval approach that first uses a sparse retrieval model to filter a subset of candidate tables before applying more computationally expensive dense models and neural re-rankers. Our approach achieves better retrieval performance than state-of-the-art (SOTA) sparse, dense, and hybrid retrievers. We further enhance table representations by generating table descriptions and titles using Gemini Flash 1.5. End-to-end TQA results using various Large Language Models (LLMs) on NQ-Tables, a subset of the Natural Questions Dataset, demonstrate $\textbf{CRAFT}$ effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Are the confidence scores of reviewers consistent with the review content? Evidence from top conference proceedings in AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Peer review is vital in academia for evaluating research quality. Top AI conferences use reviewer confidence scores to ensure review reliability, but existing studies lack fine-grained analysis of text-score consistency, potentially missing key details. This work assesses consistency at word, sentence, and aspect levels using deep learning and NLP conference review data. We employ deep learning to detect hedge sentences and aspects, then analyze report length, hedge word/sentence frequency, aspect mentions, and sentiment to evaluate text-score alignment. Correlation, significance, and regression tests examine confidence scores' impact on paper outcomes. Results show high text-score consistency across all levels, with regression revealing higher confidence scores correlate with paper rejection, validating expert assessments and peer review fairness.</description>

      <title>GitHub Repository Complexity Leads to Diminished Web Archive Availability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15042v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software is often developed using versioned controlled software, such as Git, and hosted on centralized Web hosts, such as GitHub and GitLab. These Web hosted software repositories are made available to users in the form of traditional HTML Web pages for each source file and directory, as well as a presentational home page and various descriptive pages. We examined more than 12,000 Web hosted Git repository project home pages, primarily from GitHub, to measure how well their presentational components are preserved in the Internet Archive, as well as the source trees of the collected GitHub repositories to assess the extent to which their source code has been preserved. We found that more than 31% of the archived repository home pages examined exhibited some form of minor page damage and 1.6% exhibited major page damage. We also found that of the source trees analyzed, less than 5% of their source files were archived, on average, with the majority of repositories not having source files saved in the Internet Archive at all. The highest concentration of archived source files available were those linked directly from repositories' home pages at a rate of 14.89% across all available repositories and sharply dropping off at deeper levels of a repository's directory tree.</description>

      <title>MoTime: A Dataset Suite for Multimodal Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While multimodal data sources are increasingly available from real-world forecasting, most existing research remains on unimodal time series. In this work, we present MoTime, a suite of multimodal time series forecasting datasets that pair temporal signals with external modalities such as text, metadata, and images. Covering diverse domains, MoTime supports structured evaluation of modality utility under two scenarios: 1) the common forecasting task, where varying-length history is available, and 2) cold-start forecasting, where no historical data is available. Experiments show that external modalities can improve forecasting performance in both scenarios, with particularly strong benefits for short series in some datasets, though the impact varies depending on data characteristics. By making datasets and findings publicly available, we aim to support more comprehensive and realistic benchmarks in future multimodal time series forecasting research.</description>

      <title>StepSearch: Igniting LLMs Search Ability via Step-Wise Proximal Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient multi-hop reasoning requires Large Language Models (LLMs) based agents to acquire high-value external knowledge iteratively. Previous work has explored reinforcement learning (RL) to train LLMs to perform search-based document retrieval, achieving notable improvements in QA performance, but underperform on complex, multi-hop QA resulting from the sparse rewards from global signal only. To address this gap in existing research, we introduce StepSearch, a framework for search LLMs that trained with step-wise proximal policy optimization method. It consists of richer and more detailed intermediate search rewards and token-level process supervision based on information gain and redundancy penalties to better guide each search step. We constructed a fine-grained question-answering dataset containing sub-question-level search trajectories based on open source datasets through a set of data pipeline method. On standard multi-hop QA benchmarks, it significantly outperforms global-reward baselines, achieving 11.2% and 4.2% absolute improvements for 3B and 7B models over various search with RL baselines using only 19k training data, demonstrating the effectiveness of fine-grained, stepwise supervision in optimizing deep search LLMs. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/zxh20001117/StepSearch.</description>

      <title>An Empirical Study on Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning-Search Interleaved LLM Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has demonstrated strong potential in training large language models (LLMs) capable of complex reasoning for real-world problem solving. More recently, RL has been leveraged to create sophisticated LLM-based search agents that adeptly combine reasoning with search engine use. While the use of RL for training search agents is promising, the optimal design of such agents remains not fully understood. In particular, key factors -- such as (1) reward formulation, (2) the choice and characteristics of the underlying LLM, and (3) the role of the search engine in the RL process -- require further investigation. In this work, we conduct comprehensive empirical studies to systematically investigate these and offer actionable insights. We highlight several key findings: format rewards are effective in improving final performance, whereas intermediate retrieval rewards have limited impact; the scale and initialization of the LLM (general-purpose vs. reasoning-specialized) significantly influence RL outcomes; and the choice of search engine plays a critical role in shaping RL training dynamics and the robustness of the trained agent during inference.

      <title>Deliberation on Priors: Trustworthy Reasoning of Large Language Models on Knowledge Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowledge graph-based retrieval-augmented generation seeks to mitigate hallucinations in Large Language Models (LLMs) caused by insufficient or outdated knowledge. However, existing methods often fail to fully exploit the prior knowledge embedded in knowledge graphs (KGs), particularly their structural information and explicit or implicit constraints. The former can enhance the faithfulness of LLMs' reasoning, while the latter can improve the reliability of response generation. Motivated by these, we propose a trustworthy reasoning framework, termed Deliberation over Priors (DP), which sufficiently utilizes the priors contained in KGs. Specifically, DP adopts a progressive knowledge distillation strategy that integrates structural priors into LLMs through a combination of supervised fine-tuning and Kahneman-Tversky optimization, thereby improving the faithfulness of relation path generation. Furthermore, our framework employs a reasoning-introspection strategy, which guides LLMs to perform refined reasoning verification based on extracted constraint priors, ensuring the reliability of response generation. Extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that DP achieves new state-of-the-art performance, especially a Hit@1 improvement of 13% on the ComplexWebQuestions dataset, and generates highly trustworthy responses. We also conduct various analyses to verify its flexibility and practicality. The code is available at https://github.com/reml-group/Deliberation-on-Priors.</description>

      <title>Directional Non-Commutative Monoidal Structures for Compositional Embeddings in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15507v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new algebraic structure for multi-dimensional compositional embeddings, built on directional non-commutative monoidal operators. The core contribution of this work is this novel framework, which exhibits appealing theoretical properties (associativity along each dimension and an interchange law ensuring global consistency) while remaining compatible with modern machine learning architectures. Our construction defines a distinct composition operator circ_i for each axis i, ensuring associative combination along each axis without imposing global commutativity. Importantly, all axis-specific operators commute with one another, enforcing a global interchange law that enables consistent crossaxis compositions. This is, to our knowledge, the first approach that provides a common foundation that generalizes classical sequence-modeling paradigms (e.g., structured state-space models (SSMs) and transformer self-attention) to a unified multi-dimensional framework. For example, specific one-dimensional instances of our framework can recover the familiar affine transformation algebra, vanilla self-attention, and the SSM-style recurrence. The higher-dimensional generalizations naturally support recursive, structure-aware operations in embedding spaces. We outline several potential applications unlocked by this structure-including structured positional encodings in Transformers, directional image embeddings, and symbolic modeling of sequences or grids-indicating that it could inform future deep learning model designs. We formally establish the algebraic properties of our framework and discuss efficient implementations. Finally, as our focus is theoretical, we include no experiments here and defer empirical validation to future work, which we plan to undertake.</description>

      <title>Do RAG Systems Suffer From Positional Bias?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15561v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation enhances LLM accuracy by adding passages retrieved from an external corpus to the LLM prompt. This paper investigates how positional bias - the tendency of LLMs to weight information differently based on its position in the prompt - affects not only the LLM's capability to capitalize on relevant passages, but also its susceptibility to distracting passages. Through extensive experiments on three benchmarks, we show how state-of-the-art retrieval pipelines, while attempting to retrieve relevant passages, systematically bring highly distracting ones to the top ranks, with over 60% of queries containing at least one highly distracting passage among the top-10 retrieved passages. As a result, the impact of the LLM positional bias, which in controlled settings is often reported as very prominent by related works, is actually marginal in real scenarios since both relevant and distracting passages are, in turn, penalized. Indeed, our findings reveal that sophisticated strategies that attempt to rearrange the passages based on LLM positional preferences do not perform better than random shuffling.</description>

      <title>ConvSearch-R1: Enhancing Query Reformulation for Conversational Search with Reasoning via Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Conversational search systems require effective handling of context-dependent queries that often contain ambiguity, omission, and coreference. Conversational Query Reformulation (CQR) addresses this challenge by transforming these queries into self-contained forms suitable for off-the-shelf retrievers. However, existing CQR approaches suffer from two critical constraints: high dependency on costly external supervision from human annotations or large language models, and insufficient alignment between the rewriting model and downstream retrievers. We present ConvSearch-R1, the first self-driven framework that completely eliminates dependency on external rewrite supervision by leveraging reinforcement learning to optimize reformulation directly through retrieval signals. Our novel two-stage approach combines Self-Driven Policy Warm-Up to address the cold-start problem through retrieval-guided self-distillation, followed by Retrieval-Guided Reinforcement Learning with a specially designed rank-incentive reward shaping mechanism that addresses the sparsity issue in conventional retrieval metrics. Extensive experiments on TopiOCQA and QReCC datasets demonstrate that ConvSearch-R1 significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods, achieving over 10% improvement on the challenging TopiOCQA dataset while using smaller 3B parameter models without any external supervision.</description>

      <title>The Atlas of In-Context Learning: How Attention Heads Shape In-Context Retrieval Augmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models are able to exploit in-context learning to access external knowledge beyond their training data through retrieval-augmentation. While promising, its inner workings remain unclear. In this work, we shed light on the mechanism of in-context retrieval augmentation for question answering by viewing a prompt as a composition of informational components. We propose an attribution-based method to identify specialized attention heads, revealing in-context heads that comprehend instructions and retrieve relevant contextual information, and parametric heads that store entities' relational knowledge. To better understand their roles, we extract function vectors and modify their attention weights to show how they can influence the answer generation process. Finally, we leverage the gained insights to trace the sources of knowledge used during inference, paving the way towards more safe and transparent language models.</description>

      <title>IntentRec: Predicting User Session Intent with Hierarchical Multi-Task Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05353v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems have played a critical role in diverse digital services such as e-commerce, streaming media, social networks, etc. If we know what a user's intent is in a given session (e.g. do they want to watch short videos or a movie or play games; are they shopping for a camping trip), it becomes easier to provide high-quality recommendations. In this paper, we introduce IntentRec, a novel recommendation framework based on hierarchical multi-task neural network architecture that tries to estimate a user's latent intent using their short- and long-term implicit signals as proxies and uses the intent prediction to predict the next item user is likely to engage with. By directly leveraging the intent prediction, we can offer accurate and personalized recommendations to users. Our comprehensive experiments on Netflix user engagement data show that IntentRec outperforms the state-of-the-art next-item and next-intent predictors. We also share several findings and downstream applications of IntentRec.</description>

      <title>Variations in Relevance Judgments and the Shelf Life of Test Collections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20937v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The fundamental property of Cranfield-style evaluations, that system rankings are stable even when assessors disagree on individual relevance decisions, was validated on traditional test collections. However, the paradigm shift towards neural retrieval models affected the characteristics of modern test collections, e.g., documents are short, judged with four grades of relevance, and information needs have no descriptions or narratives. Under these changes, it is unclear whether assessor disagreement remains negligible for system comparisons. We investigate this aspect under the additional condition that the few modern test collections are heavily re-used. Given more possible query interpretations due to less formalized information needs, an ``expiration date'' for test collections might be needed if top-effectiveness requires overfitting to a single interpretation of relevance. We run a reproducibility study and re-annotate the relevance judgments of the 2019~TREC Deep Learning track. We can reproduce prior work in the neural retrieval setting, showing that assessor disagreement does not affect system rankings. However, we observe that some models substantially degrade with our new relevance judgments, and some have already reached the effectiveness of humans as rankers, providing evidence that test collections can expire.</description>

      <title>Are AI Agents interacting with Online Ads?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07112v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As AI-driven agents become increasingly integrated into the digital ecosystem, they reshape how online advertising is perceived and processed. Particularly in the travel and hotel booking sector, these autonomous systems influence the effectiveness of traditional advertising formats. While visual cues and emotional appeals sway human users, AI agents prioritize structured data such as price, availability, and specifications. This study examines how different AI agents interact with online advertising, whether they incorporate ads into their decision-making processes, and which ad formats prove most effective. We analyze interaction patterns, click behavior, and decision-making strategies through experiments with multimodal language models such as OpenAI GPT-4o, Anthropic Claude, and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash. Our findings reveal that AI agents neither ignore nor systematically avoid advertisements but instead favor certain features-particularly keywords and structured data. These insights have significant implications for the future design of advertising strategies in AI-dominated digital environments.</description>

      <title>Boosting Text-to-Chart Retrieval through Training with Synthesized Semantic Insights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Charts are crucial for data analysis and decision-making.Text-to-chart retrieval systems have become increasingly important for Business Intelligence (BI), where users need to find relevant charts that match their analytical needs. These needs can be categorized into precise queries that are well-specified and fuzzy queries that are more exploratory -- both require understanding the semantics and context of the charts. However, existing text-to-chart retrieval solutions often fail to capture the semantic content and contextual information of charts, primarily due to the lack of comprehensive metadata (or semantic insights). To address this limitation, we propose a training data development pipeline that automatically synthesizes hierarchical semantic insights for charts, covering visual patterns (visual-oriented), statistical properties (statistics-oriented), and practical applications (task-oriented), which produces 207,498 semantic insights for 69,166 charts. Based on these, we train a CLIP-based model named ChartFinder to learn better representations of charts for text-to-chart retrieval. Our method leverages rich semantic insights during the training phase to develop a model that understands both visual and semantic aspects of charts.To evaluate text-to-chart retrieval performance, we curate the first benchmark, CRBench, for this task with 21,862 charts and 326 text queries from real-world BI applications, with ground-truth labels verified by the crowd workers.Experiments show that ChartFinder significantly outperforms existing methods in text-to-chart retrieval tasks across various settings. For precise queries, ChartFinder achieves up to 66.9% NDCG@10, which is 11.58% higher than state-of-the-art models. In fuzzy query tasks, our method also demonstrates consistent improvements, with an average increase of 5% across nearly all metrics.</description>

      <title>Explain What You Mean: Intent Augmented Knowledge Graph Recommender Built With An LLM</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10900v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interaction sparsity is a long-standing challenge in recommendation systems. Sparsity manifests in environments with disproportional cardinality of groupings of entities, such as users and products in an online marketplace. It is also found for newly introduced entities, described as the cold-start problem. Recent efforts to mitigate this issue either enrich the connectivity data by incorporating social networks or external knowledge graphs, or fine-tune LLMs into interaction augmenters or next-item recommenders. However, these techniques tend to be resource demanding, requiring high computational power. They also have several limitations, including data availability, low quality, or synthetic noise issues. In this work, we propose LLM-based Intent Knowledge Graph Recommender (IKGR), a novel framework that leverages retrieval-augmented generation and an encoding approach to construct and densify a knowledge graph. IKGR leverages latent user-item affinities from an interaction knowledge graph and further densifies it through mutual intent connectivity. This addresses sparsity issues and allows the model to make intent-grounded recommendations with an interpretable embedding translation layer. Through extensive experiments on real-world datasets, we demonstrate that IKGR overcomes knowledge gaps and achieves substantial gains over state-of-the-art baselines on both publicly available and our internal recommendation datasets.</description>

      <title>MIRACL-VISION: A Large, multilingual, visual document retrieval benchmark</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11651v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Document retrieval is an important task for search and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. Large Language Models (LLMs) have contributed to improving the accuracy of text-based document retrieval. However, documents with complex layout and visual elements like tables, charts and infographics are not perfectly represented in textual format. Recently, image-based document retrieval pipelines have become popular, which use visual large language models (VLMs) to retrieve relevant page images given a query. Current evaluation benchmarks on visual document retrieval are limited, as they primarily focus only English language, rely on synthetically generated questions and offer a small corpus size. Therefore, we introduce MIRACL-VISION, a multilingual visual document retrieval evaluation benchmark. MIRACL-VISION covers 18 languages, and is an extension of the MIRACL dataset, a popular benchmark to evaluate text-based multilingual retrieval pipelines. MIRACL was built using a human-intensive annotation process to generate high-quality questions. In order to reduce MIRACL-VISION corpus size to make evaluation more compute friendly while keeping the datasets challenging, we have designed a method for eliminating the "easy" negatives from the corpus. We conducted extensive experiments comparing MIRACL-VISION with other benchmarks, using popular public text and image models. We observe a gap in state-of-the-art VLM-based embedding models on multilingual capabilities, with up to 59.7% lower retrieval accuracy than a text-based retrieval models. Even for the English language, the visual models retrieval accuracy is 12.1% lower compared to text-based models. MIRACL-VISION is a challenging, representative, multilingual evaluation benchmark for visual retrieval pipelines and will help the community build robust models for document retrieval.</description>

      <title>PoisonArena: Uncovering Competing Poisoning Attacks in Retrieval-Augmented Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.12574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems, widely used to improve the factual grounding of large language models (LLMs), are increasingly vulnerable to poisoning attacks, where adversaries inject manipulated content into the retriever's corpus. While prior research has predominantly focused on single-attacker settings, real-world scenarios often involve multiple, competing attackers with conflicting objectives. In this work, we introduce PoisonArena, the first benchmark to systematically study and evaluate competing poisoning attacks in RAG. We formalize the multi-attacker threat model, where attackers vie to control the answer to the same query using mutually exclusive misinformation. PoisonArena leverages the Bradley-Terry model to quantify each method's competitive effectiveness in such adversarial environments. Through extensive experiments on the Natural Questions and MS MARCO datasets, we demonstrate that many attack strategies successful in isolation fail under competitive pressure. Our findings highlight the limitations of conventional evaluation metrics like Attack Success Rate (ASR) and F1 score and underscore the need for competitive evaluation to assess real-world attack robustness. PoisonArena provides a standardized framework to benchmark and develop future attack and defense strategies under more realistic, multi-adversary conditions.

      <title>A Comprehensive Evaluation of Large Language Models on Temporal Event Forecasting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11638v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential in various data mining tasks, such as knowledge question answering, mathematical reasoning, and commonsense reasoning. However, the reasoning capability of LLMs on temporal event forecasting has been under-explored. To systematically investigate their abilities in temporal event forecasting, we conduct a comprehensive evaluation of LLM-based methods for temporal event forecasting. Due to the lack of a high-quality dataset that involves both graph and textual data, we first construct a benchmark dataset, named MidEast-TE-mini. Based on this dataset, we design a series of baseline methods, characterized by various input formats and retrieval augmented generation (RAG) modules. From extensive experiments, we find that directly integrating raw texts into the input of LLMs does not enhance zero-shot extrapolation performance. In contrast, fine-tuning LLMs with raw texts can significantly improve performance. Additionally, LLMs enhanced with retrieval modules can effectively capture temporal relational patterns hidden in historical events. However, issues such as popularity bias and the long-tail problem persist in LLMs, particularly in the retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method. These findings not only deepen our understanding of LLM-based event forecasting methods but also highlight several promising research directions. We consider that this comprehensive evaluation, along with the identified research opportunities, will significantly contribute to future research on temporal event forecasting through LLMs.</description>

      <title>MIRe: Enhancing Multimodal Queries Representation via Fusion-Free Modality Interaction for Multimodal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08334</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08334v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent multimodal retrieval methods have endowed text-based retrievers with multimodal capabilities by utilizing pre-training strategies for visual-text alignment. They often directly fuse the two modalities for cross-reference during the alignment to understand multimodal queries. However, existing methods often overlook crucial visual information due to a text-dominant issue, which overly depends on text-driven signals. In this paper, we introduce MIRe, a retrieval framework that achieves modality interaction without fusing textual features during the alignment. Our method allows the textual query to attend to visual embeddings while not feeding text-driven signals back into the visual representations. Additionally, we construct a pre-training dataset for multimodal query retrieval by transforming concise question-answer pairs into extended passages. Our experiments demonstrate that our pre-training strategy significantly enhances the understanding of multimodal queries, resulting in strong performance across four multimodal retrieval benchmarks under zero-shot settings. Moreover, our ablation studies and analyses explicitly verify the effectiveness of our framework in mitigating the text-dominant issue.

      <title>Aggregation Schemes for Single-Vector WSI Representation Learning in Digital Pathology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17822v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A crucial step to efficiently integrate Whole Slide Images (WSIs) in computational pathology is assigning a single high-quality feature vector, i.e., one embedding, to each WSI. With the existence of many pre-trained deep neural networks and the emergence of foundation models, extracting embeddings for sub-images (i.e., tiles or patches) is straightforward. However, for WSIs, given their high resolution and gigapixel nature, inputting them into existing GPUs as a single image is not feasible. As a result, WSIs are usually split into many patches. Feeding each patch to a pre-trained model, each WSI can then be represented by a set of patches, hence, a set of embeddings. Hence, in such a setup, WSI representation learning reduces to set representation learning where for each WSI we have access to a set of patch embeddings. To obtain a single embedding from a set of patch embeddings for each WSI, multiple set-based learning schemes have been proposed in the literature. In this paper, we evaluate the WSI search performance of multiple recently developed aggregation techniques (mainly set representation learning techniques) including simple average or max pooling operations, Deep Sets, Memory networks, Focal attention, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) Fisher Vector, and deep sparse and binary Fisher Vector on four different primary sites including bladder, breast, kidney, and Colon from TCGA. Further, we benchmark the search performance of these methods against the median of minimum distances of patch embeddings, a non-aggregating approach used for WSI retrieval.</description>

      <title>GLTW: Joint Improved Graph Transformer and LLM via Three-Word Language for Knowledge Graph Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Knowledge Graph Completion (KGC), which aims to infer missing or incomplete facts, is a crucial task for KGs. However, integrating the vital structural information of KGs into Large Language Models (LLMs) and outputting predictions deterministically remains challenging. To address this, we propose a new method called GLTW, which encodes the structural information of KGs and merges it with LLMs to enhance KGC performance. Specifically, we introduce an improved Graph Transformer (iGT) that effectively encodes subgraphs with both local and global structural information and inherits the characteristics of language model, bypassing training from scratch. Also, we develop a subgraph-based multi-classification training objective, using all entities within KG as classification objects, to boost learning efficiency.Importantly, we combine iGT with an LLM that takes KG language prompts as input.Our extensive experiments on various KG datasets show that GLTW achieves significant performance gains compared to SOTA baselines.</description>

      <title>Scaling Laws for Many-Shot In-Context Learning with Self-Generated Annotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03062v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The high cost of obtaining high-quality annotated data for in-context learning (ICL) has motivated the development of methods that use self-generated annotations in place of ground-truth labels. While these approaches have shown promising results in few-shot settings, they generally do not scale to many-shot scenarios. In this work, we study ICL with self-generated examples using a framework analogous to traditional semi-supervised learning, consisting of annotation generation, demonstration selection, and in-context inference. Within this framework, we propose a simple baseline that outperforms ground-truth ICL in zero-shot, few-shot, and many-shot settings. Notably, we observe a scaling law with this baseline, where optimal performance is achieved with more than 1,000 demonstrations. To fully exploit the many-shot capabilities of semi-supervised ICL, we introduce IterPSD, an iterative annotation approach that integrates iterative refinement and curriculum pseudo-labeling techniques from semi-supervised learning, yielding up to 6.8% additional gains on classification tasks.</description>

      <title>MacRAG: Compress, Slice, and Scale-up for Multi-Scale Adaptive Context RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06569v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Long-context large language models (LC LLMs) combined with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) hold strong potential for complex multi-hop and large-document tasks. However, existing RAG systems often suffer from imprecise retrieval, incomplete context coverage under constrained windows, and fragmented information from suboptimal context construction. We introduce Multi-scale Adaptive Context RAG (MacRAG), a hierarchical RAG framework that compresses and partitions documents into coarse-to-fine granularities, then adaptively merges relevant contexts through real-time chunk- and document-level expansions. By initiating with finest-level retrieval and progressively incorporating broader, higher-level context, MacRAG constructs effective query-specific long contexts, optimizing both precision and coverage. Evaluations on challenging LongBench expansions of HotpotQA, 2WikiMultihopQA, and Musique confirm MacRAG consistently surpasses baseline RAG pipelines in single- and multi-step generation using Llama-3.1-8B, Gemini-1.5-pro, and GPT-4o. Our results establish MacRAG as an efficient, scalable solution for real-world long-context, multi-hop reasoning. Our code is available at https://github.com/Leezekun/MacRAG.</description>

      <title>Securing RAG: A Risk Assessment and Mitigation Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08728v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the de facto industry standard for user-facing NLP applications, offering the ability to integrate data without re-training or fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). This capability enhances the quality and accuracy of responses but also introduces novel security and privacy challenges, particularly when sensitive data is integrated. With the rapid adoption of RAG, securing data and services has become a critical priority. This paper first reviews the vulnerabilities of RAG pipelines, and outlines the attack surface from data pre-processing and data storage management to integration with LLMs. The identified risks are then paired with corresponding mitigations in a structured overview. In a second step, the paper develops a framework that combines RAG-specific security considerations, with existing general security guidelines, industry standards, and best practices. The proposed framework aims to guide the implementation of robust, compliant, secure, and trustworthy RAG systems.</description>
