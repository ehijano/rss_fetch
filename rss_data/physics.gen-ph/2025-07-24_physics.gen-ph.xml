      <title>Fractional time approach to a generalized quantum light-matter system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates the fractional time description of a generalized quantum light-matter system modeled by a time-dependent Jaynes-Cummings (JC) interaction. Distinct fractional effects are included by considering two approaches for the power in the imaginary unit of the Schr\"odinger equation. Additionally, we consider various time modulations in the coupling (constant, linear, exponential, and sinusoidal) and analyze their consequences on population inversion and entanglement. The assumption of fractional order leads to distinct consequences in the considered quantities, such as oscillations with decreasing amplitude around a fixed value or decay to an asymptotic value. The time-dependent couplings influence how these effects occur, eventually resulting in high or low degrees of entanglement. Notably, with sinusoidal coupling, we find that non-periodic behavior is preserved under both treatments of the imaginary unit; however, with decreasing fractional order, the non-periodic dynamics can be suppressed.</description>

      <title>Top Quark Bound States in Finite and Holomorphic Quantum Field Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a unified theoretical study of the recently observed threshold enhancement in top-antitop production at the LHC known as toponium. First, we extend the finite, nonlocal quantum field theories to derive a modified Bethe-Salpeter equation for heavy quark-antiquark bound states, incorporating exp wential regulator functions that render all loop amplitudes ultraviolet finite. We show that nonlocal propagators induce characteristic shifts in the resonance mass and width, which can be contrasted directly with LHC data. Second, we analyse the renormalization group flow of the strong coupling near the top-pair threshold, introducing a holomorphic deformation inspired by unified field-theoretic constructions. We find that the modified $\beta$-function softens the running of \(\alpha_s\) around \(2m_t\), giving a subtle enhancement of the threshold cross-section. Third, we present a systematic comparison of charmonium, bottomonium, and toponium, quantifying differences in binding energies, lifetimes, and production signatures. In particular, the top quark's large width precludes long-lived bound states, so that toponium appears only as a transient threshold resonance. Taken together, our results demonstrate that toponium not only probes nonlocal UV completions of QCD but also offers a novel window onto holomorphic renormalization group dynamics and the broader phenomenology of heavy quarkonium.</description>

      <title>Geodesics of charged particle in electromagnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report calculations about the motion of a charged particle in an external electric and magnetic field. The metric for the particle moving on a slope with non-zero traction and coefficient of friction is also evaluated for weak fields. We have geometric solutions in terms of Finsler geometry. We show that our solution metrics belong to the ({\alpha}, \b{eta})-metric class for cases with and without motion on a slope. Further, the external magnetic field is manifested in an additional parameter in the metric. The geodesic spray coefficients under the influence of magnetic field have also been calculated. Finally, we have estimated the indicatrices and geodesics for slippery plane and cone.</description>
