      <title>Low-density InGaAs/AlGaAs Quantum Dots in Droplet-Etched Nanoholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past two decades, epitaxial semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) have demonstrated very promising properties as sources of single photons and entangled photons on-demand. Among different growth methods, droplet etching epitaxy has allowed the growth of almost strain-free QDs, with low and controllable surface densities, small excitonic fine structure splitting (FSS), and fast radiative decays. Here, we extend the local droplet etching technique to In(Ga)As QDs in AlGaAs, thereby increasing the achievable emission wavelength range beyond that accessible to GaAs/AlGaAs QDs, while benefiting from the aforementioned advantages of this growth method. We observe QD densities of $\sim 0.2\ \mu\mathrm{m}^{-2}$, FSS values as small as $3\ \mu\mathrm{eV}$, and short radiative lifetimes of $\sim 300\ \mathrm{ps}$, while extending the achievable emission range to $\sim 920\ \mathrm{nm}$ at cryogenic temperatures. We envision these QDs to be particularly suitable for integrated quantum photonics applications.</description>

      <title>Comparative Study of Lateral and Vertical Beta-Ga2O3 Photoconductive Switches via Intrinsic and Extrinsic Optical Triggering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gallium oxide (Ga2O3), with its ultra-wide bandgap (approximately 4.8 eV) and high breakdown field (approximately 8 MV per cm), is a leading candidate for photoconductive semiconductor switches (PCSSs) in high-power and high-speed pulsed applications. This work, for the first time, presents a systematic experimental comparison of lateral and vertical beta-Ga2O3 PCSS under both intrinsic (245 nm) and extrinsic (280 nm, 300 nm, and 445 nm) optical excitation. Under intrinsic excitation, where carrier generation is confined near the surface due to the shallow absorption depth (approximately between 0.1 and 1 um), the lateral PCSS demonstrated higher photocurrent performance compared to the vertical structure. In contrast, under extrinsic excitation, which enables deeper penetration into the bulk, the vertical PCSS exhibited enhanced switching performance due to a more uniform electric-field distribution across the device volume. These results highlight the critical role of device geometry and carrier generation mechanism in optimizing Ga2O3 PCSS performance and provide valuable guidance for developing efficient and cost-effective high-voltage PCSSs.</description>

      <title>Multimodal learning enables instant ionizing radiation alerts on unmodified mobile phones for real-world emergency response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08541v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a radiation emergency, every second counts, yet the public rarely has immediate access to dedicated monitoring devices when they are needed most. Here, the first practical mobile phone-based emergency ionizing radiation detection method is presented that operates entirely without requiring camera coverage or additional hardware modifications. Utilizing a multimodal deep learning approach that integrates sparse radiation-induced signal distributions with the brightness patterns, the proposed framework effectively isolates subtle radiation signals from overwhelming visual interference. A hybrid 3D-2D convolutional neural network (CNN) identifies radiation-induced spots from raw mobile phone video, while a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) fuses the radiation signal and brightness maps for the dose rate estimation. The method detects hazardous dose rates (25-280 mRem/h) rapidly within six seconds (accuracy 86-96%), and low-level radiation (-0.6 mRem/h) with extended measurement durations achieves 87% accuracy. The developed method greatly enhances mobile phone radiation detection practicality and shows substantial potential as an accessible radiation emergency detection tool.</description>

      <title>Electronic transport and Fermi surface of Weyl semimetal WTe2: quantum oscillations and first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Currently, topological semimetals are being actively investigated from both theoretical and experimental perspectives due to their unique physical properties, including topologically protected states, large magnetoresistivity, and high carrier mobility, which make these materials promising for various applications in electronics. In this work, we present experimental and theoretical studies of the electronic structure and electronic transport in the Weyl semimetal $WTe_2$. Band structure of $WTe_2$ was scrutinized with DFT+U+SOC method showing the semimetallic nature and sensitivity of the structure to the value of U and to changes in the Fermi energy. Our results demonstrate that $WTe_2$ is in a near-compensated state and exhibits an almost quadratic non-saturating magnetoresistivity. It is found that $WTe_2$ violates the classical Kohler's rule, which is attributed to the coexistence of multiple scattering mechanisms and a strong temperature dependence of the current carrier concentration. Analysis of the Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations reveals three distinct frequencies corresponding to two electron and one hole Fermi surface pockets, which are well reproduced in Fermi surface calculations. Using the Lifshitz-Kosevich formalism, we determined the electronic structure parameters for each Fermi surface pocket. Additionally, we discuss the relationship between the g-factor and the Berry phase extracted from quantum oscillations.</description>

      <title>Macroscopic properties of high-harmonic generation from molecular ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the existing framework of macroscopic HHG to combine it with high-accuracy ab initio calculations for molecules as microscopic input. This approach is applied to HHG spectra exhibiting Mollow sidebands, for open shell molecules undergoing nonadiabatic dynamics. We demonstrate the details of the method and analyze how the predicted features in the microscopic HHG response unambiguously survive macroscopic response calculations, and furthermore they exhibit a interesting angular pattern in the far-field. We calculate the macroscopic harmonic spectrum by combining many single-molecule calculations at different intensities, obtained in one case from time-dependent density functional theory calculations for N+ 2 , in second case for one electron time dependent Schr\"odinger equation for a 1D double well model potential. For both cases one can observe that the resulting macroscopic spectra exhibit Mollow sidebands of approximately the same intensity as the main harmonics, while being radiated at wider angles, meaning they could be isolated more easily in an experiment.</description>

      <title>Quadrupolar gyration of a Brownian particle in a confining ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a minimal theoretical model that reveals a structured steady-state flux field with four alternating local circulation, a phenomenon we refer to as quadrupolar gyration. A passive Brownian particle is confined to move in a ring-shaped trap and driven far from equilibrium solely by anisotropic thermal fluctuations from two orthogonal heat baths held at different temperatures. By breaking detailed balance, this fundamental temperature anisotropy induces a robust nonequilibrium steady state characterized by probability currents of the particle's motion. Remarkably, these currents self-organize into a distinctive quadrupolar vortex pattern, providing a clear signature of emergent symmetry breaking, irreversible entropy production, and coherent motion in minimal passive systems.</description>

      <title>Above room temperature multiferroic tunnel junction with the altermagnetic metal CrSb</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13850v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Altermagnets with nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting and compensated net magnetic moments have recently garnered significant interest in spintronics, particularly as pinning layers in magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs). However, room temperature (RT) altermagnet-based MTJs with tunable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) or electroresistance (TER) modulated by multiferroicity remain largely unexplored. Here, we propose an experimentally fabricable above-RT multiferroic MTJ, comprising an altermagnetic metal, ferroelectric barrier, and ferromagnetic metal-epitomized by a CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 heterostructure. Our calculations with first-principles and nonequilibrium Green function method indicate that the architecture enables magnetically switchable TER, electrically tunable TMR, and dual-mode controllable spin filtering. To disentangle the roles of ferroelectricity and the tunnel barrier, nonferroelectric Sb2Se3 and a vacuum gap are exploited as control cases. Remarkably, the system achieves TMR up to 2308%, TER of 707%, and near-perfect spin filtering efficiency. Both TMR and TER are considerable for CrSb/In2Se3/Fe3GaTe2 with either Cr or Sb interface. The transport performance is robust under bias voltage. These findings demonstrate the above-RT multiferroic altermagnet-based MTJs and highlight their exciting potential as a versatile platform for next-generation spin dynamics, magnetic sensing, and quantum logic nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Closer look at sum uncertainty relations and related relations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09122v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the weak and critical points of various uncertainty relations that follow from the inequalities for the norms of vectors in the Hilbert space of states of a quantum system. There are studied uncertainty relations for sums of standard deviations, for sums of variances, and other relations between standard deviations or variances. The obtained results are compared with the conclusions obtained in similar cases using the standard Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation. We also show that there exists an upper bound on the product of standard deviations that appears in the Heisenberg-Robertson uncertainty relation.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Lumerical FDTD and Tidy3D for three-dimensional FDTD simulations of passive silicon photonic components</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We benchmark Lumerical FDTD and Tidy3D for 3D simulations of passive silicon photonic components on the SOI platform. Five devices -- including an MMI, directional coupler, waveguide crossing, mode converter, and polarization splitter rotator -- are simulated under matched conditions using geometries from the generic PDK from GDSFactory. We compare simulation accuracy, runtime, and transmission spectra across varying resolutions and bandwidths. Results reinforce that both solver are reliable with minimal discrepancies. Overall, Tidy3D is well suited for rapid prototyping while Lumerical FDTD remains a robust option for complex simulations.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependent Mechanical and Structural Properties of Uniaxially Strained Planar Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14709v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations in a planar graphene sheet, we investigate the temperature dependence of its mechanical behavior under uniaxial tensile stress applied either along the armchair or the zigzag direction. Stress-strain curves are calculated for different temperatures and the corresponding dependence of various elastic parameters, like the Young modulus, the third-order elastic modulus, the tensile strength and failure strain, is presented. Fracture stress and strain, as well as the Young modulus, decrease almost linearly with temperature. The distributions of bond lengths and bond angles at different strains and temperatures are also discussed and approximate analytical expressions are presented. The latter describe accurately the numerically obtained distributions.</description>
