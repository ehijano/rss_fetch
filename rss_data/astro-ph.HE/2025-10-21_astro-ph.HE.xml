      <title>Early X-ray emission of short Gamma-Ray Bursts: insights into physics and multi-messenger prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Early X-ray emission of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) traces the transition between the prompt emission and the afterglow radiation, and its rapid flux decline is often interpreted as the tail of the prompt emission. As such, it can offer insights into the emission mechanisms active during the prompt emission and the physics of GRB jets. In this work, we focus on merger-driven GRBs, which are sources of gravitational waves (GWs) detectable by ground-based interferometers, such as LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. We present a systematic analysis of the early X-ray emission ($t &lt; 10^3 \ \mathrm{s}$) of a sample of 16 merger-driven GRB candidates detected by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory (hereafter, Swift). We performed a time-resolved spectral analysis of soft and hard X-ray data (0.3-150 keV) by fitting two curved spectral models to the spectra: a physical synchrotron model and an empirical smoothly broken power law model. We characterized the evolution of the peak energy and bolometric flux, and derived the intrinsic properties of the 10 bursts with measured redshift. We discovered a tight correlation between the rest-frame peak energy of the spectra and the isotropic-equivalent luminosity. Specifically, we obtained $\nu_{c,z} \propto L_{\rm iso}^{(0.64 \pm 0.03)}$ when adopting the synchrotron model, and $E_{p,z} \propto L_{\rm iso}^{(0.58 \pm 0.04)}$ when adopting the smoothly broken power law. Both relations were extrapolated to the typical prompt emission energies and well describe the properties of short GRBs detected in the MeV gamma-rays. These results suggest a common origin for the prompt and steep-decay emissions in merger-driven GRBs, and rule out high-latitude emission as the dominant process shaping the early X-ray tails. Finally, we assessed the detectability of these sources with the Wide-field X-ray Telescope onboard the Einstein Probe mission.</description>

      <title>Detection of Compton scattering in the jet of 3C 84</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 3C 84 is the brightest cluster galaxy in the Perseus Cluster. It is among the closest radio-loud active galaxies and among the very few that can be detected from low frequency radio up to TeV $\gamma$-rays. Here we report on the first X-ray polarization observation of 3C~84 with the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer, for a total of 2.2 Msec that coincides with a flare in $\gamma$-rays. This is the longest observation for a radio-loud active galaxy that allowed us to reach unprecedented sensitivity, leading to the detection of an X-ray polarization degree of $\rm\Pi_X=4.2\pm1.3\%$ ($\sim3.2\sigma$ confidence) at an X-ray electric vector polarization angle of $\rm \psi_X=163^{\circ}\pm9^{\circ}$, that is aligned with the radio jet direction on the sky. Optical polarization observations show fast variability about the jet axis as well. Our results strongly favor models in which X-rays are produced by Compton scattering from relativistic electrons -- specifically Synchrotron Self-Compton -- that takes places downstream, away from the supermassive black hole.</description>

      <title>GRB 230307A Formed No Dust or Was Not a Binary Neutron Star Merger</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new analysis of the JWST infrared spectra of GRB 230307A (AT 2023vfi), a long gamma-ray burst (GRB) with an infrared excess and spectral lines suggestive of significant heavy $r$-process production. The spectra, taken 29 and 61~days after the GRB trigger, have blackbody-like continua with $T_{\rm eff} \approx 550$ K and an emission line near $2.1$ $\mu$m, previously attributed to [Te III]. This line identification has been used as evidence for an $r$-process-powered kilonova (KN), despite no KN model producing a blackbody-like spectrum at late times. Such an infrared continuum could be emitted by newly formed dust, and we model the thermal emission to infer dust properties, including composition and mass. We find that the emission requires at least 3--$6 \times 10^{-3}$~M$_{\odot}$ of carbon or silicate dust, which is inconsistent with $r$-process yields expected from a neutron star merger. Alternatively, the continuum could be from $2\times 10^{-3}$~M$_{\odot}$ of metallic iron dust, which is mildly consistent (at 3$\sigma$) with KN models, but such dust is unlikely to form in the expanding ejecta. GRB 230307A's low late-time luminosity also constrains the amount of radioactive $^{56}$Ni produced to $&lt;2.6 \times 10^{-3}$~M$_{\odot}$ (3$\sigma$). No KN model can simultaneously form the necessary dust for the infrared continuum and heavy elements for the [Te III] line. We conclude that the blackbody continuum is not due to dust emission, or GRB 230307A did not originate from a binary compact-object merger.</description>

      <title>Tracking optical variability and outflows across the accretion states of the black hole transient MAXI J1820+070</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a study of the minute-timescale optical variability and spectroscopic outflow signatures in the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820+070 during its 2018 outburst and re-brightenings. Minute-cadence, multi-filter optical light curves were obtained with the Las Cumbres Observatory network and the Al Sadeem Observatory (UAE) over 2018-2020, complemented by X-ray data from Swift/BAT, XRT, and MAXI. We also acquired contemporaneous low-resolution optical spectra with the 2.1 m OAN San Pedro Martir and OAGH Cananea telescopes (Mexico) and the 1.5 m G.D. Cassini telescope at Loiano (Italy). The optical fractional rms peaks in the hard state and is dominated by short-timescale flickering that strengthens toward longer wavelengths, suggesting that the variability is jet-driven. In this scenario, inflow fluctuations inject velocity perturbations at the jet base (internal shock model). The variability is quenched in the soft state, with any residual signal likely linked to accretion-flow fluctuations. This behaviour supports the accretion-ejection coupling in black hole binaries and shows that the jet's variability signature extends to optical wavelengths in all hard states. In the faintest hard states, residual optical variability may instead trace cyclo-synchrotron emission from the hot flow. The spectra show double-peaked emission lines and tentative cold-wind signatures during the hard state. Such winds were reported during the main 2018 outburst; here we find evidence of their presence also in later re-brightenings. Their absence in the soft state likely reflects stronger disc ionisation from the higher X-ray flux, suppressing low-ionisation optical features.</description>

      <title>Searching for Exotrojans in Pulsar Binary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16164v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trojan asteroids are found in the equilateral triangle Lagrange points of the Sun-Jupiter system in great number, though they also exist less prolifically in other Sun-planet systems. Despite up to planetary mass Trojans being predicted in extrasolar systems (i.e. exotrojans), they remain largely unconfirmed, though with recent strong candidate evidence emerging. We turn the current search for exotrojans to radio pulsars with low-mass companions ($\sim0.01\,\rm{M}_\odot$) using accurately measured pulse times of arrival. With techniques developed for detecting the reflex motion of a star due to a librating Trojan, we place reasonable mass constraints ($\sim 1\,\rm{M}_\oplus$) on potential exotrojans around binary pulsars observed in the NANOGrav 15-year data set. We find weak evidence consistent with $\sim1\,\rm{M}_{\rm J}$ exotrojans in the PSR~J0023+0923 and PSR~J1705$-$1903 systems, though the signals likely have a different, unknown source. We also place a libration-independent upper mass constraint of $\sim8$\,M$_{\rm J}$ on exotrojans in the PSR~1641+8049 binary system by looking for an inconsistency between the times of superior conjunction as measured by optical light curves and those predicted by radio timing.</description>

      <title>Charged pion chain decay and the cosmic ray positron flux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of the cosmic ray positron flux has attracted intense attention in recent years, especially because the observations suggest that it could receive contributions from sources such as pulsars or the self--annihilation or decay of dark matter particles. The main known source of relativistic positrons, that form the background to possible additional contributions, is the chain decay of $\pi^+$ produced in the inelastic interactions of cosmic rays with interstellar and circumstellar gas. The shape of the energy spectrum of positrons produced in these pion decays can be calculated exactly and is well known. However, surprisingly, some estimates of the contribution of the standard mechanism to the positron flux have adopted an incorrect spectral shape of the positron produced in these decays, following an error present in a 1997 paper of Moskalenko and Strong. In this work we report this error, discuss its origin, and estimate its impact on the numerical results.</description>

      <title>Rapidly rotating hot nuclear and hypernuclear compact stars: integral parameters and universal relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate hot, isentropic compact stars in the limiting cases of static and maximally rotating configurations, focusing on how variations in the symmetry energy of the equation of state derived from covariant density functional theory affect stellar properties. We consider both nucleonic and hyperonic matter with systematically varied symmetry energy slopes, fixed entropies per baryon $s / k_B=1$ and 3, and electron fractions $Y_e=0.1$ and $Y_e=0.4$, representative of conditions in binary neutron star mergers and proto-neutron stars. We compute and analyze mass--radius and moment--of--inertia--mass relations, as well as the dependence of the Keplerian (mass-shedding) frequency on mass, angular momentum, and the ratio of kinetic to gravitational energy. Furthermore, we show that several universal relations between global properties remain valid across both nucleonic and hyperonic equations of state with varying symmetry energy, both in the static and Keplerian limit, and for various combinations of the fixed entropy and electron fraction.</description>

      <title>Accretion and Jet Coupling in Powerful Radio Quasars at Cosmic Noon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present bolometric corrections, as a function of wavelength, for powerful radio-loud quasars from the Revised Third Cambridge Catalogue of Radio Galaxies (3CRR) at 1 &lt; z &lt; 2. The bolometric luminosities are derived by integrating the intrinsic accretion disk spectral energy distributions (SEDs) over the range 1{\mu}m-10keV (excluding reprocessed infrared emission) and integrating over inclination angles (to account for accretion disk emission anisotropy). We use accretion disk models, fitted to observed data, to self-consistently bridge the unobserved wavelength region between the UV and X-rays with no need for far-UV gap repair. The resulting bolometric corrections span a wide range (~1-400) across different wavelengths, showing minimal dependence on redshift, X-ray luminosity, and black hole mass, which is possibly due to a narrow range of these intrinsic AGN parameters in the sample. However, when the sample is divided by Eddington ratio, the X-ray bolometric corrections exhibit distinctly different values, with higher correction factors corresponding to higher Eddington ratios. We also examine the connection between total radio luminosity and accretion disk power. For most 3CRR sources, the radio power constitutes roughly 1%-10% of the accretion disk luminosity. However, quasars with compact jets exhibit higher radio luminosities for a given accretion disk power. This suggests a higher efficiency of conversion of accretion power to radio luminosity in the younger jets. Our results provide physically motivated bolometric corrections for powerful radio quasars that are applicable to powerful radio-loud quasars at any epoch.</description>

      <title>A Unified Maxwell-Bloch Framework for Multi-periodic 6.7 GHz Methanol Flaring in G9.62+0.20E</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze a decade of 6.7 GHz methanol monitoring data in G9.62+0.20E, confirming the known periodicities of p1 = 241.3 +/- 2.3 d and p2 = 52.5 +/- 0.3 d, and identifying three new cycles at p3 = 127.0 +/- 1.6 d, p4 = 163.9 +/- 2.9 d, and p5 = 204.1 +/- 1.5 d. The 241.3-d and 204.1-d periods occur in multiple velocity channels, while the others are confined to single components. Despite their diverse morphologies and timescales, all flares can be reproduced within a unified Maxwell-Bloch framework operating in the fast-transient superradiance regime, driven by narrow periodic pump excitations. Model fits yield consistent environmental parameters across periodicities (temperatures, collisional timescales), pointing to broadly uniform physical conditions in the masing region. The discovery of new periodicities and their unified Maxwell-Bloch modeling provide a consistent picture of multi-periodic flaring in G9.62+0.20E and support superradiance as a general framework for maser flaring.</description>

      <title>The metallicity dependence of long-duration gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both theoretical models and observations of collapsar created gamma-ray bursts -- typically long-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs) -- suggest that these transients cannot occur at high metallicity, likely due to angular momentum losses via stellar winds for potential progenitor stars. However, the precise metallicity threshold (if it is a hard threshold) above which the formation of LGRBs is suppressed is still a topic of discussion. We investigated observed LGRBs and the properties of their host galaxies to constrain this metallicity dependence. In order to compute LGRB rates we modelled the cosmic history of star formation, as a function of host galaxy metallicity and stellar mass, and added a LGRB efficiency function that can include various shapes including abrupt cutoffs and more gradual variations in the GRB yield with metallicity. In contrast to previous work, this model includes scatters in the relations between mass, metallicity, and star formation rate, as well as a scatter in the metallicity distribution inside galaxies. We then varied both the threshold value and shape, and compared it to observed LGRBs and the properties of their host galaxies. In our model a sharp cutoff at an oxygen abundance $Z_{\text{O/H}}=12+\log(\text{O/H})=8.6\pm0.1$ (corresponding to $\sim0.6Z_{\odot}$) provides the best explanation for the observed LGRB data. In contrast, a lower threshold proposed in literature (i.e. at $Z_{\text{O/H}}=8.3$ or $\sim0.3Z_{\odot}$) fits observations poorly. We therefore conclude that, in contrast to most theoretical LGRB models, a relatively high metallicity threshold at near-solar values provides the best match between our model and observed LGRBs.</description>

      <title>A Practical Framework for Estimating the Repetition Likelihood of Fast Radio Bursts from Spectral Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The repeating behavior of fast radio bursts (FRBs) is regarded as a key clue to understanding their physical origin, yet reliably distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters with current observations remains challenging. Here we propose a physically interpretable and practically quantifiable classification framework based on spectral morphology. Using dimensionality reduction, clustering, and feature-importance analysis, we identify the spectral running $r$ and spectral index $\gamma$ as the most critical parameters for distinguishing repeaters from apparent non-repeaters in the CHIME/FRB sample. In the $\gamma$-$r$ space, repeaters preferentially occupy regions with steeper, narrower-band spectra, whereas non-repeaters cluster in flatter, broader-band regions, resulting in a clear density separation. We further construct an empirical probability map in the $\gamma$-$r$ space, showing a clear gradient of repetition likelihood, from $\sim 65\%$ in the high-repetition region to $\sim 5\%$ in the low-repetition region. Combining this with Gaussian Mixture Model posterior analysis, we identify several apparent non-repeaters with high inferred repetition probability, recommending them as priority targets for future monitoring. This framework provides a simple and generalizable tool for assessing repeatability in the CHIME/FRB sample and highlights the diagnostic power of spectral morphology in unveiling FRB origins.</description>

      <title>An Overview of Rossby Wave Instability in Accretion Discs surrounding Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rossby Wave Instability (RWI) has become an important concept in understanding the hydrodynamics (HDs) of accretion discs (ADs), especially in systems around black holes (BHs) where magnetic effects are either weak or absent. This instability is triggered by extrema (or sharp gradients) in the vortensity profile of the disc. Once activated, it leads to non-axisymmetric disturbances that can grow into large-scale vortices. These vortices play a significant role in the outward transport of angular momentum (AM). They may also help explain the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) observed in certain astrophysical systems such as X-ray binaries (XRBs). Here we review the main theoretical ideas behind RWI, as well as findings from more advanced three-dimensional (3D) and relativistic simulations. We also mention how the theory has been extended to include magnetic fields and self-gravity(SG) and what these results might imply for actual observations.</description>

      <title>Explodability matters: how realistic neutrino-driven explosions change explosive nucleosynthesis yields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Explosive nucleosynthesis is affected by many uncertainties, particularly regarding assumptions and prescriptions adopted during the evolution of the star. Moreover, simple explosion models are often used in the literature, which can introduce large errors in the assumed explosion energy and mass cut. In this paper, our goal is to analyze the explosion properties and nucleosynthesis of a large range of progenitors from three different stellar evolution codes: FRANEC, KEPLER, and MESA. In particular, we will show the differences between the neutrino-driven explosions simulated in this work with the much simpler bomb and piston models that are typically widely used in the literature. We will then focus on the impact of different explodabilities and different explosion dynamics on the nucleosynthetic yields. We adopt the neutrino-driven core-collapse supernova explosion code GR1D+, i.e. a spherically symmetric model with state-of-the-art microphysics and neutrino transport and a time-dependent mixing-length model for neutrino-driven convection. We carry out explosions up to several seconds after bounce, and then calculate the nucleosynthetic yields with the post-processing code SkyNet. We find that our 1D+ simulations yield explosion energies and remnant masses in agreement with observations of type II-P, IIb, and Ib supernovae, as well as with the most recent 3D simulations of the explosion. We provide a complete set of yields for all the stars simulated, including rotating, low-metallicity, and binary progenitors. Finally, we find that piston and bomb models, compared to more realistic neutrino-driven explosions, can artificially increase the production of Fe-peak elements, whereas the different explodability tends to cause discrepancies in the lighter elements.</description>

      <title>Implications of Joint Spectral Analysis of Gamma-Ray Bursts detected by Fermi Large Area Telescope and Gamma-ray Burst Monitor on Phenomenological Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16475v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) have emerged as powerful cosmological probes for exploring the distant Universe, owing to their immense luminosities and detectability at high redshifts. Several empirical correlations have been established, particularly involving their energy properties. This work aims to enhance the precision of these correlations through joint spectral analysis, focusing on reducing uncertainties in both the spectral indices and the peak energy ($E_{\rm p}$) derived from spectral fitting. We extend previous studies using both traditional and novel spectral models, utilizing a sample of 37 GRBs observed by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) and Large Area Telescope (LAT), incorporating the LAT Low-Energy (LLE) technique, over the period 2008-2024. Our analysis compares results from joint fits (GBM-LAT-LLE) against those from GBM-only fits. The study focuses on fitting time-integrated ${\rm T}_{90}$ and peak flux in the rest frame. Among the observable phenomenological correlations, we revisit the Amati and Yonetoku relations: the Amati relation links the intrinsic peak energy ($E_{i,\rm p}$) to the total isotropic energy ($E_{\rm iso}$) emitted during ${\rm T}_{90}$, while the Yonetoku relation connects $E_{i,\rm p}$ to the isotropic luminosity ($L_{\rm iso}$). Refining these correlations aims to deepen our understanding of GRB energetics and improve the precision of cosmological parameter estimates derived from GRB observations.</description>

      <title>A UV to X-Ray View of Soft Excess in Type 1 Active Galactic Nuclei. II. Broadband Correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical origin of soft X-ray excess (SE) is a long lasting question, with two prevailing theories -- ``warm corona'' and ``ionized reflection'' -- dominating the discussion. In the warm corona scenario, SE originates from upscattered disk photons and should therefore correlate strongly with UV emission. Conversely, in the ionized reflection scenario, SE arises from the illumination of the accretion disk by the hot corona and should primarily correlate with the hard X-ray primary continuum (PC). In this second paper of the series, we investigate the correlations among SE, UV and PC, leveraging a sample of 59 unobscured type 1 AGNs compiled in \citet{Chen+2025a}. Our extensive analysis reveals a strong intrinsic correlation between SE and UV that remains robust after controlling for PC ($p_\mathrm{null}\lesssim 10^{-7}$). In contrast, the correlation between SE and PC is weaker but still statistically significant ($p_\mathrm{null}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-2}$). These findings suggest that, in addition to ionized reflection -- a natural outcome of the hot corona illuminating the disk -- a warm corona component is essential, and may even dominate, in producing the soft excess. Additionally, we report a mild anti-correlation between SE strength ($q$) and PC photon index ($\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$) ($p_\mathrm{null}=10^{-2}$), suggesting a potential competition between the warm and hot coronae. Finally, we find that the $\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$ values we derived with SE properly incorporated exhibit a much weaker correlation with $\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ ($p_\mathrm{null}=2\times 10^{-2}$) than previously reported in the literature. This highlights the critical role of accurately modeling SE in studies of the $\Gamma_\mathrm{PC}$--$\lambda_\mathrm{Edd}$ relation.</description>

      <title>CAZ catalog and optical light curves of 7918 blazar-selected AGN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16584v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) are some of the brightest and most variable objects in the universe. Those with relativistic jets observed at small viewing angles are blazars. Due to Doppler-boosting, blazars exhibit extreme stochastic variability. While the origin of this variability is thought to be changes in the accretion flow and jet dynamics, much about blazar variability remains unknown. In this paper we use several blazar-dominated AGN samples to form a catalog of 7918 blazars and candidates -- the largest to date. We also collect source types, redshifts, spectral energy distribution (SED) peak frequencies, radio variability Doppler factors, and X-ray flux densities for as many sources as possible. We use all-sky surveys (CRTS, ATLAS, and ZTF, abbreviated as ``CAZ'') to extract their optical multiband flux density on a nightly basis between 2007 and 2023, and construct as long and as high cadence light curves as possible for as many sources as attainable. The catalog and its light curves are provided in the accompanying electronic tables, enabling many analyses involving AGN variability with unprecedented sample-sizes. We quantify the variability of the light curves, and apply the Bayesian blocks algorithm to determine their flaring periods. We find: (1) optical flares generally have a faster rise than decay; (2) optical brightness and variability are strongly dependent on the synchrotron peak frequency; (3) flat spectrum radio quasars and BL Lac objects have comparable optical variability and flare characteristics at the same synchrotron peak frequency; and (4) optical flare times tend to decrease and amplitudes increase with increasing radio variability Doppler factor.</description>

      <title>Association of the IceCube neutrinos with CAZ blazar light curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the past decade, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory has detected a few hundreds of high-energy (HE) neutrinos from cosmic sources. Despite numerous studies searching for their origin, it is still not known which source populations emit them. A few confident individual associations exist with active galactic nuclei (AGN), mostly with blazars which are jetted AGN whose jet points in our direction. Nonetheless, on a population level, blazar-neutrino correlation strengths are rather weak. This could mean that blazars as a population do not emit HE neutrinos, or that the detection power of the tests is insufficient due to the strong atmospheric neutrino background. By assuming an increase in HE neutrino emission during major blazar flares, in our previous studies we leveraged the arrival time of the neutrinos to boost the detection power. In this paper we utilize the same principle while substantially increasing the number of blazars. We search for the spatio-temporal correlation of 356 IceCube HE neutrinos with major optical flares of 3225 radio- and 3814 $\gamma$-ray-selected blazars. We find that, despite the increase in data size, the number of confident spatio-temporal associations remains low and the overall correlation strengths weak. Two individual associations drive our strongest and the only $&gt;$2$\sigma$ post-trial spatio-temporal correlation, occurring with the BL Lac objects of the radio-selected blazar sample. We estimate that $\lesssim$8\% of the detected cosmic neutrinos were emitted by blazars during major optical flares. As a complementary analysis, we compare the synchrotron peak frequency, redshift, Doppler factor, X-ray brightness, and optical variability of spatially neutrino-associated blazars to those of the general blazar population. We find that spatially neutrino-associated blazars of the tested samples have higher than average Doppler factor and X-ray brightness.</description>

      <title>TRAPUM search for pulsars in supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae - II. Survey analysis and population study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the second and final set of TRAPUM searches for pulsars at 1284 MHz inside supernova remnants and pulsar wind nebulae with the MeerKAT telescope. No new pulsars were detected for any of the 80 targets, which include some unidentified TeV sources that could be pulsar wind nebulae. The mean upper limit on the flux density of undetected pulsars is 52 $\mu$Jy, which includes the average sensitivity loss across the coherent beam tiling pattern. This survey is the largest and most sensitive multi-target campaign of its kind. We explore the selection effects that precluded discoveries by testing the parameters of the survey iteratively against many simulated populations of young pulsars in supernova remnants. For the synthetic pulsars that were undetected, we find evidence that, after beaming effects are accounted for, about 45 per cent of pulsars are too faint, 30 per cent are too smeared by scattering, and a further 25 per cent have a modelled projected location which places them outside their supernova remnant. The simulations are repeated for the S1 subband of the MeerKAT S-band receivers, resulting in a 50-150 per cent increase in the number of discoveries compared to L-band depending on the flux density limit achieved. Therefore, higher frequency searches that can also achieve improved flux density limits are the best hope for future targeted searches. We also report updated properties for the two previous discoveries, including a polarimetry study of PSR J1831$-$0941 finding a rotation measure of 401$\pm$1 rad m$^2$.</description>

      <title>CHIME-o-Grav: Wideband Timing of Four Millisecond Pulsars from the NANOGrav 15-yr dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16668v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wideband timing of the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) datasets, where a single time-of-arrival (TOA) and a single dispersion measure (DM) are measured using the entire bandwidth of each observation, was first done for the 12.5-year dataset, and proved to be invaluable for characterizing the time-varying dispersion measure, reducing the data volume, and for improving the overall timing precision. The Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) Telescope has been observing most NANOGrav millisecond pulsars (MSPs) at nearly daily cadence (compared to roughly monthly cadence for other NANOGrav observations) since 2019 with the objective of integration into future pulsar timing array (PTA) datasets. In this paper, we show the results of integration of high-cadence, low-observing-frequency CHIME data with data from the NANOGrav experiment for an isolated MSP PSR J0645$+$5158 and three binary MSPs PSR J1012$+$5307, PSR J2145$-$0750, and PSR J2302$+$4442. Using a wideband timing pipeline which we also describe, we present updated timing results for all four sources, including improvements in measurements of relativistic post-Keplerian parameters for the three binary pulsars in this analysis. For PSR J2302$+$4442, we report an updated strong detection of Shapiro delay from which we measured a companion mass of $0.35^{+0.05}_{-0.04}\ M_{\odot}$, a pulsar mass of $1.8^{+0.3}_{-0.3}\ M_{\odot}$, and an orbital inclination of ${80^{\circ}}^{+1}_{-2}$. We also report updated constraints on the reflex motion for PSR J2145$-$0750 using a combination of Very Long Baseline Array astrometry and our updated measurement of the time derivative of the projected semi-major axis of the pulsar orbit as a prior.</description>

      <title>The origin of the spectral versus dynamical age discrepancy in radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of turbulent magnetic fields on the observed spectral properties of synchrotron radio emission in large-scale radio galaxy lobes. We use three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations of fast, high-powered jets to study the structure of the lobe magnetic fields and how this structure affects the radio spectrum of the lobes. It has previously been argued that lobe ages inferred from radio spectra underestimate the true ages of radio galaxies due to re-acceleration of electrons in the lobe, mixing of electron populations, or the presence of turbulent magnetic fields in the lobes. We find that the spectral ages with and without accounting for the lobe magnetic field structure are consistent with each other, suggesting that mixing of radiating populations of different ages is the primary cause of the underestimation of radio lobe ages. By accounting for the structure of lobe magnetic fields, we find greater spectral steepening in the equatorial regions of the lobe. We demonstrate that the assumptions of the continuous injection, Jaffe-Perola, and Tribble models for radio lobe spectra do not hold in our simulations, and we show that young particles with high magnetic field strengths are the dominant contributors to the overall radio lobe spectrum.</description>

      <title>A transition from mixed-fuel to pure-helium thermonuclear bursts in Terzan 5 X-3/Swift J174805.3-244637</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We presented a detailed analysis of seven thermonuclear X-ray bursts from Terzan 5 X-3/Swift J174805.3-244637, detected by NICER during the source's 2023 outburst. Our analysis reveals a clear evolution of burst properties, identifying four non-photospheric radius expansion (non-PRE) bursts, one PRE candidate occurring in a mixed hydrogen/helium environment, and two powerful PRE bursts from pure helium ignition. The time-resolved burst spectra were well described by a model including a variable persistent emission component, quantified by a factor $f_a$, due to the Poynting-Robertson drag. The strength of this interaction scales with burst luminosity: the enhancement is absent ($f_a \approx 1$) in the faintest bursts, becomes modest ($f_a \approx 1.5-2$) for the more luminous non-PRE burst and the PRE candidate, and is very strong ($f_a \approx 6-8$) during the pure-helium PRE bursts. This observed transition from mixed-fuel to pure-helium burning as the local mass accretion rate dropped below $\sim$10% of the Eddington limit, $\dot{m}_{\rm Edd}$, aligns with theoretical predictions. We verified this scenario with two independent methods. First, at the known distance to Terzan 5, the touchdown luminosities of both the pure helium PRE bursts and the mixed-fuel PRE candidate are consistent with reaching their respective, composition-dependent Eddington limits on the same plausible, massive neutron star of $\sim 2 M_\odot$. Second, the observed recurrence times of the non-PRE bursts were consistent with predictions for mixed-fuel burning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I explore the origin of the circumstellar (CS) shell of the unusual SN Ia 2020aeuh based on the light curve model abd observational constraints. I estimate the $^{56}$Ni mass ($1.1 M\odot$), CS shell mass ($0.04-0.2 M\odot$), radius ($2\times10^{16}$ cm), and expansion velocity $\lesssim 200$ km/s. Large $^{56}$Ni mass and properties of the CS shell are consistent with the scenario of massive binary white dwarf merger that has been accompanied with the ejection of $\sim 0.1 M\odot$ of matter. It is argued that SN~2020aeuh exploded not earlier than 30 yr after the merger.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Kilonova Searches: A Case Study of the Type IIb SN 2025ulz in the Localization Volume of the Low-Significance Gravitational Wave Event S250818k</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kilonovae, the ultraviolet/optical/infrared counterparts to binary neutron star mergers, are an exceptionally rare class of transients. Optical follow-up campaigns are plagued by impostors whose early evolution masquerades as the rapid radioactive decay of heavy elements. In this work, we present an analysis of the multi-wavelength dataset of supernova (SN) 2025ulz, a proposed kilonova candidate following the low-significance detection of gravitational waves originating from the potential binary neutron star merger S250818k. Despite an early rapid decline in brightness, our multi-wavelength observations of SN 2025ulz reveal that it is a type IIb supernova. As part of this analysis, we demonstrate the capabilities of a novel quantitative scoring algorithm to determine the likelihood that a transient candidate is a kilonova, based primarily on its 3D location and light curve evolution. We also apply our scoring algorithm to other transient candidates in the localization volume of S250818k and find that, at all times after the discovery of SN 2025ulz, there are $\geq 4$ candidates with a score more promising than SN 2025ulz. During future kilonova searches, this type of scoring algorithm will be useful to rule out contaminating transients in real time, optimizing the use of valuable telescope resources.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Iron Spectrum with the MAGIC Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Iron cosmic rays represent the most abundant heavy nuclei at energies above 1 TeV, with their production thought to be primarily originated by astrophysical sources. Therefore, measuring the iron spectrum provides crucial insights into the origin, acceleration, and propagation mechanisms of cosmic rays. While recent results from space-based detectors have revealed unexpected energy dependences in the GeV-TeV range, these measurements are limited by low statistics at higher energies. At energies above a few TeV, ground-based detectors, such as the Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov (MAGIC) telescopes, become more effective due to their large collec- tion areas, enabling them to extend and complement the capabilities of space-borne instruments. In this work, we apply the so-called direct Cherenkov technique, which accounts for the radiation emitted by charged particles before the cascade develops in the atmosphere, with MAGIC to identify iron-induced air showers and distinguish them from those produced by lighter cosmic-ray species.</description>

      <title>An Overview of the Effect of Self-Gravity on the Structure of Accretion Discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In astrophysical systems like X-ray binaries (XRBs), active galactic nuclei (AGN), and young stellar objects (YSOs), we often observe a very fundamental structure called accretion discs(ADs). Conventional AD theory usually supposes that the gravitational field is controlled by a central compact object. This assumption breaks down when the mass of the disc becomes considerable in contrast to that of the massive central object. In these cases, the AD's self-gravity (SG) can drastically change its structure, dynamics, and evolution. This review investigates how SG influences the radial and vertical structure of ADs and how it modifies the mechanisms that transport angular momentum (AM). Along with these, this review also tries to explore how gravitational instabilities (GIs) evolve and how they affect disc fragmentation and astrophysical phenomena like stellar and planetary formation, AGN dynamics, and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).</description>

      <title>A Common Synchrotron Origin for Prompt Gamma-Ray and Soft X-Ray Emission in GRBs: Evidence from Joint Spectral Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent launches of the Einstein Probe (EP) and the Space Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM) mission have led to the detection of a growing number of long GRBs with significant, early soft X-ray flux during their gamma-ray emission, prompting the question of whether their multi-band prompt emission shares a common origin in region and mechanism. To address this, we utilize the 20-year Swift archival data, which provides a substantial sample of joint soft X-ray and gamma-ray observations, enabling a systematic joint spectral study. We resolve 110 temporal pulses from 46 GRBs and find that a single power-law model with a low-energy break or cutoff adequately describes the prompt spectra from 150 keV down to 0.5 keV. More than half of the sample pulses require a break around a few keV, with average spectral indices $\langle \alpha_1 \rangle = -0.88$ and $\langle \alpha_2 \rangle = -1.46$ consistent with synchrotron radiation in a marginally fast-cooling regime. The observed spectral evolution and the distribution of indices support a single-emission-region origin, where the varying spectral shapes are largely governed by the evolution of the synchrotron cooling frequency $\nu_c$ and the effect of finite emission width. The observed differences in the temporal behavior between X-ray and gamma-ray light curves can be naturally explained by this spectral evolution across the broad band.</description>

      <title>Electron impact excitation of Te IV and V and Level Resolved R-matrix Photoionization of Te I - IV with application to modelling of AT2017gfo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectral modelling of kilonovae (KNe) require large amounts of collisional excitation and photoionization atomic data for lowly ionised (neutral, singly and doubly ionised) species of heavy elements. Much of the data currently used is calculated using approximate hydrogenic results or adopts semi-empirical formulae. We present atomic data for ions of tellurium (Te) computed using the well-known $R$-matrix method. Results will also be presented for radiative and thermal collisions of Te IV and V, for which the required atomic data are also typically limited in the literature. The Multi-Configuration-Dirac-Hartree-Fock (MCDHF) method is used to produce model atomic structures and radiative rates. These model structures are then used to calculate electron-impact-excitation and photoionization cross-sections. The resulting excitation and radiative rates are further used in a collisional radiative model to produce synthetic spectra, which are compared with observations. We also investigate the possibility of Te IV contributing to the 1.08 $\mu$m emission feature in the mid-epochs of AT2017gfo alongside the established P-Cygni feature of Sr II.</description>

      <title>The Dark Matters at ICRC 2025</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark matter track at ICRC~2025 showed a field in transition. Direct detection has entered the \emph{neutrino-floor era}, with XENONnT and PandaX-4T now limited by Solar neutrinos. Indirect searches have become truly \emph{multimessenger}, combining $\gamma$-rays, neutrinos, cosmic rays, and radio data under unified likelihoods and shared systematics. Non-WIMP candidates -- axions, sub-GeV particles, primordial black holes, macroscopic relics -- are becoming central. Across all fronts, progress depends as much on new detectors as on the coherence of shared data, methods, and analysis frameworks. Here, I distill the main experimental and conceptual shifts behind these trends, noting how assumptions have evolved since ICRC~2023 and where the next decisive advances are likely to come.</description>

      <title>Impact of Magnetic Field Topology on Electromagnetic and Gravitational Waves from Binary Neutron Star Merger Remnants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations of binary neutron star (BNS) mergers with four distinct magnetic field topologies: (i) a dipole pulsar-like configuration, (ii) a mixed linear superposition of poloidal and toroidal components inside the star, and (iii-iv) two topologies featuring a smooth transition from a confined mixed core to a pulsar-like structure at radii $0.95\,R_{\rm NS}$ and $0.5\,R_{\rm NS}$, with $R_{\rm NS}$ the radius of the star. The latter topologies are explored in BNS merger studies for the first time. We evolve systems with two equations of state (EoS), SLy and WFF1, with ADM masses 2.7 and 2.6, respectively, and include an additional lower-mass SLy binary to probe the behavior of long-lived remnants. We perform an extensive analysis of the emission properties of the systems, both electromagnetic and gravitational waves, and of the properties of the remnants, namely their frequency modes, density eigenfunctions, rotation, temperature, and convective stability. We report three key results: (1) for the first time, we assess the convective stability of magnetized remnants, extending previous unmagnetized analyses; (2) we identify a clear secondary peak in the gravitational-wave spectrum of pulsar-like configurations, consistent with the nonlinear coupling of the $m=0$ and $m=2$ modes, which is absent in other topologies; and (3) the magnetic field topology strongly influences the gravitational wave emission properties to the extent that nearby ($&lt;50\,{\rm Mpc}$) events could allow one to observationally distinguish between different field structures with future gravitational-wave detectors. Across all models, we obtain luminosities compatible with short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs), with purely poloidal configurations being the most efficient in driving possible relativistic jets.</description>

      <title>Highlights from the IceCube Neutrino Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17523v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube neutrino observatory has been successfully operating in its full configuration for almost 15 years and is characterized by a remarkably high stability and uptime. During this time, it has made many groundbreaking observations, such as the first detection of a high-energy diffuse cosmic neutrino flux or, more recently, the identification of the AGN NGC1068 as a steady source of high-energy neutrino emission and the observation of neutrinos from the Milky Way. In this talk, new developments in these areas will be discussed and further highlights presented. The second part then looks at the ongoing developments at the South Pole with IceCube Upgrade and IceCube-Gen2 and discusses their potential for advancing neutrino and astroparticle physics.</description>

      <title>Extracting SASI signatures from Gravitational Waves of Core-Collapse Supernovae using the Hilbert-Huang Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Core collapse supernovae are among the most energetic astrophysical events in the Universe. Despite huge efforts on understanding the main ingredients triggering such explosions, we still lack of compelling evidences for the precise mechanism driving those phenomena. They are expected to produce gravitational waves due to asymmetric mass motions in the collapsing core, and emit in the meanwhile neutrinos as a result of the interactions in their high-density environment. The combination of these two cosmic messengers can provide a unique probe to study the inner engine of these processes and unveil the explosion mechanism. Among the possible detectable signature, standing accretion shock instabilities (SASI) are particularly relevant in this context as they establish a direct connection between gravitational wave emission and the outcoming neutrino flux. In this work, Hilbert-Huang transform is applied to a selected sample of 3D numerical simulations, with the aim of identifying SASI contribution and extract its instantaneous frequency. The performance of the method is evaluated in the context of Einstein Telescope.</description>

      <title>Clumpy Outflows from Super-Eddington Accreting Black Holes I: Radiation Hydrodynamics Simulations and Observational Implications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in X-ray spectroscopic observation have enabled researchers to reveal distinct clumpy structures in the super-Eddington outflows from the supermassive black hole in PDS 456 (XRISM Collaboration 2025), initiating detailed investigation of fine-scale structures in accretion-driven outflows. In this study, we conduct high-resolution, two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamics simulations with time-varying and anisotropic initial and boundary conditions to reproduce outflows launched from super-Eddington accretion flows and analyze their statistical properties. The resulting clumpy outflows extend across a wide range of radial distances and polar angles, exhibiting typical properties such as a size of ~10 rg (where rg is the gravitational radius), a velocity of ~0.05-0.2 c (where c is the speed of light), and about five clumps along the line of sight. Although the velocities are slightly smaller, these characteristics reasonably resemble those obtained from the XRISM observation. The gas density of the clumps is on the order of 10^{-13}-10^{-12} g cm^{-3}, and their optical depth for electron scattering is approximately 1-10. The clumpy winds accelerated by radiation force are considered to originate from the region within &lt;~300 rg.</description>

      <title>Discovery of 30 Galactic radio transient pulsars with MeerTRAP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the discovery of 30 new Galactic sources from the MeerTRAP project, a commensal fast radio transient search programme using the MeerKAT telescope. These sources were all identified via a single pulse search. Most of them are likely to be rotating radio transients (RRATs) given their low pulse rates. Using data captured in our transient buffer we have localised nine sources in the image domain to arcsecond precision. This facilitates the timing of these sources and further follow-up with other telescopes. Using the arrival times of single pulses, we have constrained the periods of 14 sources, ranging from 121ms to 7.623s, and derived a phase-coherent timing solution for one of them. Follow-up observations of the MeerTRAP sources (including those published previously) performed with the Effelsberg telescope have detected regular but faint emission from three sources, confirming their long rotation period, including PSR J2218+2902 with a period of 17.5s, the fourth slowest in the radio pulsar population. A few of the sources exhibit interesting emission features, such as periodic microstructure in PSR J1243-0435 and possible nulling in PSR J1911-2020 and PSR J1243-0435. We find that the duty cycles of the three newly discovered pulsars are very low and follow the general trend for the duty cycle with period of known pulsars.</description>

      <title>Simulating Binary Neutron Star Mergers with Finite-temperature Equations of State: The influences of the slope of the symmetry energy and artificial heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23684v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new set of numerical-relativity simulations of merging binary neutron stars, aiming to identify possible observable signatures of the slope of the symmetry energy $L_{\rm sym}$. To achieve this goal, we employ a set of equations of state based on a parameterization of the covariant density functional theory of nuclear matter that allows controlled variations of $L_{\rm sym}$ and the skewness $Q_{\rm sat}$, holding the latter fixed. For a set of our simulations, we identify a steep energy gradient in the equation of state at subsaturation densities, which acts as a source of heating with subsequent stiffening produced by thermal support. Accounting for related structural modifications in the tidal deformability reconciles our results with theoretical expectations. On the other hand, we show that gravitational waves are unlikely to distinguish the role of $L_{\rm sym}$. In contrast to this, we find that the ejecta composition is significantly altered in our simulations, which employ an M1 moment scheme, when $L_{\rm sym}$ is varied. Based on our extracted dynamical ejecta properties, we compute r-process yields and find that they are distinct for the different $L_{\rm sym}$, especially at lower mass numbers $A \lesssim 120$. This suggests that electromagnetic counterparts are more likely to exhibit signatures; however, a direct connection to $L_{\rm sym}$ remains a challenge, given the complex interplay between details of the ejecta properties and the kilonova signal.</description>

      <title>Spin-aligned inspiral waveforms from self-force and post-Newtonian theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16112v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the state-of-the-art waveform model WaSABI-C for quasicircular inspirals of spinning black hole binaries with aligned or anti-aligned spins. Our model synthesizes the most up-to-date first- and second-order gravitational self-force results with high-order post-Newtonian expansions through a systematic hybridization procedure. This approach captures both strong-field and weak-field dynamics with high fidelity, enabling accurate modeling of spin-(anti)aligned inspirals across a wide parameter space. The resulting waveforms mark a significant advance in the precision of self-force-based templates, providing critical input for the detection and interpretation of gravitational waves from compact binaries with future observatories such as LISA and ET. We accompany this work with the release of WaSABI (Waveform Simulations of Asymmetric Binary Inspirals), a public package implementing our model for community use and further development.</description>

      <title>Post-adiabatic self-force waveforms: slowly spinning primary and precessing secondary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16113v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in gravitational self-force theory has led to the development of a first post-adiabatic (1PA) waveform model for nonspinning, quasicircular compact binaries [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 241402 (2023)]. In this paper, we extend that model to allow for a slowly spinning primary black hole and a generic, precessing spin on the secondary object, restricting to the case of small misalignment between the primary spin and the orbital angular momentum. We demonstrate excellent agreement between our waveforms and fully nonlinear numerical relativity simulations for mass ratios $q\gtrsim 5$ and primary spins $|\chi_1|\lesssim 0.1$ and arbitrary secondary spin $\chi_2 \lesssim 1$. In particular we present the re-summed 1PAT1R waveform model, which significantly improves the accuracy of the original 1PAT1 waveforms for comparable masses and increasing primary spin. Our models are publicly available in the WaSABI package.</description>

      <title>Hybrid waveform model for asymmetric spinning binaries: Self-force meets post-Newtonian theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop and implement a new hybrid waveform model for quasicircular inspirals with a spinning primary and nonspinning secondary, excluding the merger and ringdown. This model, which is a core component of the more extensive WaSABI-C model, consistently assembles all available first-order self-force and post-Newtonian results through a hybridization procedure without any tuning to numerical relativity, making it particularly suited for intermediate to extreme mass ratios. For almost all masses and primary spins, the resulting hybrid model significantly improves the faithfulness of both post-Newtonian and adiabatic self-force waveforms considered separately. We provide detailed comparisons with 50 simulations from the SXS catalog with mass ratios ranging from 1 to 15 and primary spins ranging from -0.8 to 0.8. The hybrid model improves the median mismatch against numerical relativity waveforms by a factor of 2000 with respect to adiabatic waveforms and 40 with respect to post-Newtonian waveforms. The mismatches are comparable to those obtained from the SEOBNRv5EHM model in the quasicircular limit over most of the parameter space covered by NR simulations.</description>

      <title>Effective cosmic ray diffusion in multiphase galactic environments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic-ray (CR) feedback is widely recognized as a key regulator of galaxy formation. After being accelerated at supernova remnant shocks, CRs propagate through the interstellar medium (ISM), establishing smooth large-scale distributions and driving galactic outflows. The efficiency of this feedback is controlled by the effective transport speed of the CR population, which in turn depends on the competition between CR-driven plasma instabilities and wave damping processes that vary strongly with ISM phase. In cold, dense gas, ion-neutral damping dominates, whereas in warm, diffuse environments, weaker non-linear Landau damping prevails, leading to enhanced CR scattering and slower transport. To investigate these effects, we employ the moving-mesh code Arepo and model CR transport using a two-moment description within the multiphase ISM framework Crisp, which self-consistently computes CR diffusion coefficients and transport velocities from coarse-grained plasma physics. The intrinsic CR diffusion coefficient depends inversely on the scattering rate of CRs and Alfv\'en waves, covering 15 orders of magnitude. In contrast, we show that the effective CR diffusion coefficient, which quantifies the propagation speed of CRs through the ISM, converges toward the canonical range of $10^{28}$-$10^{29}$ cm$^2$ s$^{-1}$. Simulations with only non-linear Landau damping yield transport rates up to an order of magnitude slower than those including both Landau and ion-neutral damping. Overall, CR transport speeds increase systematically with gas density, for which we provide a density-dependent fit of the effective CR diffusion coefficient. We demonstrate that, despite strong ion-neutral damping in the cold and warm phases of the galactic disk, CRs are transported at speeds only a few times the local Alfv\'en speed as they traverse alternating ISM phases on their way out of the galaxy.</description>

      <title>Modelling the Future of Gaia Neutron Star-Main Sequence Binaries: From Eccentric Orbits to Millisecond Pulsar-White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We model the evolution of 21 Gaia neutron star (NS)-main-sequence binaries (orbital period $P_{\mathrm{orb}}\sim200$--$1000$ days, eccentricity $e\gtrsim0.2$) using binary evolution with \texttt{MESA}. We examine eccentric mass transfer and models assuming prior circularization. All systems end as NS-white dwarf (WD) binaries, but transfer modes yield distinct outcomes. Under eccentric transfer, binaries are driven to higher $e$, forming orbits with $e\gtrsim0.6$ and $P_{\rm orb}\sim1000$-$4000$ days. Periastron bursts are brief ($\lesssim10^6$ yr), transfer only a few $\times10^{-2}$ M$_\odot$, and produce mildly recycled pulsars ($P_{\mathrm{spin}}\gtrsim50$ ms) with low-mass He WDs. Artificially circularized transfer gives $P_{\rm orb}\sim200$-$2000$ days, lasts $\sim10^7$ yr, and allows NSs to accrete $\sim0.1$ M$_\odot$, forming fully recycled MSPs ($P_{\mathrm{spin}}\sim$ few-30 ms) with CO WDs. Allowing super-Eddington accretion up to $100\times$ the canonical rate makes even eccentric systems efficient MSP producers, though torque coupling remains uncertain. Using an adaptive, field-dependent magnetic-field decay timescale, we find MSPs stay radio-active over Gyr spans. Gaia systems undergoing stable mass transfer remain wide and fail to match the Galactic MSP-WD population, where most, nearly circular systems have $P_{\rm orb}\lesssim100$ days. Binaries with different mass ratios and initial configurations -- likely leading to unstable mass transfer -- are needed to reproduce the observed MSP-WD distribution.</description>

      <title>Axion condensates in neutron stars and radial oscillation modes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16245v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light QCD axions, introduced to solve the strong CP problem, may form condensates inside neutron stars, giving rise to a novel ground state of dense matter. We investigate how such axion condensates modify the equilibrium structure and radial oscillation spectrum of NSs. Using a realistic NS model with the BSk26 equation of state, and solving the coupled Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff and Klein-Gordon equations together with a linear perturbation analysis, we find two distinct families of quasi-normal modes: weakly damped fluid-dominated oscillations and highly damped axion modes. The coupling between the fluid and the axion field introduces axion-induced damping of radial oscillations, with decay timescales of order seconds for kHz axion masses. Modes with frequencies above the axion mass are strongly damped, while those below remain unaffected. These results suggest that stellar oscillations could provide a novel probe of axion properties, opening prospects for axion asteroseismology in neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Production of radioactive $^{22}$Na in core-collapse supernovae: the Ne-E(L) component in presolar grains and its possible consequences on supernova observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16246v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Presolar graphite grains carry the isotopic signatures of their parent stars. A significant fraction of presolar graphites shows isotopic abundance anomalies relative to solar for elements such as O, Si, Mg and Ca, which are compatible with nucleosynthesis in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe). Therefore, they must have condensed from CCSN ejecta before the formation of the Sun. Their most puzzling abundance signature is the $^{22}$Ne-enriched component Ne-E(L), interpreted as the effect of the radioactive decay of $^{22}$Na ($T_{1/2}$ = 2.6 years). Previous works have shown that if H is ingested into the He shell and not fully destroyed before the explosion, the CCSN shock in the He shell material produces large $^{22}$Na amounts. Here we focus on such CCSN models, showing a radioactive $^{26}$Al production compatible with grains measurements, and analyze the conditions of $^{22}$Na nucleosynthesis. In these models, $^{22}$Na is mostly made in the He shell, with a total ejected mass varying between 2.6$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ and 1.9$\times$10$^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$. We show that such $^{22}$Na may already impact the CCSN light curve 500 days after the explosion, and at later stages it can be the main source powering the CCSN light curve for up to a few years before the $^{44}$Ti decay becomes dominant. Based on the CCSN yields above, the 1274.53 keV $\gamma$-ray flux due to $^{22}$Na decay could be observable for years after the first CCSN light is detected, depending on the distance. This makes CCSNe possible sites to detect a $^{22}$Na $\gamma$-ray signature consistently with the Ne-E(L) component found in presolar graphites. Finally, we discuss the potential contribution from the $^{22}$Na decay to the galactic positron annihilation rate.</description>

      <title>Investigating Production of TeV-scale Muons in Extensive Air Shower at 2400 Meters Underground</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16341v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The China Jinping Underground Laboratory, characterized by a vertical rock overburden of 2,400 m, provides an exceptionally effective shield against cosmic muons with energies below 3 TeV. The surviving high-energy muons, produced as part of extensive air showers, open a unique observational window into primary cosmic rays with energies ranging from tens of TeV up to the PeV scale and beyond. This distinctive feature also enables detailed studies of the earliest stages of shower development. Using 1,338.6 live days of data collected with a one-ton prototype detector for the Jinping Neutrino Experiment, we measured the underground muon flux originating from air showers. The results show discrepancies of about 40%, corresponding to a significance of more than 5.5$\sigma$, relative to predictions from several leading hadronic interaction models. We interpret these findings from two complementary perspectives: (i) by adopting the expected cosmic ray spectra, we constrain the modeling of the initial hadronic interactions in air showers; and (ii) by assuming specific hadronic interaction models, we infer the mass composition of cosmic rays, and our data favor a lighter component in the corresponding energy range. Our study demonstrates the potential of deep underground laboratories to provide new experimental insights into cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>XRISM-Subaru views of Abell 754: Energetic ICM Motions Revealed by XRISM/Resolve</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16553v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of the merging cluster Abell~754 using \textit{XRISM}/Resolve. In GO1 phase, \textit{XRISM}/Resolve observed Abell 754 in two deep pointings, targeting the eastern primary core (114~ks) and the middle of the X-ray filamentary structure (190~ks). Spectral fits to full field-of-view data reveal a line-of-sight velocity difference of $656 \pm 35$~km~s$^{-1}$ between the two pointing, corresponding to a bulk Mach number of 0.45$\pm$0.03. Velocity dispersions are measured to be $220^{+26}_{-29}$~km~s$^{-1}$ and $279^{+24}_{-23}$~km~s$^{-1}$ in the eastern and middle pointing, respectively. Within the eastern core, the velocity dispersion shows spatial variation, reaching $497^{+144}_{-117}$~km~s$^{-1}$ in the southern core with high temperature -- among the largest values yet reported in galaxy clusters to date. Narrow-band analysis of the Fe--K complex in this region reveals systematically higher temperatures derived from He-like and H-like Fe line ratio compared to those obtained via broadband fits, indicating multi-phase structures. Two-temperature modeling further separates a cooler core phase from a hotter, shock or turbulence-heated phase whose velocity is blueshifted, similar to that of the middle pointing. These results point to a mixing interface where post-shock gas from the south overlaps, in projection, with cooler core gas, inflating the observed line widths in this region. Weak-lensing analysis with Subaru/HSC and Suprime-cam confirms that the eastern component is about twice as massive as the western one, consistent with disruption and gas stripping of the latter. The curved morphology of the eastern X-ray core, together with the measured kinematics, is naturally explained by an off-axis, post--core-passage merger that imparts angular momentum and drives large-scale rotational and fallback flows.</description>

      <title>Contribution from Nonlinear Quasi-normal Modes in GW250114</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report evidence for nonlinear gravitational effects in the ringdown signal of gravitational wave event GW250114. Using Bayesian inference, we find that the inclusion of a nonlinear quasi-normal mode (220Q), a second-order harmonic predicted by general relativity, is statistically favored over the standard linear model (440 mode) when analyzing the post-merger oscillations. Specifically, models incorporating the 220Q mode yield higher Bayes factors than those including only the linear 440 mode, and produce remnant black hole parameters (mass and spin) more consistent with full numerical relativity simulations. This suggests that nonlinear mode coupling contributes significantly to the ringdown phase, opening a new avenue to probe strong-field gravity beyond linear approximations.</description>

      <title>Studying the Dust Distribution Around Accreting Black Holes with Reverberation Mapping Using PRIMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Variability studies are a powerful tool for studying the structures of unresolved sources. One such type of variability study, called reverberation mapping (RM), established that the dominant source of infrared radiation from an active galactic nucleus (AGN) was from dust absorption and re-emission, which demonstrated that the optical brightening and fading of light from the accretion disk (AD) around a supermassive black hole was followed by a corresponding (delayed) variation at infrared (IR) wavelengths from the surrounding dust distribution. Since that time a great deal more has been learned about the dust distribution around ADs, both near the AD in the form of a potential torus, as well as extended emission in the form of polar dust outflows. Understanding the dust distribution is vital to understanding how AGNs affect their host galaxy as well as the overall energetics of AGNs as ~50% of energy from an AGN comes out in the IR. Dust RM has been done exclusively in the near-IR (1-5 microns) which traces the inner edge of the dust near the dust sublimation radius. Hence extending RM to the mid-IR, especially to the peak of the dust emission between 25 and 30 microns, allows for an examination of the dust distribution around ADs and potentially traces the source of the polar outflow. RM with the proposed PRobe far-Infrared Mission for Astrophysics (PRIMA) can focus on variability monitoring of a sample of low- to high-luminosity AGNs to trace the 25-30 microns emission that is reverberated from the UV/optical AD emission which will be monitored by other space and ground-based observatories and made available to PRIMA users. Then, by detailed modeling of the response of the dust emission to shorter wavelengths, the distribution of the dust around an AGN will be revealed and can be linked to the accretion disk luminosities.</description>

Abstract: There is a claim in the literature that charged dark matter particles in the mass range $100 (q_{\rm X}/e)^2~\mathrm{TeV} \leq m_{\rm X} \leq 10^8 (q_{\rm X}/e)~\mathrm{TeV}$ are allowed, based on arguing that heavy charged particles cannot reach the Earth from outside the magnetized region of the Milky Way (Chuzhoy-Kolb, 2009). We point out that this claim fails for physical models for the Galactic magnetic field. We explicitly confirm our argument by simulating with the software CRPropa the trajectories of heavy charged dark matter in models of the Galactic magnetic field.</description>

      <title>From Stars to Waves: Non-deterministic Inference of Microlensed Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strongly lensed gravitational waves may pass through the stellar field of a lensing galaxy with additional modulations (on both phase and amplitude) due to gravitational microlensing effect of stars/remnants near the line of sight. These microlensed waveforms depend on the mass and location of thousands or more most relevant stars, so that their deterministic reconstruction from the data is computationally prohibitive. We classify the detection and parameter estimation of such events as non-deterministic inference problem and propose a solution with the implementation of normalizing flows. As a first step, we show that $8\%$ of microlensed events can be detected with significance $\ge 3 \sigma$ in the third generation era, with the chosen microlensing parameters correlated with the density of the underlying stellar field. This approach opens the door to probing microlensing effects and the properties of the underlying stellar fields. A similar construction may also be applied to other non-deterministic inference problems, such as detecting post-merger gravitational waves from binary neutron star coalescence and signals from core-collapse supernovae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17449v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the measurability of effective inspiral spin in the detectable compact binary mergers using gravitational-wave observations. Measurements from the latest gravitational-wave transient catalog do not rule out the existence of binary systems with non-zero effective spins. However, we observe an apparent correlation between the inferred effective inspiral spin and the loudness of the gravitational-wave events- loud events typically have close-to-zero effective spins whereas fainter events tend to be inferred with relatively arbitrary effective spins. Through simulations, we demonstrate that non-negligible effective spins can be systematically inferred from non-spinning systems at small signal strengths. These two observations support the possibility that the effective spin magnitudes in the observable compact binaries are generally small. Future detections can have potential impact on the understanding of their population and other astrophysical inferences.</description>

      <title>A modeling perspective on the diversity of red-supergiant stars exploding within circumstellar material</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the ever faster cadence of untargeted surveys of the sky, the supernova (SN) community will capture in the coming years a growing number of shock breakouts in red-supergiant (RSG) stars. Expecting a high frequency of breakouts within circumstellar material (CSM), we have produced an extended, regular and cubic grid of models covering from low- to high-energy explosions, compact to extended CSM, moderate- to high-density CSM. Here, we document the main results from the radiation-hydrodynamics and nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative-transfer calculations over the first 15d of evolution, including the bolometric and multi-band light curves and the salient features from spectra. As before, CSM interaction is found to boost the UV brightness and shorten the optical rise time if compact. Higher ionization (e.g., as seen with OVI3820A) is obtained for more compact CSM, and is maximum for explosions in a vacuum. CSM interaction also diversifies the spectral evolution as seen in line profile morphology, with electron-scattering broadening dominating during the IIn phase. In the absence of CSM, Doppler broadening dominates immediately after shock breakout and leads to strongly blueshifted emission in lines such as HeII4686A or CIV5805A. This treasury of models will be used to analyze as well as predict future observations of RSG shock breakouts in CSM.</description>

Abstract: Next-generation GW detectors will produce a high rate of temporally overlapping signals from unrelated compact binary coalescences. Such overlaps can bias parameter estimation (PE) and mimic signatures of other physical effects, such as gravitational lensing. In this work, we investigate how overlapping signals can be degenerate with gravitational lensing by focusing on two scenarios: Type-II strong lensing and microlensing by an isolated point-mass lens. We simulate quasicircular binary black-hole pairs with chirp-mass ratios $\mathscr{M}_{\rm B}/\mathscr{M}_{\rm A}\in\{0.5,\,1,\,2\}$, SNR ratios $\mathrm{SNR}_{\rm B}/\mathrm{SNR}_{\rm A}\in\{0.5,\,1\}$, and coalescence-time offsets $\Delta t_{\rm c}\in[-0.1,\,0.1]~\mathrm{s}$. Bayesian PE and fitting-factor studies show that the Type-II lensing hypothesis is favored over the unlensed quasicircular hypothesis ($\log_{10}\mathscr{B}^{\rm L}_{\rm U}&gt;1$) only in a small region of the overlapping parameter space with $\mathscr{M}_{\rm B}/\mathscr{M}_{\rm A}\gtrsim1$ and $|\Delta t_{\rm c}|\leq0.03~\rm{s}$.. Meanwhile, false evidence for microlensing signatures can arise because, to a reasonable approximation, the model produces two superimposed images whose time delay can closely match $|\Delta t_{\rm c}|$. Overall, the inferred Bayes factor depends on relative chirp-mass ratios, relative loudness, difference in coalescence times, and also the absolute SNRs of the overlapping signals. Cumulatively, our results indicate that overlapping black-hole binaries with nearly equal chirp masses and comparable loudness are likely to be falsely identified as lensed. Such misidentifications are expected to become more common as detector sensitivities improve. While our study focuses on ground-based detectors using appropriate detectability thresholds, the findings naturally extend to next-generation GW observatories.</description>

      <title>Pair creation in the vortex-driven magnetic fields of black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01611v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of pair creation on the radiation emerging from black holes under the assumption that the magnetic fields are vortex driven. In particular, for a sufficiently broad range of supermassive black holes, we investigated the energies at which photons undergo decay under the influence of a strong magnetic field, producing electron-positron pairs. Depending on particular physical parameters, it has been shown that in certain scenarios high or very high energy emission generated by black holes will be strongly suppressed, thus, will be unable to escape a zone where radiation is generated. In particular, photons with energies exceeding $\sim 1$ GeV will never leave the magnetosphere if they are generated at the scale 10$R_g$ and the threshold is of the order of $1$ TeV, if the emission is produced at $\sim 100\; R_g$. Analysing the process versus the black hole mass, assuming the region $100\; R_g$, it has been shown that for the considered lowest mass, the photons with energies $250$ GeV will never leave the black hole and for the considered highest mass the corresponding value is $\sim 250$ TeV.</description>

      <title>Impact of propagation effects on the spectro-temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.00232v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a mathematical analysis of propagation-induced distortions in the spectro-temporal properties of Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Within the Triggered Relativistic Dynamical Model, we derive a centroid-based formulation of the sub-burst slope law, which is an inverse relation between frequency-drift rate and temporal width of sub-bursts. We extend our analysis to include two frequency-dependent propagation effects: (i) multipath scattering, characterized by a pulse-broadening timescale $\tau_\mathrm{sc} \propto \nu^{-4}$, and (ii) residual dispersion, parameterized by $\Delta \mathrm{DM}\propto \nu^{-2}$. Our analysis shows that scattering preserves the inverse relation between sub-burst slope and duration, but increases the scaling coefficient when $\tau_\mathrm{sc}$ exceeds the intrinsic width ($t_\mathrm{w}$) of sub-bursts. Residual DM errors act asymmetrically: under-dedispersion flattens the sub-burst slope, whereas over-dedispersion causes a non-linear increase and eventually a change of sign. When both effects are present, scattering counterbalances the steepening induced by over-dedispersion and augments the flattening produced by under-dedispersion, yielding characteristically distorted curves. We repeat measurements for ultra-short duration bursts (ultra-FRBs) with $t_\mathrm{w} = 50\ \mu\mathrm{s}$ at 1 GHz and found them to be far more sensitive to propagation errors. Deviations become measurable for $\left | \Delta \mathrm{DM} \right |\sim0.05$ pc cm$^{-3}$ and for $\tau_\mathrm{sc} \sim0.1$ ms at 1 GHz, levels that have negligible impact on the standard-width sub-bursts. Our analysis provides practical diagnostics to disentangle propagation effects from the observed spectro-temporal properties of FRBs, thereby recovering true correlations among their intrinsic parameters.</description>

      <title>Scintillation Properties of PSR B1133+16 Measured with Very Long Baseline Interferometry</title>

Abstract: The scintillation of pulsars reveals small-scale structure of the interstellar medium.
  A powerful technique for characterizing the scintillating structures (screens) combines analysis of scintillation arcs and very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).
  We present the results of a VLBI analysis of the scintillation arcs of PSR B1133+16 from simultaneous observations with Arecibo, VLA, Jodrell Bank, Effelsberg, and Westerbork.
  Three arcs appear in the data set, all of which appear consistent with being the result of very anisotropic scattering screens.
  We are able to measure their orientations on the sky, down to uncertainties of $5\arcdeg$ for the two stronger screens, and measure distances, of $140\pm30$, $180\pm20$, and $250\pm30{\rm\,pc}$, consistent with, but substantially more precise than what was inferred previously from annual modulation patterns in the scintillation.
  Comparing with the differential dust extinction with distance in this direction, the two nearer screens appear associated with the wall of the Local Bubble.</description>

      <title>Indication for Dual Periodic Signatures in PKS 0805-07 from Multi-technique Time Series Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09602v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the identification of two statistically significant quasi-periodic oscillations in the weekly binned $\gamma$-ray light curve of the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 0805$-$07, observed by Fermi-LAT over the period MJD 59047.5-59740.5. By applying a suite of complementary time-series analysis techniques, we identify periodic signatures at approximately 255 and 112 days. These techniques include the Lomb-Scargle periodogram (LSP), Weighted Wavelet Z-transform (WWZ), REDFIT, Date-Compensated Discrete Fourier Transform (DCDFT), Phase Dispersion Minimization (PDM), and the String-length method. The reliability of these signals is supported by high local significance (&gt; 99) in all methods and reinforced through phase-folding. Model selection using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) strongly supports a two-component periodic model. The detection of dual QPOs is rare among blazars and suggests complex variability mechanisms. Although a binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) scenario could be considered given the sources high redshift (z = 1.837), the short periodicities are difficult to reconcile with orbital motion unless invoking extreme parameters. Double-sine model fitting reveals that the oscillatory components have comparable amplitudes but are out of phase, suggesting a potential beating phenomenon due to interference. This amplitude-modulated variability is consistent with a geometric origin, most plausibly jet precession driven by Lense-Thirring torques, superimposed with a secondary process such as polar jet oscillation. Doppler factor modulation arising from these effects can account for the observed flux variations without requiring an unrealistically compact binary.</description>

      <title>The 300 TeV photon from GRB 221009A: a Hint at Non-linear Lorentz Invariance Violation?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The air shower array Carpet-3 detected a 300 TeV photon from the direction of GRB 221009A at 4536 s after the Fermi-GBM trigger for this event. If the association with this gamma-ray burst is real, it poses two puzzles. First, why was this photon not absorbed by the extragalactic background light? ``New physics'' beyond the Standard Model is required to explain how it managed to reach Earth from a cosmological distance. Second, why was this photon detected when the VHE afterglow observed by LHAASO already faded? A novel astrophysical mechanism is required to explain this delay. In this work we show that Lorentz invariance violation (LIV), which arises as a low-energy limit of certain quantum gravity theories, can solve both puzzles. It shifts thresholds of particle interaction and changes the opacity of the extragalactic background, and cause energy-dependent variations of the photon velocity, which changes the photon time of flight. We investigate the LIV parameter space assuming that the 300 TeV photon is a part of the VHE afterglow detected by LHAASO in the TeV range. We identify viable solutions and place stringent two-sided constraints on the LIV energy scale required to resolve the observational puzzles. First-order LIV appears to be incompatible with the constraints set by analyzing the TeV afterglow of this GRB. Viable solutions emerge for higher orders. In particular, the commonly studied second-order subluminal LIV with $E_{\rm LIV2} = 1.30_{-0.35}^{+0.56} \times 10^{-7} E_{\rm Pl}$ (95.4% credibility level; $E_{\rm Pl}$ is the Planck energy) is consistent with all the observed data.</description>

      <title>Probing ALP-photon couplings in Neutron Stars: Scalar versus pseudoscalar cases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the distribution of an interacting axion-like massive field within a magnetized Neutron Star. For this we consider the effect of an intense density-dependent axially symmetric stellar magnetic field ${\bf B}(r,\theta)$ adding another much weaker, but non-vanishing, electric field. We particularize the latter for the case when a finite chiral charge density is present. The axion field is thus coupled to a generic function $Q(F_0,G_0)$ depending on Lorentz invariants $F_0, G_0$ which can be constructed from these electromagnetic fields. From this, the static axion field equations are solved as function of stellar radial coordinate and angular direction, $a(r,\theta)$, using a prescribed linear form for $Q$. In addition, we use a semi-analytical approach to calculate the stellar structure in this hybrid system where pressure components are treated under a perturbative scheme, provided induced deformations with respect to spherical symmetry are tiny. Our results show that the axion couplings to magnetic and electric fields along with its mass, critically determine the axion spatial distribution. Furthermore, we focus on the possibility that the axion field might accumulate in specific outer regions of the star, particularly within the crust, where it could form a condensate. We explore the possible presence of magnetic flux tubes from superconductor phases in this outer layers and qualitatively show they may enhance local conversion into photons. We explore prospects of detectability through indirect methods.</description>

      <title>Magnetar-like flares behind the high-energy emission in LS 5039</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LS 5039 hosts a high-mass star, and a compact object that might be a strongly magnetized neutron star (NS). This scenario requires a mechanism to power its persistent and strong non-thermal emission. We investigate a mechanism in which the non-steady interaction structure of the stellar and the NS winds can regularly excite NS magnetospheric activity, releasing extra energy and fueling the source non-thermal emission. The NS wind shocked by the stellar wind can recurrently touch the NS magnetosphere, triggering magnetic instabilities whose growth can release extra energy into the NS wind in a cyclic manner. To illustrate and study the impact of these cycles on the two-wind interaction structure on different scales, we performed relativistic hydrodynamics simulations in 2D and 3D with periods of an enhanced power in the NS wind along the orbit. We also used analytical tools to characterize processes near the NS relevant for the non-thermal emission. As the NS wind termination shock touches the magnetosphere energy dissipation occurs, but the whole shocked two-wind structure is eventually driven away halting the extra energy injection. However, due to the corresponding drop in the NS wind ram pressure, the termination shock propagates back towards the magnetosphere, resuming the process. These activity cycles excite strong waves in the shocked flows, intensifying their mixing and the disruption of their spiral-like structure produced by orbital motion. Further downstream, the shocked winds can become a quasi-stable, relatively smooth flow. The recurrent interaction between the NS magnetosphere and shocked wind can fuel a relativistic outflow powerful enough to explain the non-thermal emission of LS 5039. A magnetospheric multipolar magnetic field much stronger than the dipolar one may provide the required energetics, and help to explain the lack of evidence of a recent supernova remnant.</description>

      <title>Fluorescent Fe K line emission of gamma Cas stars II. Predictions for magnetic interactions and white-dwarf accretion scenarios</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: About 12 percent of the early-type Be stars, so-called gamma Cas stars, exhibit an unusually hard and bright thermal X-ray emission that could result from accretion onto a white dwarf companion or from magnetic interactions between the Be star and its decretion disk. Exploring the full power of high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy of gamma Cas stars requires comparison of observations of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines near 6.4 keV with synthetic profiles of this line complex computed in the framework of the magnetic interaction and the accreting WD scenarios. For the latter, we further distinguish between accretion onto a non-magnetic and a magnetic WD. Our models account for different reservoirs of reprocessing material: the Be circumstellar decretion disk, the Be photosphere, an accretion disk around the WD companion, a magnetically channelled accretion flow and the WD photosphere. We find considerably different line properties for the different scenarios. For a non-magnetic accreting WD, the global Fe Kalpha complex is extremely broad, reaching a full width of 140 eV, whilst it is ~ 40 eV for the magnetic star-disk interaction and the magnetic accreting WD cases. In the magnetic star-disk interaction, the line centroid follows the orbital motion of the Be star, whereas it moves along with the WD in the case of an accreting WD. For gamma Cas, given the 15 times larger amplitude of the WD orbital motion, the shift in position for an accreting WD should be easily detectable with high-resolution spectrographs such as Resolve on XRISM, but remains essentially undetectable for the magnetic star-disk interaction. Upcoming high-resolution spectroscopy of the fluorescent Fe Kalpha emission lines in the X-ray spectra of gamma Cas stars will thus allow to distinguish between the competing scenarios.</description>

Abstract: We present a new technique for sub-GeV dark matter (DM) searches and a new use of neutrino observatories. DM-electron scattering in an observatory can excite or ionize target molecules, which then produce light that can be detected by the photomultiplier tubes (PMTs). While individual DM scatterings are indistinguishable, the aggregate rate from many independent scatterings can be isolated from the total PMT dark rate using the expected DM annual modulation. We showcase this technique with the example of JUNO, a 20,000-ton scintillator detector, showing that its potential sensitivity in some mass ranges exceeds other techniques and reaches key particle-theory benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Recasting Experimental Constraints on Relativistic Magnetic Monopoles</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.05136v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic monopoles with masses up to $10^{14}$ GeV can be accelerated to relativistic velocities in Galactic and intergalactic magnetic fields. The cosmic flux of relativistic monopoles is constrained by various experiments, with the limits given as functions of the monopole velocity (Lorentz factor) at the detectors. The velocity, however, is usually treated as a free parameter due to the ambiguity in the computation of the acceleration before the monopoles arrive at Earth. We explicitly evaluate the velocity by exploiting recent studies on cosmic magnetic fields and the monopole acceleration therein, to recast experimental limits in terms of the mass of monopoles. By applying our method to various terrestrial experiments, including the Pierre Auger Observatory, IceCube, MACRO, and the upcoming Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory, as well as to astrophysical constraints, we report limits on the flux of monopoles for a wide range of monopole masses. We also highlight the role of monopoles as messengers of cosmic magnetic fields, and discuss the possibility of using monopole experiments to probe intergalactic magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>A flexible, GPU-accelerated approach for the joint characterization of LISA instrumental noise and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.06300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: LISA data analysis represents one of the most challenging tasks ahead for the future of gravitational-wave (GW) astronomy. Characterizing the instrument's noise properties while fitting for all the other detectable sources is a key requirement of any robust inference pipeline. Noise estimation will also play a crucial role in searches and parameter estimation of cosmological and astrophysical stochastic signals. Previous studies have tackled this topic by assuming perfect knowledge of the spectral shape of the instrumental noise and of different possible types of GW Stochastic Backgrounds (SGWBs), usually resorting to parametrized templates. Recently, various works that employ template-agnostic methods have been presented. In this work, we take an additional step further, introducing flexible spectral shapes in both the instrumental noise and the stochastic signals. We account for the lack of knowledge of the exact shape of the individual contributions to the overall power spectral density by using splines to represent arbitrary perturbations of the noise and signal spectral densities. We implement a data-driven Reversible Jump MCMC algorithm to fit different components simultaneously and to infer the level of flexibility required under different scenarios. We test this approach on simulated LISA data produced under different assumptions. We investigate the impact of this increased flexibility on the reconstruction of both the injected signal and the noise level, and we discuss the prospects for claiming a successful SGWB detection.</description>

      <title>Constraints on axionlike particles from 16.5 years of Fermi-LAT data and prospects for VLAST</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.07786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Axionlike particles (ALPs), hypothetical particles beyond the Standard Model, are considered as promising dark matter candidates. ALPs can convert into photons and vice versa in a magnetic field via the Primakoff effect, potentially generating detectable oscillation in $\gamma$-ray spectra. This study analyzes 16.5 years of data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT) on NGC 1275, the brightest galaxy in the Perseus cluster, to constrain the ALP parameter space. Our results improve the previous 95\% exclusion limits of the photon-ALP coupling $g_{a\gamma}$ by a factor of 2 in the ALP mass range of $4\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_{a}\lesssim 5\times 10^{-9}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Moreover, we investigate the projected sensitivity of the future Very Large Area $\gamma$-ray Space Telescope (VLAST) on searching for ALPs. We find that (i) the expected sensitivity on the ALP-photon coupling can be stronger than that from the upcoming International Axion Observatory (IAXO) in the ALP mass range of $2\times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{eV}\lesssim m_{a}\lesssim 1\times 10^{-7}\,\mathrm{eV}$, with the best sensitivity of $g_{a\gamma}\sim 7\times 10^{-13}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ at $m_{a}\sim 2\times 10^{-10}\,\mathrm{eV}$; (ii) VLAST can extend the sensitivity of the ALP masses below $5\times 10^{-12}\,\mathrm{eV}$, where the ALP-photon coupling $g_{a\gamma}\gtrsim 1.5\times 10^{-11}\,\mathrm{GeV^{-1}}$ will be excluded; (iii) the entire parameter space of ALP accounting for TeV transparency can be fully tested. These results demonstrate that VLAST will offer an excellent opportunity for ALPs searches.</description>

      <title>Searching for continuous gravitational waves in the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array Data Release 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.13944v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present results from an all-sky search for continuous gravitational waves from individual supermassive binary black holes using the third data release (DR3) of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array (PPTA). Even though we recover a common-spectrum stochastic process, potentially induced by a nanohertz gravitational wave background, we find no evidence of continuous waves. Therefore, we place upper limits on the gravitational-wave strain amplitude: in the most sensitive frequency range around 10 nHz, we obtain a sky-averaged 95\% credibility upper limit of $\approx 7 \times 10^{-15}$. Our search is sensitive to supermassive binary black holes with a chirp mass of $\geq 10^9M_{\odot}$ up to a luminosity distance of 50 Mpc for our least sensitive sky direction and 200 Mpc for the most sensitive direction. This work provides at least 4 times better sensitivity in the 1-200 nHz frequency band than our last search based on the PPTA's first data release. We expect that PPTA will continue to play a key role in detecting continuous gravitational waves in the exciting era of nanohertz gravitational wave astronomy.</description>

      <title>Electron-Ion Equilibration in the Merging Galaxy Cluster A665</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15138v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Galaxy cluster mergers drive powerful shock fronts that heat the intracluster medium (ICM) and accelerate particles, redistributing the energy in a merger. A665 is one of only a few clusters with such a powerful shock ($\mathcal{M}\sim$3), and it provides a unique opportunity to study the thermalization timescale of the ICM, particularly the electron-ion equilibration timescale. Understanding this timescale is crucial for determining how the energy from the merger is distributed between thermal and nonthermal particle populations. Using $\sim$200 ks of NuSTAR observations, we measure the temperature distribution across the shock to distinguish between two heating models: (1) an instant collisionless model, where ions and electrons are immediately heated at the shock front; and (2) a collisional model, where electrons are initially adiabatically compressed at the shock and subsequently equilibrate with the ions over $\sim$100 Myr. Our measurements favor the delayed-equilibration model, suggesting that electrons do not immediately reach thermal equilibrium with the ions at the shock front and instead equilibrate over $t_{eq} = (4.0 \pm 3.4) \times 10^8$ yr. Additionally, our temperature measurements indicate that the Mach number may be lower than previously estimated ($\mathcal{M} = 2.8 \pm 0.7$), suggesting that the shock strength has been overestimated in past studies. These results add to our understanding of the microphysics governing how thermal energy is distributed in diffuse plasmas like the ICM, with implications for galaxy cluster evolution, large-scale structure formation, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Black hole mass function shift in proto-stellar-clusters driven by gas accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has observed compact, massive proto-stellar clusters of low metallicity in the Cosmic Gems arc galaxy at high redshift, which represent likely precursors to globular clusters. We model the mass growth of stellar black holes (BHs) during the first few Myr of the life of a massive, compact, gaseous stellar cluster before stellar feedback expels the primordial gas. At high redshift, in a lower metallicity environment stellar winds get weaker allowing for larger gas-depletion time-scales in the cluster despite of energetic pair-instability supernova (PISN) feedback for sufficiently compact clusters. Mass segregation drives the massive stellar progenitors of BHs in the center of the cluster where gas is most dense. We estimate the conditions for which the initial black hole mass function (BHMF), with a PISN-induced cut-off $&lt;55{\rm M}_\odot$, gets shifted to values within the upper BH mass gap, $\sim 60-130{\rm M}_\odot$, or higher, as observed by Gravitational Wave (GW) experiments LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA. We find that the BHs are shifted by the end of gas depletion to values within and above the mass gap, well within the range of BH components of the recent GW-signal GW231123, depending on total mass, star formation efficiency, metallicity and compactness. The individual BH mass increase follows approximately a surprisingly steep power law with respect to initial BH mass with an exponent in the range $\approx 4-6$. This occurs in gaseous proto-stellar clusters that are sufficiently massive and compact, with typical values of total mass $\sim 10^6{\rm M}_\odot$ and size $\sim 1{\rm pc}$. Our analysis suggests that proto-stellar clusters at high redshift such as Cosmic Gems arc clusters have generated through early gas accretion, BHs as heavy as $\sim 10^2-10^3{\rm M}_\odot$.</description>
