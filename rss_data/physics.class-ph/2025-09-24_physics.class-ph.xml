      <title>Causal Finite-Tick Dynamics as a Resolution of the Classical Radiation Reaction Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiation-reaction problem in classical electrodynamics has long resisted a consistent solution: the Abraham-Lorentz-Dirac equation admits runaways and pre-acceleration, while the Landau-Lifshitz (LL) equation avoids these pathologies only as a reduction-of-order approximation. We introduce Tick-Tock (TT) dynamics, a causal finite-step formulation in which radiation recoil arises from discrete tick-by-tick updates. In the continuum limit, TT reproduces the LL equation, ensuring consistency with all experimental tests of radiation reaction. Unlike LL, however, TT does not rely on reduction of order: the recoil force is expressed directly through finite-difference changes of the Lorentz acceleration, making the Schott-like energy term explicit as a telescoping boundary contribution. This construction eliminates pre-acceleration and runaway solutions while providing a transparent stepwise energy balance. Moreover, the finite-tick structure introduces a natural high-frequency cutoff, suppressing unphysical growth in discontinuous fields. Taken together, TT offers a stable and causal reformulation of radiation reaction, consistent with LL in smooth regimes but extending its applicability to rapidly varying ones, and it suggests that characteristic timescales such as $\tau_{0}$ may play a special role.</description>

      <title>Coupled Dipole Oscillation Enabled Scintillation Compensation in Turbulence-Impacted Laser Beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.19210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present work develops a rigorous framework for collective dipole oscillations in dense dielectric media by extending the Lorentz oscillator model to include both quadratic (second order) and cubic (third order) nonlinear restoring forces. Dipole-dipole interactions are incorporated via the dyadic Greens function, leading to a nonlocal description of the medium. Starting from the generalised oscillator equation, the system is expressed in matrix form with an effective stiffness matrix. Using a harmonic steady state ansatz, nonlinear terms are approximated in the frequency domain. Diagonalisation provides collective normal modes, which serve as a basis for perturbative expansion zeroth order captures the linear response, while higher orders describe nonlinear corrections. The polarisation is expressed through corrected mode amplitudes, yielding an effective nonlinear nonlocal susceptibility kernel. Finally, the scalar Greens function formalism is applied to derive the structured output field. These approaches bridge microscopic dipole dynamics with macroscopic optical propagation, offering key insights into nonlinear light matter interaction and turbulence influenced field evolution.</description>

      <title>Radiation forces and torques in optics and acoustics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23670v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mechanical action of various kinds of waves has been recognized for several centuries. The first tide of scientific interest in wave-induced forces and torques emerged at the turn of the 20th century, with the development of wave theories and the concepts of wave momentum and angular momentum. A second surge occurred in the past several decades, driven by technological breakthroughs: the invention of lasers and the controlled generation of structured wave fields. This resulted in major discoveries, including optical trapping and manipulation of small particles, from atomic to micro sizes, as well as acoustic manipulation of larger particles, including biological cells and samples. Nowadays, radiation forces and torques underpin numerous applications: optical and acoustic tweezers, acoustofluidic sorting of biological cells, optomechanical systems operating in both classical and quantum regimes, solar sails, quantum simulators, volumetric displays, etc. In this review, we present a unifying perspective on optical and acoustic forces and torques acting on various particles, addressing both their theoretical foundations and key applications. Our approach relies on the universal connection between the local energy, momentum, and spin densities of wave fields and the principal forces and torques exerted on small particles. Moreover, we describe important cases of nontrivial (e.g., lateral and pulling) forces and complex (e.g., chiral and anisotropic) particles. We also highlight significant experimental achievements involving optical and acoustic manipulation in structured wave fields. Our aim is to illuminate the common fundamental origins and close interconnections between the mechanical actions of optical and acoustic fields, thereby fostering a deeper understanding and advancing the development of optomechanical and acoustomechanical applications.</description>

      <title>Degrees of Freedom of New General Relativity 2: Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11118v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate degrees of freedom in New General Relativity. This theory is the three-parameter extension of Teleparallel Equivalent to GR and classified into nine irreducible types according to the rotation symmetry $SO(3)$ on each leaf of ADM-foliation. In the previous work~[{\it 2410.15056[gr-qc]}], we investigated the degrees of freedom in NGR types that are of interest in describing gravity: Type 2, Type 3, Type 5, and Type 8. In this work, we focus on unveiling those numbers in all other types to complete the analysis of NGR. After providing the Hamiltonian formulation of NGR and considering in detail the regularity of NGR, we perform the analysis of Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9. We reveal that the degrees of freedom of Type 4, Type 7, and Type 9 are five, zero (purely topological system in bulk spacetime), and three, respectively. Type 4 and Type 9 have second-class constraint densities only, whereas Type 7 has first-class constraint densities only. In every type, no bifurcation occurs. In particular, Type 4 and Type 7 are irregular and provide specific examples of handling irregular systems. Since no general method is known for treating an irregular system, this work contributes to furthering the understanding of irregular systems.</description>
