      <title>Content-Adaptive Rate-Quality Curve Prediction Model in Media Processing System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In streaming media services, video transcoding is a common practice to alleviate bandwidth demands. Unfortunately, traditional methods employing a uniform rate factor (RF) across all videos often result in significant inefficiencies. Content-adaptive encoding (CAE) techniques address this by dynamically adjusting encoding parameters based on video content characteristics. However, existing CAE methods are often tightly coupled with specific encoding strategies, leading to inflexibility. In this paper, we propose a model that predicts both RF-quality and RF-bitrate curves, which can be utilized to derive a comprehensive bitrate-quality curve. This approach facilitates flexible adjustments to the encoding strategy without necessitating model retraining. The model leverages codec features, content features, and anchor features to predict the bitrate-quality curve accurately. Additionally, we introduce an anchor suspension method to enhance prediction accuracy. Experiments confirm that the actual quality metric (VMAF) of the compressed video stays within 1 of the target, achieving an accuracy of 99.14%. By incorporating our quality improvement strategy with the rate-quality curve prediction model, we conducted online A/B tests, obtaining both +0.107% improvements in video views and video completions and +0.064% app duration time. Our model has been deployed on the Xiaohongshu App.</description>

      <title>Rate-aware Compression for NeRF-based Volumetric Video</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The neural radiance fields (NeRF) have advanced the development of 3D volumetric video technology, but the large data volumes they involve pose significant challenges for storage and transmission. To address these problems, the existing solutions typically compress these NeRF representations after the training stage, leading to a separation between representation training and compression. In this paper, we try to directly learn a compact NeRF representation for volumetric video in the training stage based on the proposed rate-aware compression framework. Specifically, for volumetric video, we use a simple yet effective modeling strategy to reduce temporal redundancy for the NeRF representation. Then, during the training phase, an implicit entropy model is utilized to estimate the bitrate of the NeRF representation. This entropy model is then encoded into the bitstream to assist in the decoding of the NeRF representation. This approach enables precise bitrate estimation, thereby leading to a compact NeRF representation. Furthermore, we propose an adaptive quantization strategy and learn the optimal quantization step for the NeRF representations. Finally, the NeRF representation can be optimized by using the rate-distortion trade-off. Our proposed compression framework can be used for different representations and experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the storage size with marginal distortion and achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance for volumetric video on the HumanRF and ReRF datasets. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art method TeTriRF, we achieved an approximately -80% BD-rate on the HumanRF dataset and -60% BD-rate on the ReRF dataset.</description>

      <title>Interdisciplinary Translations: Sensory Perception as a Universal Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates sensory perception's pivotal role as a universal communicative bridge across varied cultures and disciplines, and how it manifests its value in the study of media art, human computer interaction and artificial intelligence. By analyzing its function in non-verbal communication through interactive systems, and drawing on the interpretive model in translation studies where "sense" acts as a mediation between two languages, this paper illustrates how interdisciplinary communication in media art and human-computer interaction is afforded by the abstract language of human sensory perception. Specific examples from traditional art, interactive media art, HCI, communication, and translation studies demonstrate how sensory feedback translates and conveys meaning across diverse modalities of expression and how it fosters connections between humans, art, and technology. Pertaining to this topic, this paper analyzes the impact of sensory feedback systems in designing interactive experiences, and reveals the guiding role of sensory perception in the design philosophy of AI systems. Overall, the study aims to broaden the understanding of sensory perception's role in communication, highlighting its significance in the evolution of interactive experiences and its capacity to unify art, science, and the human experience.</description>

      <title>On the Role of Noise in AudioVisual Integration: Evidence from Artificial Neural Networks that Exhibit the McGurk Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans are able to fuse information from both auditory and visual modalities to help with understanding speech. This is frequently demonstrated through an phenomenon known as the McGurk Effect, during which a listener is presented with incongruent auditory and visual speech that fuse together into the percept of an illusory intermediate phoneme. Building on a recent framework that proposes how to address developmental 'why' questions using artificial neural networks, we evaluated a set of recent artificial neural networks trained on audiovisual speech by testing them with audiovisually incongruent words designed to elicit the McGurk effect. We compared networks trained on clean speech to those trained on noisy speech, and discovered that training with noisy speech led to an increase in both visual responses and McGurk responses across all models. Furthermore, we observed that systematically increasing the level of auditory noise during ANN training also increased the amount of audiovisual integration up to a point, but at extreme noise levels, this integration failed to develop. These results suggest that excessive noise exposure during critical periods of audiovisual learning may negatively influence the development of audiovisual speech integration. This work also demonstrates that the McGurk effect reliably emerges untrained from the behaviour of both supervised and unsupervised networks. This supports the notion that artificial neural networks might be useful models for certain aspects of perception and cognition.</description>

      <title>pTSE-T: Presentation Target Speaker Extraction using Unaligned Text Cues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03109v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: TSE(Target Speaker Extraction) aims to extract the clean speech of the target speaker in an audio mixture, thus eliminating irrelevant background noise and speech. While prior work has explored various auxiliary cues including pre-recorded speech, visual information (e.g., lip motions and gestures), and spatial information, the acquisition and selection of such strong cues are infeasible in many practical scenarios. Unlike all existing work, in this paper, we condition the TSE algorithm on semantic cues extracted from limited and unaligned text content, such as condensed points from a presentation slide. This method is particularly useful in scenarios like meetings, poster sessions, or lecture presentations, where acquiring other cues in real-time is challenging. To this end, we design two different networks. Specifically, our proposed TPE fuses audio features with content-based semantic cues to facilitate time-frequency mask generation to filter out extraneous noise, while another proposal, namely TSR, employs the contrastive learning technique to associate blindly separated speech signals with semantic cues. The experimental results show the efficacy in accurately identifying the target speaker by utilizing semantic cues derived from limited and unaligned text, resulting in SI-SDRi of 12.16 dB, SDRi of 12.66 dB, PESQi of 0.830 and STOIi of 0.150, respectively. Dataset and source code will be publicly available. Project demo page: https://slideTSE.github.io/.</description>
