      <title>Computing Betti tables and minimal presentations of zero-dimensional persistent homology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Betti tables of a multigraded module encode the grades at which there is an algebraic change in the module. Multigraded modules show up in many areas of pure and applied mathematics, and in particular in topological data analysis, where they are known as persistence modules, and where their Betti tables describe the places at which the homology of filtered simplicial complexes change. Although Betti tables of singly and bigraded modules are already being used in applications of topological data analysis, their computation in the bigraded case (which relies on an algorithm that is cubic in the size of the filtered simplicial complex) is a bottleneck when working with large datasets. We show that, in the special case of $0$-dimensional homology (which is relevant for clustering and graph classification) the Betti tables of a bigraded module can be computed in log-linear time. We also consider the problem of computing minimal presentations, and show that a minimal presentation of $0$-dimensional persistent homology can be computed in quadratic time, regardless of the grading poset.</description>

      <title>Topological numbers and their use to characterize simple points for 2D binary images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21588v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we adapt the two topological numbers, which have been proposed to efficiently characterize simple points in specific neighborhoods for 3D binary images, to the case of 2D binary images. Unlike the 3D case, we only use a single neighborhood to define these two topological numbers for the 2D case. Then, we characterize simple points either by using the two topological numbers or by a single topological number linked to another one condition. We compare the characterization of simple points by topological numbers with two other ones based on Hilditch crossing number and Yokoi number. We also highlight the number of possible configurations corresponding to a simple point, which also represents the maximum limit of local configurations that a thinning algorithm operating by parallel deletion of simple (individual) points may delete while preserving topology (limit usually not reachable, depending on the deletion strategy).</description>

      <title>Ideal Membership Problem for Boolean Minority and Dual Discriminator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22102v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the polynomial Ideal Membership Problem (IMP) for ideals encoding combinatorial problems that are instances of CSPs over a finite language. In this paper, the input polynomial $f$ has degree at most $d=O(1)$ (we call this problem IMP$_d$). We bridge the gap in \cite{MonaldoMastrolilli2019} by proving that the IMP$_d$ for Boolean combinatorial ideals whose constraints are closed under the minority polymorphism can be solved in polynomial time. This completes the identification of the tractability for the Boolean IMP$_d$. We also prove that the proof of membership for the IMP$_d$ for problems constrained by the dual discriminator polymorphism over any finite domain can be found in polynomial time. Our results can be used in applications such as Nullstellensatz and Sum-of-Squares proofs.</description>

      <title>Homotopy-Aware Multi-Agent Path Planning on Plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01945v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient framework using Dynnikov coordinates for homotopy-aware multi-agent path planning in planar domains that may contain obstacles. We developed a method for generating multiple homotopically distinct solutions for the multi-agent path planning problem in planar domains by combining our framework with revised prioritized planning and proved its completeness under specific assumptions. Experimentally, we demonstrated that our method is significantly faster than a method without Dynnikov coordinates. We also confirmed experimentally that homotopy-aware planning contributes to avoiding locally optimal solutions when searching for low-cost trajectories for a swarm of agents in a continuous environment.</description>

      <title>On Sparse Covers of Minor Free Graphs, Low Dimensional Metric Embeddings, and other applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.14060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.14060v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a metric space $(X,d_X)$, a $(\beta,s,\Delta)$-sparse cover is a collection of clusters $\mathcal{C}\subseteq P(X)$ with diameter at most $\Delta$, such that for every point $x\in X$, the ball $B_X(x,\frac\Delta\beta)$ is fully contained in some cluster $C\in \mathcal{C}$, and $x$ belongs to at most $s$ clusters in $\mathcal{C}$. Our main contribution is to show that the shortest path metric of every $K_r$-minor free graphs admits $(O(r),O(r^2),\Delta)$-sparse cover, and for every $\epsilon&gt;0$, $(4+\epsilon,O(\frac1\epsilon)^r,\Delta)$-sparse cover (for arbitrary $\Delta&gt;0$). We then use this sparse cover to show that every $K_r$-minor free graph embeds into $\ell_\infty^{\tilde{O}(\frac1\epsilon)^{r+1}\cdot\log n}$ with distortion $3+\epsilon$ (resp. into $\ell_\infty^{\tilde{O}(r^2)\cdot\log n}$ with distortion $O(r)$). Further, among other applications, this sparse cover immediately implies an algorithm for the oblivious buy-at-bulk problem in fixed minor free graphs with the tight approximation factor $O(\log n)$ (previously nothing beyond general graphs was known).</description>

      <title>Rectangulotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17349v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rectangulations are decompositions of a square into finitely many axis-aligned rectangles. We describe realizations of $(n-1)$-dimensional polytopes associated with two combinatorial families of rectangulations composed of $n$ rectangles. They are defined as quotientopes of natural lattice congruences on the weak Bruhat order on permutations in $\mathfrak{S}_n$, and their skeleta are flip graphs on rectangulations. We give simple vertex and facet descriptions of these polytopes, in particular elementary formulas for computing the coordinates of the vertex corresponding to each rectangulation, in the spirit of J.-L. Loday's realization of the associahedron.</description>
