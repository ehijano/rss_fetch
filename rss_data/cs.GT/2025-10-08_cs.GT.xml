      <title>Computing Envy-Free up to Any Good (EFX) Allocations via Local Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple local search algorithm for computing EFX (envy-free up to any good) allocations of $m$ indivisible goods among $n$ agents with additive valuations. EFX is a compelling fairness notion, and whether such allocations always exist remains a major open question in fair division.
  Our algorithm employs simulated annealing with the total number of EFX violations as an objective function together with a single-transfer neighborhood structure to move through the space of allocations. It found an EFX allocation in all the instances tested, which included thousands of randomly generated inputs, and scaled to settings with hundreds of agents and/or thousands of items. The algorithm's simplicity, along with its strong empirical performance makes it a simple benchmark for evaluating future approaches.
  On the theoretical side, we provide a potential function for identical additive valuations, which ensures that any strict-descent procedure under the single-transfer neighborhood ends at an EFX allocation. This represents an alternative proof of existence for identical valuations.</description>

      <title>Fair Rent Division: New Budget and Rent Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the classical rent division problem, where $n$ agents must allocate $n$ indivisible rooms and split a fixed total rent $R$. The goal is to compute an envy-free (EF) allocation, where no agent prefers another agent's room and rent to their own. This problem has been extensively studied under standard assumptions, where efficient algorithms for computing EF allocations are known.
  We extend this framework by introducing two practically motivated constraints: (i) lower and upper bounds on room rents, and (ii) room-specific budget for agents. We develop efficient combinatorial algorithms that either compute a feasible EF allocation or certify infeasibility.
  We further design algorithms to optimize over EF allocations using natural fairness objectives such as maximin utility, leximin utility, and minimum utility spread. Our approach unifies both constraint types within a single algorithmic framework, advancing the applicability of fair division methods in real-world platforms such as Spliddit.</description>

      <title>Fair metric distortion for matching with preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the matching problem in the metric distortion framework. There are $n$ agents and $n$ items occupying points in a shared metric space, and the goal is to design a matching mechanism that outputs a low-cost matching between the agents and items, using only agents' ordinal rankings of the candidates by distance. A mechanism has distortion $\alpha$ if it always outputs a matching whose cost is within a factor of $\alpha$ of the optimum, in every instance regardless of the metric space.
  Typically, the cost of a matching is measured in terms of the total distance between matched agents and items, but this measure can incentivize unfair outcomes where a handful of agents bear the brunt of the cost. With this in mind, we consider how the metric distortion problem changes when the cost is instead measured in terms of the maximum cost of any agent. We show that while these two notions of distortion can in general differ by a factor of $n$, the distortion of a variant of the state-of-the-art mechanism, RepMatch, actually improves from $O(n^2)$ under the sum objective to $O(n^{1.58})$ under the max objective. We also show that for any fairness objective defined by a monotone symmetric norm, this algorithm guarantees distortion $O(n^2)$.</description>

      <title>Hallucinating Flows for Optimal Mechanisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Myerson's seminal characterization of the revenue-optimal auction for a single item \cite{myerson1981optimal} remains a cornerstone of mechanism design. However, generalizing this framework to multi-item settings has proven exceptionally challenging. Even under restrictive assumptions, closed-form characterizations of optimal mechanisms are rare and are largely confined to the single-agent case \cite{pavlov2011optimal,hart2017approximate, daskalakis2018transport, GIANNAKOPOULOS2018432}, departing from the two-item setting only when prior distributions are uniformly distributed \cite{manelli2006bundling, daskalakis2017strong,giannakopoulos2018sjm}. In this work, we build upon the bi-valued setting introduced by Yao \cite{YAO_BIC_DSIC}, where each item's value has support 2 and lies in $\{a, b\}$. Yao's result provides the only known closed-form optimal mechanism for multiple agents. We extend this line of work along three natural axes, establishing the first closed-form optimal mechanisms in each of the following settings: (i) $n$ i.i.d. agents and $m$ i.i.d. items (ii) $n$ non-i.i.d. agents and two i.i.d. items and (iii) $n$ i.i.d. agents and two non-i.i.d. items. Our results lie at the limit of what is considered possible, since even with a single agent and m bi-valued non-i.i.d. items, finding the optimal mechanism is $\#P$-Hard \cite{daskalakis2014complexity, xi2018soda}. We finally generalize the discrete analog of a result from~\cite{daskalakis2017strong}, showing that for a single agent with $m$ items drawn from arbitrary (non-identical) discrete distributions, grand bundling is optimal when all item values are sufficiently large. We further show that for any continuous product distribution, grand bundling achieves $\mathrm{OPT} - \epsilon$ revenue for large enough values.</description>

      <title>Mechanism design and equilibrium analysis of smart contract mediated resource allocation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized coordination and digital contracting are becoming critical in complex industrial ecosystems, yet existing approaches often rely on ad hoc heuristics or purely technical blockchain implementations without a rigorous economic foundation. This study develops a mechanism design framework for smart contract-based resource allocation that explicitly embeds efficiency and fairness in decentralized coordination. We establish the existence and uniqueness of contract equilibria, extending classical results in mechanism design, and introduce a decentralized price adjustment algorithm with provable convergence guarantees that can be implemented in real time. To evaluate performance, we combine extensive synthetic benchmarks with a proof-of-concept real-world dataset (MovieLens). The synthetic tests probe robustness under fee volatility, participation shocks, and dynamic demand, while the MovieLens case study illustrates how the mechanism can balance efficiency and fairness in realistic allocation environments. Results demonstrate that the proposed mechanism achieves substantial improvements in both efficiency and equity while remaining resilient to abrupt perturbations, confirming its stability beyond steady state analysis. The findings highlight broad managerial and policy relevance for supply chains, logistics, energy markets, healthcare resource allocation, and public infrastructure, where transparent and auditable coordination is increasingly critical. By combining theoretical rigor with empirical validation, the study shows how digital contracts can serve not only as technical artifacts but also as institutional instruments for transparency, accountability, and resilience in high-stakes resource allocation.</description>

      <title>M\"obius transforms and Shapley values for vector-valued functions on weighted directed acyclic multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the concept of M\"obius inversion and Shapley values to directed acyclic multigraphs and weighted versions thereof. We further allow value functions (games) and thus their M\"obius transforms (synergy function) and Shapley values to have values in any abelian group that is a module over a ring that contains the graph weights, e.g. vector-valued functions. To achieve this and overcome the obstruction that the classical axioms (linearity, efficiency, null player, symmetry) are not strong enough to uniquely determine Shapley values in this more general setting, we analyze Shapley values from two novel points of view: 1) We introduce projection operators that allow us to interpret Shapley values as the recursive projection and re-attribution of higher-order synergies to lower-order ones; 2) we propose a strengthening of the null player axiom and a localized symmetry axiom, namely the weak elements and flat hierarchy axioms. The former allows us to remove coalitions with vanishing synergy while preserving the rest of the hierarchical structure. The latter treats player-coalition bonds uniformly in the corner case of hierarchically flat graphs. Together with linearity these axioms already imply a unique explicit formula for the Shapley values, as well as classical properties like efficiency, null player, symmetry, and novel ones like the projection property. This whole framework then specializes to finite inclusion algebras, lattices, partial orders and mereologies, and also recovers certain previously known cases as corner cases, and presents others from a new perspective. The admission of general weighted directed acyclic multigraph structured hierarchies and vector-valued functions and Shapley values opens up the possibility for new analytic tools and application areas, like machine learning, language processing, explainable artificial intelligence, and many more.</description>

      <title>A Small Collusion is All You Need</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transaction Fee Mechanisms (TFMs) study auction design in the Blockchain context, and emphasize robustness against miner and user collusion, moreso than traditional auction theory. \cite{chung2023foundations} introduce the notion of a mechanism being $c$-Side-Contract-Proof ($c$-SCP), i.e., robust to a collusion of the miner and $c$ users. Later work \cite{chung2024collusion,welfareIncreasingCollusion} shows a gap between the $1$-SCP and $2$-SCP classes. We show that the class of $2$-SCP mechanisms equals that of any $c$-SCP with $c\geq 2$, under a relatively minor assumption of consistent tie-breaking. In essence, this implies that any mechanism vulnerable to collusion, is also vulnerable to a small collusion.</description>

      <title>The Query Complexity of Uniform Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real-world pricing mechanisms are typically optimized using training data, a setting corresponding to the $\textit{pricing query complexity}$ problem in Mechanism Design. The previous work (LSTW23, SODA) studies the $\textit{single-distribution}$ case, with tight bounds of $\widetilde{\Theta}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ for a $\textit{general}$ distribution and $\widetilde{\Theta}(\varepsilon^{-2})$ for either a $\textit{regular}$ or $\textit{monotone-hazard-rate (MHR)}$ distribution.
  This can be directly interpreted as ''the query complexity of the $\textsf{Uniform Pricing}$ mechanism, in the $\textit{single-distribution}$ case''. Yet in the $\textit{multi-distribution}$ case, can the regularity and MHR conditions still lead to improvements over the tight bound $\widetilde{\Theta}(\varepsilon^{-3})$ for general distributions? We answer this question in the negative, by establishing a (near-)matching lower bound $\Omega(\varepsilon^{-3})$ for either $\textit{two regular distributions}$ or $\textit{three MHR distributions}$.
  We also address the $\textit{regret minimization}$ problem and, in comparison with the folklore upper bound $\widetilde{O}(T^{2 / 3})$ for general distributions (see, e.g., SW24, EC), establish a (near-)matching lower bound $\Omega(T^{2 / 3})$ for either $\textit{two regular distributions}$ or $\textit{three MHR distributions}$, via a black-box reduction. Again, this is in stark contrast to the tight bound $\widetilde{\Theta}(T^{1 / 2})$ for a single regular or MHR distribution.</description>

      <title>Measurement of Trustworthiness of the Online Reviews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.00815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.00815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In electronic commerce (e-commerce)markets, a decision-maker faces a sequential choice problem. Third-party intervention is essential in making purchase decisions in this choice process. For instance, while purchasing products/services online, a buyer's choice or behavior is often affected by the overall reviewers' ratings, feedback, etc. Moreover, the reviewer is also a decision-maker. The question that arises is how trustworthy these review reports and ratings are. The trustworthiness of these review reports and ratings is based on whether the reviewer is rational or irrational. Indexing the reviewer's rationality could be a way to quantify a reviewer's rationality, but it needs to communicate the history of their behavior. In this article, the researcher aims to derive a rationality pattern function formally and, thereby, the degree of rationality of the decision-maker or the reviewer in the sequential choice problem in the e-commerce markets. Applying such a rationality pattern function could make quantifying the rational behavior of an agent participating in the digital markets easier. This, in turn, is expected to minimize the information asymmetry within the decision-making process and identify the paid reviewers or manipulative reviews.</description>
