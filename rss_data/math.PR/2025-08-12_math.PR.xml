      <title>An Exponential Concentration Inequality for the Components of a Uniform Random Vector on the Sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that if $\vec X = (X_1, \dots, X_N)$ is a uniform random vector on the unit Euclidean sphere, the empirical CDF of the components of $\sqrt N \vec X = (\sqrt N X_1, \dots, \sqrt N X_N)$ concentrates exponentially rapidly in $N$ around the standard Gaussian CDF $\Phi$. More precisely, we find explicit functions $\gamma$ and $g_\pm$ such that the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance between the empirical CDF of the components of $\sqrt N \vec X$ and $\Phi$ deviates by more than $\epsilon + \gamma(t)$ with probability at most $2e^{-2N\epsilon^2} + e^{-Ng_+(t)^2} + e^{-Ng_-(t)^2}$ for $\epsilon &gt; 0$ and $t\in[0,1)$. A weaker but more transparent inequality replacing $\gamma$ and $g_\pm$ with linear functions is obtained as a corollary. All functions and constants are explicit, so our bounds offer finite-sample guarantees for statistical applications.</description>

      <title>Onsager--Machlup functional for multiple SLEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, Carfagnini and Wang established that the loop Loewner energy can be interpreted as the Onsager--Machlup functional for the SLE loop measure. In this paper, we first interpret the multi-chordal Loewner potential as an Onsager--Machlup functional for the multi-chordal SLE. Subsequently, we extend the conformal deformation formula to the multi-radial Loewner potential and derive the Onsager--Machlup functional for the multi-radial SLE.</description>

      <title>Fredrickson Andersen Model and Noisy Majority Vote Process on Nonamenable Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Fredrickson-Andersen j-spin facilitated model and the noisy majority vote process on connected infinite graphs satisfying suitable expansion properties. For the former, we consider the out-of-equilibrium regime where the density of facilitating sites is close to 1, both for the equilibrium product measure and for the initial configuration, and we show exponential convergence to equilibrium. For the latter, we prove the existence of multiple equilibrium measures, generalising recent results by J. Ding and F. Huang (2025). Our proofs build on the framework of decorated set systems introduced by I. Hartarsky and F. Toninelli (2024) and establish exponentially decaying tails for the diameter of the space-time cluster of zeros containing a fixed vertex for both perturbed bootstrap percolation and consensus processes. The results are essentially sharp on hyperbolic lattices and we further show how some of the borderline cases can be handled using Toom contours, in the reformulation by J. M. Swart, R. Szab\'o and C. Toninelli (2022).</description>

      <title>$\mathbb{L}^p$-solutions for BSDEs and Reflected BSDEs with jumps in a general filtration under stochastic Lipschitz coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the existence and uniqueness of $\mathbb{L}^p$-solutions for $p \in (1, 2)$, first for backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) in a general filtration that supports a Brownian motion and an independent Poisson random measure, and then for reflected BSDEs with an RCLL barrier in the same stochastic framework. The results are obtained under suitable $\mathbb{L}^p$-integrability conditions on the data and a stochastic-Lipschitz condition on the coefficient.</description>

      <title>The Maki-Thompson model with random awareness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a rumor propagation model in which individuals within a homogeneously mixed population can assume one of infinitely many possible states. To analyze this model, we extend the classical law of large numbers for density-dependent population models in $\mathbb{R}^d$ (Ethier \&amp; Kurtz in 2005) to an infinite--dimensional setting. Specifically, we prove a convergence result for stochastic processes in the space of $p$-summable real sequences, generalizing the finite-dimensional theory. We apply this framework to an infinite-dimensional continuous-time Markov chain that can be seen as a generalization of the Maki--Thompson model, where each ignorant individual becomes a spreader only after hearing the rumor a random number of times. We derive the asymptotic proportions of individuals in each state at the end of a rumor outbreak. Furthermore, we characterize the maximum proportion of individuals actively spreading the rumor and explore conditions under which the model exhibits waves of rumor propagation.</description>

      <title>Stein's method for asymmetric Laplace approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07245v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by its appearance as a limiting distribution for random and non-random sums of independent random variables, in this paper we develop Stein's method for approximation by the asymmetric Laplace distribution. Our results generalise and offer technical refinements on existing results concerning Stein's method for (symmetric) Laplace approximation. We provide general bounds for asymmetric Laplace approximation in the Kolmogorov and Wasserstein distances, and a smooth Wasserstein distance, that involve a distributional transformation that can be viewed as an asymmetric Laplace analogue of the zero bias transformation. As an application, we derive explicit Kolmogorov, Wasserstein and smooth Wasserstein distance bounds for the asymmetric Laplace approximation of geometric random sums, and complement these results by providing explicit bounds for the asymmetric Laplace approximation of a deterministic sum of random variables with a random normalisation sequence.</description>

Abstract: Let $X_{1}, ..., X_{n}$ be arbitrary non-negative independent random variables with respective expected values $\mu_{i}$ at most one and $\delta &gt; 0$. We prove Feige's Conjecture $\mathbb{P} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_{i} &lt; \mu + \delta \right) \geq \min \left\{ \frac{\delta}{1 + \delta} \, , \, \exp \left(-1 \right) \right\}$, where $\mu$ is the expected value of the sum of the random variables. We show by a simple example how this inequality finds use in mathematical finance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the regularization effects, in the sense of Malliavin calculus, on functionals of Gaussian processes induced by time integration, focusing on their covariance functions. We study several examples of important covariance functions classes to verify whether they satisfy the sufficient conditions proposed for regularization. Additionally, we derive a weak implication for the smoothness of level-crossing functionals.</description>

      <title>Wicksell's corpuscle problem in spaces of constant curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Wicksell's corpuscle problem in spaces of constant curvature, thus extending the classical Euclidean framework. We consider a particle process of balls with random radii in such a space, assumed to be invariant under the action of the full isometry group. We refer to the process of intersections of these balls with a fixed totally geodesic hypersurface as the induced process. We first derive a section formula expressing the distribution of the induced process in terms of that of the original process. Conversely, assuming that the distribution of the induced process is known, we establish an inversion formula that recovers the distribution of the original process. Finally, we show that in the limit as the curvature of the space tends to zero, our section and inversion formulas converge to the classical Euclidean results.</description>

      <title>Ergodicity of infinite volume $\Phi^4_3$ at high temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the infinite volume $\Phi^4_3$ dynamic and show that it is globally well-posed in a suitable weighted Besov space of distributions. At high temperatures / small coupling, we furthermore show that the difference between any two solutions driven by the same realisation of the noise converges to zero exponentially fast. This allows us to characterise the infinite-volume $\Phi^4_3$ measure at high temperature as the unique invariant measure of the dynamic, and to prove that it satisfies all Osterwalder--Schrader axioms, including invariance under translations, rotations, and reflections, as well as exponential decay of correlations.</description>

      <title>Feynman-Kac formula gor general time dependent stochastic parabolic equation on a bounded domain and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a Feynman-Kac formula to represent the solution to general time inhomogeneous stochastic parabolic partial differential equations driven by multiplicative fractional Gaussian noises in bounded domain where L_t is a second order uniformly elliptic operator whose coefficients can depend on time and generates a time inhomoegenous Markov process. The idea is to use the Aronson bounds of fundamental solution of the associated heat kernel and the techniques from Malliavin calculus. The newly obtained Feynman-Kac formula is then applied to establish the Holder regularity in the space and time variables. The dependence on time of the coefficients poses serious challenges and new results about the stochastic differential equations are discovered to face the challenge. An amazing application of the Feynman-Kac formula is about the matching upper and lower bounds for all moments of the solution, an critical tool for the intermittency. For the latter result we need first to establish new small ball like bounds for the diffusion associated with the parabolic differential operator in the bounded domain which is of interest on its own.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores the Site Frequency Spectrum (SFS) in stationary branching populations. We derive estimates for the SFS associated with a sample from a continuous-state branching process conditioned to never go extinct, utilizing a quadratic branching mechanism. The genealogy of such processes is represented by a real tree with a semi-infinite branch, and we compute the expectation of the SFS under the infinitely-many-sites assumption as the sample size approaches infinity. Additionally, we present a continuum version of the SFS as a random point measure on the positive real line and compute the density of its expected measure explicitly. Finally, we derive estimates for the size of the clonal subpopulation carrying the same genotype as the most recent common ancestor of the whole population at a given time.</description>

      <title>Sharper Perturbed-Kullback-Leibler Exponential Tail Bounds for Beta and Dirichlet Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07991</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07991v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an improved exponential tail bound for Beta distributions, refining a result in [15]. This improvement is achieved by interpreting their bound as a regular Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence one, while introducing a specific perturbation $\eta$ that shifts the mean of the Beta distribution closer to zero within the KL bound. Our contribution is to show that a larger perturbation can be chosen, thereby tightening the bound. We then extend this result from the Beta distribution to Dirichlet distributions and Dirichlet processes (DPs).</description>

      <title>Recent Progress on Fractal Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a survey paper about the fractal percolation process, also known as Mandelbrot percolation. It is intended to give a general breadth overview of more recent research in the topic, but also includes some of the more classical results, for example related to the connectivity properties. Particular emphasis is put on the dimension theory of the limiting set and also on the geometry of the non-trivial connected components in the supercritical regime. In particular, we show that both the Assouad spectrum and intermediate dimensions of the non-trivial connected components are constant equal to its box dimension despite its Hausdorff, box and Assouad dimensions known to being distinct.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic Statistical Theory for the Samples Problems using the Functional Empirical Process, revisited I</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the asymptotic theory for samples problem based on the functional empirical process (fep), this new method is called general samples problem. We suggest this method to develop the full theory of estimation of means, variances, ratios of variances and difference of means for independent samples. We compare the results of our new method to the Gaussian method using simulated and real data. The obtained results are almost equivalent to those in the Gaussian case for samples's size equal to $10$. It has been prove that the estimation of the means difference is very precise regardless of the equality or inequality of variances for greater sizes of sample. This method is recommended when the sizes of samples is around or greater that $15$ and it requires the finiteness of the fourth order moment.</description>

Abstract: This paper explores the connection between perfect t-embeddings and the octahedron equation in the setting of the two-periodic Aztec diamond.

Abstract: A random rooted graph is said to be sofic if it is the Benjamini-Schramm limit of a sequence of finite graphs. Given any finite graph $H$, we prove that every one-ended, unimodular random rooted graph that does not have H as a minor must be sofic. The hypothesis regarding the number of ends can be dropped under the additional assumption that the graph is quasi-transitive.</description>

      <title>A Score-based Diffusion Model Approach for Adaptive Learning of Stochastic Partial Differential Equation Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework for adaptively learning the time-evolving solutions of stochastic partial differential equations (SPDEs) using score-based diffusion models within a recursive Bayesian inference setting. SPDEs play a central role in modeling complex physical systems under uncertainty, but their numerical solutions often suffer from model errors and reduced accuracy due to incomplete physical knowledge and environmental variability. To address these challenges, we encode the governing physics into the score function of a diffusion model using simulation data and incorporate observational information via a likelihood-based correction in a reverse-time stochastic differential equation. This enables adaptive learning through iterative refinement of the solution as new data becomes available. To improve computational efficiency in high-dimensional settings, we introduce the ensemble score filter, a training-free approximation of the score function designed for real-time inference. Numerical experiments on benchmark SPDEs demonstrate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed method under sparse and noisy observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new stochastic model involving state-dependent variable exponent $p(\cdot)$ which allows modeling of systems where noise intensity adapts to the current state. This new flexible theoretical framework generalizes both the geometric Brownian motion (GBM) and the Constant-Elasticity-of-Variance (CEV) models. We prove an existence-uniqueness theorem. We obtain an upper-bound approximation for the model-to-model pathwise error between our model and the GBM model as well as test its accuracy through analytical and numerical error estimates.</description>

      <title>Nonparametric Reaction Coordinate Optimization with Histories: A Framework for Rare Event Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rare but critical events in complex systems, such as protein folding, chemical reactions, disease progression, and extreme weather or climate phenomena, are governed by complex, high-dimensional, stochastic dynamics. Identifying an optimal reaction coordinate (RC) that accurately captures the progress of these dynamics is crucial for understanding and simulating such processes. This work introduces a nonparametric RC optimization framework that incorporates trajectory histories, enabling robust analysis even for irregular or incomplete data. The power of the method is demonstrated through increasingly challenging analyses of protein folding dynamics, where it provides accurate committor estimates that pass a stringent validation test and yield high-resolution free energy profiles. Its generality is further illustrated through applications to dynamics in phase space, a conceptual ocean circulation model, and a longitudinal clinical dataset. These results demonstrate that rare event dynamics can be accurately characterized without exhaustive sampling of the configuration space, establishing a general, flexible, and robust framework for analyzing complex dynamical systems and longitudinal datasets.</description>

      <title>How to simulate L\'evy flights in a steep potential: An explicit splitting numerical scheme</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an effective explicit numerical scheme for simulating solutions of stochastic differential equations with confining superlinear drift terms, driven by multiplicative heavy-tailed L\'evy noise. The scheme is designed to prevent explosion and accurately capture all finite moments of the solutions.
  In the purely Gaussian case, it correctly reproduces moments of sub-Gaussian tails of the solutions.
  This method is particularly well-suited for approximating statistical moments and other probabilistic characteristics of L\'evy flights in steep potential landscapes.</description>

      <title>Conditional splitting probabilities for hidden-state inference in drift-diffusive processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Splitting probabilities quantify the likelihood of particular outcomes out of a set of mutually-exclusive possibilities for stochastic processes and play a central role in first-passage problems. For two-dimensional Markov processes $\{X(t),Y(t)\}_{t\in T}$, a joint analogue of the splitting probabilities can be defined, which captures the likelihood that the variable $X(t)$, having been initialised at $x_0 \in \mathbb{L}$, exits $\mathbb{L}$ for the first time via either of the interval boundaries \emph{and} that the variable $Y(t)$, initialised at $y_0$, is given by $y_{\rm exit}$ at the time of exit. We compute such joint splitting probabilities for two classes of processes: processes where $X(t)$ is Brownian motion and $Y(t)$ is a decoupled internal state, and unidirectionally coupled processes where $X(t)$ is drift-diffusive and depends on $Y(t)$, while $Y(t)$ evolves independently. For the first class we obtain generic expressions in terms of the eigensystem of the Fokker-Planck operator for the $Y$ dynamics, while for the second we carry out explicit derivations for three paradigmatic cases (run-and-tumble motion, diffusion in an intermittent piecewise-linear potential and diffusion with stochastic resetting). Drawing on Bayes' theorem, we subsequently introduce the related notion of conditional splitting probabilities, defined as the posterior likelihoods of the internal state $Y$ \emph{given} that the observable degree of freedom $X$ has undergone a specific exit event. After computing these conditional splitting probabilities, we propose a simple scheme that leverages them to partially infer the assumedly hidden state $Y(t)$ from point-wise detection events.</description>

      <title>Number of orbits of $k$-subsets of permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07463v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $S_n$ denote the symmetric group of order $n$. Say that two subsets $x, y\subseteq S_n$ are \emph{equivalent} if there exist permutations $g_1, g_2\in S_n$ such that $g_1xg_2=y$, where multiplication is understood elementwise. Recently, [Tripathi, 2024] and [Kushwaha and Triathi, 2025] asked for the asymptotics of $T(n,k)$, the number of subsets of $S_n$ of size $k$ up to this equivalence. It is easy to see that $T(n,0)=T(n, 1)=1$ and $T(n, 2)=p(n)-1$, where $p(n)$ is the number of integer partitions of $n$. In this work, we show that $T(n,k) = \Lambda_n(k)(1+o_n(1))$ for $3\leq k\leq n!-3$, where $\Lambda_n(k)=\frac{1}{n!^2}\binom{n!}{k}$. Furthermore, we prove that $$\frac{1}{\Lambda_n(n!/2)}T\!\left(n,\left[\sqrt{\tfrac{n!}{4}}x+\tfrac{n!}{2}\right]\right) ~\xrightarrow{n\to\infty}~ \exp\!\left(-\tfrac{x^2}{2}\right),$$ uniformly over $\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>When and how can inexact generative models still sample from the data manifold?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A curious phenomenon observed in some dynamical generative models is the following: despite learning errors in the score function or the drift vector field, the generated samples appear to shift \emph{along} the support of the data distribution but not \emph{away} from it. In this work, we investigate this phenomenon of \emph{robustness of the support} by taking a dynamical systems approach on the generating stochastic/deterministic process. Our perturbation analysis of the probability flow reveals that infinitesimal learning errors cause the predicted density to be different from the target density only on the data manifold for a wide class of generative models. Further, what is the dynamical mechanism that leads to the robustness of the support? We show that the alignment of the top Lyapunov vectors (most sensitive infinitesimal perturbation directions) with the tangent spaces along the boundary of the data manifold leads to robustness and prove a sufficient condition on the dynamics of the generating process to achieve this alignment. Moreover, the alignment condition is efficient to compute and, in practice, for robust generative models, automatically leads to accurate estimates of the tangent bundle of the data manifold. Using a finite-time linear perturbation analysis on samples paths as well as probability flows, our work complements and extends existing works on obtaining theoretical guarantees for generative models from a stochastic analysis, statistical learning and uncertainty quantification points of view. Our results apply across different dynamical generative models, such as conditional flow-matching and score-based generative models, and for different target distributions that may or may not satisfy the manifold hypothesis.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.07928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish non-asymptotic bounds for accuracy of normal approximation for linear two-timescale stochastic approximation (TTSA) algorithms driven by martingale difference or Markov noise. Focusing on both the last iterate and Polyak-Ruppert averaging regimes, we derive bounds for normal approximation in terms of the convex distance between probability distributions. Our analysis reveals a non-trivial interaction between the fast and slow timescales: the normal approximation rate for the last iterate improves as the timescale separation increases, while it decreases in the Polyak-Ruppert averaged setting. We also provide the high-order moment bounds for the error of linear TTSA algorithm, which may be of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Propagation of weak log-concavity along generalised heat flows via Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07931v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A well-known consequence of the Pr{\'e}kopa-Leindler inequality is the preservation of logconcavity by the heat semigroup. Unfortunately, this property does not hold for more general semigroups. In this paper, we exhibit a slightly weaker notion of log-concavity that can be propagated along generalised heat semigroups. As a consequence, we obtain logsemiconcavity properties for the ground state of Schr{\"o}dinger operators for non-convex potentials, as well as propagation of functional inequalities along generalised heat flows. We then investigate the preservation of weak log-concavity by conditioning and marginalisation, following the seminal works of Brascamp and Lieb. To our knowledge, our results are the first of this type in non log-concave settings. We eventually study generation of log-concavity by parabolic regularisation and prove novel two-sided log-Hessian estimates for the fundamental solution of parabolic equations with unbounded coefficients, which can be made uniform in time. These properties are obtained as a consequence of new propagation of weak convexity results for quadratic Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations. The proofs rely on a stochastic control interpretation combined with a second order analysis of reflection coupling along HJB characteristics.</description>

      <title>On the attainability of singular Wiener bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize the lower and upper attainability of the Wiener bound (also known as Voigt-Reuss bound) for singularly distributed conductive material mixtures. For the lower attainability we consider mixtures in which high-conductance materials support on sets having finite one-dimensional Hausdorff measures. We show that, under a mild coercivity condition, the kernel of the effective tensor of the mixture is equal to the orthogonal complement of the homotopy classes of closed paths in the supporting set. This shows that a periodic planar network has positive definite effective tensor, i.e., it is resilient to fluctuations, if and only if the network is reticulate. We provide a geometric characterization of the upper attainability by applying a transformation from varifolds to matrix-valued measures. We show that this transformation leads to an equivalence between two distinct notions from material science and geometric measure theory respectively: conductance maximality and area criticality. Based on this relation we show a pointwise dimension bound for mixtures that attain the upper Wiener bound by applying a fractional version of the monotonicity formula for stationary varifolds. This dimension bound illustrates how the maximality condition constrains the local anisotropy and the local distribution of conductance magnitudes. Both the lower and upper attainability results have potential novel applications in modeling leaf venation patterns.</description>

      <title>Many-Server Asymptotics for Join-the-Shortest-Queue: Large Deviations and Rare Events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.04938</link>
      <description>arXiv:1904.04938v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Join-the-Shortest-Queue routing policy is studied in an asymptotic regime where the number of processors $n$ scales with the arrival rate. A large deviation principle (LDP) for the occupancy process is established, as $n\to \infty$, in a suitable infinite-dimensional path space. Model features that present technical challenges include, Markovian dynamics with discontinuous statistics, a diminishing rate property of the transition probability rates, and an infinite-dimensional state space. The difficulty is in the proof of the Laplace lower bound which requires establishing the uniqueness of solutions of certain infinite-dimensional systems of controlled ordinary differential equations. The LDP gives information on the rate of decay of probabilities of various types of rare events associated with the system. We illustrate this by establishing explicit exponential decay rates for probabilities of long queues. In particular, denoting by $E_j^n(T)$ the event that there is at least one queue with $j$ or more jobs at some time instant over $[0,T]$, we show that, in the critical case, for large $n$ and $T$, $\mathbb{P}(E^n_j(T)) \approx \exp\left [-\frac{n (j-2)^2}{4T}\right].$</description>

      <title>Quantization for the mixtures of uniform distributions on connected and disconnected line segments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2203.12664v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we have studied various mixed distributions generated by two uniform distributions: first, where the supports are two connected line segments, and second, where the supports are two disconnected line segments. For these mixed distributions, we have determined the optimal sets of $n$-means and the corresponding $n$th quantization errors for all positive integers $n $. The methods developed in this paper can be applied more generally to investigate optimal quantization for any mixed distribution $P := pP_1 + (1 - p)P_2,$ where $P_1$ and $P_2$ are arbitrary probability distributions supported on either connected or disconnected line segments, and $(p, 1 - p)$ is any probability vector with $0 &lt; p &lt; 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2207.14152v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Optimal quantization for mixed distributions has emerged as a compelling area of study. In this work, we have focused on a mixed distribution formed from two uniform distributions with partially overlapping supports. For this class of distributions, we have examined the structure of optimal sets of $n$-means and the corresponding $n$th quantization errors for all positive integers $n$. Initially, we explicitly determined the optimal sets and quantization errors for $1 \leq n \leq 6$. Subsequently, we established several key lemmas and propositions and proposed an algorithm that facilitates the computation of optimal $n$-means and quantization errors for all $n \geq 5$. Numerical results are also presented to illustrate the application of the algorithm in deriving these quantities. The findings of this study offer valuable insight and serve as a foundation for further research on quantization in the context of mixed distributions with overlapping supports.</description>

      <title>The compact support property for solutions to stochastic heat equations with stable noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.04520v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider weak non-negative solutions to the stochastic partial differential equation \[ \partial_t Y(t,x) = \Delta Y(t,x) + Y(t,x)^\gamma \dot{L}(t,x), \] for $(t,x) \in \mathbb{R}_+ \times \mathbb{R}^d$, where $\gamma &gt; 0$ and $\dot{L}$ is a one-sided stable noise of index $\alpha \in (1,2)$. We prove that solutions with compactly supported initial data have compact support for all times if $\gamma \in (2-\alpha, 1)$ for $d=1$, and if $\gamma \in [1/\alpha,1)$ in dimensions $d \in [2,2/(\alpha-1)) \cap \mathbb{N}$. This complements known results on solutions to the equation with Gaussian noise.
  We also establish a stochastic integral formula for the density of a solution and associated moment bounds which hold in all dimensions for which solutions are defined.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.15508v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide a general framework for investigating McKean-Vlasov stochastic partial differential equations. We first show the existence of weak solutions by combining the localizing approximation, Faedo-Galerkin technique, compactness method and the Jakubowski version of the Skorokhod representation theorem. Then under certain locally monotone condition we further investigate the existence and uniqueness of (probabilistically) strong solutions. The applications of the main results include a large class of McKean-Vlasov stochastic partial differential equations such as stochastic 2D/3D Navier-Stokes equations, stochastic Cahn-Hilliard equations and stochastic Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equations. Finally, we show a propagation of chaos result in Wasserstein distance for weakly interacting stochastic 2D Navier-Stokes systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.11167v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by recent development of mean-field systems with common noise, this paper establishes Ito's formula for flows of conditional probability measures under a common filtration associated with general semimartingales. This generalizes existing works on flows of conditional measures on Ito processes and flows of deterministic measure on general semimartingales. The key technical components involve constructing conditional independent copies and establishing the equivalence between stochastic integrals with respect to the conditional law of semimartingales and the conditional expectation of stochastic integrals with respect to copies of semimartingales. Ito's formula is then established for cylindrical functions through conditional independent copies, and extended to the general case through function approximations.</description>

      <title>$L^2$-Wasserstein contraction of modified Euler schemes for SDEs with high diffusivity and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.01731v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we are concerned with a modified Euler scheme for the SDE under consideration, where the drift is of super-linear growth and dissipative merely outside a closed ball. By adopting the synchronous coupling, along with the construction of an equivalent quasi-metric, the $L^2$-Wasserstein contraction of the modified Euler scheme is addressed provided that the diffusivity is large enough. In particular, as a by-product, the $L^2$ Wasserstein contraction of the projected (truncated) Euler scheme and the tamed Euler algorithm is treated under much more explicit conditions imposed on drifts. The theory derived on the $L^2$-Wasserstein contraction has numerous applications on various aspects. In addition to applications on Poincar\'{e} inequalities (with respect to the numerical transition kernel and the numerical invariant probability measure), concentration inequalities for empirical averages, and bounds concerning the KL-divergence, in this paper we present another two potential applications. One concerns the non-asymptotic $L^2$-Wasserstein bound corresponding to the projected Euler scheme and the tamed Euler recursion, respectively, which further implies the $L^2$-Wasserstein error bound between the exact invariant probability measure and the numerical counterpart. It is worthy to emphasize that the associated convergence rate is improved greatly in contrast to the existing literature. Another application is devoted to the strong law of large numbers of additive functionals related to the modified Euler algorithm, where the observable functions involved are allowed to be of polynomial growth, and the associated convergence rate is also enhanced remarkably.</description>

Abstract: It is known that the set of lumpable Markov chains over a finite state space, with respect to a fixed lumping function, generally does not form an exponential family of stochastic matrices. In this work, we explore efficiently verifiable necessary and sufficient conditions for families of lumpable transition matrices to form exponential families. To this end, we develop a broadly applicable dimension-based method for determining whether a given family of stochastic matrices forms an exponential family.</description>

      <title>Characterization of the directed landscape from the KPZ fixed point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13032v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the directed landscape is the unique coupling of the KPZ fixed point from all initial conditions satisfying three natural properties: independent increments, monotonicity, and shift commutativity. Equivalently, we show that the directed landscape is the unique directed metric on $\mathbb R^2$ with independent increments and KPZ fixed point marginals. This unifies the two central objects in the KPZ universality class.
  Our main theorem also provides a general framework for proving convergence to the directed landscape given convergence to the KPZ fixed point. We apply this framework to prove landscape convergence in a range of models: exotic couplings of ASEP and TASEP, the random walk and Brownian web distances, and a class of non-integrable asymmetric exclusion processes with the basic coupling that perturb off of TASEP (this final class requires random initial data). All of our convergence theorems are new except for colored TASEP, where we provide a short alternative proof.</description>

      <title>On empty balls of critical 2-dimensional branching random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16225v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\{Z_n\}_{n\geq 0 }$ be a critical $d$-dimensional branching random walk started from a Poisson random measure whose intensity measure is the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{R}^d$. Denote by $R_n:=\sup\{u&gt;0:Z_n(\{x\in\mathbb{R}^d:|x|&lt;u\})=0\}$ the radius of the largest empty ball centered at the origin of $Z_n$. In \cite{reves02}, R\'ev\'esz shows that if $d=1$, then $R_n/n$ converges in law to an exponential random variable as $n\to\infty$. Moreover, R\'ev\'esz (2002) conjectured that
  $$\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{R_n}{\sqrt n}\overset{\text{law}}=\text{non-trival~distri.,}~d=2; \lim_{n\to\infty}{R_n}\overset{\text{law}}=\text{non-trival~distri.,}~d\geq3.$$ Later, Hu (2005) \cite{hu05} confirmed the case of $d\geq3$. This work confirms the case of $d=2$. It turns out that the limit distribution can be precisely characterized through the super-Brownian motion. Moreover, we also give complete results of empty balls of the branching random walk with infinite second moment offspring law. As a by-product, this article also improves the assumption of maximal displacements of branching random walks \cite[Theorem 1]{lalley2015}.</description>

      <title>A uniform particle approximation to the Navier-Stokes-alpha models in three dimensions with advection noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.12960v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a system of interacting particles governed by a set of stochastic differential equations. Our main goal is to rigorously demonstrate that the empirical measure associated with the particle system converges uniformly, both in time and space, to the solution of the three dimensional Navier Stokes alpha model with advection noise. This convergence establishes a probabilistic framework for deriving macroscopic stochastic fluid equations from underlying microscopic dynamics. The analysis leverages semigroup techniques to address the nonlinear structure of the limiting equations, and we provide a detailed treatment of the well posedness of the limiting stochastic partial differential equation. This ensures that the particle approximation remains stable and controlled over time. Although similar convergence results have been obtained in two dimensional settings, our study presents the first proof of strong uniform convergence in three dimensions for a stochastic fluid model derived from an interacting particle system. Importantly, our results also yield new insights in the deterministic regime, namely, in the absence of advection noise, where this type of convergence had not been previously established.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Negative dependence in tournaments has received attention in the literature. The property of negative orthant dependence (NOD) was proved for different tournament models with a special proof for each model. For general round-robin tournaments and knockout tournaments with random draws, Malinovsky and Rinott (2023) unified and simplified many existing results in the literature by proving a stronger property, negative association (NA). For a knockout tournament with a non-random draw, Malinovsky and Rinott (2023) presented an example to illustrate that S is NOD but not NA. However, their proof is not correct. In this paper, we establish the properties of negative regression dependence (NRD), negative left-tail dependence (NLTD) and negative right-tail dependence (NRTD) for a knockout tournament with a random draw and with players being of equal strength. For a knockout tournament with a non-random draw and with equal strength, we prove that S is NA and NRTD, while S is, in general, not NRD or NLTD.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a density variant of the Frankl-R\"{o}dl theorem on the sphere $\mathbb{S}^{n-1}$, which concerns avoiding pairs of vectors with a specific distance, or equivalently, a prescribed inner product. In particular, we establish lower bounds on the probability that a randomly chosen pair of such vectors lies entirely within a measurable subset $A \subseteq \mathbb{S}^{n-1}$ of sufficiently large measure. Additionally, we prove a density version of spherical avoidance problems, which generalize from pairwise avoidance to broader configurations with prescribed pairwise inner products. Our framework encompasses a class of configurations we call inductive configurations, which include simplices with any prescribed inner product $-1 &lt; r &lt; 1$. As a consequence of our density statement, we show that all inductive configurations are sphere Ramsey.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Binary search trees (BSTs) are fundamental data structures whose performance is largely governed by tree height. We introduce a block model for constructing BSTs by embedding internal BSTs into the nodes of an external BST -- a structure motivated by parallel data architectures -- corresponding to composite permutations formed via Kronecker or wreath products. Extending Devroye's result that the height $h_n$ of a random BST satisfies $h_n / \log n \to c^* \approx 4.311$, we show that block BSTs with $nm$ nodes and fixed external size $m$ satisfy $h_{n,m} / \log n \to c^* + h_m$ in distribution. We then study butterfly trees: BSTs generated from permutations built using iterated Kronecker or wreath products. For simple butterfly trees (from iterated Kronecker products of $S_2$), we give a full distributional description showing polynomial height growth: $\mathbb{E} h_n^{\operatorname{B}} = \Theta(N^\alpha)$ with $\alpha = \log_2(3/2) \approx 0.58496$. For nonsimple butterfly trees (from wreath products), we prove power-law bounds: $cN^\alpha\cdot (1 + o(1)) \le \mathbb{E} h_n^{\operatorname{B}} \le dN^\beta\cdot (1 + o(1))$, with $\beta \approx 0.913189$.</description>

      <title>Pontryagin Maximum Principle for McKean-Vlasov Stochastic Reaction-Diffusion Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stochastic control of a semi-linear stochastic partial differential equations (SPDE) of McKean-Vlasov type. Based on a recent novel approach to the Lions derivative for Banach space valued functions, we prove the Gateaux differentiability of the control to state map and, using adjoint calculus, we derive explicit representations of the gradient of the cost functional and a Pontryagin maximum principle. On the way, we also prove a novel existence and uniqueness result for linear McKean-Vlasov backward SPDE. Furthermore, for deterministic controls, we prove the existence of optimal controls using a martingale approach and a novel compactness method. This result is complemented in the appendix with a rigorous proof of folklore results on the compactness method in the variational approach to SPDE. Our setting uses the variational approach to SPDE with monotone coefficients, allowing for a polynomial perturbation and allowing the drift and diffusion coefficients to depend on the state, the distribution of the state and the control.</description>

      <title>Upper bounds for the connective constant of weighted self-avoiding walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.01993v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building on an earlier work by Alm, we consider a model of weighted self-avoiding walks on a generic lattice and develop a method for computing upper bounds on the corresponding weighted connective constant, which we implement in a publicly available software package. The bounds are obtained as the dominant eigenvalues of certain matrices and provide detailed information about the convergence of the model's multivariate generating function. We discuss potential applications of our results to developing Peierls-type estimates for anisotropic contour models in statistical physics, generalizing a technique recently introduced by Fahrbach--Randall.</description>

      <title>Online Learning and Optimization for Queues with Unknown Demand Curve and Service Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.03399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.03399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate an optimization problem in a queueing system where the service provider selects the optimal service fee p and service capacity \mu to maximize the cumulative expected profit (the service revenue minus the capacity cost and delay penalty). The conventional predict-then-optimize (PTO) approach takes two steps: first, it estimates the model parameters (e.g., arrival rate and service-time distribution) from data; second, it optimizes a model based on the estimated parameters. A major drawback of PTO is that its solution accuracy can often be highly sensitive to the parameter estimation errors because PTO is unable to properly link these errors (step 1) to the quality of the optimized solutions (step 2). To remedy this issue, we develop an online learning framework that automatically incorporates the aforementioned parameter estimation errors in the solution prescription process; it is an integrated method that can "learn" the optimal solution without needing to set up the parameter estimation as a separate step as in PTO. Effectiveness of our online learning approach is substantiated by (i) theoretical results including the algorithm convergence and analysis of the regret ("cost" to pay over time for the algorithm to learn the optimal policy), and (ii) engineering confirmation via simulation experiments of a variety of representative examples. We also provide careful comparisons for PTO and the online learning method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13133v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The classical theorem of Wendel provides an exact formula for the probability that the convex hull of independent symmetrically distributed vectors in ${\mathbb R}^d$ contains the origin as long as the distributions of the vectors are continuous. In this note, we provide an extension to Wendel's theorem for independent random vectors $X_1,\dots,X_n$ with i.i.d components having a (possibly discrete) symmetric distribution of unit variance. As a related observation, we give sharp estimates on the probability that a random linear program of the form ``$\max\langle x,{\mathfrak c}\rangle\quad\mbox{subject to }\langle X_i,x\rangle\leq 1,\;i\leq n$'', is bounded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper begins with a study of the exact distribution of the empirical correlation of two independent AR(1) processes with Gaussian increments. We proceed to develop rates of convergence for the distribution of the scaled empirical correlation to the standard Gaussian distribution in both Wasserstein distance and Kolmogorov distance. Given $n$ data points, we prove the convergence rate in Wasserstein distance is $n^{-1/2}$ and the convergence rate in Kolmogorov distance is $n^{-1/2} \sqrt{\ln n}$. We conclude by extending these results to two AR(1) processes with correlated Gaussian increments.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo with kernel-based Gibbs measures: Guarantees for probabilistic herding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11736v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kernel herding belongs to a family of deterministic quadratures that seek to minimize the worst-case integration error over a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). These quadrature rules come with strong experimental evidence that this worst-case error decreases at a faster rate than the standard square root of the number of quadrature nodes. This conjectured fast rate is key for integrating expensive-to-evaluate functions, as in Bayesian inference of expensive models, and makes up for the increased computational cost of sampling, compared to i.i.d. or MCMC quadratures. However, there is little theoretical support for this faster-than-square-root rate, at least in the usual case where the RKHS is infinite-dimensional, while recent progress on distribution compression suggests that results on the direct minimization of worst-case integration are possible. In this paper, we study a joint probability distribution over quadrature nodes, whose support tends to minimize the same worst-case error as kernel herding. Our main contribution is to prove that it does outperform i.i.d Monte Carlo, in the sense of coming with a tighter concentration inequality on the worst-case integration error. This first step towards proving a fast error decay demonstrates that the mathematical toolbox developed around Gibbs measures can help understand to what extent kernel herding and its variants improve on computationally cheaper methods. Moreover, we investigate the computational bottlenecks of approximately sampling our quadrature, and we demonstrate on toy examples that a faster rate of convergence, though not worst-case, is likely.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Space-Valued LQ Mean Field Games: An Infinite-Dimensional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01012v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive study of linear-quadratic (LQ) mean field games (MFGs) in Hilbert spaces, generalizing the classic LQ MFG theory to scenarios involving $N$ agents with dynamics governed by infinite-dimensional stochastic equations. In this framework, both state and control processes of each agent take values in separable Hilbert spaces. All agents are coupled through the average state of the population which appears in their linear dynamics and quadratic cost functional. Specifically, the dynamics of each agent incorporates an infinite-dimensional noise, namely a $Q$-Wiener process, and an unbounded operator. The diffusion coefficient of each agent is stochastic involving the state, control, and average state processes. We first study the well-posedness of a system of $N$ coupled semilinear infinite-dimensional stochastic evolution equations establishing the foundation of MFGs in Hilbert spaces. We then specialize to $N$-player LQ games described above and study the asymptotic behaviour as the number of agents, $N$, approaches infinity. We develop an infinite-dimensional variant of the Nash Certainty Equivalence principle and characterize a unique Nash equilibrium for the limiting MFG. Finally, we study the connections between the $N$-player game and the limiting MFG, demonstrating that the empirical average state converges to the mean field and that the resulting limiting best-response strategies form an $\epsilon$-Nash equilibrium for the $N$-player game in Hilbert spaces.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Representation of Commutative Quantum Circuit Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.19173v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In commuting parametric quantum circuits, the Fourier series of the pairwise fidelity can be expressed as the characteristic function of random variables. Furthermore, expressiveness can be cast as the recurrence probability of a random walk on a lattice. This construction has been successfully applied to the group composed only of Pauli-Z rotations, and we generalize this probabilistic strategy to any commuting set of Pauli operators. We utilize an efficient algorithm by van den Berg and Temme (2020) using the tableau representation of Pauli strings to yield a unitary from the Clifford group that, under conjugation, simultaneously diagonalizes our commuting set of Pauli rotations. Furthermore, we fully characterize the underlying distribution of the random walk using stabilizer states and their basis state representations. This would allow us to tractably compute the lattice volume and variance matrix used to express the frame potential. Together, this demonstrates a scalable strategy to calculate the expressiveness of parametric quantum models.</description>

      <title>Statistics on monotonically ordered non-crossing partitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.12032v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study some combinatorial statistics defined on the set NC^{mton}(n) of monotonically ordered non-crossing partitions of {1,...,n}, and on the set NC_2^{mton}(2n) of monotonically ordered non-crossing pair-partitions of {1,...,2n}. A relevant point in our study is that the disjoint union of the NC^{mton}(n)'s has a natural tree structure, with good homogeneity properties, which can be used to produce recursions for the Laplace transforms of various random variables of interest. Unlike in the analogous results known for unordered non-crossing partitions, the computations of expectations and variances for natural block-counting statistics on NC^{mton}(n) and for the expectation of the area statistic on NC_2^{mton}(2n) turn out to yield a logarithmic regime.</description>

      <title>Kinetic Optimal Transport (OTIKIN) -- Part 1: Second-Order Discrepancies Between Probability Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15665v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is the first part of a general description in terms of mass transport for time-evolving interacting particles systems, at a mesoscopic level. Beyond kinetic theory, our framework naturally applies in biology, computer vision, and engineering.
  The central object of our study is a new discrepancy $\mathsf d$ between two probability distributions in position and velocity states, which is reminiscent of the $2$-Wasserstein distance, but of second-order nature. We construct $\mathsf d$ in two steps. First, we optimise over transport plans. The cost function is given by the minimal acceleration between two coupled states on a fixed time horizon $T$. Second, we further optimise over the time horizon $T&gt;0$.
  We prove the existence of optimal transport plans and maps, and study two time-continuous characterisations of $\mathsf d$. One is given in terms of dynamical transport plans. The other one -- in the spirit of the Benamou--Brenier formula -- is formulated as the minimisation of an action of the acceleration field, constrained by Vlasov's equations. Equivalence of static and dynamical formulations of $\mathsf d$ holds true. While part of this result can be derived from recent, parallel developments in optimal control between measures, we give an original proof relying on two new ingredients: Galilean regularisation of Vlasov's equations and a kinetic Monge--Mather shortening principle.
  Finally, we establish a first-order differential calculus in the geometry induced by $\mathsf d$, and identify solutions to Vlasov's equations with curves of measures satisfying a certain $\mathsf d$-absolute continuity condition. One consequence is an explicit formula for the $\mathsf d$-derivative of such curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23256v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a fixed, compactly supported probability measure $\mu$ on the $d$-dimensional space $\mathbb{R}^d$, we consider the problem of minimizing the $p^{\mathrm{th}}$-power average distance functional over all compact, connected $\Sigma \subseteq \mathbb{R}^d$ with Hausdorff 1-measure $\mathcal{H}^1(\Sigma) \leq l$. This problem, known as the average distance problem, was first studied by Buttazzo, Oudet, and Stepanov in 2002, and has undergone a considerable amount of research since. We will provide a novel approach to studying this problem by analyzing it using the so-called \textit{barycentre field} considered previously by Hayase and two of the authors. This allows us to provide a complete topological description of minimizers in arbitrary dimensions when $p = 2$ and $p &gt; \frac{1}{2}(3 + \sqrt{5}) \approx 2.618$, the first such result that includes the case when $d &gt; 2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a multiscale stochastic optimal control problem subject to state constraints on the slow variable. To address this class of problems, we develop a rigorous theoretical framework based on singular perturbation analysis, tailored to settings with constrained dynamics. Our approach relies on the theory of viscosity solutions for degenerate Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations with Neumann-type boundary conditions. We also establish the convergence of the multiscale value functions in the infinite-horizon regime. Finally, we present two illustrative examples that highlight the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Diversification and Stochastic Dominance: When All Eggs Are Better Put in One Basket</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.16265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diversification is widely regarded as a reliable way to reduce risk, yet under certain extreme conditions it can have the opposite effect. A simple and striking example of this phenomenon was recently given by Chen et al. (2025), who showed that for independent and identically distributed (iid) Pareto risks with infinite mean, any weighted average is larger -- in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance -- than a single such risk. Our main result -- the \textit{one-basket theorem} -- identifies new sufficient conditions under which this reversal occurs for independent but not necessarily identically distributed risks. We compare a weighted average to its corresponding mixture model, which concentrates all exposure on one of the risks, chosen at random. In the iid case, the mixture has the same distribution as any individual risk, thereby recovering the canonical comparison between a diversified portfolio and full exposure to a single component. The theorem enables weight-specific verification of the stochastic dominance relation and yields new applications, including infinite-mean discrete Pareto risks and the St. Petersburg lottery. We further show that these reversals are boundary cases of a broader pattern: diversification always increases the likelihood of exceeding small thresholds, and under specific conditions, this local effect extends globally, resulting in first-order stochastic dominance.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic universal moment matching properties of normal distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.03790v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Moment matching is an easy-to-implement and usually effective method to reduce variance of Monte Carlo simulation estimates. On the other hand, there is no guarantee that moment matching will always reduce simulation variance for general integration problems at least asymptotically, i.e. when the number of samples is large. We study the characterization of conditions on a given underlying distribution $X$ under which asymptotic variance reduction is guaranteed for a general integration problem $\mathbb{E}[f(X)]$ when moment matching techniques are applied. We show that a sufficient and necessary condition for such asymptotic variance reduction property is $X$ being a normal distribution. Moreover, when $X$ is a normal distribution, formulae for efficient estimation of simulation variance for (first and second order) moment matching Monte Carlo are obtained. These formulae allow estimations of simulation variance as by-products of the simulation process, in a way similar to variance estimations for plain Monte Carlo. Moreover, we propose non-linear moment matching schemes for any given continuous distribution such that asymptotic variance reduction is guaranteed.</description>

Abstract: The developments over the last five decades concerning numerical discretisations of the incompressible Navier--Stokes equations have lead to reliable tools for their approximation: those include stable methods to properly address the incompressibility constraint, stable discretisations to account for convection dominated problems, efficient time (splitting) methods, and methods to tackle their nonlinear character. While these tools may successfully be applied to reliably simulate even more complex fluid flow PDE models, their understanding requires a fundamental revision in the case of stochastic fluid models, which are gaining increased importance nowadays.
  This work motivates and surveys optimally convergent numerical methods for the stochastic Stokes and Navier--Stokes equations that were obtained in the last decades. Furtheremore, we computationally illustrate the failure of some of those methods from the deterministic setting, if they are straight-forwardly applied to the stochastic case. In fact, we explain why some of these deterministic methods perform sub-optimally by highlighting crucial analytical differences between the deterministic and stochastic equations -- and how modifications of the deterministic methods restore their optimal performance if they properly address the probabilistic nature of the stochastic problem.
  Next to the numerical analysis of schemes, we propose a general benchmark of prototypic fluid flow problems driven by different types of noise to also compare new algorithms by simulations in terms of complexities, efficiencies, and possible limitations. The driving motivation is to reach a better comparison of simulations for new schemes in terms of accuracy and complexities, and to also complement theoretical performance studies for restricted settings of data by more realistic ones.</description>
