      <title>New Generation Compact Linear Accelerator for Low-Current, Low-Energy Multiple Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new compact linear proton accelerator project (named LINAC 7) for multiple low-current applications, designed and built in-house at the Beam Laboratory of the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) is described. The project combines the University, a research technology center and a private company with the aim of designing and building a compact, low-current proton accelerator capable of accelerating particles up to 7 MeV. In this paper, we present an overview of the accelerator design, summarize the progress and testing of the components that have been built, and describe the components that are being designed that will allow us to achieve the final desired energy of 7 MeV.</description>

      <title>New compact ion source design and implementation for low current applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new compact electron cyclotron resonance (ECR) ion source for low current applications, designed and built in-house at the University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU) is presented. The source was designed to use as many commercially available components as possible for key tasks such as electromagnetic resonators, magnetic structure, RF power couplers and beam transport, to lower the cost and lessen reliance on specially made parts for spares. This leads to a cost-effective yet compact and fully functional design. The main design decisions are described and experiments on plasma generation and the proton beam extracted using the source are shown and discussed.</description>

      <title>Maintaining a Resonance Condition of an RF Spin Rotator Through a Feedback Loop in a Storage Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the successful application of a phase-lock feedback system to maintain the resonance condition of a radio frequency (rf) spin rotator (specifically, an rf Wien filter) with respect to a 120 kHz spin precession in the Cooler Synchrotron (COSY) storage ring. Real-time monitoring of the spin precession and the rf Wien filter signal allows the relative phase between the two to be stabilized at an arbitrary setpoint. The feedback system compensates for deviations in the relative phase by adjusting the frequency and/or phase as needed. With this method, a variation in phase relative to the demand phase with a standard deviation of $\sigma_{\Delta\varphi}\approx 0.2\mathrm{rad}$ could be achieved. The system was implemented in two runs aiming at a first direct measurement of the deuteron electric dipole moment in 2018 and 2021. In addition, the difference between a single-bunch beam affected by the spin rotator and a two-bunch system in which only one bunch is exposed to the spin rotator fields is discussed. Both methods have been used during these beam times. The ability to keep the spin precession and the rf fields synchronized is also crucial for future investigations of electric dipole moments of charged particles using storage rings.</description>

      <title>Multi-beam-energy control unit based on triple bend achromats</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.19295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) are the new generation of particle accelerator-based light sources, capable of producing tunable, high-power X-ray pulses that are increasingly vital across various scientific disciplines. Recently, continuous-wave (CW) XFELs driven by superconducting linear accelerators have garnered significant attention due to their ability to enhance availability by supporting multiple undulator lines simultaneously. However, different undulator lines typically require distinct electron beam qualities, particularly varying electron beam energy to achieve a wide range of photon energy tunability. Consequently, precise bunch-to-bunch control of electron beam energy is essential. A double-bend achromat based electron beam delay system has been proposed to enable multi-beam energy operations in CW-XFELs. In this paper, we introduce a novel delay system comprising four triple-bend achromats (TBAs). Based on parameters of the Shanghai High-Repetition-Rate XFEL and Extreme Light Facility, start-to-end simulations demonstrate that the TBA-based delay system achieves better electron beam qualities while providing a wide beam energy tuning range.</description>

      <title>Experimental generation of extreme electron beams for advanced accelerator applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10413v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter we report on the experimental generation of high energy (10 GeV), ultra-short (fs-duration), ultra-high current (0.1 MA), petawatt peak power electron beams in a particle accelerator. These extreme beams enable the exploration of a new frontier of high intensity beam-light and beam-matter interactions broadly relevant across fields ranging from laboratory astrophysics to strong field quantum electrodynamics and ultra-fast quantum chemistry. We demonstrate our ability to generate and control the properties of these electron beams by means of a laser-electron beam shaping technique. This experimental demonstration opens the door to on-the-fly customization of extreme beam current profiles for desired experiments and is poised to benefit a broad swathe of cross-cutting applications of relativistic electron beams.</description>
