      <title>Latent-Level Enhancement with Flow Matching for Robust Automatic Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Noise-robust automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been commonly addressed by applying speech enhancement (SE) at the waveform level before recognition. However, speech-level enhancement does not always translate into consistent recognition improvements due to residual distortions and mismatches with the latent space of the ASR encoder. In this letter, we introduce a complementary strategy termed latent-level enhancement, where distorted representations are refined during ASR inference. Specifically, we propose a plug-and-play Flow Matching Refinement module (FM-Refiner) that operates on the output latents of a pretrained CTC-based ASR encoder. Trained to map imperfect latents-either directly from noisy inputs or from enhanced-but-imperfect speech-toward their clean counterparts, the FM-Refiner is applied only at inference, without fine-tuning ASR parameters. Experiments show that FM-Refiner consistently reduces word error rate, both when directly applied to noisy inputs and when combined with conventional SE front-ends. These results demonstrate that latent-level refinement via flow matching provides a lightweight and effective complement to existing SE approaches for robust ASR.</description>

      <title>LLMs-Integrated Automatic Hate Speech Recognition Using Controllable Text Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes an automatic speech recognition (ASR) model for hate speech using large language models (LLMs). The proposed method integrates the encoder of the ASR model with the decoder of the LLMs, enabling simultaneous transcription and censorship tasks to prevent the exposure of harmful content. Instruction tuning of the LLM to mask hate-related words with specific tokens requires an annotated hate speech dataset, which is limited. We generate text samples using an LLM with the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting technique guided by cultural context and examples and then convert them into speech samples using a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, some of them contain non-hate speech samples with hate-related words, which degrades the censorship performance. This paper filters the samples which text classification models correctly label as hate content. By adjusting the threshold for the number of correct answer models, we can control the level of hate in the generated dataset, allowing us to train the LLMs through curriculum learning in a gradual manner. Experimental results show that the proposed method achieves a masking accuracy of 58.6\% for hate-related words, surpassing previous baselines. We also confirm that the curriculum training contributes to the efficiency of both transcription and censorship tasks.</description>

      <title>Gradient-based Optimisation of Modulation Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modulation effects such as phasers, flangers and chorus effects are heavily used in conjunction with the electric guitar. Machine learning based emulation of analog modulation units has been investigated in recent years, but most methods have either been limited to one class of effect or suffer from a high computational cost or latency compared to canonical digital implementations. Here, we build on previous work and present a framework for modelling flanger, chorus and phaser effects based on differentiable digital signal processing. The model is trained in the time-frequency domain, but at inference operates in the time-domain, requiring zero latency. We investigate the challenges associated with gradient-based optimisation of such effects, and show that low-frequency weighting of loss functions avoids convergence to local minima when learning delay times. We show that when trained against analog effects units, sound output from the model is in some cases perceptually indistinguishable from the reference, but challenges still remain for effects with long delay times and feedback.</description>

      <title>Predictive Controlled Music</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach to algorithmic composition, called predictive controlled music (PCM), which combines model predictive control (MPC) with music generation. PCM uses dynamic models to predict and optimize the music generation process, where musical notes are computed in a manner similar to an MPC problem by optimizing a performance measure. A feedforward neural network-based assessment function is used to evaluate the generated musical score, which serves as the objective function of the PCM optimization problem. Furthermore, a recurrent neural network model is employed to capture the relationships among the variables in the musical notes, and this model is then used to define the constraints in the PCM. Similar to MPC, the proposed PCM computes musical notes in a receding-horizon manner, leading to feedback controlled prediction. Numerical examples are presented to illustrate the PCM generation method.</description>

      <title>From Imitation to Innovation: The Divergent Paths of Techno in Germany and the USA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many documentaries on early house and techno music exist. Here, protagonists from the scenes describe key elements and events that affected the evolution of the music. In the research community, there is consensus that such descriptions have to be examined critically. Yet, there have not been attempts to validate such statements on the basis of audio analyses. In this study, over 9,000 early house and techno tracks from Germany and the United States of America are analyzed using recording studio features, machine learning and inferential statistics. Three observations can be made: 1.) German and US house/techno music are distinct, 2.) US styles are much more alike, and 3.) scarcely evolved over time compared to German house/techno regarding the recording studio features. These findings are in agreement with documented statements and thus provide an audio-based perspective on why techno became a mass phenomenon in Germany but remained a fringe phenomenon in the USA. Observations like these can help the music industry estimate whether new trends will experience a breakthrough or disappear.</description>

      <title>Defense Against Synthetic Speech: Real-Time Detection of RVC Voice Conversion Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative audio technologies now enable highly realistic voice cloning and real-time voice conversion, increasing the risk of impersonation, fraud, and misinformation in communication channels such as phone and video calls. This study investigates real-time detection of AI-generated speech produced using Retrieval-based Voice Conversion (RVC), evaluated on the DEEP-VOICE dataset, which includes authentic and voice-converted speech samples from multiple well-known speakers. To simulate realistic conditions, deepfake generation is applied to isolated vocal components, followed by the reintroduction of background ambiance to suppress trivial artifacts and emphasize conversion-specific cues. We frame detection as a streaming classification task by dividing audio into one-second segments, extracting time-frequency and cepstral features, and training supervised machine learning models to classify each segment as real or voice-converted. The proposed system enables low-latency inference, supporting both segment-level decisions and call-level aggregation. Experimental results show that short-window acoustic features can reliably capture discriminative patterns associated with RVC speech, even in noisy backgrounds. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of practical, real-time deepfake speech detection and underscore the importance of evaluating under realistic audio mixing conditions for robust deployment.</description>

      <title>LEMAS: Large A 150K-Hour Large-scale Extensible Multilingual Audio Suite with Generative Speech Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the LEMAS-Dataset, which, to our knowledge, is currently the largest open-source multilingual speech corpus with word-level timestamps. Covering over 150,000 hours across 10 major languages, LEMAS-Dataset is constructed via a efficient data processing pipeline that ensures high-quality data and annotations. To validate the effectiveness of LEMAS-Dataset across diverse generative paradigms, we train two benchmark models with distinct architectures and task specializations on this dataset. LEMAS-TTS, built upon a non-autoregressive flow-matching framework, leverages the dataset's massive scale and linguistic diversity to achieve robust zero-shot multilingual synthesis. Our proposed accent-adversarial training and CTC loss mitigate cross-lingual accent issues, enhancing synthesis stability. Complementarily, LEMAS-Edit employs an autoregressive decoder-only architecture that formulates speech editing as a masked token infilling task. By exploiting precise word-level alignments to construct training masks and adopting adaptive decoding strategies, it achieves seamless, smooth-boundary speech editing with natural transitions. Experimental results demonstrate that models trained on LEMAS-Dataset deliver high-quality synthesis and editing performance, confirming the dataset's quality. We envision that this richly timestamp-annotated, fine-grained multilingual corpus will drive future advances in prompt-based speech generation systems.</description>

      <title>SmoothSync: Dual-Stream Diffusion Transformers for Jitter-Robust Beat-Synchronized Gesture Generation from Quantized Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04236v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Co-speech gesture generation is a critical area of research aimed at synthesizing speech-synchronized human-like gestures. Existing methods often suffer from issues such as rhythmic inconsistency, motion jitter, foot sliding and limited multi-sampling diversity. In this paper, we present SmoothSync, a novel framework that leverages quantized audio tokens in a novel dual-stream Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture to synthesis holistic gestures and enhance sampling variation. Specifically, we (1) fuse audio-motion features via complementary transformer streams to achieve superior synchronization, (2) introduce a jitter-suppression loss to improve temporal smoothness, (3) implement probabilistic audio quantization to generate distinct gesture sequences from identical inputs. To reliably evaluate beat synchronization under jitter, we introduce Smooth-BC, a robust variant of the beat consistency metric less sensitive to motion noise. Comprehensive experiments on the BEAT2 and SHOW datasets demonstrate SmoothSync's superiority, outperforming state-of-the-art methods by -30.6% FGD, 10.3% Smooth-BC, and 8.4% Diversity on BEAT2, while reducing jitter and foot sliding by -62.9% and -17.1% respectively. The code will be released to facilitate future research.</description>

      <title>Summary of The Inaugural Music Source Restoration Challenge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Music Source Restoration (MSR) aims to recover original, unprocessed instrument stems from professionally mixed and degraded audio, requiring the reversal of both production effects and real-world degradations. We present the inaugural MSR Challenge, which features objective evaluation on studio-produced mixtures using Multi-Mel-SNR, Zimtohrli, and FAD-CLAP, alongside subjective evaluation on real-world degraded recordings. Five teams participated in the challenge. The winning system achieved 4.46 dB Multi-Mel-SNR and 3.47 MOS-Overall, corresponding to relative improvements of 91% and 18% over the second-place system, respectively. Per-stem analysis reveals substantial variation in restoration difficulty across instruments, with bass averaging 4.59 dB across all teams, while percussion averages only 0.29 dB. The dataset, evaluation protocols, and baselines are available at https://msrchallenge.com/.</description>

      <title>TellWhisper: Tell Whisper Who Speaks When</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03712v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (MASR) aims to predict ''who spoke when and what'' from multi-speaker speech, a key technology for multi-party dialogue understanding. However, most existing approaches decouple temporal modeling and speaker modeling when addressing ''when'' and ''who'': some inject speaker cues before encoding (e.g., speaker masking), which can cause irreversible information loss; others fuse identity by mixing speaker posteriors after encoding, which may entangle acoustic content with speaker identity. This separation is brittle under rapid turn-taking and overlapping speech, often leading to degraded performance. To address these limitations, we propose TellWhisper, a unified framework that jointly models speaker identity and temporal within the speech encoder. Specifically, we design TS-RoPE, a time-speaker rotary positional encoding: time coordinates are derived from frame indices, while speaker coordinates are derived from speaker activity and pause cues. By applying region-specific rotation angles, the model explicitly captures per-speaker continuity, speaker-turn transitions, and state dynamics, enabling the attention mechanism to simultaneously attend to ''when'' and ''who''. Moreover, to estimate frame-level speaker activity, we develop Hyper-SD, which casts speaker classification in hyperbolic space to enhance inter-class separation and refine speaker-activity estimates. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>MOSS Transcribe Diarize: Accurate Transcription with Speaker Diarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01554v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription (SATS) aims to transcribe what is said and to precisely determine the timing of each speaker, which is particularly valuable for meeting transcription. Existing SATS systems rarely adopt an end-to-end formulation and are further constrained by limited context windows, weak long-range speaker memory, and the inability to output timestamps. To address these limitations, we present MOSS Transcribe Diarize, a unified multimodal large language model that jointly performs Speaker-Attributed, Time-Stamped Transcription in an end-to-end paradigm. Trained on extensive real wild data and equipped with a 128k context window for up to 90-minute inputs, MOSS Transcribe Diarize scales well and generalizes robustly. Across comprehensive evaluations, it outperforms state-of-the-art commercial systems on multiple public and in-house benchmarks.</description>

      <title>MM-Sonate: Multimodal Controllable Audio-Video Generation with Zero-Shot Voice Cloning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Joint audio-video generation aims to synthesize synchronized multisensory content, yet current unified models struggle with fine-grained acoustic control, particularly for identity-preserving speech. Existing approaches either suffer from temporal misalignment due to cascaded generation or lack the capability to perform zero-shot voice cloning within a joint synthesis framework. In this work, we present MM-Sonate, a multimodal flow-matching framework that unifies controllable audio-video joint generation with zero-shot voice cloning capabilities. Unlike prior works that rely on coarse semantic descriptions, MM-Sonate utilizes a unified instruction-phoneme input to enforce strict linguistic and temporal alignment. To enable zero-shot voice cloning, we introduce a timbre injection mechanism that effectively decouples speaker identity from linguistic content. Furthermore, addressing the limitations of standard classifier-free guidance in multimodal settings, we propose a noise-based negative conditioning strategy that utilizes natural noise priors to significantly enhance acoustic fidelity. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that MM-Sonate establishes new state-of-the-art performance in joint generation benchmarks, significantly outperforming baselines in lip synchronization and speech intelligibility, while achieving voice cloning fidelity comparable to specialized Text-to-Speech systems.</description>

      <title>MoE Adapter for Large Audio Language Models: Sparsity, Disentanglement, and Gradient-Conflict-Free</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02967</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02967v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Extending the input modality of Large Language Models~(LLMs) to the audio domain is essential for achieving comprehensive multimodal perception. However, it is well-known that acoustic information is intrinsically \textit{heterogeneous}, entangling attributes such as speech, music, and environmental context. Existing research is limited to a dense, parameter-shared adapter to model these diverse patterns, which induces \textit{gradient conflict} during optimization, as parameter updates required for distinct attributes contradict each other. To address this limitation, we introduce the \textit{\textbf{MoE-Adapter}}, a sparse Mixture-of-Experts~(MoE) architecture designed to decouple acoustic information. Specifically, it employs a dynamic gating mechanism that routes audio tokens to specialized experts capturing complementary feature subspaces while retaining shared experts for global context, thereby mitigating gradient conflicts and enabling fine-grained feature learning. Comprehensive experiments show that the MoE-Adapter achieves superior performance on both audio semantic and paralinguistic tasks, consistently outperforming dense linear baselines with comparable computational costs. Furthermore, we will release the related code and models to facilitate future research.</description>
