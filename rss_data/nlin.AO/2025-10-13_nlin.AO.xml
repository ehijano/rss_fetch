      <title>Interplay of sync and swarm: Theory and application of swarmalators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.09819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Swarmalators, entities that combine the properties of swarming particles with synchronized oscillations, represent a novel and growing area of research in the study of collective behavior. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of swarmalator research, focusing on the interplay between spatial organization and temporal synchronization. After a brief introduction to synchronization and swarming as separate phenomena, we discuss the various mathematical models that have been developed to describe swarmalator systems, highlighting the key parameters that govern their dynamics. The review also discusses the emergence of complex patterns, such as clustering, phase waves, and synchronized states, and how these patterns are influenced by factors such as interaction range, coupling strength, and frequency distribution. Recently, some minimal models were proposed that are solvable and mimic real-world phenomena. The effect of predators in the swarmalator dynamics is also discussed. Finally, we explore potential applications in fields ranging from robotics to biological systems, where understanding the dual nature of swarming and synchronization could lead to innovative solutions. By synthesizing recent advances and identifying open challenges, this review aims to provide a foundation for future research in this interdisciplinary field.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Public Goods Game in Dynamical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10259v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The evolutionary mechanisms of cooperative behavior represent a fundamental topic in complex systems and evolutionary dynamics. Although recent advances have introduced real-world stochasticity in nonlinear public goods game (PGG), such stochasticity remains static, neglecting its origin in the external environment as well as the coevolution of system stochasticity and cooperative behavior driven by environmental dynamics. In this work, we introduce a dynamic environment feedback mechanism into the stochastic nonlinear PGG framework, establishing a coevolutionary model that couples environmental states and individual cooperative strategies. Our results demonstrate that the interplay among environment feedback, nonlinear effects, and stochasticity can drive the system toward a wide variety of steady-state structures, including full defection, full cooperation, stable coexistence, and periodic limit cycles. Further analysis reveals that asymmetric nonlinear parameters and environment feedback rates exert significant regulatory effects on cooperation levels and system dynamics. This study not only enriches the theoretical framework of evolutionary game theory, but also provides a foundation for the management of ecological systems and the design of cooperative mechanisms in society.</description>

      <title>Directly Mapping Interacting Components to Complex Systems' Emergent Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent behavior in complex systems arises from nonlinear interactions among components, yet the intricate nature of self-organization often obscures the underlying causal relationships, long regarded as the "holy grail" of complexity research. To address this challenge, we adopted an inductive, mechanism-agnostic approach to characterize how diseased biological systems respond to therapeutic interventions, leading to the discovery of the Complex System Response (CSR) equation, a deterministic formulation that quantitatively connects component interactions with emergent behaviors, validated across 30 disease models. In this study, the main goal is to extend the CSR framework beyond biology to validate its applicability in engineering systems and urban social dynamics. Our results reveal that the CSR equation embodies the same systemic principles governing physical, chemical, biological, and social complex systems.</description>

      <title>Tempological Control of Network Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Feedback control is an effective strategy for stabilizing a desired state and has been widely adopted in maintaining the stability of systems such as flying birds and power grids. By default, this framework requires continuous control input to offset deviations from the desired state, which can be invasive and cost a considerable amount of energy. Here, we introduce tempological (temporal + topological) control -- a novel, noninvasive strategy that harnesses the inherent flexibility of time-varying networks to control the dynamics of a general nonlinear system. By strategically switching network topology on-the-fly based on the current states of the nodes, we show how it is possible to drive a system to a desired state or even stabilize otherwise unstable states, all in the absence of external forcing. We demonstrate the utility of our approach using networks of Kuramoto and Stuart-Landau oscillators, achieving synchronization out of sets of unsynchronizable networks. Finally, we develop a statistical theory that explains why tempological control will almost always succeed in the limit of large and diverse temporal networks, with diversity of network configurations overcoming the deficiencies of any snapshot in isolation.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Emergent Behaviors in Agent-Based Models using Mean Information Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergent behaviors are a defining feature of complex systems, yet their quantitative characterization remains an open challenge, as traditional classifications rely mainly on visual inspection of spatio-temporal patterns. In this Letter, we propose using the Mean Information Gain (MIG) as a metric to quantify emergence in Agent-Based Models. The MIG is a conditional entropy-based metric that quantifies the lack of information about other elements in a structure given certain known properties. We apply it to a multi-agent biased random walk that reproduces Wolfram's four behavioral classes and show that MIG differentiates these behaviors. This metric reconnects the analysis of emergent behaviors with the classical notions of order, disorder, and entropy, thereby enabling the quantitative classification of regimes as convergent, periodic, complex, and chaotic. This approach overcomes the ambiguity of qualitative inspection near regime boundaries, particularly in large systems, and provides a compact, extensible framework for identifying and comparing emergent behaviors in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Emergence of hybrid computational dynamics through reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11162v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how learning algorithms shape the computational strategies that emerge in neural networks remains a fundamental challenge in machine intelligence. While network architectures receive extensive attention, the role of the learning paradigm itself in determining emergent dynamics remains largely unexplored. Here we demonstrate that reinforcement learning (RL) and supervised learning (SL) drive recurrent neural networks (RNNs) toward fundamentally different computational solutions when trained on identical decision-making tasks. Through systematic dynamical systems analysis, we reveal that RL spontaneously discovers hybrid attractor architectures, combining stable fixed-point attractors for decision maintenance with quasi-periodic attractors for flexible evidence integration. This contrasts sharply with SL, which converges almost exclusively to simpler fixed-point-only solutions. We further show that RL sculpts functionally balanced neural populations through a powerful form of implicit regularization -- a structural signature that enhances robustness and is conspicuously absent in the more heterogeneous solutions found by SL-trained networks. The prevalence of these complex dynamics in RL is controllably modulated by weight initialization and correlates strongly with performance gains, particularly as task complexity increases. Our results establish the learning algorithm as a primary determinant of emergent computation, revealing how reward-based optimization autonomously discovers sophisticated dynamical mechanisms that are less accessible to direct gradient-based optimization. These findings provide both mechanistic insights into neural computation and actionable principles for designing adaptive AI systems.</description>

      <title>A Self-Organized Tower of Babel: Diversification through Competition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a minimal evolutionary model to show how local cooperation and global competition can create a transition to the diversity of communities such as linguistic groups. By using a lattice model with high-dimensional state agents and evolution under a fitness that depends on an agent's local neighborhood and global dissimilarity, clusters of diverse communities with different fitness are organized by equalizing the finesses on the boundaries, where their numbers and sizes are robust to parameters. We observe successive transitions over quasi-stationary states, as triggered by the emergence of new communities on the boundaries. Our abstract framework provides a simple mechanism for the diversification of culture.</description>

      <title>The Impact of Social Attractiveness on Casual Group Formation: Power-Law Group Sizes and Suppressed Percolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12585v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamics of casual group formation has long been a subject of interest in social sciences. While early stochastic models offered foundational insights into group size distributions, they often simplified individual behaviors and lacked mechanisms for heterogeneous social appeal. Here, we re-examine the attractiveness-driven interaction model, an agent-based framework where point-like agents move randomly in a 2D arena and exhibit varied social appeal, leading them to pause near highly attractive celebrity peers. We compare this model to a null model where the agents are continuously in movement, which resembles a Random Geometric Graph. Our extensive simulations reveal significant structural and dynamic differences: unlike the null model, the attractiveness-driven model's average degree increases linearly with system size for fixed density, resulting in more compact groups and the suppression of a percolation transition. Crucially, while the null model's group size distribution is either exponentially decaying or bimodal, the attractiveness-driven model robustly exhibits a power-law distribution, $P(n) \propto n^{-2.5}$, with an exponent independent of density. These findings, obtained through computationally intensive simulations due to long equilibration times, offer a thorough quantitative characterization of this model, highlighting the critical role of individual attractiveness in shaping social aggregation in physical space.</description>

      <title>Updating the Complex Systems Keyword Diagram Using Collective Feedback and Latest Literature Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The complex systems keyword diagram generated by the author in 2010 has been used widely in a variety of educational and outreach purposes, but it definitely needs a major update and reorganization. This short paper reports our recent attempt to update the keyword diagram using information collected from the following multiple sources: (a) collective feedback posted on social media, (b) recent reference books on complex systems and network science, (c) online resources on complex systems, and (d) keyword search hits obtained using OpenAlex, an open-access bibliographic catalogue of scientific publications. The data (a), (b) and (c) were used to incorporate the research community's and other public communities' perceptions of the relevant topics, whereas the data (d) was used to obtain more objective measurements of the keywords' relevance and associations from publications made in complex systems science. Results revealed differences and overlaps between public perception and actual usage of keywords in publications on complex systems. Four topical communities were obtained from the keyword association network, although they were highly intertwined with each other. We hope that the resulting network visualization of complex systems keywords provides a more up-to-date, accurate topic map of the field of complex systems as of today.</description>

      <title>Coordination Requires Simplification: Thermodynamic Bounds on Multi-Objective Compromise in Natural and Artificial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23144v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Information-processing systems coordinating across multiple agents and objectives face fundamental thermodynamic constraints. We show that solutions with maximum utility to act as coordination focal points have much higher selection pressure for being findable across agents rather than accuracy. We derive that the information-theoretic minimum description length of coordination protocols to precision $\varepsilon$ scales as $L(P)\geq NK\log_2 K+N^2d^2\log (1/\varepsilon)$ for $N$ agents with $d$ potentially conflicting objectives and internal model complexity $K$. This scaling forces progressive simplification, with coordination dynamics changing the environment itself and shifting optimization across hierarchical levels. Moving from established focal points requires re-coordination, creating persistent metastable states and hysteresis until significant environmental shifts trigger phase transitions through spontaneous symmetry breaking. We operationally define coordination temperature to predict critical phenomena and estimate coordination work costs, identifying measurable signatures across systems from neural networks to restaurant bills to bureaucracies. Extending the topological version of Arrow's theorem on the impossibility of consistent preference aggregation, we find it recursively binds whenever preferences are combined. This potentially explains the indefinite cycling in multi-objective gradient descent and alignment faking in Large Language Models trained with reinforcement learning with human feedback. We term this framework Thermodynamic Coordination Theory (TCT), which demonstrates that coordination requires radical information loss.</description>

      <title>Local active error correction from simulated confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We refine an old idea for performing fault-tolerant error correction in topological codes by simulating confining interactions between excitations. We implement confinement using an array of local classical processors that measure syndromes, broadcast messages to neighboring processors, and move excitations using received messages. The dynamics of the resulting real-time decoder is geometrically local, homogeneous in spacetime, and self-organized, operating without any form of global control. We prove that below a threshold error rate, it achieves a memory lifetime scaling as a stretched exponential in the linear system size $L$, provided that it has access to $O({\rm polylog}(L))$ noiseless classical bits for each noisy qubit. When applied to the surface code subject to depolarizing noise and measurement errors of equal strength, numerics indicate a threshold at $p_c \approx 1.5\%$.</description>
