      <title>A corresponding relationship between nonlinear Hermitian systems and linear non-Hermitian models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We note that the non-orthogonality of states and their coincidence at the degeneracy point are both admitted by nonlinear Hermitian systems and linear non-Hermitian systems. These striking characteristics motivate us to re-investigate the localized waves of nonlinear Hermitian systems and the eigenvalue degeneracies of linear non-Hermitian models, based on several well-known Lax integrable systems that have wide applications in nonlinear optics. We choose nonlinear Schrodinger equation integrability hierarchy to demonstrate the quantitative relations between dynamics of nonlinear Hermitian systems and eigenvalue degeneracies of linear non-Hermitian models. Specifically, the degeneracies of the real or imaginary spectrum of the linear non-Hermitian matrices are uncovered to clarify several essential characteristics of nonlinear localized waves, such as breathers, rogue waves, and solitons. We find that the exceptional points generally correspond to rogue waves for modulational instability cases and dark solitons with maximum velocity for the modulational stability cases. These insights provide another interesting perspective for understanding nonlinear localized waves, and hint that there are closer relations between nonlinear Hermitian systems and linear non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Pattern formation and film rupture in a two-dimensional thermocapillary thin-film model of the B\'enard-Marangoni problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional, stationary square and hexagonal patterns in the thermocapillary deformational thin-film model for the fluid height $h$\begin{equation*}
  \partial_t h+\nabla\cdot\left(h^3\left(\nabla\Delta h-g\nabla h\right)+M\frac{h^2}{(1+h)^2}\nabla h\right)=0,\quad t&gt;0,\quad x\in\mathbb{R}^2,
  \end{equation*} that can be formally derived from the B\'enard-Marangoni problem via a long-wave approximation. Using a linear stability analysis, we show that the flat surface profile corresponding to the pure conduction state destabilises at a critical Marangoni number $M^*$ via a conserved long-wave instability. For any fixed absolute wave number $k_0$, we find that square and hexagonal patterns bifurcate from the flat surface profile at $M=M^* + 4k_0^2$. Using analytic global bifurcation theory, we show that the local bifurcation curves can be extended to global curves of square and hexagonal patterns with constant absolute wave number and mass. We exclude that the global bifurcation curves are closed loops through a global bifurcation in cones argument, which also establishes nodal properties for the solutions. Furthermore, assuming that the Marangoni number is uniformly bounded on the bifurcation branch, we prove that solutions exhibit film rupture, that is, their minimal height tends to zero. This assumption is substantiated by numerical experiments.</description>

      <title>Elastic Plateau-Rayleigh instability in soft cylinders: Surface elasticity and periodic beading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08660v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Plateau-Rayleigh instability shows that a cylindrical fluid flow can be destabilized by surface tension. Similarly, capillary forces can make an elastic cylinder unstable when the elastocapillary length is comparable to the cylinder's radius. While existing models predict a single isolated bulge as the result of an instability, experiments reveal a periodic sequence of bulges spaced out by thinned regions, a phenomenon known as beading instability. Most models assume that surface tension is independent of the deformation of the solid, neglecting variations due to surface stretch.
  In this work, we assume that surface tension arises from the deformation of material particles near the free surface, treating it as a pre-stretched elastic surface surrounding the body. Using the theoretical framework proposed by Gurtin and Murdoch, we show that a cylindrical solid can undergo a mechanical instability with a finite critical wavelength if the body is sufficiently soft or axially stretched. Post-buckling numerical simulations reveal a morphology in qualitative agreement with experimental observations. Period-halving secondary bifurcations are also observed. The results of this research have broad implications for soft materials, biomechanics, and microfabrication applications where surface tension plays a crucial role.</description>
