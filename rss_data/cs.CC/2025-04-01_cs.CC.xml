      <title>Integer multiplication is at least as hard as matrix transposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22848v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Working in the multitape Turing model, we show how to reduce the problem of matrix transposition to the problem of integer multiplication. If transposing an $n \times n$ binary matrix requires $\Omega(n^2 \log n)$ steps on a Turing machine, then our reduction implies that multiplying $n$-bit integers requires $\Omega(n \log n)$ steps. In other words, if matrix transposition is as hard as expected, then integer multiplication is also as hard as expected.</description>

      <title>Disjunctive Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recently introduced measure of Boolean functions complexity--disjunc\-tive complexity (DC)--is compared with other complexity measures: the space complexity of streaming algorithms and the complexity of nondeterministic branching programs (NBP). We show that DC is incomparable with NBP. Specifically, we present a function that has low NBP but has subexponential DC. Conversely, we provide arguments based on computational complexity conjectures to show that DC can superpolynomially exceed NBP in certain cases. Additionally, we prove that the monotone version of NBP complexity is strictly weaker than DC. We prove that the space complexity of one-pass streaming algorithms is strictly weaker than DC. Furthermore, we introduce a generalization of streaming algorithms that captures the full power of DC. This generalization can be expressed in terms of nondeterministic algorithms that irreversibly write 1s to entries of a Boolean vector (i.e., changes from 1 to 0 are not allowed).
  Finally, we discuss an unusual phenomenon in disjunctive complexity: the existence of uniformly hard functions. These functions exhibit the property that their disjunctive complexity is maximized, and this property extends to all functions dominated by them.</description>

      <title>On the difficulty of order constrained pattern matching with applications to feature matching based malware detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We formulate low-level malware detection using algorithms based on feature matching as Order-based Malware Detection with Critical Instructions (General-OMDCI): given a pattern in the form of a sequence \(M\) of colored blocks, where each block contains a critical character (representing a unique sequence of critical instructions potentially associated with malware but without certainty), and a program \(A\), represented as a sequence of \(n\) colored blocks with critical characters, the goal is to find two subsequences, \(M'\) of \(M\) and \(A'\) of \(A\), with blocks matching in color and whose critical characters form a permutation of each other. When $M$ is a permutation in both colors and critical characters the problem is called OMDCI. If we additionally require $M'=M$, then the problem is called OMDCI+; if in this case $d=|M|$ is used as a parameter, then the OMDCI+ problem is easily shown to be FPT. Our main (negative) results are on the cases when $|M|$ is arbitrary and are summarized as follows: 
OMDCI+ is NP-complete, which implies OMDCI is also NP-complete.
For the special case of OMDCI, deciding if the optimal solution has length $0$ (i.e., deciding if no part of \(M\) appears in \(A\)) is co-NP-hard. As a result, the OMDCI problem does not admit an FPT algorithm unless P=co-NP. 
In summary, our results imply that using algorithms based on feature matching to identify malware or determine the absence of malware in a given low-level program are both hard.</description>

      <title>Simple general magnification of circuit lower bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct so-called distinguishers, sparse matrices that retain some properties of error correcting codes. They provide a technically and conceptually simple approach to magnification. We generalize and strengthen known general (not problem specific) magnification results and in particular achieve magnification thresholds below known lower bounds. For example, we show that fixed polynomial formula size lower bounds for NP are implied by slightly superlinear formula size lower bounds for approximating any sufficiently sparse problem in NP. We also show that the thresholds achieved are sharp. Additionally, our approach yields a uniform magnification result for the minimum circuit size problem. This seems to sidestep the localization barrier.</description>

      <title>$\mathsf{P}$-completeness of Graph Local Complementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Local complementation of a graph $G$ on vertex $v$ is an operation that results in a new graph $G*v$, where the neighborhood of $v$ is complemented. This operation has been widely studied in graph theory and quantum computing.
  This article introduces the Local Complementation Problem, a decision problem that captures the complexity of applying a sequence of local complementations. Given a graph $G$, a sequence of vertices $s$, and a pair of vertices $u,v$, the problem asks whether the edge $(u,v)$ is present in the graph obtained after applying local complementations according to $s$. The main contribution of this work is proving that this problem is $\mathsf{P}$-complete, implying that computing a sequence of local complementation is unlikely to be efficiently parallelizable. The proof is based on a reduction from the Circuit Value Problem, a well-known $\mathsf{P}$-complete problem, by simulating circuits through local complementations.
  Aditionally, the complexity of this problem is analyzed under different restrictions. In particular, it is shown that for complete and star graphs, the problem belongs to $\mathsf{LOGSPACE}$. Finally, it is conjectured that the problem remains $\mathsf{P}$-complete for the class of circle graphs.</description>

      <title>Lifting for Arbitrary Gadgets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a sensitivity-to-communication lifting theorem for arbitrary gadgets. Given functions $f: \{0,1\}^n\to \{0,1\}$ and $g : \mathcal X\times \mathcal Y\to \{0,1\}$, denote $f\circ g(x,y) := f(g(x_1,y_1),\ldots,g(x_n,y_n))$. We show that for any $f$ with sensitivity $s$ and any $g$, \[D(f\circ g) \geq s\cdot \bigg(\frac{\Omega(D(g))}{\log\mathsf{rk}(g)} - \log\mathsf{rk}(g)\bigg),\] where $D(\cdot)$ denotes the deterministic communication complexity and $\mathsf{rk}(g)$ is the rank of the matrix associated with $g$. As a corollary, we get that if $D(g)$ is a sufficiently large constant, $D(f\circ g) = \Omega(\min\{s,d\}\cdot \sqrt{D(g)})$, where $s$ and $d$ denote the sensitivity and degree of $f$. In particular, computing the OR of $n$ copies of $g$ requires $\Omega(n\cdot\sqrt{D(g)})$ bits.</description>

      <title>Classical Simulation of Quantum CSP Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that any perfect quantum strategy for the two-prover game encoding a constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) can be simulated via a perfect classical strategy with an extra classical communication channel, whose size depends only on $(i)$ the size of the shared quantum system used in the quantum strategy, and $(ii)$ structural parameters of the CSP template. The result is obtained via a combinatorial characterisation of perfect classical strategies with extra communication channels and a geometric rounding procedure for the projection-valued measurements involved in quantum strategies. A key intermediate step of our proof is to establish that the gap between the classical chromatic number of graphs and its quantum variant is bounded when the quantum strategy involves shared quantum information of bounded size.</description>

      <title>On the Quantum Chromatic Gap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The largest known gap between quantum and classical chromatic number of graphs, obtained via quantum protocols for colouring Hadamard graphs based on the Deutsch--Jozsa algorithm and the quantum Fourier transform, is exponential. We put forth a quantum pseudo-telepathy version of Khot's $d$-to-$1$ Games Conjecture and prove that, conditional to its validity, the gap is unbounded: There exist graphs whose quantum chromatic number is $3$ and whose classical chromatic number is arbitrarily large. Furthermore, we show that the existence of a certain form of pseudo-telepathic XOR games would imply the conjecture and, thus, the unboundedness of the quantum chromatic gap. As two technical steps of our proof that might be of independent interest, we establish a quantum adjunction theorem for Pultr functors between categories of relational structures, and we prove that the Dinur--Khot--Kindler--Minzer--Safra reduction, recently used for proving the $2$-to-$2$ Games Theorem, is quantum complete.</description>

      <title>Multi-Pass Streaming Lower Bounds for Approximating Max-Cut</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23404v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the Max-Cut problem in the streaming model, an algorithm is given the edges of an unknown graph $G = (V,E)$ in some fixed order, and its goal is to approximate the size of the largest cut in $G$. Improving upon an earlier result of Kapralov, Khanna and Sudan, it was shown by Kapralov and Krachun that for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$, no $o(n)$ memory streaming algorithm can achieve a $(1/2+\varepsilon)$-approximation for Max-Cut. Their result holds for single-pass streams, i.e.~the setting in which the algorithm only views the stream once, and it was open whether multi-pass access may help. The state-of-the-art result along these lines, due to Assadi and N, rules out arbitrarily good approximation algorithms with constantly many passes and $n^{1-\delta}$ space for any $\delta&gt;0$.
  We improve upon this state-of-the-art result, showing that any non-trivial approximation algorithm for Max-Cut requires either polynomially many passes or polynomially large space. More specifically, we show that for all $\varepsilon&gt;0$, a $k$-pass streaming $(1/2+\varepsilon)$-approximation algorithm for Max-Cut requires $\Omega_{\varepsilon}\left(n^{1/3}/k\right)$ space. This result leads to a similar lower bound for the Maximum Directed Cut problem, showing the near optimality of the algorithm of [Saxena, Singer, Sudan, Velusamy, SODA 2025].
  Our lower bounds proceed by showing a communication complexity lower bound for the Distributional Implicit Hidden Partition (DIHP) Problem, introduced by Kapralov and Krachun. While a naive application of the discrepancy method fails, we identify a property of protocols called ``globalness'', and show that (1) any protocol for DIHP can be turned into a global protocol, (2) the discrepancy of a global protocol must be small. The second step is the more technically involved step in the argument, and therein we use global hypercontractive inequalities.</description>

      <title>On guarded extensions of MMSNP</title>

Abstract: Feder and Vardi showed that the class Monotone Monadic SNP without inequality (MMSNP) has a P vs NP-complete dichotomy if and only if such a dichotomy holds for finite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems. Moreover, they showed that none of the three classes obtained by removing one of the defining properties of MMSNP (monotonicity, monadicity, no inequality) has a dichotomy. The overall objective of this paper is to study the gaps between MMSNP and each of these three superclasses, where the existence of a dichotomy remains unknown. For the gap between MMSNP and Monotone SNP without inequality, we study the class Guarded Monotone SNP without inequality (GMSNP) introduced by Bienvenu, ten Cate, Lutz, and Wolter, and prove that GMSNP has a dichotomy if and only if a dichotomy holds for GMSNP problems over signatures consisting of a unique relation symbol. For the gap between MMSNP and MMSNP with inequality, we have two contributions. We introduce a new class MMSNP with guarded inequality, that lies between MMSNP and MMSNP with inequality and that is strictly more expressive than the former and still has a dichotomy. Apart from that, we give a detailed proof that every problem in NP is polynomial-time equivalent to a problem in MMSNP with inequality, which implies the absence of a dichotomy for the latter. For the gap between MMSNP and Monadic SNP without inequality, we introduce a logic that extends the class of Matrix Partitions in a similar way how MMSNP extends CSP, and pose an open question about the existence of a dichotomy for this class. Finally, we revisit the theorem of Feder and Vardi, which claims that the class NP embeds into MMSNP with inequality. We give a detailed proof of this theorem as it ensures no dichotomy for the right-hand side class of each of the three gaps.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Inapproximability of Maxmin $k$-Cut Reconfiguration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03416v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $k$-Coloring Reconfiguration is one of the most well-studied reconfiguration problems, which asks to transform a given proper $k$-coloring of a graph to another by repeatedly recoloring a single vertex. Its approximate version, Maxmin $k$-Cut Reconfiguration, is defined as an optimization problem of maximizing the minimum fraction of bichromatic edges during the transformation between (not necessarily proper) $k$-colorings. In this paper, we prove that the optimal approximation factor of this problem is $1 - \Theta\left(\frac{1}{k}\right)$ for every $k \ge 2$. Specifically, we show the $\mathsf{PSPACE}$-hardness of approximating the objective value within a factor of $1 - \frac{\varepsilon}{k}$ for some universal constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, whereas we present a deterministic polynomial-time algorithm that achieves the approximation factor of $1 - \frac{2}{k}$.
  To prove the hardness result, we develop a new probabilistic verifier that tests a ``striped'' pattern. Our polynomial-time algorithm is based on ``a random reconfiguration via a random solution,'' i.e., the transformation that goes through one random $k$-coloring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We will study some important properties of Boolean functions based on newly introduced concepts called Special Decomposition of a Set and Special Covering of a Set. These concepts enable us to study important problems concerning Boolean functions represented in conjunctive normal form including the satisfiability problem. Studying the relationship between the Boolean satisfiability problem and the problem of existence of a special covering for set we show that these problems are polynomially equivalent. This means that the problem of existence of a special covering for a set is an NP complete problem. We prove an important theorem regarding the relationship between these problems. The Boolean function in conjunctive normal form is satisfiable if and only if there is a special covering for the set of clauses of this function. The purpose of the article is also to study some important properties of satisfiable Boolean functions using the concepts of special decomposition and special covering of a set. We introduce the concept of generation of satisfiable function by another satisfiable function by means of admissible changes in the clauses of the function. We will prove that if the generation of a function by another function is defined as a binary relation then the set of satisfiable functions of n variables represented in conjunctive normal form with m clauses is partitioned to equivalence classes In addition, extending the rules of admissible changes we prove that arbitrary two satisfiable Boolean functions of n variables represented in conjunctive normal form with m clauses can be generated from each other.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of Resilience Problems via Valued Constraint Satisfaction Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.15654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.15654v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Valued constraint satisfaction problems (VCSPs) constitute a large class of computational optimisation problems. It was shown recently that, over finite domains, every VCSP is in P or NP-complete, depending on the admitted cost functions. In this article, we study cost functions over countably infinite domains whose automorphisms form an oligomorphic permutation group. Our results include a hardness condition based on a generalisation of pp-constructability as known from classical CSPs and a polynomial-time tractability condition based on the concept of fractional polymorphisms. We then observe that the resilience problem for unions of conjunctive queries (UCQs) studied in database theory, under bag semantics, may be viewed as a special case of the VCSPs that we consider. We obtain a complexity dichotomy for the case of incidence-acyclic UCQs and exemplarily use our methods to determine the complexity of a conjunctive query that has been stated as an open problem in the literature. We conjecture that our hardness and tractability conditions match for resilience problems for UCQs. Further, we obtain a complete dichotomy for resilience problems for two-way regular path queries, under bag semantics.</description>

      <title>Persistent (Co)Homology in Matrix Multiplication Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most algorithms for computing persistent homology do so by tracking cycles that represent homology classes. There are many choices of such cycles, and specific choices have found different uses in applications. Although it is known that persistence diagrams can be computed in matrix multiplication time [8] for the more general case of zigzag persistent homology, it is not clear how to extract cycle representatives, especially if specific representatives are desired. In this paper, we provide the same matrix multiplication bound for computing representatives for the two choices common in applications in the case of ordinary persistent (co)homology. We first provide a fast version of the reduction algorithm, which is simpler than the algorithm in [8], but returns a different set of representatives than the standard algorithm [6] We then give a fast version of a different variant called the row algorithm [4], which returns the same representatives as the standard algorithm.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected graph with $N$ vertices. Let $k$ be the number of vertices in a longest path of $G$ such that every vertex on the path is a cut vertex of $G$, and every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $G$. Let $k$ be the number of vertices of such a longest path of $T$ that every vertex of the path is a cut vertex and that every intermediate vertex of the path is a degree-two vertex of $T$. Let $P=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ be a set of pebbles with $n+k &lt; N$. A configuration of $P$ on $G$ is defined as a function $f$ from $V(G)$ to $\{0, 1, \ldots, n \}$ with $|f^{-1}(i)| = 1$ for $1 \le i \le n$, where $f^{-1}(i)$ is a vertex occupied with the $i$th pebble for $1 \le i \le n$ and $f^{-1}(0)$ is a set of unoccupied vertices. A move is defined as shifting a pebble from a vertex to some unoccupied neighbor. The pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is to decide whether a given configuration of pebbles is reachable from another by executing a sequence of moves. In this paper, we show that the length of the shortest solution sequence of the pebble motion problem on the pair $(G,P)$ is in $O(Nn + n^2 \log(\min\{n,k\}))$ if $G$ is a $N$-vertex tree, and it is in $O(N^2 + \frac{n^3}{N-n} + n^2 \log(\min\{n,N-n\}))$ if $G$ is a connected general $N$-vertex graph. We provide an algorithm that can obtain a solution sequence of lengths that satisfy these orders, with the same computational complexity as the order of the length.
