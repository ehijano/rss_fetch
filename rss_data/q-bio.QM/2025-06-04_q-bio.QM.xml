      <title>A meaningful prediction of functional decline in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis based on multi-event survival analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a degenerative disorder of motor neurons that causes progressive paralysis in patients. Current treatment options aim to prolong survival and improve quality of life; however, due to the heterogeneity of the disease, it is often difficult to determine the optimal time for potential therapies or medical interventions. In this study, we propose a novel method to predict the time until a patient with ALS experiences significant functional impairment (ALSFRS-R&lt;=2) with respect to five common functions: speaking, swallowing, handwriting, walking and breathing. We formulate this task as a multi-event survival problem and validate our approach in the PRO-ACT dataset by training five covariate-based survival models to estimate the probability of an event over a 500-day period after a baseline visit. We then predict five event-specific individual survival distributions (ISDs) for each patient, each providing an interpretable and meaningful estimate of when that event will likely take place in the future. The results show that covariate-based models are superior to the Kaplan-Meier estimator at predicting time-to-event outcomes. Additionally, our method enables practitioners to make individual counterfactual predictions, where certain features (covariates) can be changed to see their effect on the predicted outcome. In this regard, we find that Riluzole has little to no impact on predicted functional decline. However, for patients with bulbar-onset ALS, our method predicts considerably shorter counterfactual time-to-event estimates for tasks related to speech and swallowing compared to limb-onset ALS. The proposed method can be applied to current clinical examination data to assess the risk of functional decline and thus allow more personalized treatment planning.</description>

      <title>Protap: A Benchmark for Protein Modeling on Realistic Downstream Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02052v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, extensive deep learning architectures and pretraining strategies have been explored to support downstream protein applications. Additionally, domain-specific models incorporating biological knowledge have been developed to enhance performance in specialized tasks. In this work, we introduce $\textbf{Protap}$, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically compares backbone architectures, pretraining strategies, and domain-specific models across diverse and realistic downstream protein applications. Specifically, Protap covers five applications: three general tasks and two novel specialized tasks, i.e., enzyme-catalyzed protein cleavage site prediction and targeted protein degradation, which are industrially relevant yet missing from existing benchmarks. For each application, Protap compares various domain-specific models and general architectures under multiple pretraining settings. Our empirical studies imply that: (i) Though large-scale pretraining encoders achieve great results, they often underperform supervised encoders trained on small downstream training sets. (ii) Incorporating structural information during downstream fine-tuning can match or even outperform protein language models pretrained on large-scale sequence corpora. (iii) Domain-specific biological priors can enhance performance on specialized downstream tasks. Code and datasets are publicly available at https://github.com/Trust-App-AI-Lab/protap.</description>

      <title>Quantifying task-relevant representational similarity using decision variable correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02164v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Previous studies have compared the brain and deep neural networks trained on image classification. Intriguingly, while some suggest that their representations are highly similar, others argued the opposite. Here, we propose a new approach to characterize the similarity of the decision strategies of two observers (models or brains) using decision variable correlation (DVC). DVC quantifies the correlation between decoded decisions on individual samples in a classification task and thus can capture task-relevant information rather than general representational alignment. We evaluate this method using monkey V4/IT recordings and models trained on image classification tasks.
  We find that model--model similarity is comparable to monkey--monkey similarity, whereas model--monkey similarity is consistently lower and, surprisingly, decreases with increasing ImageNet-1k performance. While adversarial training enhances robustness, it does not improve model--monkey similarity in task-relevant dimensions; however, it markedly increases model--model similarity. Similarly, pre-training on larger datasets does not improve model--monkey similarity. These results suggest a fundamental divergence between the task-relevant representations in monkey V4/IT and those learned by models trained on image classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Constrained Sliced Wasserstein Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) distances offer an efficient method for comparing high-dimensional probability measures by projecting them onto multiple 1-dimensional probability distributions. However, identifying informative slicing directions has proven challenging, often necessitating a large number of slices to achieve desirable performance and thereby increasing computational complexity. We introduce a constrained learning approach to optimize the slicing directions for SW distances. Specifically, we constrain the 1D transport plans to approximate the optimal plan in the original space, ensuring meaningful slicing directions. By leveraging continuous relaxations of these transport plans, we enable a gradient-based primal-dual approach to train the slicer parameters, alongside the remaining model parameters. We demonstrate how this constrained slicing approach can be applied to pool high-dimensional embeddings into fixed-length permutation-invariant representations. Numerical results on foundation models trained on images, point clouds, and protein sequences showcase the efficacy of the proposed constrained learning approach in learning more informative slicing directions. Our implementation code can be found at https://github.com/Stranja572/constrainedswe.</description>

      <title>Quantum Ensembling Methods for Healthcare and Life Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02213v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Learning on small data is a challenge frequently encountered in many real-world applications. In this work we study how effective quantum ensemble models are when trained on small data problems in healthcare and life sciences. We constructed multiple types of quantum ensembles for binary classification using up to 26 qubits in simulation and 56 qubits on quantum hardware. Our ensemble designs use minimal trainable parameters but require long-range connections between qubits. We tested these quantum ensembles on synthetic datasets and gene expression data from renal cell carcinoma patients with the task of predicting patient response to immunotherapy. From the performance observed in simulation and initial hardware experiments, we demonstrate how quantum embedding structure affects performance and discuss how to extract informative features and build models that can learn and generalize effectively. We present these exploratory results in order to assist other researchers in the design of effective learning on small data using ensembles. Incorporating quantum computing in these data constrained problems offers hope for a wide range of studies in healthcare and life sciences where biological samples are relatively scarce given the feature space to be explored.</description>

      <title>HIEGNet: A Heterogenous Graph Neural Network Including the Immune Environment in Glomeruli Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have recently been found to excel in histopathology. However, an important histopathological task, where GNNs have not been extensively explored, is the classification of glomeruli health as an important indicator in nephropathology. This task presents unique difficulties, particularly for the graph construction, i.e., the identification of nodes, edges, and informative features. In this work, we propose a pipeline composed of different traditional and machine learning-based computer vision techniques to identify nodes, edges, and their corresponding features to form a heterogeneous graph. We then proceed to propose a novel heterogeneous GNN architecture for glomeruli classification, called HIEGNet, that integrates both glomeruli and their surrounding immune cells. Hence, HIEGNet is able to consider the immune environment of each glomerulus in its classification. Our HIEGNet was trained and tested on a dataset of Whole Slide Images from kidney transplant patients. Experimental results demonstrate that HIEGNet outperforms several baseline models and generalises best between patients among all baseline models. Our implementation is publicly available at https://github.com/nklsKrmnn/HIEGNet.git.</description>

      <title>A novel sensitivity analysis method for agent-based models stratifies in-silico tumor spheroid simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00168v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agent-based models (ABMs) are widely used in biology to understand how individual actions scale into emergent population behavior. Modelers employ sensitivity analysis (SA) algorithms to quantify input parameters' impact on model outputs, however, it is hard to perform SA for ABMs due to their computational and complex nature. In this work, we develop the Simulate, Summarize, Reduce, Cluster, and Analyze (SSRCA) methodology, a machine-learning based pipeline designed to facilitate SA for ABMs. In particular, SSRCA can achieve the following tasks for ABMS: 1) identify sensitive model parameters, 2) reveal common output model patterns, and 3) determine which input parameter values generate these patterns. We use an example ABM of tumor spheroid growth to showcase how SSRCA provides similar SA results to the popular Sobol' Method while also identifying four common patterns from the ABM and the parameter regions that generate these outputs. This analysis could streamline data-driven tasks, such as parameter estimation, for ABMs by reducing parameter space. While we highlight these results with an ABM on tumor spheroid formation, the SSRCA methodology is broadly applicable to biological ABMs.</description>

      <title>Look mom, no experimental data! Learning to score protein-ligand interactions from simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00593v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite recent advances in protein-ligand structure prediction, deep learning methods remain limited in their ability to accurately predict binding affinities, particularly for novel protein targets dissimilar from the training set. In contrast, physics-based binding free energy calculations offer high accuracy across chemical space but are computationally prohibitive for large-scale screening. We propose a hybrid approach that approximates the accuracy of physics-based methods by training target-specific neural networks on molecular dynamics simulations of the protein in complex with random small molecules. Our method uses force matching to learn an implicit free energy landscape of ligand binding for each target. Evaluated on six proteins, our approach achieves competitive virtual screening performance using 100-500 $\mu$s of MD simulations per target. Notably, this approach achieves state-of-the-art early enrichment when using the true pose for active compounds. These results highlight the potential of physics-informed learning for virtual screening on novel targets. We publicly release the code for this paper at https://github.com/molecularmodelinglab/lfm under the MIT license.</description>
