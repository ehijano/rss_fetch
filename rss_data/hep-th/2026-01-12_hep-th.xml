      <title>Microscopic Unitarity and the Quantization of Black Hole Evaporation Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05305v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work presents an effective microscopic, time-dependent Hamiltonian framework for investigating information dynamics during black hole evaporation. While current approaches often rely on gravitational path integrals or statistical ensembles to recover the Page curve, our model provides an explicit, unitary quantum-mechanical evolution of the radiation. We utilize the Independent Unitary Pairing assumption, where the total Hilbert space is decomposed into N_{total} mutually independent bipartite subsystems. Each subsystem consists of a single interior qubit interacting unitarily with a single radiation qubit, ensuring strict global microscopic unitarity (Von Neumann entropy =0) throughout the process. To reconcile this with macroscopic thermodynamics, we introduce a methodology called "Fermion-like Occupancy Bound", which can be considered as a Holographic Binary Capacity Constraint, where each radiation channel is modeled as a two-level system representing the fundamental unit of information. This truncation, justified by the holographic principle at the Planck scale, enforces a maximum entropy bound of ln2 per channel, which naturally yields the entropy turnaround and final state purification. The central result of this framework is the derivation of a Quantum Condition for Unitarity , which couples microscopic phase evolution with macroscopic observables.</description>

      <title>The Self-Duality Equations on a Riemann Surface and Four-Dimensional Chern-Simons Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a Lagrangian formulation of Hitchin's self-duality equations on a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ using potentials for the connection and Higgs field. This two-dimensional action is then obtained from a four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory on $\Sigma\times \mathbb{CP}^1$ with an appropriate choice of meromorphic 1-form on $\mathbb{CP}^1$ and boundary conditions at its poles. We show that the symplectic structure induced by the four-dimensional theory coincides with the canonical symplectic form on the Hitchin moduli space in the complex structure corresponding to the moduli space of Higgs bundles. We further provide a direct construction of Hitchin Hamiltonians in terms of the four-dimensional gauge field. Exploiting the freedom in the choice of the meromorphic one-form, we construct a family of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theories depending on a $\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter. Upon reduction to two dimensions, these descend to a corresponding family of two-dimensional actions on $\Sigma$ whose field equations are again Hitchin's equations. Furthermore, we obtain a family of symplectic structures from our family of four-dimensional theories and show that they agree with the hyperk\"ahler family of symplectic forms on the Hitchin moduli space, thereby identifying the $\mathbb{CP}^1$-valued parameter with the twistor parameter of the Hitchin moduli space. Our results place Hitchin's equations and their integrable structure within the framework of four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory and make the role of the twistor parameter manifest.</description>

      <title>The $T^{\mu\nu}$ of the conformal scalars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct the unique primary energy-momentum tensor $T^{\mu\nu}$ for the conformal free scalar with scaling dimension $\Delta=d/2-\zeta$ as a sum of Gegenbauer polynomials. For integer $\zeta$, the sum truncates at order $\zeta$, compactly reproducing all known results; for the nonlocal case of real $\zeta$, it is an infinite sum, with a two-parameter extension that reflects the nonuniqueness of the nonlocal geometric coupling. We find $T^{\mu\nu}$ by imposing off-shell conservation and tracelessness, and then directly solving the primary condition in momentum space. In the integer $\zeta$ case, we reproduce the known two-point function, and confirm the match with the $T^{\mu\nu}$ computed from Juhl's formulae for the GJMS operators (the Weyl-covariant upgrades of $(-\partial^2)^\zeta$), an equality following from the descent of Weyl covariance to conformal invariance.</description>

      <title>Energy-Energy Correlator from the AdS Virasoro-Shapiro Amplitude</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a precise formula relating the world-sheet integral of the AdS Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude to the energy-energy correlator (EEC) in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory at strong coupling. This mapping allows us to evaluate the coefficients of the AdS curvature expansion of the EEC in terms of the world-sheet integral over a unit disk. To illustrate this idea, we explicitly compute the flat-space contribution and the first curvature correction to the EEC. Our results provide a rigorous description of the stringy energy flow, demonstrating how world-sheet correlator imprint themselves on collider observables and offering a potential template for effective string descriptions of energy correlators in general gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Causality Criteria for Island Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Island models offer a compelling resolution of the black hole information paradox, but they also raise persistent questions about causal consistency in effective descriptions. In particular, effective theories arising in double holography can exhibit apparent violations of micro-causality, despite the underlying bulk dynamics being local and causal. The aim of this work is to clarify the physical origin of this phenomenon and to identify the structural features that control causal consistency in island models.
  We argue that the apparent non-causality in double holography is neither intrinsic to island physics nor a consequence of nonlocal operator reconstruction. Rather, it reflects a mismatch between effective spacetime separation and bulk causal accessibility, a feature already implicit in earlier analyses. Nonlocal reconstruction instead encodes quantum error correction within a restricted code subspace and does not introduce independent propagation channels.
  Motivated by this perspective, we formulate a structural criterion for micro-causality in effective island descriptions. The criterion consists of three conditions: the absence of independent propagation channels beyond those of the bulk theory, a local bulk-supported operator dictionary, and a consistent matching between effective spacelike separation and dynamically accessible bulk causal curves. When these conditions are satisfied, effective micro-causality follows directly from bulk micro-causality. We apply the criterion to brane world realizations of island models, including the defect-extremal-surface construction, and show that they preserve causal consistency, in contrast to double holography. We further demonstrate that the criterion remains robust in time-dependent processes such as island formation and evaporation.</description>

      <title>Entanglement measures for multi-component universe from holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies in \cite{Park:2020jio,Paul:2025gpk} have calculated various holographic information theoretic quantities of the four-dimensional FLRW universe for different matter-dominated eras using the braneworld model of cosmology. These studies are done for a single matter component, which is a good toy model for understanding the entanglement properties of the universe. Although for a more realistic model, one should consider a scenario where our universe has coexisting matter components like radiation-dark matter or radiation-exotic matter, etc. In this work, we have presented a systematic way to study various holographic information-theoretic quantities (entanglement entropy and complexity) of the FLRW universe in the presence of coexisting matter components. We have shown that the black brane geometry in the presence of $p$-brane gas indeed supports the existence of a universe with two-component matter sources. The second Israel junction condition, along with the Ryu-Takayanagi formula, is used to compute the time-dependent holographic entanglement entropy of the universe with coexisting radiation-dark matter and radiation-exotic matter. The expression of the time-dependent volume complexity is also evaluated in these scenarios. For both universes, these information-theoretic quantities show a clear radiation dependence in the early time and matter and exotic matter dominance in the late time, which is consistent with the thermal history of the universe.</description>

      <title>On Duality Invariant Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an explicit construction of a manifestly duality invariant, interacting deformation of Maxwell theory in four dimensions in terms of mutually local, but interacting 1- and 3-forms. Interestingly, our theory is formulated directly as a BRST quantized gauge theory, while the underlying gauge invariant Lagrangian before gauge fixing is obscured. Furthermore, the underlying gauge invariance is based on an associative, rather than a Lie symmetry.</description>

      <title>Mimetic Dark Matter from Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the coupling of mimetic dark matter to the Gauss-Bonnet topological term in addition to the Einstein-Hilbert action. We demonstrate that such interactions can naturally give rise to mimetic dark matter during the inflationary stage of the universe's evolution. By choosing an appropriate coupling between the mimetic field and the Gauss-Bonnet term, we find that at the end of inflation, the correct amount of dust-like dark matter is produced, with its energy density expressible in terms of the Hubble parameter at the end of inflation. Furthermore, depending on the form of the coupling, the post matter-radiation equality behavior of mimetic dark matter can experience slight modifications.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Interactions in Celestial CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Loop corrections in QED and gravity have recently been conjectured to give rise to an infinite tower of logarithmic soft theorems governing the universal low-energy behavior of photons and gravitons. We explore the implications of this tower for celestial CFT and for the algebra of conformally soft operators. The symmetry-governed part of the tower of logarithmic soft factors is shown to exponentiate, which demonstrates that these loop effects do not represent independent multi-particle interactions, but instead are rooted in the long-range exchange of gauge bosons between pairs of hard operator insertions. We define conformally soft loop operators, and compute their operator product expansions on the celestial sphere. The associated Ward identities exhibit characteristic non-local behaviors, which reflect the pair-wise interactions between hard operator insertions mediated by gauge bosons. We comment on the implications of these results for the soft operator algebra at loop order.</description>

      <title>Temporal Kirkwood-Dirac Quasiprobability Distribution and Unification of Temporal State Formalisms through Temporal Bloch Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal quantum states generalize the multipartite density operator formalism to the time domain, enabling a unified treatment of quantum systems with both timelike and spacelike correlations. Despite a growing body of temporal state formalisms, their precise operational relationships and conceptual distinctions remain unclear. In this work, we resolve this issue by extending the Kirkwood-Dirac (KD) quasiprobability distribution to arbitrary multi-time quantum processes and, more broadly, to general spatiotemporal settings. We define left, right, and doubled temporal KD quasiprobabilities, together with their real components, which we identify as temporal Margenau-Hill (MH) quasiprobabilities. All of these quantities are experimentally accessible through interferometric measurement schemes. By characterizing their nonclassical features, we show that the generalized KD framework provides a unified operational foundation for a wide class of temporal state approaches and can be directly implemented via temporal or spatiotemporal Bloch tomography.</description>

      <title>An Operator-Algebraic Framework for Anyons and Defects in Quantum Spin Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this dissertation, we detail an operator algebraic approach to studying topological order in the infinite volume setting. We give a thorough and self-contained review of the DHR-style approach on quantum spin systems, which builds a category $\mathrm{\textbf{DHR}}$ of anyon sectors starting from microscopic lattice spin systems. In general, this category has the structure of a braided $\mathrm{C}^*$-tensor category. We will verify in full detail that $\mathrm{\textbf{DHR}}$ is the expected category in Kitaev's Quantum Double model, a paradigmatic model for studying topological order on the lattice. We will then extend the DHR-style analysis to systems in the presence of a global on-site symmetry, and introduce a category of symmetry defects, $G\mathsf{Sec}$, and show that it has the structure of a $G$-crossed braided $\mathrm{C}^*$-tensor category.</description>

      <title>Tunnelling in Quantum Cosmology: WKB vs SWKB</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05687v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The WKB approximation is a standard tool for studying tunnelling problems in quantum cosmology. We compare this method to the Supersymmetric WKB (SWKB) applied to a closed FRW minisuperspace model. We consider the transition from a dust towards a dark energy-dominated epoch can be explained by a generalized Chaplygin gas. Using analytic approximations for the superpotential (power-series and a Picard approximation), we derive closed-form SWKB tunnelling expressions and compute transmission probabilities as functions of the Chaplygin parameters $A$, $B$ and $\alpha$. Numerical root-finding locates classical turning points and numerical integration allows comparison with standard WKB results. We find that SWKB and WKB agree when the WKB validity condition holds, while the SWKB yields systematically larger (and plausibly more accurate) tunnelling probabilities for parameter values where the WKB assumptions break down. The results support the SWKB as a useful complementary approach for barrier-transmission studies in quantum cosmology.</description>

      <title>Towards Accurate Gravitational Wave Predictions: Gauge-Invariant Nucleation in the Electroweak Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.05793v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vacuum decay in the early Universe should be gauge-invariant. In this work, we study the gauge dependence of the vacuum decay occurring through a first-order phase transition and the associated gravitational wave production. We investigate the gauge dependence of the bubble nucleation and phase transition parameters within the framework of the Standard model effective field theory in three dimension. By considering the power-counting and utilizing the Nielsen identity at finite temperature, we show that, depending on the power-counting scheme favored by the new physics scale, the perturbative computation methodology allow we get the gauge-independent nucleation rates and phase transition, this enables more accurate predictions of gravitational wave signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.05840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The near-threshold photo- and electroproduction of heavy vector quarkonia off the proton provides direct access to its gluonic structure. In particular, the cross section for $J/\Psi$ photoproduction near threshold is governed by the proton's gluon gravitational form factors (GFFs). In this work, we employ the generalized parton distribution framework together with gluon GFFs calculated in a light-front gluon-spectator model inspired by soft-wall AdS/QCD to predict both the differential and total cross sections for near-threshold $J/\Psi$ and $\Upsilon$ photoproductions. Our results for $J/\Psi$ photoproduction show good agreement with recent experimental data from the $J/\Psi$-007 and GlueX Collaborations at Jefferson Lab, as well as with earlier measurements from SLAC and Cornell.</description>

Abstract: The trapping (or apparent) horizon serves as a key tool for tracing the complete evolution of black holes. We investigate a class of coordinate singularities induced by such trapping (or apparent) horizons in a spherically symmetric, dynamic spacetime, which are distinct from the well-known coordinate singularities associated with the Killing horizon. In particular, we clarify the geometric structure of this coordinate singularity by means of the Kodama vector field, thereby avoiding unphysical artifacts. We further employ the evolving Ellis drainhole as an analytical model to illustrate key details of this phenomenon.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the discrete as well as the continuous symmetry transformations for a three $(2+1)$-dimensional $(3D)$ combined system of the free Abelian 1-form and 2-form gauge theories within the framework of Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) formalism and establish their relevance in the context of the algebraic structures that are obeyed by the de Rham cohomological operators of differential geometry. In fact, our present field-theoretic system respects six continuous symmetry transformations and a couple of very useful discrete duality symmetry transformations. Out of the above six continuous symmetry transformations four are off-shell nilpotent (i.e. fermionic) in nature and two are bosonic. The algebraic structures, obeyed by the symmetry operators, are reminiscent of the algebra satisfied by the de Rham cohomological operators. Hence, our present $3D$ field-theoretic system provides a perfect example for Hodge theory where there is convergence of ideas from the physical aspects of the BRST formalism and mathematical ingredients that are connected with the cohomological operators of differential geometry at the algebraic level. One of the highlights of our present investigation is the appearance of a pseudo-scalar field in our theory (on the symmetry ground alone) which carries the negative kinetic term. Thus, it is one of the possible candidates for the ``phantom" fields of the cyclic, bouncing and self-accelerated cosmological models of the Universe.</description>

      <title>Pinpointing Triple Point of Noncommutative Matrix Model with Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07563v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a Hermitian matrix model with a quartic potential, modified by a curvature term $\mathrm{tr}(R\Phi^2)$, where $R$ is a fixed external matrix. Inspired by the truncated Heisenberg algebra formulation of the Grosse--Wulkenhaar model, this term breaks unitary invariance and, through perturbative expansion, induces an effective multitrace matrix model. We analyze the resulting action both analytically and numerically, including Hamiltonian Monte Carlo simulations, focusing on two features closely tied to renormalizability: the shift of the triple point and the suppression of the noncommutative striped phase. Our findings show that the curvature term drives the phase structure toward renormalizable behavior by removing the striped phase in the large-$N$ limit, while also unexpectedly revealing a possible novel multi-cut phase observed at the level of finite matrix size.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of the Fermion-Rotor System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.21059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the dynamics of the fermion-rotor system, a simple impurity model in d=1+1 dimensions that consists of a collection of purely right-moving fermions interacting with a quantum mechanical rotor localised at the origin. This was first introduced by Polchinski as a toy model for monopole-fermion scattering and is surprisingly subtle, with ingoing and outgoing fermions carrying different quantum numbers. We show that the rotor acts as a twist operator in the low-energy theory, changing the quantum numbers of excitations that have previously passed through the origin to ensure scattering consistent with all symmetries.
  We further show how generalisations of this model with multiple rotors and unequal charges can be viewed as a UV-completion of boundary states for chiral theories, including the well-studied 3450 model. We compute correlation functions between ingoing and outgoing fermions and show that fermions dressed with the rotor degree of freedom act as local operators and create single-particle states, generalising an earlier result obtained in a theory with a single rotor and equal charges. Finally, we point out a mod 2 anomaly in these models that descends from the Witten anomaly in 4d</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Truncation Framework for Gauge Theories on the Interval</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17890v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate gauge theories in two dimensions nonperturbatively using the Hamiltonian truncation approach. Working on a spatial interval and adopting the axial gauge, we remove all gauge field degrees of freedom and express the interacting Hamiltonian in the eigenbasis of the free Dirac theory, truncated at a finite energy. As a benchmark we analyse the Schwinger model, where our numerical spectra agree closely with the exact results from bosonization across a wide range of couplings, validating the construction of the Hamiltonian. We then generalize the formulation to nonabelian gauge groups and apply it to SU(3) gauge theory with a single massless Dirac fermion. These results demonstrate that gauge theories can be explored nonperturbatively using a truncated Hamiltonian that generates evolutions in ordinary time, offering a complementary alternative to lattice field theory.</description>

      <title>Gravitational dressing: from the crossed product to more general algebraic and mathematical structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24833v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The crossed product, and consequent transition from von Neumann algebras of type III to II, is recovered from a truncation of more general gravitational dressing constructions, about certain spacetimes. This is done by extending "standard dressing" constructions previously used to give a perturbative definition of "gravitational splittings," defining approximate localization of information. This result appears to illustrate that this algebraic transition is a small piece of a more general algebraic, or other mathematical, structure associated with quantum gravity. The leading-order structure involves noncommutativity from separated regions, and at the nonperturbative level connects with a possible explanation of holographic behavior for gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.11756v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We clarify the status of gauge-invariant entire-function regulators in NonLocal Quantum Field Theory. The regulator is implemented as an entire function of the covariant Laplace--Beltrami operator. Working in the background-field formalism and expanding around flat, trivial backgrounds, we show that plane waves diagonalize the d'Alembertian, so that the entire function reduces to a multiplicative form factor in Minkowski momentum space. After Wick rotation, to the Euclidean axis, producing exponential ultraviolet damping in loop integrals without introducing additional poles or branch cuts. Our analysis provides a concise, gauge-covariant justification for the use of entire-function regulators in nonlocal quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study bulk locality constraints in quantum field theories in AdS$_2$. The known derivation of locality sum rules in AdS$_{d+1}$ does not apply for $d=1$ due to the different singularity structure of the conformal blocks and the inequivalence of operator orderings on the boundary. Assuming unitarity and a mild growth condition, we establish power-law bounds for correlators, derive dispersion relations and an expansion in terms of ``even'' and ``odd'' local blocks that converges in the entire AdS$_2$. These yield two novel families of symmetric and antisymmetric locality sum rules. We test these sum rules explicitly in the free scalar field theory.</description>

      <title>The spectrum of Feynman-integral geometries at two loops</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.13794v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide a complete classification of the Feynman-integral geometries at two-loop order in four-dimensional Quantum Field Theory with standard quadratic propagators. Concretely, we consider a finite basis of integrals in the 't Hooft--Veltman scheme, i.e. with $D$-dimensional loop momenta and four-dimensional external momenta, which belong to 79 independent topologies, or sectors. Then, we analyze the leading singularities of the integrals in those sectors for generic values of the masses and momenta, using the loop-by-loop Baikov representation. Aside from the Riemann sphere, we find that elliptic curves, hyperelliptic curves of genus 2 and 3 as well as K3 surfaces occur. Moreover, we find a smooth and non-degenerate Del Pezzo surface of degree 2, a particular Fano variety known to be rationalizable, resulting in a curve of geometric genus 3. These geometries determine the space of functions relevant for Quantum Field Theories at two-loop order, including in the Standard Model.</description>

Abstract: Discretizing the $\lambda \phi^4$ scalar field theory on a lattice yields a system of coupled anharmonic oscillators with quadratic and quartic potentials. We begin by analyzing the two coupled oscillators in the second quantization method to derive several analytic relations to the second-order perturbation, which are then employed to numerically calculate the thermal out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), $C_T(t)$. We find that the function $C_T(t)$ exhibits exponential growth over a long time window in the early stages, with Lyapunov exponent $\lambda\sim T^{1/4}$, which diagnoses quantum chaos. We furthermore investigate the quantum chaos properties in a closed chain of N coupled anharmonic oscillators, which relates to the 1+1 dimensional interacting quantum scalar field theory. The results reveal an interesting property that the signatures of quantum chaos appear at low perturbative orders in the OTOC.</description>

      <title>Exact Infrared Triangle in Massless sQED with Long-range Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21239v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The logarithmic soft photon theorem in four spacetime dimensions encodes an infinite-dimensional asymptotic symmetry which acts on massive matter as a divergent superphaserotation. Here we extend this result to massless matter which is both more subtle and surprising. We derive the charge associated to divergent superphaserotations and show that it exactly vanishes to all orders in the electromagnetic coupling. This is in agreement with the vanishing of the classical logarithmic soft photon theorem which is one-loop exact. Special care is required for massless matter due to potential collinear divergences which, as we show, do however not affect the superphaserotation charge. We furthermore compute the infrared corrections to the charge associated to the subleading tree-level soft photon theorem. As a corollary of our result, we find that the tail to the velocity kick memory due to the long-range interactions between soft electromagnetic radiation and massless matter vanishes.</description>

      <title>Graviton-Photon Mixing by a Kerr-Newman Black Hole with Worldline EFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.00980v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In black hole perturbation theory, the difficulty in separating electromagnetic and gravitational sectors of the coupled Teukolsky equations has prevented a general treatment of scattering processes involving both electromagnetic waves and gravitational waves in presence of a Kerr-Newman black hole. We present the first computation of the gauge-invariant, low-frequency scattering amplitude for graviton photoproduction by a Kerr-Newman black hole at tree level up to $\mathcal{O}\big((\omega/m)^2\big)$ or $\mathcal{O}(S^2)$ and linear in $\kappa$, using the worldline effective field theory. The relevant Wilson coefficients are determined by matching the graviton and photon one-point functions to the Kerr-Newman solution. We obtain the full angular dependence of the conversion cross section in the presence of spin and comment on the factorization relation between the graviton photoproduction amplitude and the photon Compton amplitude for a classical spinning source. The result provides a benchmark for future analyses of coupled gravitoelectromagnetic scattering in spinning charged compact object backgrounds.</description>

      <title>All loop soft photon theorems and higher spin currents on the celestial sphere</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft factorization theorems can be reinterpreted as Ward identities for (asymptotic) symmetries of scattering amplitudes in asymptotically flat space-time. In this paper we study the symmetries implied by the all loop soft photon theorems when all external particles are massless. Loop level soft theorems are qualitatively different from the tree level soft theorems because loop level soft factors contain multi-particle sums. If we want to interpret them as Ward identities then we need to introduce additional fields which live on the celestial sphere but do not appear as asymptotic states in any scattering experiment. For example, if we want to interpret the one-loop exact $O(\ln\omega)$ soft theorem for a positive helicity soft photon (with energy $\omega$) as a Ward identity then we need to introduce a pair of antiholomorphic currents on the celestial sphere which transform as a doublet under the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})_{R}$. We call them dipole currents because the corresponding charges measure the monopole and the dipole moment of an electrically charged particle on the celestial sphere. More generally, the soft photon theorem at $O(\omega^{2j-1}(\ln\omega)^{2j})$ for every $j\in \frac{1}{2}\mathbb{Z}_+$ gives rise to $(2j+1)$ antiholomorphic currents which transform in the spin-$j$ representation of the $SL(2,\mathbb{R})_{R}$. These currents exist in the quantum theory because they follow from loop level soft theorems. We argue that under certain circumstances the (classical) algebra of the higher spin currents is the wedge subalgebra of the $w_{1+\infty}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19753v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We take first steps toward a theory of ``conformal twists'' for superconformal field theories in dimension 3 to 6, extending the well-known analysis of twists for supersymmetric theories. A conformal twist is a square-zero odd element in the superconformal Lie algebra, and we classify all twists and describe their orbits under the adjoint action of the superconformal group. We work mostly with the complexified superconformal algebras, unless explicitly stated otherwise; real forms of the superconformal algebra may have important physical implications, but we only discuss these subtleties in a few special cases. Conformal twists can give rise to interesting subalgebras and protected sectors of operators in a superconformal field theory, with the Donaldson--Witten topological field theory and the vertex operator algebras of 4-dimensional N=2 SCFTs being prominent examples. To obtain mathematical precision, we explain how to extract vertex algebras and E_n algebras from a twisted superconformal field theory using factorization algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00146v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we have tested the non-unitary mixing hypothesis with the latest data from NO$\nu$A and T2K experiments. We have also analysed their combined data. We have provided the best-fit values of the standard and non standard parameters after the analysis. $90\%$ limits on the non-unitary mixing parameters have also been provided. The constraints on unitary violation is stronger, compared to the constraints obtained from previous data from NO$\nu$A and T2K. The tension between NO$\nu$A and T2K at the $1\,\sigma$ for normal mass hierarchy can be reduced for non-unitary mixing due to $\alpha_{10}$, albeit for a value of $|\alpha_{10}|$ larger than the present global $90\%$ limit. Additionally a study of the future sensitivity of NO$\nu$A, T2K and DUNE has been provided.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.19511v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent developments in the thermodynamics of Taub-NUT spaces and the absence of Misner strings in Taub-NUT solutions with flat horizons, we investigated the phase structure of dyonic Taub-NUT solutions. We follow the treatment proposed in arXiv:2206.09124 and arXiv:2304.06705 to introduce the nut parameter as a conserved charge to the first law. Although the calculated quantities satisfy the first law, we have found a larger class of charges that satisfy the first law and depend on some arbitrary parameter which we call $\alpha$. We choose to describe phase diagrams as NUT parameter-Temperature graphs to show borders of big and small black hole phases. We study the phase structure of these spaces in a mixed ensemble (i.e., we fix the electric potential, the nut parameter, and the magnetic charge), which we classify into different cases depending on the value of $\alpha$. In some of these cases we have first-order phase transitions that end with critical points. These classes could include up to four critical points, again, depending on $\alpha$ and the other quantities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17401v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the centennial of quantum mechanics, we offer an overview of the central role played by quantum information and thermalization in problems involving fundamental properties of spacetime and gravitational physics. This is an open area of research still a century after the initial development of formal quantum mechanics, highlighting the effectiveness of quantum physics in the description of all natural phenomena. These remarkable connections can be highlighted with the tools of modern quantum optics, which effectively addresses the three-fold interplay of interacting atoms, fields, and spacetime backgrounds describing gravitational fields and noninertial systems. In this review article, we select aspects of these phenomena centered on quantum features of the acceleration radiation of particles in the presence of black holes. The ensuing horizon-brightened radiation (HBAR) provides a case study of the role played by quantum physics in nontrivial spacetime behavior, and also shows a fundamental correspondence with black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Deciphering the nature of $X(2300)$ with the PACIAE model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.11746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the BESIII newest observation of an axial-vector particle $X(2300)$ in the $\psi(3686)\rightarrow \phi\eta \eta'$ process, we simulate its production in $e^+e^-$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=4.95$ GeV using the parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE 4.0. In this model, the final partonic state (FPS) and hadronic state (FHS) are simulated and recorded sequentially. We propose, for the first time, that $X(2300)$ could be a $q\bar{q}s\bar{s}$ ($q=u/d$) state or a hadro-strangeonium state, i.e., a bound system of a strangeonium and a light hadron. The excited strangeonium candidate is formed by coalescing an $s\bar{s}$ quark pair in the FPS with the quantum statistical mechanics inspired dynamically constrained phase-space coalescence model. The tetraquark candidates of $q\bar{q}s\bar{s}$ and $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ are similarly produced by coalescing four constituent quarks in the FPS. In contrast, a hadro-strangeonium candidate emerges from the recombination of the constituent $\phi$ and $\eta/\eta$ in the FHS. We then calculate the $X(2300)$'s orbital angular momentum quantum number in its rest frame and perform the spectral classification for each of the above candidates. Given its quantum numbers $J^{PC}=1^{+-}$, $X(2300)$ is identified as a $P$-wave $s\bar{s}$, an $S$-wave $q\bar{q}s\bar{s}/ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ or $S$-wave $\phi\eta'/\phi \eta$ candidate. For the first time, we estimate the production rates for these configurations. The $P$-wave $s\bar{s}$ and $S$-wave $q\bar{q}s\bar{s}$ states are produced at rates on the order of $10^{-5}$, whereas the $S$-wave $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ and $\phi\eta'/\phi \eta$ states appear at rates on the order of $10^{-6}$. Moreover, significant discrepancies are observed in the rapidity and transverse momentum distributions among different candidates. These discrepancies could be served as valuable criteria for deciphering the nature of $X(2300)$.</description>

      <title>Higher-Form Anomalies on Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Higher-form symmetry in a tensor product Hilbert space is always emergent: the symmetry generators become genuinely topological only when the Gauss law is energetically enforced at low energies. In this paper, we present a general method for defining the 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetries in lattice models built on a tensor product Hilbert space. In (2+1)D, for given Gauss law operators realized by finite-depth circuits that generate a finite 1-form $G$ symmetry, we construct an index representing a cohomology class in $H^4(B^2G, U(1))$, which characterizes the corresponding 't Hooft anomaly. This construction generalizes the Else-Nayak characterization of 0-form symmetry anomalies. More broadly, under the assumption of a specified formulation of the $p$-form $G$ symmetry action and Hilbert space structure in arbitrary $d$ spatial dimensions, we show how to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly of the symmetry action by an index valued in $H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational baryogenesis in $f(T,L_m)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17218v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The observed matter-antimatter asymmetry of the Universe remains a fundamental challenge in modern physics. In this work, we explore gravitational baryogenesis within the framework of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity, where the gravitational Lagrangian depends on both the torsion scalar $T$ and the matter Lagrangian $L_m$. We consider three representative models and examine their ability to generate the observed baryon-to-entropy ratio. Our analysis shows that couplings involving both torsion and the matter Lagrangian, $\partial_\mu(-T-\frac{L_m}{L_0})$, can successfully account for the baryon asymmetry for decoupling temperatures in the range $10^{12}$-$10^{14}\,\text{GeV}$, while remaining consistent with small deviations from General Relativity. These results highlight the capacity of $f(T,L_m)$ gravity to provide novel mechanisms for baryogenesis, demonstrating that the interplay between torsion and matter-sector contributions can naturally generate the observed asymmetry. The framework also remains compatible with late-time cosmological evolution, offering a unified setting for early- and late-time dynamics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Wigner theorem for non-invertible symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25327v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish the conditions under which a conservation law associated with a non-invertible operator may be realized as a symmetry in quantum mechanics. As established by Wigner, all quantum symmetries must be represented by either unitary or antiunitary transformations. Relinquishing an implicit assumption of invertibility, we demonstrate that the fundamental invariance of quantum transition probabilities under the application of symmetries mandates that all non-invertible symmetries may only correspond to {\it projective} unitary or antiunitary transformations, i.e., {\it partial isometries}. This extends the notion of physical states beyond conventional rays in Hilbert space to equivalence classes in an {\it extended, gauged Hilbert space}, thereby broadening the traditional understanding of symmetry transformations in quantum theory. We discuss consequences of this result and explicitly illustrate how, in simple model systems, whether symmetries be invertible or non-invertible may be inextricably related to the particular boundary conditions that are being used.</description>

      <title>Non-local Metric-Affine Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-local gravity can potentially solve several problems of gravitational field both at Ultra-Violet and Infra-Red scales. However, such an approach has been formulated mainly in metric formalism. In this paper, we discuss non-local theories of gravity in the metric-affine framework. In particular, we study the dynamics of metric-affine analogue of some well-studied non-local theories, by treating the metric and the connection as independent fields. The approach gives the opportunity to deal with non-local gravity under a more general standard. Furthermore, we introduce some novel non-local metric-affine theories with no Riemannian analogue and investigate their dynamics. Finally we discuss some cosmological applications of our development.</description>

      <title>On the Complexified Spacetime Manifold Mapping of AdS to dS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.11658v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a complex manifold, one can bridge anti-de Sitter and de Sitter spacetimes via analytic continuation, preserving geometric invariants and regularity, avoiding singularities during the AdS-dS transition. It unifies gravitational and gauge interactions under a complexified symmetry group, maintaining bulk unitarity for both AdS and dS. Boundary unitarity is upheld in AdS but not in dS due to the spacelike conformal boundary. The theory uses holographic principles like the MacDowell-Mansouri and Quantum Extremal Surface prescriptions to align entanglement and black hole entropy with AdS/CFT and general relativity. HUFT provides insights into AdS and dS holography, the cosmological constant, and quantum gravity unitarity and entanglement.</description>

      <title>$\mathbb Z_2$-Stable Dark Matter via Broken $\text{SU}(5)$ Gauge Bosons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.19462v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I construct and analyze a dark matter sector that is neutral under the unbroken Standard Model gauge group and couples only to the broken $\text{SU}(5)$ gauge directions, the leptoquark vectors $X,Y$. An exact $\mathbb Z_2$ renders the dark matter stable. I give a gauge-covariant definition of projectors onto the unbroken Standard Model and broken ($X,Y$) subspaces, demonstrate that the covariant derivative of dark matter selects only $X,Y$, and integrate out $X,Y$ at tree level to obtain the leading effective operators. I also derive the loop-induced $\chi^2\,G^a_{\mu\nu}G^{a\mu\nu}$ coupling to gluons, prove color neutrality, and show consistency with cold dark matter phenomenology. Cosmological production proceeds via UV freeze-in or even more suppressed channels in.</description>
