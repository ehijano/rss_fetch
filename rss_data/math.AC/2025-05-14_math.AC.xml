      <title>Universal enveloping H-pseudoalgebras of DGP pseudoalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notions of Poisson $H$-pseudoalgebras are generalizations of Poisson algebras in a pseudotensor category $\mathcal{M}^{\ast}(H)$. This paper introduces an analogue of Poisson-Ore extension in Poisson $H$-pseudoalgebras. Poisson $H$-pseudoalgebras with the differential graded setting induces the notions of differential graded Poisson $H$-pseudoalgebras (DGP pseudoalgebras, for short). The DGP pseudoalgebra with some compatibility conditions is proved to be closed under tensor product. Furthermore, the universal enveloping $H$-pseudoalgebras of DGP pseudoalgebras are constructed by a $\mathcal{P}$-triple. A unique differential graded pseudoalgebra homomorphism between a universal enveloping $H$-pseudoalgebra of a DGP pseudoalgebra and a $\mathcal{P}$-triple of a DGP pseudoalgebra is obtained.</description>

      <title>When are Morse resolutions polyhedral?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is known that the chain complex of a simplex on $q$ vertices can be used to construct a free resolution of any ideal generated by $q$ monomials, and as a direct result, the Betti numbers always have binomial upper bounds, given by the number of faces of a simplex in each dimension.
  It is also known that for most monomials the resolution provided by the simplex is far from minimal. Discrete Morse theory provides an algorithm called \say{Morse matchings} by which faces of the simplex can be removed so that the chain complex on the remaining faces is still a free resolution of the same ideal. An immediate positive effect is an often considerable improvement on the bounds on Betti numbers. A caveat is the loss of the combinatorial structure of the simplex we started with: the output of the Morse matching process is a cell complex with no obvious structure besides an \say{address} for each cell.
  The main question in this paper is: which Morse matchings lead to Morse complexes that are polyhedral cell complexes? We prove that if a monomial ideal is minimally generated by up to four generators, then there is a maximal Morse matching of the simplex such that the resulting cell complex is a polyhedral cell complex. We then give an example of a monomial ideal minimally generated by six generators whose minimal free resolution is supported on a Morse complex and the Morse complex cannot be polyhedral no matter what Morse matching is chosen, and we go further to show that this ideal cannot have any polyhedral minimal free resolution.</description>

      <title>Properties of LCM Lattices of Monomial Ideals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: LCM lattices were introduced by Gasharov, Peeva, and Welker as a way to study minimal free resolutions of monomial ideals. All LCM lattices are atomic and all atomic lattices arise as the LCM lattice of some monomial ideal. We systematically study other lattice properties of LCM lattices. For lattices associated to the edge ideal of a graph, we completely characterize the many standard lattice properties in terms of the associated graphs: Boolean, modular, upper semimodular, lower semimodular, supersolvable, coatomic, and complemented; edge ideals with graded LCM lattices were previously characterized by Nevo and Peeva as those associated to gap-free graphs. Such a characterization for arbitrary monomial ideals appears to be out of reach. However, we prove the Cohen-Macaulayness of minimal monomial ideals associated to modular lattices. We also prove separate necessary and sufficient lattice conditions for when the projective dimension of a monomial ideal matches the height of its LCM lattice.</description>

      <title>Clarification and Coinduction of Tambara Functors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08066v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tambara functors are equivariant analogues of rings arising in representation theory and equivariant homotopy theory. We introduce the notion of a clarified Tambara functor and show that under mild conditions every Tambara functor admits a decomposition as a product of coinductions of clarified Tambara functors; projection onto the non-coinduced part defines a reflective localization we call clarification. Through this perspective we study Nakaoka spectra, Morita invariance and $K$-theory of Tambara functors, field-like and domain-like Tambara functors, $G$-$\mathbb{E}_\infty$-rings, Nullstellensatzian clarified Tambara functors, and transversal Tambara functors.</description>

      <title>Resolving the Module of Derivations on an $n \times (n+1)$ Determinantal Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use the construction of the relative bar resolution via differential graded structures to obtain the minimal graded free resolution of $\text{Der}_{R \mid k}$, where $R$ is a determinantal ring defined by the maximal minors of an $n \times (n+1)$ generic matrix and $k$ is its coefficient field. Along the way, we compute an explicit action of the Hilbert-Burch differential graded algebra on a differential graded module resolving the cokernel of the Jacobian matrix whose kernel is $\text{Der}_{R \mid k}$. As a consequence of the minimality of the resulting relative bar resolution, we get a minimal generating set for $\text{Der}_{R \mid k}$ as an $R$-module, which, while already known, has not been obtained via our methods.</description>

Abstract: We present a new key exchange protocol based on circulant matrices acting on matrices over a congruence-simple semiring.

      <title>A study of perfectoid rings via Galois cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01922v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In his foundational study of $p$-adic Hodge theory, Faltings introduced the method of almost \'etale extensions to establish fundmental comparison results of various $p$-adic cohomology theories. Scholze introduced the tilting operations to study algebraic objects arising from $p$-adic Hodge theory in mixed characteristic via the Frobenius map. In this article, we prove a few results which clarify certain ring-theoretic or homological properties of the tilt of an extension between perfectoid rings treated in the construction of big Cohen-Macaulay algebras.</description>

      <title>Generic Green's Conjecture and Generic Geometric Syzygy Conjecture in Positive Characteristic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2109.12187v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the syzygies of canonical curves of genus $g\geq 3$ over an algebraically closed field $\mathbb{F}$ of characteristic $p&gt;0$. We provide a new proof of generic Green's Conjecture for $p\geq\frac{g+4}{2}$. Using the techniques from the even-genus case, we establish a significant case of the Geometric Syzygy Conjecture for the last syzygy space of a general even-genus canonical curve (assuming $p&gt;g$). In characteristic 0, it was shown in prior work that this case implies the full conjecture.</description>

      <title>Degree of freedom count in linear gauge invariant PDE systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16042v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider not necessarily Lagrangian partial linear differential equations (PDE) with constant coefficients. Einstein proposed a definition of the"strength" of such a field theory that defines its degree of freedom (DoF). Einsteinian strength is based on the asymptotic number of free Taylor series coefficients of bounded degree in the general solution of the PDE system. The direct count of DoF in this way is a complex and technically demanding process. Proceeding from Einsteinian strength of equations and making use of commutative algebra tools, we deduce another DoF count recipe which is formulated in terms of orders of the field equations, their gauge symmetries and gauge identities. This DoF count recipe covers the case of reducible gauge field theories, and it is easy to use. We begin with interpreting the matrix of the system as a linear map between polynomial modules. First, proceeding from Einsteinian definition, we derive an explicit formula for DoF as the multiplicity of a certain extension module. Second, we prove another explicit formula for DoF in terms of orders of equations and gauge generators. A notable consequence of this formula is that two Hermitian conjugate systems have identical DoF. Every classical field theory defines the BRST complex which has the natural grading known as the ghost number. We equip this complex with another grading, which we call differential order. This grading is 1 for every space time-derivative, while all thefields, ghosts, and antifields are assigned with this degree in a certain way, depending on their ghost number and the orders of equations and gauge generators. We compute the Euler characteristic of the BRST complex with respect to this new grading. This provides homological interpretation of DoF for linear gauge system as minus the residue at infinity of the logarithmic derivative of the Euler characteristics for its BRST complex.</description>
