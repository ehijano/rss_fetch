      <title>OMGM: Orchestrate Multiple Granularities and Modalities for Efficient Multimodal Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vision-language retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has become an effective approach for tackling Knowledge-Based Visual Question Answering (KB-VQA), which requires external knowledge beyond the visual content presented in images. The effectiveness of Vision-language RAG systems hinges on multimodal retrieval, which is inherently challenging due to the diverse modalities and knowledge granularities in both queries and knowledge bases. Existing methods have not fully tapped into the potential interplay between these elements. We propose a multimodal RAG system featuring a coarse-to-fine, multi-step retrieval that harmonizes multiple granularities and modalities to enhance efficacy. Our system begins with a broad initial search aligning knowledge granularity for cross-modal retrieval, followed by a multimodal fusion reranking to capture the nuanced multimodal information for top entity selection. A text reranker then filters out the most relevant fine-grained section for augmented generation. Extensive experiments on the InfoSeek and Encyclopedic-VQA benchmarks show our method achieves state-of-the-art retrieval performance and highly competitive answering results, underscoring its effectiveness in advancing KB-VQA systems.</description>

      <title>Efficient and Reproducible Biomedical Question Answering using Retrieval Augmented Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Biomedical question-answering (QA) systems require effective retrieval and generation components to ensure accuracy, efficiency, and scalability. This study systematically examines a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for biomedical QA, evaluating retrieval strategies and response time trade-offs. We first assess state-of-the-art retrieval methods, including BM25, BioBERT, MedCPT, and a hybrid approach, alongside common data stores such as Elasticsearch, MongoDB, and FAISS, on a ~10% subset of PubMed (2.4M documents) to measure indexing efficiency, retrieval latency, and retriever performance in the end-to-end RAG system. Based on these insights, we deploy the final RAG system on the full 24M PubMed corpus, comparing different retrievers' impact on overall performance. Evaluations of the retrieval depth show that retrieving 50 documents with BM25 before reranking with MedCPT optimally balances accuracy (0.90), recall (0.90), and response time (1.91s). BM25 retrieval time remains stable (82ms), while MedCPT incurs the main computational cost. These results highlight previously not well-known trade-offs in retrieval depth, efficiency, and scalability for biomedical QA. With open-source code, the system is fully reproducible and extensible.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Contrastive Learning with Model-augmentation for Knowledge-aware Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Benefiting from the effectiveness of graph neural networks (GNNs) and contrastive learning, GNN-based contrastive learning has become mainstream for knowledge-aware recommendation. However, most existing contrastive learning-based methods have difficulties in effectively capturing the underlying hierarchical structure within user-item bipartite graphs and knowledge graphs. Moreover, they commonly generate positive samples for contrastive learning by perturbing the graph structure, which may lead to a shift in user preference learning. To overcome these limitations, we propose hyperbolic contrastive learning with model-augmentation for knowledge-aware recommendation. To capture the intrinsic hierarchical graph structures, we first design a novel Lorentzian knowledge aggregation mechanism, which enables more effective representations of users and items. Then, we propose three model-level augmentation techniques to assist Hyperbolic contrastive learning. Different from the classical structure-level augmentation (e.g., edge dropping), the proposed model-augmentations can avoid preference shifts between the augmented positive pair. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate the superiority (maximum improvement of $11.03\%$) of proposed methods over existing baselines.</description>

      <title>TikTok Search Recommendations: Governance and Research Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08385v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Like other social media, TikTok is embracing its use as a search engine, developing search products to steer users to produce searchable content and engage in content discovery. Their recently developed product search recommendations are preformulated search queries recommended to users on videos. However, TikTok provides limited transparency about how search recommendations are generated and moderated, despite requirements under regulatory frameworks like the European Union's Digital Services Act. By suggesting that the platform simply aggregates comments and common searches linked to videos, it sidesteps responsibility and issues that arise from contextually problematic recommendations, reigniting long-standing concerns about platform liability and moderation. This position paper addresses the novelty of search recommendations on TikTok by highlighting the challenges that this feature poses for platform governance and offering a computational research agenda, drawing on preliminary qualitative analysis. It sets out the need for transparency in platform documentation, data access and research to study search recommendations.</description>

      <title>Lost in Transliteration: Bridging the Script Gap in Neural IR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most human languages use scripts other than the Latin alphabet. Search users in these languages often formulate their information needs in a transliterated -- usually Latinized -- form for ease of typing. For example, Greek speakers might use Greeklish, and Arabic speakers might use Arabizi. This paper shows that current search systems, including those that use multilingual dense embeddings such as BGE-M3, do not generalise to this setting, and their performance rapidly deteriorates when exposed to transliterated queries. This creates a ``script gap" between the performance of the same queries when written in their native or transliterated form. We explore whether adapting the popular ``translate-train" paradigm to transliterations can enhance the robustness of multilingual Information Retrieval (IR) methods and bridge the gap between native and transliterated scripts. By exploring various combinations of non-Latin and Latinized query text for training, we investigate whether we can enhance the capacity of existing neural retrieval techniques and enable them to apply to this important setting. We show that by further fine-tuning IR models on an even mixture of native and Latinized text, they can perform this cross-script matching at nearly the same performance as when the query was formulated in the native script. Out-of-domain evaluation and further qualitative analysis show that transliterations can also cause queries to lose some of their nuances, motivating further research in this direction.</description>

      <title>Interest Changes: Considering User Interest Life Cycle in Recommendation System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recommendation systems, user interests are always in a state of constant flux. Typically, a user interest experiences a emergent phase, a stable phase, and a declining phase, which are referred to as the "user interest life-cycle". Recent papers on user interest modeling have primarily focused on how to compute the correlation between the target item and user's historical behaviors, without thoroughly considering the life-cycle features of user interest. In this paper, we propose an effective method called Deep Interest Life-cycle Network (DILN), which not only captures the interest life-cycle features efficiently, but can also be easily integrated to existing ranking models. DILN contains two key components: Interest Life-cycle Encoder Module constructs historical activity histograms of the user interest and then encodes them into dense representation. Interest Life-cycle Fusion Module injects the encoded dense representation into multiple expert networks, with the aim of enabling the specific phase of interest life-cycle to activate distinct experts. Online A/B testing reveals that DILN achieves significant improvements of +0.38% in CTR, +1.04% in CVR and +0.25% in duration per user, which demonstrates its effectiveness. In addition, DILN inherently increase the exposure of users' emergent and stable interests while decreasing the exposure of declining interests. DILN has been deployed on the Lofter App.</description>

      <title>SweRank: Software Issue Localization with Code Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Software issue localization, the task of identifying the precise code locations (files, classes, or functions) relevant to a natural language issue description (e.g., bug report, feature request), is a critical yet time-consuming aspect of software development. While recent LLM-based agentic approaches demonstrate promise, they often incur significant latency and cost due to complex multi-step reasoning and relying on closed-source LLMs. Alternatively, traditional code ranking models, typically optimized for query-to-code or code-to-code retrieval, struggle with the verbose and failure-descriptive nature of issue localization queries. To bridge this gap, we introduce SweRank, an efficient and effective retrieve-and-rerank framework for software issue localization. To facilitate training, we construct SweLoc, a large-scale dataset curated from public GitHub repositories, featuring real-world issue descriptions paired with corresponding code modifications. Empirical results on SWE-Bench-Lite and LocBench show that SweRank achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming both prior ranking models and costly agent-based systems using closed-source LLMs like Claude-3.5. Further, we demonstrate SweLoc's utility in enhancing various existing retriever and reranker models for issue localization, establishing the dataset as a valuable resource for the community.</description>

      <title>Development of a WAZOBIA-Named Entity Recognition System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07884v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Named Entity Recognition NER is very crucial for various natural language processing applications, including information extraction, machine translation, and sentiment analysis. Despite the ever-increasing interest in African languages within computational linguistics, existing NER systems focus mainly on English, European, and a few other global languages, leaving a significant gap for under-resourced languages. This research presents the development of a WAZOBIA-NER system tailored for the three most prominent Nigerian languages: Hausa, Yoruba, and Igbo. This research begins with a comprehensive compilation of annotated datasets for each language, addressing data scarcity and linguistic diversity challenges. Exploring the state-of-the-art machine learning technique, Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and deep learning models such as Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM), Bidirectional Encoder Representation from Transformers (Bert) and fine-tune with a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), the study evaluates the effectiveness of these approaches in recognizing three entities: persons, organizations, and locations. The system utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) technology to convert textual images into machine-readable text, thereby enabling the Wazobia system to accept both input text and textual images for extraction purposes. The system achieved a performance of 0.9511 in precision, 0.9400 in recall, 0.9564 in F1-score, and 0.9301 in accuracy. The model's evaluation was conducted across three languages, with precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy as key assessment metrics. The Wazobia-NER system demonstrates that it is feasible to build robust NER tools for under-resourced African languages using current NLP frameworks and transfer learning.</description>

      <title>Securing RAG: A Risk Assessment and Mitigation Framework</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.08728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) has emerged as the de facto industry standard for user-facing NLP applications, offering the ability to integrate data without re-training or fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs). This capability enhances the quality and accuracy of responses but also introduces novel security and privacy challenges, particularly when sensitive data is integrated. With the rapid adoption of RAG, securing data and services has become a critical priority. This paper first reviews the vulnerabilities of RAG pipelines, and outlines the attack surface from data pre-processing and data storage management to integration with LLMs. The identified risks are then paired with corresponding mitigations in a structured overview. In a second step, the paper develops a framework that combines RAG-specific security considerations, with existing general security guidelines, industry standards, and best practices. The proposed framework aims to guide the implementation of robust, compliant, secure, and trustworthy RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Task-level Distributionally Robust Optimization for Large Language Model-based Dense Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10613v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Model-based Dense Retrieval (LLM-DR) optimizes over numerous heterogeneous fine-tuning collections from different domains. However, the discussion about its training data distribution is still minimal. Previous studies rely on empirically assigned dataset choices or sampling ratios, which inevitably lead to sub-optimal retrieval performances. In this paper, we propose a new task-level Distributionally Robust Optimization (tDRO) algorithm for LLM-DR fine-tuning, targeted at improving the universal domain generalization ability by end-to-end reweighting the data distribution of each task. The tDRO parameterizes the domain weights and updates them with scaled domain gradients. The optimized weights are then transferred to the LLM-DR fine-tuning to train more robust retrievers. Experiments show optimal improvements in large-scale retrieval benchmarks and reduce up to 30% dataset usage after applying our optimization algorithm with a series of different-sized LLM-DR models.</description>

      <title>Towards Brain Passage Retrieval -- An Investigation of EEG Query Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06695v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Information Retrieval (IR) systems primarily rely on users' ability to translate their internal information needs into (text) queries. However, this translation process is often uncertain and cognitively demanding, leading to queries that incompletely or inaccurately represent users' true needs. This challenge is particularly acute for users with ill-defined information needs or physical impairments that limit traditional text input, where the gap between cognitive intent and query expression becomes even more pronounced. Recent neuroscientific studies have explored Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs) as a potential solution, aiming to bridge the gap between users' cognitive semantics and their search intentions. However, current approaches attempting to decode explicit text queries from brain signals have shown limited effectiveness in learning robust brain-to-text representations, often failing to capture the nuanced semantic information present in brain patterns. To address these limitations, we propose BPR (Brain Passage Retrieval), a novel framework that eliminates the need for intermediate query translation by enabling direct retrieval of relevant passages from users' brain signals. Our approach leverages dense retrieval architectures to map EEG signals and text passages into a shared semantic space. Through comprehensive experiments on the ZuCo dataset, we demonstrate that BPR achieves up to 8.81% improvement in precision@5 over existing EEG-to-text baselines, while maintaining effectiveness across 30 participants. Our ablation studies reveal the critical role of hard negative sampling and specialised brain encoders in achieving robust cross-modal alignment. These results establish the viability of direct brain-to-passage retrieval and provide a foundation for developing more natural interfaces between users' cognitive states and IR systems.</description>

      <title>FlippedRAG: Black-Box Opinion Manipulation Adversarial Attacks to Retrieval-Augmented Generation Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02968v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enriches LLMs by dynamically retrieving external knowledge, reducing hallucinations and satisfying real-time information needs. While existing research mainly targets RAG's performance and efficiency, emerging studies highlight critical security concerns. Yet, current adversarial approaches remain limited, mostly addressing white-box scenarios or heuristic black-box attacks without fully investigating vulnerabilities in the retrieval phase. Additionally, prior works mainly focus on factoid QA tasks, their attacks lack complexity and can be easily corrected by advanced LLMs. In this paper, we investigate a more realistic and critical threat scenario: adversarial attacks intended for opinion manipulation against black-box RAG models, particularly on controversial topics. Specifically, we propose FlippedRAG, a transfer-based adversarial attack against black-box RAG systems. We first demonstrate that the underlying retriever of a black-box RAG system can be reverse-engineered, enabling us to train a surrogate retriever. Leveraging the surrogate retriever, we further craft target poisoning triggers, altering vary few documents to effectively manipulate both retrieval and subsequent generation. Extensive empirical results show that FlippedRAG substantially outperforms baseline methods, improving the average attack success rate by 16.7%. FlippedRAG achieves on average a 50% directional shift in the opinion polarity of RAG-generated responses, ultimately causing a notable 20% shift in user cognition. Furthermore, we evaluate the performance of several potential defensive measures, concluding that existing mitigation strategies remain insufficient against such sophisticated manipulation attacks. These results highlight an urgent need for developing innovative defensive solutions to ensure the security and trustworthiness of RAG systems.</description>

      <title>Alleviating LLM-based Generative Retrieval Hallucination in Alipay Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21098v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generative retrieval (GR) has revolutionized document retrieval with the advent of large language models (LLMs), and LLM-based GR is gradually being adopted by the industry. Despite its remarkable advantages and potential, LLM-based GR suffers from hallucination and generates documents that are irrelevant to the query in some instances, severely challenging its credibility in practical applications. We thereby propose an optimized GR framework designed to alleviate retrieval hallucination, which integrates knowledge distillation reasoning in model training and incorporate decision agent to further improve retrieval precision. Specifically, we employ LLMs to assess and reason GR retrieved query-document (q-d) pairs, and then distill the reasoning data as transferred knowledge to the GR model. Moreover, we utilize a decision agent as post-processing to extend the GR retrieved documents through retrieval model and select the most relevant ones from multi perspectives as the final generative retrieval result. Extensive offline experiments on real-world datasets and online A/B tests on Fund Search and Insurance Search in Alipay demonstrate our framework's superiority and effectiveness in improving search quality and conversion gains.</description>

Abstract: Recommender systems have become an integral part of our daily online experience by analyzing past user behavior to suggest relevant content in entertainment domains such as music, movies, and books. Today, they are among the most widely used applications of AI and machine learning. Consequently, regulations and guidelines for trustworthy AI, such as the European AI Act, which addresses issues like bias and fairness, are highly relevant to the design, development, and evaluation of recommender systems. One particularly important type of bias in this context is popularity bias, which results in the unfair underrepresentation of less popular content in recommendation lists. This work summarizes our research on investigating the amplification of popularity bias in recommender systems within the entertainment sector. Analyzing datasets from three entertainment domains, music, movies, and anime, we demonstrate that an item's recommendation frequency is positively correlated with its popularity. As a result, user groups with little interest in popular content receive less accurate recommendations compared to those who prefer widely popular items. Furthermore, this work contributes to a better understanding of the connection between recommendation accuracy, calibration quality of algorithms, and popularity bias amplification.</description>

      <title>Exploring Generative AI Techniques in Government: A Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The swift progress of Generative Artificial intelligence (GenAI), notably Large Language Models (LLMs), is reshaping the digital landscape. Recognizing this transformative potential, the National Research Council of Canada (NRC) launched a pilot initiative to explore the integration of GenAI techniques into its daily operation for performance excellence, where 22 projects were launched in May 2024. Within these projects, this paper presents the development of the intelligent agent Pubbie as a case study, targeting the automation of performance measurement, data management and insight reporting at the NRC. Cutting-edge techniques are explored, including LLM orchestration and semantic embedding via RoBERTa, while strategic fine-tuning and few-shot learning approaches are incorporated to infuse domain knowledge at an affordable cost. The user-friendly interface of Pubbie allows general government users to input queries in natural language and easily upload or download files with a simple button click, greatly reducing manual efforts and accessibility barriers.</description>

      <title>Push and Pull: A Framework for Measuring Attentional Agency on Digital Platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14614v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for measuring attentional agency, which we define as a user's ability to allocate attention according to their own desires, goals, and intentions on digital platforms that use statistical learning to prioritize informational content. Such platforms extend people's limited powers of attention by extrapolating their preferences to large collections of previously unconsidered informational objects. However, platforms typically also allow users to influence the attention of other users in various ways. We introduce a formal framework for measuring how much a given platform empowers each user to both pull information into their own attention and push information into the attention of others. We also use these definitions to clarify the implications of generative foundation models and other recent advances in AI for the structure and efficiency of digital platforms. We conclude with a set of possible strategies for better understanding and reshaping attentional agency online.</description>

      <title>Clinically inspired enhance Explainability and Interpretability of an AI-Tool for BCC diagnosis based on expert annotation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00104v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An AI tool has been developed to provide interpretable support for the diagnosis of BCC via teledermatology, thus speeding up referrals and optimizing resource utilization. The interpretability is provided in two ways: on the one hand, the main BCC dermoscopic patterns are found in the image to justify the BCC/Non BCC classification. Secondly, based on the common visual XAI Grad-CAM, a clinically inspired visual explanation is developed where the relevant features for diagnosis are located. Since there is no established ground truth for BCC dermoscopic features, a standard reference is inferred from the diagnosis of four dermatologists using an Expectation Maximization (EM) based algorithm. The results demonstrate significant improvements in classification accuracy and interpretability, positioning this approach as a valuable tool for early BCC detection and referral to dermatologists. The BCC/non-BCC classification achieved an accuracy rate of 90%. For Clinically-inspired XAI results, the detection of BCC patterns useful to clinicians reaches 99% accuracy. As for the Clinically-inspired Visual XAI results, the mean of the Grad-CAM normalized value within the manually segmented clinical features is 0.57, while outside this region it is 0.16. This indicates that the model struggles to accurately identify the regions of the BCC patterns. These results prove the ability of the AI tool to provide a useful explanation.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Integrated Layered Attention (AILA)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose Adaptive Integrated Layered Attention (AILA), a neural network architecture that combines dense skip connections with different mechanisms for adaptive feature reuse across network layers. We evaluate AILA on three challenging tasks: price forecasting for various commodities and indices (S&amp;P 500, Gold, US dollar Futures, Coffee, Wheat), image recognition using the CIFAR-10 dataset, and sentiment analysis on the IMDB movie review dataset. In all cases, AILA matches strong deep learning baselines (LSTMs, Transformers, and ResNets), achieving it at a fraction of the training and inference time. Notably, we implement and test two versions of the model - AILA-Architecture 1, which uses simple linear layers as the connection mechanism between layers, and AILA-Architecture 2, which implements an attention mechanism to selectively focus on outputs from previous layers. Both architectures are applied in a single-task learning setting, with each model trained separately for individual tasks. Results confirm that AILA's adaptive inter-layer connections yield robust gains by flexibly reusing pertinent features at multiple network depths. The AILA approach thus presents an extension to existing architectures, improving long-range sequence modeling, image recognition with optimised computational speed, and SOTA classification performance in practice.</description>

      <title>Graph RAG for Legal Norms: A Hierarchical and Temporal Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00039v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article proposes an adaptation of Graph Retrieval Augmented Generation (Graph RAG) specifically designed for the analysis and comprehension of legal norms, which are characterized by their predefined hierarchical structure, extensive network of internal and external references and multiple temporal versions. By combining structured knowledge graphs with contextually enriched text segments, Graph RAG offers a promising solution to address the inherent complexity and vast volume of legal data. The integration of hierarchical structure and temporal evolution into knowledge graphs - along with the concept of comprehensive Text Units - facilitates the construction of richer, interconnected representations of legal knowledge. Through a detailed analysis of Graph RAG and its application to legal norm datasets, this article aims to advance the field of Artificial Intelligence applied to Law, creating opportunities for more effective systems in legal research, legislative analysis, and decision support.</description>

      <title>From raw affiliations to organization identifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07577v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate affiliation matching, which links affiliation strings to standardized organization identifiers, is critical for improving research metadata quality, facilitating comprehensive bibliometric analyses, and supporting data interoperability across scholarly knowledge bases. Existing approaches fail to handle the complexity of affiliation strings that often include mentions of multiple organizations or extraneous information. In this paper, we present AffRo, a novel approach designed to address these challenges, leveraging advanced parsing and disambiguation techniques. We also introduce AffRoDB, an expert-curated dataset to systematically evaluate affiliation matching algorithms, ensuring robust benchmarking. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of AffRp in accurately identifying organizations from complex affiliation strings.</description>
