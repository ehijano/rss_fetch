      <title>Interplay between inversion and translation symmetries in trigonal PtBi$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The trigonal Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$ presents an intriguing superconducting phase, previously reported to be confined to its topological Fermi arcs within a certain temperature range. This observation highlights the importance of a thorough understanding of its normal phase, particularly the roles that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and inversion-symmetry breaking play in shaping its band structure. Our density-functional theory calculations reveal that the semimetallic nature of trigonal PtBi$_2$ can be interpreted as stemming from a noncentrosymmetric crystal distortion of a parent structure, that drives a metal to semimetal transition. This distortion breaks inversion symmetry and, crucially, reduces translational symmetry. Due to its interplay with translational symmetry, inversion-symmetry breaking emerges as the dominant energy scale producing substantial asymmetries ($\sim$ 0.6\,eV) in certain short-range hopping amplitudes, superseding the effects of SOC, whose primary role is to define the characteristics of the low-energy nodal structure. This also applies to the formation of the Weyl nodes closest to the Fermi energy, which are found to exist even in the absence of SOC as a result of the orbital physics associated with the reduced translational symmetry.</description>

      <title>Enhanced superconductivity in LaRu3Si2 by chemical pressure tuning of kagome flat bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In kagome metals, flat bands induced by frustrated hopping serve as a platform for strong electronic correlation, while often exhibiting substantial dispersion along the $k_z$ direction due to interlayer coupling. Here, we investigate the superconductivity of the kagome metal LaRu$_3$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ by chemical pressure tuning while preserving the Ru-$4d$ states that constitute the kagome flat bands. We observe a sizable enhancement in the density of states up to $x = 0.07$, as determined by the specific heat, with a concomitant increase in the superconducting transition temperature. As supported by our first-principles calculations, the lattice expansion along the $c$-axis by chemical pressure mitigates a detrimental effect of hybridization between kagome layers, thereby reinforcing the three-dimensional localization of flat-band electrons. Providing evidence for LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ as a flat-band hosting superconductor, we demonstrate a simple, yet effective, route to engineer flat bands by uniaxial lattice expansion.</description>

      <title>Revealing the loss mechanisms of a 3D superconducting microwave cavity for use in a dark matter search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconducting microwave cavities have found applications in many areas including quantum computing, particle accelerators, and dark matter searches. Their extremely high quality factors translate to very narrow bandwidth, which makes them key components of sensitive detectors. In this study, we aim to understand the loss mechanisms of an aluminium cavity and how they change as the cavity material transitions from the superconducting to normal state. We found that at temperatures not much lower than the transition temperature $T_c$, losses are dominated by quasiparticle excitations and are well described by the BCS theory. The exponential decrease of the quasiparticle density below $T_c$ results in a 1000-fold increase of the quality factor, as well as a shift of the resonance frequency due to the change of the kinetic inductance of the superconductor. At very low temperatures, losses due to two-level systems begin to dominate giving a peak in the quality factor of about 27.6 million at 130 mK. Understanding the loss mechanisms is invaluable, as the working temperature of the cavity may vary during operation regardless of its application.</description>

      <title>Phase-Coherent Dynamics in Intervalley Coherent States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron transport driven by the phase coherence and interference of quantum many-body wavefunctions is a fascinating phenomenon with potential technological significance. Superconductivity, for example, enables dissipationless transport through macroscopic phase twisting. Similarly, in charge-density waves, once the phase degree of freedom-representing the collective position of electrons relative to the lattice-is depinned, it generates characteristic broadband noise and intriguing AC-DC interference patterns. In this work, we point out a phase-coherent transport phenomena in the intervalley coherent (IVC) state, also known as the bond-ordered or Kekule distorted state, frequently reported in rhombohedral multilayer graphene. Under a static magnetic field, the IVC state responds with an oscillating orbital magnetization, inducing an AC Hall effect similar to the AC Josephson effect in superconductors. In this analogy, the magnetic field acts as the DC voltage, while the oscillating magnetization acts as the AC Josephson current. We present detailed microscopic calculations for all the parameters of the phase-number free-energy in rhombohedral trilayer graphene, predicting an oscillation frequency of approximately 12 GHz at 0.1 Tesla. We comment on this phase-coherent transport in twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides, where the IVC state has been theoretically proposed.</description>

      <title>Ground states of quasi-two-dimensional correlated systems via energy expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22014v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a generic method for computing groundstates that is applicable to a wide range of spatially anisotropic 2D many-body quantum systems. By representing the 2D system using a low-energy 1D basis set, we obtain an effective 1D Hamiltonian that only has quasi-local interactions, at the price of a large local Hilbert space. We apply our new method to three specific 2D systems of weakly coupled chains: hardcore bosons, a spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg Hamiltonian, and spinful fermions with repulsive interactions. In particular, we showcase a non-trivial application of the energy expansion framework, to the anisotropic triangular Heisenberg lattice, a highly challenging model related to 2D spin liquids. Treating lattices of unprecedented size, we provide evidence for the existence of a quasi-1D gapless spin liquid state in this system. We also demonstrate the energy expansion-framework to perform well where external validation is possible. For the fermionic benchmark in particular, we showcase the energy expansion-framework's ability to provide results of comparable quality at a small fraction of the resources required for previous computational efforts.</description>

      <title>Toward single-photon detection with superconducting niobium diselenide nanowires</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on few-layer NbSe$_2$ fully encapsulated with hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), demonstrating single-photon sensitivity. Our fabrication process preserves the superconducting properties of NbSe$_2$ in nanowires, as confirmed by low-temperature transport measurements that show a critical temperature of $T_c \approx 6.5$ K, comparable to the reported values for unpatterned sheets, and it maintains a contact resistance of $\sim 50 \, \Omega$ at $T = 4$ K. Meandered NbSe$_2$ nanowires exhibit a responsivity of up to $4.9 \times 10^4$ V/W over a spectral range of 650-1550 nm in a closed-cycle cryostat at 4 K, outperforming planar and short-wire devices. The devices achieve a $1/e$ recovery time of $\tau = (135 \pm 36)$ ns, system timing jitter of $j_\text{sys} = (1103 \pm 7)$ ps, and detection efficiency of $\sim 0.01\%$ at $0.95I_c$, with a linear increase in detection probability confirming the single-photon operation. Furthermore, measurements under attenuated pulsed laser (1 MHz) indicate a success rate of up to $33\%$ in detecting individual optical pulses, establishing the platform as a promising candidate for developing efficient single-photon detectors.</description>

      <title>Majorana Flat Bands in the Vortex Line of Superconducting Weyl Semimetals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the emergence of Majorana flat bands (MFBs) in the vortex line of superconducting (SC) time-reversal-symmetry-breaking Weyl semimetals. By considering a Weyl semimetal as a stack of Chern insulators with varying Chern numbers along one ($z$) direction, we decompose the vortex bound states of SC Weyl semimetals into those of $k_{z}$-resolved SC Chern insulators. Through analytical and numerical calculations of the topological phase diagram of the SC Chern insulators, we explain the appearance of MFBs and determine the exact boundaries of them. Notably, the tuning of chemical potential or pairing strength results in the MFBs along the entire $k_{z}$ axis. To characterize the MFBs, we propose a $k_{z}$-resolved $Z_{2}$ Chern-Simons invariant as the topological indicator. Finally, we take an attractive Hubbard interaction into consideration, and the aforementioned SC Weyl semimetal with BCS pairing can be realized under appropriate parameters.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of superconductivity on thin film of Sn under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigated the pressure effects of a superconductivity on thin films of Sn. Elemental superconductor Sn with a body-centered tetragonal structure, $\beta$-Sn, exhibits superconductivity below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}=3.72$ K) at ambient pressure. $T_{\rm c}$ of Sn increases with lowering dimension such as in thin film and nanowire growth, or by high-pressure application. For thin films, $T_{\rm c}$ exhibits a slight increase up to approximately 4 K compared to the bulk value, attributable to the crystalline size and lattice disorder. By applying pressure on a bulk Sn, $T_{\rm c}$ initially decreases from 3.72 K as the pressure increases. Further increasing pressure up to 10 GPa, $T_{\rm c}$ increases to 5.3 K with the structural transformation. However, the combination of these effects on thin films of Sn, namely, thin-film growth and pressure effects, remains underexplored. In this study, we combined film-growth and pressure-application techniques to further increase $T_{\rm c}$ using a diamond anvil cell with boron-doped diamond electrodes. The drop of the electrical resistance suggesting the onset of $T_{\rm c}$ on the thin film reached above 6 K in $\gamma$-Sn phase. Further, the upper critical magnetic field was drastically enhanced. Atomic force microscopy suggests that the refinement of the grain size of the thin film under the non-hydrostatic pressure conditions contributes to stabilizing the higher $T_{\rm c}$ of $\gamma$-Sn.</description>

      <title>Electron pairing by dispersive phonons in altermagnets: re-entrant superconductivity and continuous transition to finite momentum superconducting state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18323v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider an altermagnet subject to the electron attractive potential mediated by the dispersive phonons. While altermagnetism suppresses superconductivity, scattering of electrons on the Fermi surface by thermal phonons suppresses altermagnetism. We show that this leads to the re-entrant superconductivity over temperature and to the stabilization of the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) finite momentum superconducting state at low temperatures. The effect is mediated by the retardation effects and no d-wave pairing interaction is required.</description>
