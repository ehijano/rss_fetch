      <title>Optimizing HERON for 100 PeV Neutrino Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Hybrid Elevated Radio Observatory for Neutrinos (HERON) is designed to target the astrophysical flux of Earth-skimming tau neutrinos at 100 PeV. HERON consists of multiple compact, phased radio arrays embedded within a larger sparse array of antennas, located on the side of a mountain. This hybrid design provides both excellent sensitivity and a sub-degree pointing resolution. To design HERON, a suite of simulations accounting for tau propagation, shower development, radio emission, and antenna response were used. These simulations were used to discover the array layout which provides maximum sensitivity at 100 PeV, as well to select the optimal antenna design. Additionally, the event reconstruction accuracy has been tested for various designs of the sparse array via simulated interferometry. Here, we present the HERON simulation procedure and its results.</description>

      <title>SCALES-DRP : A Data Reduction Pipeline for an Upcoming Keck Thermal Infrared Spectrograph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the end-to-end data reduction pipeline for SCALES (Slicer Combined with Array of Lenslets for Exoplanet Spectroscopy), the upcoming thermal-infrared, diffraction-limited imager, and low and medium-resolution integral field spectrograph (IFS) for the Keck II telescope. The pipeline constructs a ramp from a set of reads and performs optimal extraction and chi-square extraction to reconstruct the 3D IFS datacube. To perform spectral extraction, wavelength calibration, and sky subtraction, the pipeline utilizes rectification matrices produced using position-dependent lenslet point spread functions (PSFs) derived from calibration exposures. The extracted 3D data cubes provide intensity values along with their corresponding uncertainties for each spatial and spectral measurement. The SCALES pipeline is under active development, implemented in Python within the Keck data reduction framework, and is openly available on GitHub along with dedicated documentation.</description>

      <title>The optical calibration system for the CTAO North Large Sized Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2018, the first prototype of the optical calibration system was installed in the Large Sized Telescopes, LST-1 at the Observatorio del Roque de los Muchachos, ORM, in La Palma, Canary Islands. We have almost completed the construction of the three remaining ones that will be mounted by 2026 on LST-2-3-4. The main feature of this system is to ensure a stable and constant photon flux over time with the characteristics of a signal produced by Cherenkov light when a high-energy gamma ray crosses the atmosphere. Test results that show the performance of the optical calibration system have been recently published. In this article, we present in detail the system used to monitor the photon flux.</description>

      <title>Detecting milli-Hz gravitational waves with optical resonators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15841v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a gravitational wave detector based on ultrastable optical cavities enabling the detection of gravitational wave signals in the mostly unexplored $10^{-5}-1$ Hz frequency band. We illustrate the working principle of the detector and discuss that several classes of gravitational wave sources, both of astrophysical and cosmological origin, may be within the detection range of this instrument. Our work suggests that terrestrial gravitational wave detection in the milli-Hz frequency range is potentially within reach with current technology.</description>

      <title>The new architecture design of the Science Alert Generation pipeline of the Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cherenkov Telescope Array Observatory (CTAO) represents the next-generation gamma-ray observatory and will operate for several decades. It will be particularly suited to analyse transients and variable phenomena, which will trigger real-time scientific alerts. To support this, the Science Alert Generation (SAG) pipeline within the Array Control and Data Acquisition (ACADA) system will process data from telescope arrays in real time, using dedicated pipelines for data reconstruction (SAG-RECO), data quality monitoring (SAG-DQ) and science monitoring (SAG-SCI). The Supervisor (SAG-SUP) oversees the dynamic operations of SAG and its integration with other ACADA components. SAG is designed to issue candidate science alerts within 20 s of data availability, processing events on multiple time scales (seconds to hours) and handling trigger rates of tens of kHz. Meeting these requirements necessitates optimised software and hardware architectures. This work presents recent developments in SAG's architecture, aimed at two main challenges: (1) selecting data only from telescopes that have entered a stable tracking state, even when they begin tracking at different times during multi-telescope observations, and (2) incorporating environmental and system monitoring information to ensure high data quality. SAG-SUP can retrieve real-time telescope status and environmental conditions from telescope managers and the weather station through the ACADA Monitoring system, collect them in a database and then use them to filter out data from slewing phases or degraded conditions. These enhancements are crucial to ensure the reliability of science alerts and improve the overall performance and responsiveness of the CTAO real-time analysis framework.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Speedmeter and Position-Meter Response in a Single Tabletop Interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15285v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum radiation-pressure noise (QRPN) limits the low-frequency sensitivity of gravitational wave detectors. The established method for suppressing QRPN is the injection of frequency-dependent squeezed light. It requires long-baseline filter cavities introducing substantial experimental complexity. A completely different interferometer concept is the speedmeter. It avoids QRPN at the source by measuring test mass speed instead of position. While extensively researched theoretically, speedmeters are yet to be demonstrated with a moving test mass in an optomechanical setting. In this work, we present the first experimental observation of speedmeter behavior in a system with a movable test mass. We realize a novel hybrid readout cavity configuration that enables simultaneous extraction of position and speed signals from two distinct output ports. We compare the optical transfer functions associated with each channel and observe the expected scaling behavior that distinguishes a speedmeter from a position-meter. We support our observations with a detailed theoretical model, showing how the hybrid readout cavity implements key speedmeter features. Our results underscore the relevance of the speedmeter concept as an alternative for mitigating QRPN in future detectors and lay the groundwork for further experimental exploration.</description>

      <title>Complete Sampling of the $uv$ Plane with Realistic Radio Arrays: Introducing the RULES Algorithm, with Application to 21 cm Foreground Wedge Removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15296v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the Radio-array $uv$ Layout Engineering Strategy (RULES), an algorithm for designing radio arrays that achieve complete coverage of the $uv$ plane, defined as, at minimum, regular sampling at half the observing wavelength ($\lambda$) along the $u$ and $v$ axes within a specified range of baseline lengths. Using RULES, we generate $uv$-complete layouts that cover the range $10\lambda\leq|(u,v)|\leq 100\lambda$ with fewer than 1000 antennas of diameter $5\lambda$, comparable to current and planned arrays. We demonstrate the effectiveness of such arrays for mitigating contamination from bright astrophysical foregrounds in 21 cm Epoch of Reionization observations,particularly in the region of Fourier space known as the foreground wedge,by simulating visibilities of foreground-like sky models over the 130-150 MHz band and processing them through an image-based power spectrum estimator. We find that with complete $uv$ coverage, the wedge power is suppressed by sixteen orders of magnitude compared to an array with a compact hexagonal layout (used as a reference for a sparse $uv$ coverage). In contrast, we show that an array with the same number of antennas but in a random configuration only suppresses the wedge by three orders of magnitude, despite sampling more distinct $uv$ points over the same range. We address real-world challenges and find that our results are sensitive to small antenna position errors and missing baselines, while still performing equally or significantly better than random arrays in any case. We propose ways to mitigate those challenges such as a minimum redundancy requirement or tighter $uv$ packing density.</description>

      <title>Astrometric exomoon detection by means of optical interferometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: With no conclusive detection to date, the search for exomoons, satellites of planets orbiting other stars, remains a formidable challenge. Detecting these objects, compiling a population-level sample and constraining their occurrence will inform planet and moon formation models and shed light on moon habitability. Aims: Here, we demonstrate the possibility of a moon search based on astrometric time series data, repeated measurements of the position of a given planet relative to its host star. The perturbing influence of an orbiting moon induces a potentially detectable planetary reflex motion. Methods: Based on an analytical description of the astrometric signal amplitude, we place the expected signatures of putative moons around real exoplanets into context with our current and future astrometric measurement precision. Modelling the orbital perturbation as a function of time, we then simulate the detection process to obtain the first astrometric exomoon sensitivity curves. Results: The astrometric technique already allows for the detection and characterisation of favourable moons around giant exoplanets and brown dwarfs. On the basis of 12 epochs obtained with VLTI/GRAVITY, it is already today possible to infer the presence of a 0.14 $\mathrm{M}_\mathrm{Jup}$ satellite at a separation of 0.39 AU around AF Lep b. Future facilities offering better precision will refine our sensitivity in both moon mass and separation from the host planet by several orders of magnitude. Conclusions: The astrometric method of exomoon detection provides a promising avenue towards making the detection of these elusive worlds a reality and efficiently building a sample of confirmed objects. With a future facility that achieves an astrometric precision of 1 mas, probing for Earth-like moons within the habitable zone of a given star will become a realistic proposition.</description>

      <title>Untapped: Veloce Detects Calcium in the Atmosphere of WASP-189b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution transmission spectroscopy has become a powerful tool for detecting atomic and ionic species in the atmospheres of ultra-hot Jupiters. In this study, we demonstrate for the first time that the Australian-built Veloce spectrograph on the 3.9-m Anglo-Australian Telescope can resolve atmospheric signatures from transiting exoplanets. We observed a single transit of the ultra-hot Jupiter WASP-189b - a favourable target given its extreme irradiation and bright host star - and applied the cross-correlation technique using standardised templates. We robustly detect ionised calcium (Ca+), and find evidence for hydrogen (H), sodium (Na), magnesium (Mg), neutral calcium (Ca), titanium (Ti), ionised titanium (Ti+), ionised iron (Fe+), neutral iron (Fe), and ionised strontium (Sr+). The strongest detection was achieved in the red arm of Veloce, consistent with expectations due to the prominent Ca+ triplet at wavelengths around 850-870 nm. Our results validate Veloce's capability for high-resolution atmospheric studies, highlighting it as an accessible, flexible facility to complement larger international telescopes. If future observations stack multiple transits, Veloce has the potential to reveal atmospheric variability, phase-dependent spectral changes, and detailed chemical compositions of highly irradiated exoplanets.</description>

      <title>The Importance of Standardizing Spectra in the Era of Large Spectroscopic Surveys: A Case Study of M Dwarfs in SDSS-V</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: SDSS-V will obtain 100,000s of medium-resolution, optical spectra of M dwarfs with the BOSS instrument. M dwarfs have complex atmospheres, and their spectra contain many wide and dense, overlapping molecular features, so determining accurate stellar parameters by fitting models has been difficult. To circumvent this, other surveys have employed machine learning methods to transfer measurements of stellar parameters from high-resolution spectra to their medium-resolution counterparts. These methods provide large catalogs of stellar parameters but, if not addressed properly, are plagued by biases which are, in part, due to the normalization of the spectra. Typical spectral normalization removes the continuum but preserves the relative depths of the absorption features, but optical M dwarf spectra are almost entirely made up of molecular absorption, which makes this difficult. Here, we develop a standardization method that instead defines a pseudo-continuum. We use the spectrum's alpha shape to find the points which lie between the absorption features and apply local polynomial regression to find this pseudo-continuum. To tune the hyperparameters of this method, we create BOSS-like spectra from BT-NextGen models to replicate instrumental, signal-to-noise, and reddening effects. We find that in both this generated set and a validation set of the SDSS-V data, our method performs better than alternative standardizations by producing spectra that are both more uniform for M dwarfs with similar stellar parameters and more easily distinguished compared to M dwarfs of differing parameters. These results from our method will be crucial for better determining stellar parameters of M dwarfs using generative models.</description>

      <title>Potential for Lunar Interior Science by the Gravitational-Wave Detector LILA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15452v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Laser Interferometer Lunar Antenna (LILA), a concept for measuring sub-Hz gravitational waves on the Moon, would use laser strainmeters to obtain extremely sensitive strain measurements from 1 mHz to 1 Hz. With proposed strain sensitivities, LILA would also be able to measure the normal modes of the Moon from 1-10 mHz at high signal-to-noise ratio. Such measurements would enable significant advances in our understanding of both the spherically symmetric and even 3D deep internal structure of the Moon. Strainmeter measurements may even be able to detect the translational mode of the solid inner core of the Moon at frequencies below 0.1 mHz. Inertial seismometers, on the other hand, are unlikely to reach the performance of $\sim10^{-16}$ m/s$^2$/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ required to reliably detect normal modes below 5-10 mHz, even with optimistic assumptions on future projected performance.</description>

      <title>CosmoGen: a cosmological model generator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15453v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The standard $\Lambda$CDM paradigm of the physical Universe suffers from well-known conceptual problems and is challenged by observational data. Alternative models exist in the literature, both phenomenological and physically motivated, many of them suffering from similar or new problems. We propose a method to mechanically generate alternative models in a procedure informed by data and tuned to mitigate specific problems. We implement a computational framework, dubbed CosmoGen, that integrates evolutionary algorithms for symbolic regression, with computation of structure formation and background cosmological quantities that are used to guide the evolutionary process. As a proof-of-concept we apply the procedure to the specific case of dark energy fluid models, and ask the framework to generate models capable of alleviating the cosmological tensions $S_8$ and $H_0$. The system generates models with high fitness values, and through a Bayesian analysis of an illustrative model, we show that the model indeed alleviates the tensions.</description>

      <title>$\nu$SpaceSim: A Comprehensive Simulation Package for Modeling the Measurement of Cosmic Neutrinos using the Earth as the Neutrino Target and Space-based Detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15469v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: $\nu$SpaceSim is a highly-efficient (e.g., fast) module-based, end-to-end simulation package that models the physical processes of cosmic neutrino interactions that leads to detectable signals for sub-orbital and space-based instruments. Starting with an input flux of neutrinos incident on a user-specified geometry in the Earth, the flux of Earth-emergent leptons are calculated followed by their subsequent extensive air showers (EAS). Next, the EAS optical Cherenkov and radio emission, signal attenuation to the detector, and the detector response are modeled to determine the sensitivity to both the diffuse cosmic neutrinos and transient neutrino sources. Using the Earth as a tau neutrino target and the atmosphere as the signal generator effectively forms a detector with a mega-gigaton mass. Furthermore, \taon decays and neutrino neutral-current interactions within the Earth (re)generates a flux of lower energy tau neutrinos that can also interact in the Earth thus enhancing the detection probability. $\nu$SpaceSim provides a tool to both understand the data from recent experiments such as EUSO-SPB2 as well as design/understand the performance the next generation of balloon- and space-based experiments, including POEMMA Balloon with Radio (PBR) and the Payload for Ultrahigh Energy Observations (PUEO). In this paper the $\nu$SpaceSim software, physics modeling, and the cosmic neutrino measurement capabilities of example sub-orbital and space-based experimental configurations are presented as well as status of planned modeling upgrades.</description>

      <title>Spatially non-parametric recovery of intrinsic kinematic maps in pre- to post-merger galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an adaptable kinematic modelling tool called ROHSA-SNAPD, "Spatially Non-parametric Approach to PSF Deconvolution using ROHSA". ROHSA-SNAPD utilises kinematic regularisation to forward model the intrinsic emission-line flux and kinematics (velocity and linewidth) of 3D data cubes. Kinematic regularisation removes the need to assume an underlying rotation model (eg. exponential disc, tilted-ring) to deconvolve kinematic data. We evaluate the code on mock observations of simulated galaxies: one idealised disc model and three more complex galaxies from a cosmological simulation with varying levels of kinematic disturbance, from pre-merger to post-merger state. The mock observations are designed to approximate published results at $z\sim 1-2$ from 8-metre class near-infrared spectroscopic facilities, using realistic observational parameters including spatial and spectral resolution, noise and point spread function. We demonstrate that ROHSA-SNAPD can effectively recover the intrinsic kinematics of complex systems whilst accounting for observational effects. ROHSA-SNAPD is publicly released on Github.</description>

Abstract: The Southern Hemisphere Asteroid Research Project is an active and informal entity comprising the University of New South Wales, the University of Tasmania, the University of Western Australia, and the Curtin University, which performs asteroid research in collaboration with federal agencies, including the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (JPL). Since 2015, we have used the Australian infrastructure to characterize more than 50 near-Earth asteroids through bistatic radar observations. On 29 June 2024, we used four very long baseline interferometer (VLBI) radio telescopes to follow the close approach of 2024 MK to the Earth. In this paper, we describe the detections and the analysis of VLBI and howthese observations can help to improve the understanding of its composition and orbit characterization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Undergraduate research in STEM can be a transformative experience, especially for Community College students, many of whom come from under-represented backgrounds. However, undergraduate research at Community Colleges is relatively rare, due in part to their focus on teaching excellence. Research partnerships with four year colleges about exciting and accessible science topics, facilitated by researchers such as postdoctoral fellows, can be a powerful path forward. We describe our program, the Dead Stars Society (DSS), as a successful example of such a research partnership, focused on the topic of observational astronomy, specifically stellar science with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, and X-ray astronomy with Chandra, NICER and NuSTAR.</description>

      <title>Simulating radio emission from extensive air showers with CORSIKA 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: CORSIKA 8 is a modern, flexible framework for simulating particle cascades in air and dense media, allowing for fully customizable shower simulations. The radio module autonomously handles electric field calculations and propagation to observer locations. It supports simultaneous simulations with both the ``Endpoint formalism'' as implemented in CoREAS and the ``ZHS'' algorithm from ZHAireS. In this contribution, we validate the radio module by comparing air-shower simulations in CORSIKA 8, CORSIKA 7, and ZHAireS. We investigate the impact of simulation parameters, such as the step size of particle tracks, on the resulting radio signals and perform a detailed comparison of the ``Endpoints'' and ``ZHS'' formalisms. For the same underlying showers simulated with CORSIKA 8 with optimized step sizes, both formalisms converge to the same radiation energy within 2%. For CORSIKA 8 and CORSIKA 7, agreement on the radiation energy is better than 10% in the 30-80 MHz band and improves to better than 2% for 50-350 MHz. This consistency provides further confirmation of the accuracy of microscopic air-shower radio emission simulations which is crucial for precise energy scale estimations using radio detection.</description>

      <title>ExoIris: fast exoplanet transmission spectroscopy in Python</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I present ExoIris, a user-friendly Python package for exoplanet transmission and emission spectroscopy. Unlike existing tools, ExoIris models two-dimensional spectrophotometric transit time series directly and supports the joint analysis of multiple datasets obtained with different instruments and at different epochs. These features enable a self-consistent estimation of both wavelength-independent and wavelength-dependent parameters. They offer a more robust workflow compared to the commonly used two-step approach, where a "white" light curve is fitted first and the transmission spectrum is then derived from independent fits constrained by the white-light solution. Despite its increased flexibility and robustness, ExoIris remains computationally efficient. A low-resolution transmission spectrum can be estimated from a single JWST NIRISS transit observation in ~5 minutes assuming white noise, and in ~15 minutes when accounting for time-correlated systematics using a Gaussian process noise model, on a standard desktop computer.</description>

      <title>A New Way to Discover Strong Gravitational Lenses: Pair-wise Spectroscopic Search from DESI DR1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new method to search for strong gravitational lensing systems by pairing spectra that are close together on the sky in a spectroscopic survey. We visually inspect 26,621 spectra in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1 that are selected in this way. We further inspect the 11,848 images corresponding to these spectra in the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys Data Release 10, and obtain 2046 conventional strong gravitational lens candidates, of which 1906 are new. This constitutes the largest sample of lens candidates identified to date in spectroscopic data. Besides the conventional candidates, we identify a new class of systems that we term "dimple lenses". These systems have a low-mass foreground galaxy as a lens, typically smaller in angular extent and fainter compared with the lensed background source galaxy, producing subtle surface brightness indentations in the latter. We report the discovery of 318 of these "dimple-lens" candidates. We suspect that these represent dwarf galaxy lensing. With follow-up observations, they could offer a new avenue to test the cold dark matter model by probing their mass profiles, stellar mass-halo mass relation, and halo mass function for $M_{\textrm{Halo}} \lesssim 10^{13}\,M_\odot$. Thus, in total, we report 2164 new lens candidates. Our method demonstrates the power of pairwise spectroscopic analysis and provides a pathway complementary to imaging-based and single-spectrum lens searches.</description>

      <title>Binary-lens Microlensing Degeneracy: Impact on Planetary Sensitivity and Mass-ratio Function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16191v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational microlensing is a unique method for discovering cold planets across a broad mass range. Reliable statistics of the microlensing planets require accurate sensitivity estimates. However, the impact of the degeneracies in binary-lens single-source (2L1S) models that affect many actual planet detections is often omitted in sensitivity estimates, leading to potential self-inconsistency of the statistics studies. In this work, we evaluate the effect of the 2L1S degeneracies on planetary sensitivity by simulating a series of typical microlensing events and comprehensively replicating a realistic planet detection pipeline, including the anomaly identification, global 2L1S model search, and degenerate model comparison. We find that for a pure-survey statistical sample, the 2L1S degeneracies reduce the overall planetary sensitivity by $5\sim10\%$, with the effect increasing at higher planet-host mass ratios. This bias leads to an underestimation of planet occurrence rates and a flattening of the inferred mass-ratio function slope. This effect will be critical for upcoming space-based microlensing surveys like the Roman or Earth 2.0 missions, which are expected to discover $\mathcal{O}(10^3)$ planets. We also discuss the computational challenges and propose potential approaches for future applications.</description>

      <title>Determination of the energy scale of cosmic ray measurements using the Auger Engineering Radio Array</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.08500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate determination of the absolute energy scale in cosmic ray measurements is both a challenging and fundamentally important task. We present how measurements of radio pulses from extensive air showers with the Auger Engineering Radio Array, combined with per-event simulations of radio emission using the CoREAS extension of CORSIKA, allow us to determine the energy scale of cosmic rays between $3\cdot 10^{17}$\,eV and several $10^{18}$\,eV. Our analysis accounts for many factors, each of which is controlled on the 5\% level or better. The absolute calibration of the antennas and the entire analog signal chain builds on a Galactic calibration in combination with a detailed understanding of the antenna-gain patterns. Additional key elements include compensation for temperature-dependent signal amplification, continuous detector health monitoring, an active veto for thunderstorm conditions, an unbiased event reconstruction, and per-event atmospheric modeling in the simulations. The analysis benefits from a high-statistics dataset of over 800 measured cosmic ray showers. We describe our analysis method, perform multiple cross-checks, and evaluate systematic uncertainties. We find that absolute energies determined with AERA are 12\% higher than those established with the Auger Fluorescence Detector, a result well in agreement within systematic uncertainties and thus a strong independent confirmation of the absolute energy scale of the Pierre Auger Observatory.</description>

      <title>Who Uses Whose Telescopes? Analyzing the Knowledge Geography and Research Dominance of Global Astronomical Facilities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12551v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large-scale research infrastructures (LSRIs) are central to contemporary science policy, combining massive capital investments with international access regimes. Yet whether open access to these infrastructures translates into more equitable scientific authority remains contested. Astronomy provides a critical case: world-leading observatories are globally shared but embedded in specific national contexts. We compile a novel country--year dataset (1955--2025) linking the location of astronomical facilities with publication usage and authorship roles. This enables us to distinguish between hosting, using, and leading in telescope-based research. Our analysis reveals: (i) usage and impact are heavily concentrated in a small number of facility hubs; (ii) scientific leadership is even more unequal than access or usage (Gini coefficient 0.91 for first/corresponding authorship versus 0.85 for facilities and usage); (iii) hosting and leadership often decouple--countries such as Chile and South Africa mediate large publication volumes without commensurate gains in leading roles; and (iv) global leadership has shifted from U.S. dominance to a multi-hub system centered in the United States, Western Europe, China, Japan, and Australia. These findings challenge the assumption that international access alone democratizes science. We argue that converting participation into leadership requires domestic PI programs, investments in instrumentation and data pipelines, and governance models that distribute credit more equitably. The study highlights how the governance of LSRIs shapes global scientific hierarchies and offers design principles for infrastructures that seek not only to share data but also to broaden scientific authority.</description>

      <title>Continuum, CO and Water vapour maps of the Orion Nebula. First millimetre spectral imaging with Concerto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20487v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The millimetre spectrum of Galactic regions and galaxies is rich in continuum and molecular lines. This diversity is mostly explored using either broad-band photometry or high-resolution heterodyne spectroscopy. We aim to map the millimetre continuum emission of Galactic regions with an intermediate spectral resolution between broad-band photometry and heterodyne spectroscopy, enabling us to rapidly cover large sky areas with spectroscopy. We report observations of the Orion Nebula with the CONCERTO instrument, which was installed at the APEX telescope focal plane from 2021 to 2023. We find that the spectrum of Orion is dominated by dust emission with an emissivity index ranging between 1.3 and 2.0, along with strong CO(2-1) and H$_2$O lines, which are naturally separated from the continuum due to the CONCERTO spectral capabilities. Many regions also show strong free-free emission at lower frequencies. We demonstrate the spectral capabilities of CONCERTO at intermediate spectral resolution, with a frequency coverage from 130 to 310 GHz. A sensitivity of 200 mK is achieved in one second, for one beam and a 6 GHz frequency width, over an 18 arcmin diameter field of view, which is within a factor of three of the expectations. We show that we can spectrally disentangle the continuum from the CO line emission, but the line is not resolved at a resolution of $\sim 8000\ \mathrm{km s^{-1}}$. The slope of the millimetre continuum is line-free mapped for the first time in Orion.</description>

Abstract: The Compression and Reconnection Investigations of the Magnetopause (CRIMP) mission is a Heliophysics Medium-Class Explorer (MIDEX) Announcement of Opportunity (AO) mission concept designed to study mesoscale structures and particle outflow along Earth's magnetopause using two identical spacecraft. CRIMP would uncover the impact of magnetosheath mesoscale drivers, dayside magnetopause mesoscale phenomenological processes and structures, and localized plasma outflows on magnetic reconnection and the energy transfer process in the dayside magnetosphere. CRIMP accomplishes this through uniquely phased spacecraft configurations that allow multipoint, contemporaneous measurements at the magnetopause. This enables an unparalleled look at mesoscale spatial differences along the dayside magnetopause on the scale of 1-3 Earth Radii (Re). Through these measurements, CRMIP will uncover how local mass density enhancements affect global reconnection, how mesoscale structures drive magnetopause dynamics, and if the magnetopause acts as a perfectly absorbing boundary for radiation belt electrons. This allows CRIMP to determine the spatial scale, extent, and temporal evolution of energy and mass transfer processes at the magnetopause - crucial measurements to determine how the solar wind energy input in the magnetosphere is transmitted between regions and across scales. This concept was conceived as a part of the 2024 NASA Heliophysics Mission Design School.</description>
