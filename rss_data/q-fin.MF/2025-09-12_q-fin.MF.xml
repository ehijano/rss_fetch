      <title>Optimal Investment and Consumption in a Stochastic Factor Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study optimal investment and consumption in an incomplete stochastic factor model for a power utility investor on the infinite horizon. When the state space of the stochastic factor is finite, we give a complete characterisation of the well-posedness of the problem, and provide an efficient numerical algorithm for computing the value function. When the state space is a (possibly infinite) open interval and the stochastic factor is represented by an It\^o diffusion, we develop a general theory of sub- and supersolutions for second-order ordinary differential equations on open domains without boundary values to prove existence of the solution to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation along with explicit bounds for the solution. By characterising the asymptotic behaviour of the solution, we are also able to provide rigorous verification arguments for various models, including -- for the first time -- the Heston model. Finally, we link the discrete and continuous setting and show that that the value function in the diffusion setting can be approximated very efficiently through a fast discretisation scheme.</description>

      <title>Optimal Risk Sharing Without Preference Convexity: An Aggregate Convexity Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the optimal risk sharing problem with a continuum of agents, modeled via a non-atomic measure space. Individual preferences are not assumed to be convex. We show the multiplicity of agents induces the value function to be convex, allowing for the application of convex duality techniques to risk sharing without preference convexity. The proof in the finite-dimensional case is based on aggregate convexity principles emanating from Lyapunov convexity, while the infinite-dimensional case uses the finite-dimensional results conjoined with approximation arguments particular to a class of law invariant risk measures, although the reference measure is allowed to vary between agents. Finally, we derive a computationally tractable formula for the conjugate of the value function, yielding an explicit dual representation of the value function.</description>

      <title>Long memory score-driven models as approximations for rough Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the continuous-time limit of score-driven models with long memory. By extending score-driven models to incorporate infinite-lag structures with coefficients exhibiting heavy-tailed decay, we establish their weak convergence, under appropriate scaling, to fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes with Hurst parameter $H &lt; 1/2$. When score-driven models are used to characterize the dynamics of volatility, they serve as discrete-time approximations for rough volatility. We present several examples, including EGARCH($\infty$) whose limits give rise to a new class of rough volatility models. Building on this framework, we carry out numerical simulations and option pricing analyses, offering new tools for rough volatility modeling and simulation.</description>

      <title>Optimal investment with insider information using Skorokhod &amp; Russo-Vallois integration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.07471v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the maximization of the logarithmic utility for an insider with different anticipating techniques. Our aim is to compare the utilization of Russo-Vallois forward and Skorokhod integrals in this context. Theoretical analysis and illustrative numerical examples showcase that the Skorokhod insider outperforms the forward insider. This remarkable observation stands in contrast to the scenario involving risk-neutral traders. Furthermore, an ordinary trader could surpass both insiders if a significant negative fluctuation in the driving stochastic process leads to a sufficiently negative final value. These findings underline the intricate interplay between anticipating stochastic calculus and nonlinear utilities, which may yield non-intuitive results from the financial viewpoint.</description>
