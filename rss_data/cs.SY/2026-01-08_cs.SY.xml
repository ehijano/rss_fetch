      <title>$\alpha^3$-Bench: A Unified Benchmark of Safety, Robustness, and Efficiency for LLM-Based UAV Agents over 6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used as high level controllers for autonomous Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) missions. However, existing evaluations rarely assess whether such agents remain safe, protocol compliant, and effective under realistic next generation networking constraints. This paper introduces $\alpha^3$-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating LLM driven UAV autonomy as a multi turn conversational reasoning and control problem operating under dynamic 6G conditions. Each mission is formulated as a language mediated control loop between an LLM based UAV agent and a human operator, where decisions must satisfy strict schema validity, mission policies, speaker alternation, and safety constraints while adapting to fluctuating network slices, latency, jitter, packet loss, throughput, and edge load variations.
  To reflect modern agentic workflows, $\alpha^3$-Bench integrates a dual action layer supporting both tool calls and agent to agent coordination, enabling evaluation of tool use consistency and multi agent interactions. We construct a large scale corpus of 113k conversational UAV episodes grounded in UAVBench scenarios and evaluate 17 state of the art LLMs using a fixed subset of 50 episodes per scenario under deterministic decoding. We propose a composite $\alpha^3$ metric that unifies six pillars: Task Outcome, Safety Policy, Tool Consistency, Interaction Quality, Network Robustness, and Communication Cost, with efficiency normalized scores per second and per thousand tokens. Results show that while several models achieve high mission success and safety compliance, robustness and efficiency vary significantly under degraded 6G conditions, highlighting the need for network aware and resource efficient LLM based UAV agents.

      <title>Battery-time-space fragment-based formulation for the Electric Autonomous Dial-a-Ride Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electric Autonomous Dial-A-Ride Problem (E-ADARP) optimizes routing and scheduling for electric autonomous vehicles to transport customers from origins to destinations. It features a combined objective that minimizes travel cost and excess user ride time, and allows partial recharging. Motivated by practical scenarios where time and battery data are available with limited precision, we introduce a discrete variant of the problem, termed D-E-ADARP, in which all time and battery parameters are discretized. This enables the development of our alternative solution approach: the discrete battery-time-space fragment-based formulation (BTSFF). In this framework, a fragment represents a subpath with an associated cost that accounts for both travel cost and excess user ride time. The BTSFF network integrates spatial, temporal, and battery dimensions, with the latter two discretized into finite indices. Computational results show that BTSFF solves D-E-ADARP significantly more efficiently than existing methods applied to the original E-ADARP. In addition, BTSFF efficiently provides high-quality lower bounds for E-ADARP and accelerates solving its battery swap variants. For E-ADARP, a relaxed network is constructed by rounding down travel times and battery consumptions, enabling a valid lower bound. For battery swap variants, BTSFF integrates lazy constraints via callbacks to correct time discretization errors, guaranteeing optimal solutions. Experiments show BTSFF outperforms benchmark methods in efficiency.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Control for UAV with Off-center Slung Load</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with slung load system is a classic air transportation system. In practical applications, the suspension point of the slung load does not always align with the center of mass (CoM) of the UAV due to mission requirements or mechanical interference. This offset creates coupling in the system's nonlinear dynamics which leads to a complicated motion control problem. In existing research, modeling of the system are performed about the UAV's CoM. In this work we use the point of suspension instead. Based on the new model, a cascade control strategy is developed. In the middle-loop controller, the acceleration of the suspension point is used to regulate the swing angle of the slung load without the need for considering the coupling between the slung load and the UAV. Using the off-center reference frame, an inner-loop controller is designed to track the UAV's attitude without the need of simplification on the coupling effects. We prove local exponential stability of the closed-loop using Lyapunov approach. Finally, simulations and experiments are conducted to validate the proposed control system.</description>

      <title>Provable Acceleration of Distributed Optimization with Local Updates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03442v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In conventional distributed optimization, each agent performs a single local update between two communication rounds with its neighbors to synchronize solutions. Inspired by the success of using multiple local updates in federated learning, incorporating local updates into distributed optimization has recently attracted increasing attention. However, unlike federated learning, where multiple local updates can accelerate learning by improving gradient estimation under mini-batch settings, it remains unclear whether similar benefits hold in distributed optimization when gradients are exact. Moreover, existing theoretical results typically require reducing the step size when multiple local updates are employed, which can entirely offset any potential benefit of these additional local updates and obscure their true impact on convergence. In this paper, we focus on the classic DIGing algorithm and leverage the tight performance bounds provided by Performance Estimation Problems (PEP) to show that incorporating local updates can indeed accelerate distributed optimization. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first rigorous demonstration of such acceleration for a broad class of objective functions. Our analysis further reveals that, under an appropriate step size, performing only two local updates is sufficient to achieve the maximal possible improvement, and that additional local updates provide no further gains. Because more updates increase computational cost, these findings offer practical guidance for efficient implementation. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets corroborate the theoretical findings.</description>

      <title>Policy Synthesis for Interval MDPs via Polyhedral Lyapunov Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decision-making under uncertainty is central to many safety-critical applications, where decisions must be guided by probabilistic modeling formalisms. This paper introduces a novel approach to policy synthesis in multi-objective interval Markov decision processes using polyhedral Lyapunov functions. Unlike previous Lyapunov-based methods that mainly rely on quadratic functions, our method utilizes polyhedral functions to enhance accuracy in managing uncertainties within value iteration of dynamic programming. We reformulate the value iteration algorithm as a switched affine system with interval uncertainties and apply control-theoretic stability principles to synthesize policies that guide the system toward a desired target set. By constructing an invariant set of attraction, we ensure that the synthesized policies provide convergence guarantees while minimizing the impact of transition uncertainty in the underlying model. Our methodology removes the need for computationally intensive Pareto curve computations by directly determining a policy that brings objectives within a specified range of their target values. We validate our approach through numerical case studies, including a recycling robot and an electric vehicle battery, demonstrating its effectiveness in achieving policy synthesis under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Developing a Quantitative Resiliency Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Resiliency has garnered attention in the management of critical infrastructure as a metric of system performance, but there are significant roadblocks to its implementation in a realistic decision-making framework. Contrasted to risk and reliability, which have robust quantification approaches and undergird many regulatory approaches to system safety (e.g., "risk-informed decision-making"), resiliency is a diffuse, qualitatively-understood characteristic, often treated differently or distinctly. However, in the emerging context of highly-complex, highly-interdependent critical systems, the idea of reliability (as the probability of non-failure) may not be an appropriate metric of system health. As a result, focus is shifting towards resiliency-centered approaches that value the response to failure as much as the avoidance of failure. Supporting this approach requires a robustly-defined, quantitative understanding of resiliency. In this paper, we explore the foundations of reliability and resiliency engineering, and propose an approach to resiliency-informed decision-making bolstered by a quantitative understanding of resiliency.</description>

      <title>Online Decision-Making Under Uncertainty for Vehicle-to-Building Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Vehicle-to-building (V2B) systems integrate physical infrastructures, such as smart buildings and electric vehicles (EVs) connected to chargers at the building, with digital control mechanisms to manage energy use. By utilizing EVs as flexible energy reservoirs, buildings can dynamically charge and discharge them to optimize energy use and cut costs under time-variable pricing and demand charge policies. This setup leads to the V2B optimization problem, where buildings coordinate EV charging and discharging to minimize total electricity costs while meeting users' charging requirements. However, the V2B optimization problem is challenging because of: (1) fluctuating electricity pricing, which includes both energy charges ($/kWh) and demand charges ($/kW); (2) long planning horizons (typically over 30 days); (3) heterogeneous chargers with varying charging rates, controllability, and directionality (i.e., unidirectional or bidirectional); and (4) user-specific battery levels at departure to ensure user requirements are met. In contrast to existing approaches that often model this setting as a single-shot combinatorial optimization problem, we highlight critical limitations in prior work and instead model the V2B optimization problem as a Markov decision process (MDP), i.e., a stochastic control process. Solving the resulting MDP is challenging due to the large state and action spaces. To address the challenges of the large state space, we leverage online search, and we counter the action space by using domain-specific heuristics to prune unpromising actions. We validate our approach in collaboration with Nissan Advanced Technology Center - Silicon Valley. Using data from their EV testbed, we show that the proposed framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Model-Based Reinforcement Learning for Orbit Feedback Control in NSLS-II Storage Ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II) uses highly stable electron beam to produce high-quality X-ray beams with high brightness and low-emittance synchrotron radiation. The traditional algorithm to stabilize the beam applies singular value decomposition (SVD) on the orbit response matrix to remove noise and extract actions. Supervised learning has been studied on NSLS-II storage ring stabilization and other accelerator facilities recently. Several problems, for example, machine status drifting, environment noise, and non-linear accelerator dynamics, remain unresolved in the SVD-based and supervised learning algorithms. To address these problems, we propose an adaptive training framework based on model-based reinforcement learning. This framework consists of two types of optimizations: trajectory optimization attempts to minimize the expected total reward in a differentiable environment, and online model optimization learns non-linear machine dynamics through the agent-environment interaction. Through online training, this framework tracks the internal status drifting in the electron beam ring. Simulation and real in-facility experiments on NSLS-II reveal that our method stabilizes the beam position and minimizes the alignment error, defined as the root mean square (RMS) error between adjusted beam positions and the reference position, down to ~1$\mu$m.</description>

      <title>Cyberattack Detection in Virtualized Microgrids Using LightGBM and Knowledge-Distilled Classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03495v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern microgrids depend on distributed sensing and communication interfaces, making them increasingly vulnerable to cyber physical disturbances that threaten operational continuity and equipment safety. In this work, a complete virtual microgrid was designed and implemented in MATLAB/Simulink, integrating heterogeneous renewable sources and secondary controller layers. A structured cyberattack framework was developed using MGLib to inject adversarial signals directly into the secondary control pathways. Multiple attack classes were emulated, including ramp, sinusoidal, additive, coordinated stealth, and denial of service behaviors. The virtual environment was used to generate labeled datasets under both normal and attack conditions. The datasets trained Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) models to perform two functions: detecting the presence of an intrusion (binary) and distinguishing among attack types (multiclass). The multiclass model attained 99.72% accuracy and a 99.62% F1 score, while the binary model attained 94.8% accuracy and a 94.3% F1 score. A knowledge-distillation step reduced the size of the multiclass model, allowing faster predictions with only a small drop in performance. Real-time tests showed a processing delay of about 54 to 67 ms per 1000 samples, demonstrating suitability for CPU-based edge deployment in microgrid controllers. The results confirm that lightweight machine learning based intrusion detection methods can provide fast, accurate, and efficient cyberattack detection without relying on complex deep learning models. Key contributions include: (1) development of a complete MATLAB-based virtual microgrid, (2) structured attack injection at the control layer, (3) creation of multiclass labeled datasets, and (4) design of low-cost AI models suitable for practical microgrid cybersecurity.</description>

      <title>Spider web-inspired sensing and computation with fiber network physical reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical reservoir computing leverages the intrinsic dynamics of mechanical systems to perform computation through their natural responses to input signals. Here, we study a compliant fiber network inspired by orb-weaving spider webs and investigate how its mechanical design and operating conditions shape its computational capability. Using Cosserat rod-based simulations, we identify how network topology, geometry, actuation, and axial tension impact the nonlinear computation and memory capacity of the network. We further evaluate several readout reduction strategies to assess how computational performance varies with the number and placement of measured outputs. We then experimentally validate these results using a physical fiber-network prototype. Overall, results provide insights and guidance on design, actuation, and sensing choices to enable fiber networks for mechano-intelligent computation. They demonstrate the ability of structured compliant fibers networks to serve as physical reservoirs capable of nonlinear transformation and input-history retention.</description>

      <title>DSP-Based Sub-Switching-Period Current-Limiting Control for Grid-Tied Inverter under Grid Faults</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a sub-switching period current-limiting control for a grid-tied inverter to prevent transient overcurrents during grid faults and enable seamless fault ride-through (FRT). Sudden grid-voltage disturbances, such as voltage sags or phase jumps, can induce large transient currents within a switching period, particularly at low switching frequencies. Upon disturbance detection, the proposed method immediately modifies the pulse-width modulation carrier, enabling continuous regulation of the inverter output current within a time much shorter than a switching period without interrupting current flow. The proposed method can be implemented on commonly used digital signal processors without requiring specialized analog or digital circuits or high-speed computing devices. Experimental results from a 2-level, 3-phase inverter switching at 3.6 kHz validate the effectiveness of the proposed method under symmetric and asymmetric voltage sags and phase jumps.</description>

      <title>Accounting for Optimal Control in the Sizing of Isolated Hybrid Renewable Energy Systems Using Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decarbonization of isolated or off-grid energy systems through phase-in of large shares of intermittent solar or wind generation requires co-installation of energy storage or continued use of existing fossil dispatchable power sources to balance supply and demand. The effective CO2 emission reduction depends on the relative capacity of the energy storage and renewable sources, the stochasticity of the renewable generation, and the optimal control or dispatch of the isolated energy system. While the operations of the energy storage and dispatchable sources may impact the optimal sizing of the system, it is challenging to account for the effect of finite horizon, optimal control at the stage of system sizing. Here, we present a flexible and computationally efficient sizing framework for energy storage and renewable capacity in isolated energy systems, accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation and the optimal feedback control. To this end, we implement an imitation learning approach to stochastic neural model predictive control (MPC) which allows us to relate the battery storage and wind peak capacities to the emissions reduction and investment costs while accounting for finite horizon, optimal control. Through this approach, decision makers can evaluate the effective emission reduction and costs of different storage and wind capacities at any price point while accounting for uncertainty in the renewable generation with limited foresight. We evaluate the proposed sizing framework on a case study of an offshore energy system with a gas turbine, a wind farm and a battery energy storage system (BESS). In this case, we find a nonlinear, nontrivial relationship between the investment costs and reduction in gas usage relative to the wind and BESS capacities, emphasizing the complexity and importance of accounting for optimal control in the design of isolated energy systems.</description>

      <title>Derivation of the Thermal Conductivity in a Latent Thermal Energy Storage Unit for Use in Simplified System Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Latent Thermal Energy Storages (LTES) can store thermal energy in a narrow temperature range. Therefore, they are favorable for integration into Rankine-based Carnot Batteries. For the design of such systems, simulations based on accurate models are desirable. However, physical phenomena such as natural convection in LTES units cannot be modeled directly in transient system models. Simplified models are required. Therefore, the objective of this work is to derive simplified LTES unit models for use in system models. In transient simulations the state of charge of the LTES influences its temperature profile. The temperature profile depends on the geometry of the LTES unit. Therefore, the geometry must be considered to model the transient behavior of an LTES unit. The LTES unit under investigation has a shell and tube heat exchanger structure. The phase change material (PCM) is located between the hexagonal fins and in the space between the finned tubes. Aluminum fins are used. They have a high thermal conductivity and thus compensate for the low thermal conductivity of the sodium nitrate used as PCM. The interaction between fins and PCM is complex. Therefore, a numerical approach can be used to gain insight into the behavior of the LTES unit. To transfer the results of a complex model to a simplified model where fins and PCM are not considered individually, the effective thermal conductivity of a single finned tube can be used to approximate the performance of the LTES unit. In this study, a model of a section with a single finned tube is developed using the COMSOL software. The effective thermal conductivity of the system is determined by varying the effective thermal conductivity in a simplified model and comparing the results with reference cases based on a complex modeling approach. The results can serve as model input for simplified system models of Carnot Batteries, among others.</description>

      <title>Output Consensus on Periodic References for Constrained Multi-agent Systems Under a Switching Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the output consensus problem of constrained heterogeneous multi-agent systems under a switching network with potential communication delay, where outputs are periodic and characterized by a linear exosystem. Since periodic references have more complex dynamics, it is more challenging to track periodic references and achieve consensus on them. In this paper, a model predictive control method incorporating an artificial reference and a modified cost is proposed to track periodic references, which maintains recursive feasibility even when reference switches. Moreover, consensus protocols are proposed to achieve consensus on periodic references in different scenarios, in which global information such as the set of globally admissible references and the global time index are not involved. Theoretical analysis proves that constrained output consensus is asymptotically achieved with the proposed algorithm as the references of each agent converge and agents track their references while maintaining constraint satisfaction. Finally, numerical examples are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</description>

      <title>Unified and Efficient Analysis of Machining Chatter and Surface Location Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03819v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although machining chatter can be suppressed by the choice of stable cutting parameters through means of stability lobe diagram (SLD), surface roughness still remains due to the forced vibration, which limits surface quality, especially in the surface finish. Better cutting parameters can be achieved considering surface location error (SLE) together with SLD. This paper proposes an innovative modeling framework of the machining dynamic system that enables efficient computation of the chatter stability and SLE. The framework mainly embodies two techniques, namely semi-discretization method (SDM) and lifting method. The machining dynamics system is mathematically expressed as an angle-varying delay differential equation (DDE). The SDM approximates the angle-varying and delayed terms to ordinary terms using zero-phase interpolations and governs the discrete angle-varying dynamics system. Then, the system is merged over the tooth passing angle using the lifted approach to establish an explicit dynamic system in the compact state-space form. Based on the compact state-space model, the chatter stability and SLE prediction are easily and efficiently conducted. Simulation results show the improved efficiency of the proposed method over other well-known methods.</description>

      <title>A Systems-Engineered ESP32 DAQ Architecture and FAIR Data Workflow for Small-Scale Wind Turbine Performance Measurement in Tropical Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-scale wind turbine research in resource-constrained academic settings frequently produces unreliable or unpublishable datasets due to ad-hoc instrumentation, inadequate time synchronization, storage failures, and weak data governance. This paper presents a systematic data acquisition (DAQ) methodology and ESP32-based reference implementation design for field characterization of small wind turbines (100~W--5~kW), emphasizing tropical/coastal deployment constraints typical of Low- and Middle-Income Countries (LMIC). We integrate (i)~a student-adapted V-model with requirements traceability, (ii)~hardware selection strategies for high-humidity and salt-spray environments, (iii)~an embedded firmware architecture featuring interrupt-driven rotor speed measurement, state-machine fault handling, and NTP-based time synchronization, (iv)~a local-first hybrid storage design combining SD-card persistence with optional MQTT cloud telemetry, and (v)~a data-management workflow adapting CRISP-DM and FAIR principles with explicit quality dimensions and publication templates. A detailed helical vertical-axis wind turbine (VAWT) design scenario for coastal Sri Lanka illustrates the complete methodology, targeting $&gt;90\%$ data completeness over six-month campaigns. The methodology is accompanied by open-source firmware, hardware templates, and data-publication workflow artifacts released via GitHub and Zenodo.</description>

      <title>Smooth Sampling-Based Model Predictive Control Using Deterministic Samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03893v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sampling-based model predictive control (MPC) is effective for nonlinear systems but often produces non-smooth control inputs due to random sampling. To address this issue, we extend the model predictive path integral (MPPI) framework with deterministic sampling and improvements from cross-entropy method (CEM)--MPC, such as iterative optimization, proposing deterministic sampling MPPI (dsMPPI). This combination leverages the exponential weighting of MPPI alongside the efficiency of deterministic samples. Experiments demonstrate that dsMPPI achieves smoother trajectories compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Exact Continuous Reformulations of Logic Constraints in Nonlinear Optimization and Optimal Control Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many nonlinear optimal control and optimization problems involve constraints that combine continuous dynamics with discrete logic conditions. Standard approaches typically rely on mixed-integer programming, which introduces scalability challenges and requires specialized solvers. This paper presents an exact reformulation of broad classes of logical constraints as binary-variable-free expressions whose differentiability properties coincide with those of the underlying predicates, enabling their direct integration into nonlinear programming models. Our approach rewrites arbitrary logical propositions into conjunctive normal form, converts them into equivalent max--min constraints, and applies a smoothing procedure that preserves the exact feasible set. The method is evaluated on two benchmark problems, a quadrotor trajectory optimization with obstacle avoidance and a hybrid two-tank system with temporal logic constraints, and is shown to obtain optimal solutions more consistently and efficiently than existing binary variable elimination techniques.</description>

      <title>A Load Impedance Emulation Active Interface for Piezoelectric Vibration Energy Harvesters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A single stage active AC/DC interface able to emulate the optimal load impedance of a Resonant Piezoelectric Vibration Energy Harvester (RPVEH) is proposed. As theoretically shown, unlike an electronic interface that emulates an optimal load generator, an interface that emulates an optimal load impedance does not require adaptation to the acceleration of input vibrations. This allows the use of a very simple control, avoiding the implementation of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithms that require lossy microcontrollers. Thus, the proposed interface is equipped with a simple analog controller allowing the RPVEH to work in its Maximum Power Point (MPP) in both steady-state and variable conditions of vibrations, without recurring to multivariable perturbative approaches, as it happens for the most of single stage AC/DC interfaces proposed in the literature. The absence of perturbative techniques allows a significant improvement of both stationary and dynamic performances. Experimental tests of a prototype of the proposed interface confirm the theoretical findings and the predicted behavior.</description>

      <title>Solar Panel-based Visible Light Communication for Batteryless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.04190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.04190v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a batteryless wireless communication node for the Internet of Things, powered entirely by ambient light and capable of receiving data through visible light communication. A solar panel serves dual functions as an energy harvester and an optical antenna, capturing modulated signals from LED light sources. A lightweight analog front-end filters and digitizes the signals for an 8-bit low-power processor, which manages the system's operational states based on stored energy levels. The main processor is selectively activated to minimize energy consumption. Data reception is synchronized with the harvester's open-circuit phase, reducing interference and improving signal quality. The prototype reliably decodes 32-bit VLC frames at 800\,Herz, consuming less than 2.8\,mJ, and maintains sleep-mode power below 30\,uW.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Continuous-Time Trajectory Estimation via Gaussian Processes and the Magnus Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous-time state estimation has been shown to be an effective means of (i) handling asynchronous and high-rate measurements, (ii) introducing smoothness to the estimate, (iii) post hoc querying the estimate at times other than those of the measurements, and (iv) addressing certain observability issues related to scanning-while-moving sensors. A popular means of representing the trajectory in continuous time is via a Gaussian process (GP) prior, with the prior's mean and covariance functions generated by a linear time-varying (LTV) stochastic differential equation (SDE) driven by white noise. When the state comprises elements of Lie groups, previous works have resorted to a patchwork of local GPs each with a linear time-invariant SDE kernel, which while effective in practice, lacks theoretical elegance. Here we revisit the full LTV GP approach to continuous-time trajectory estimation, deriving a global GP prior on Lie groups via the Magnus expansion, which offers a more elegant and general solution. We provide a numerical comparison between the two approaches and discuss their relative merits.</description>

      <title>Sensor to Pixels: Decentralized Swarm Gathering via Image-Based Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study highlights the potential of image-based reinforcement learning methods for addressing swarm-related tasks. In multi-agent reinforcement learning, effective policy learning depends on how agents sense, interpret, and process inputs. Traditional approaches often rely on handcrafted feature extraction or raw vector-based representations, which limit the scalability and efficiency of learned policies concerning input order and size. In this work we propose an image-based reinforcement learning method for decentralized control of a multi-agent system, where observations are encoded as structured visual inputs that can be processed by Neural Networks, extracting its spatial features and producing novel decentralized motion control rules. We evaluate our approach on a multi-agent convergence task of agents with limited-range and bearing-only sensing that aim to keep the swarm cohesive during the aggregation. The algorithm's performance is evaluated against two benchmarks: an analytical solution proposed by Bellaiche and Bruckstein, which ensures convergence but progresses slowly, and VariAntNet, a neural network-based framework that converges much faster but shows medium success rates in hard constellations. Our method achieves high convergence, with a pace nearly matching that of VariAntNet. In some scenarios, it serves as the only practical alternative.</description>

      <title>Multi-agent Optimization of Non-cooperative Multimodal Mobility Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03777v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While multimodal mobility systems have the potential to bring many benefits to travelers, drivers, the environment, and traffic congestion, such systems typically involve multiple non-cooperative decision-makers who may selfishly optimize their own objectives without considering the overall system benefits. This paper aims to investigate market-based interactions of travelers and ride-sourcing drivers in the context of multimodal mobility systems. We propose a unified mathematical modeling framework to capture the decentralized travelers and drivers' decision-making process and balance the network's demand and supply by equilibrium pricing. Such a model allows analyses of the impact of decentralized decision-making on multimodal mobility efficiencies. The proposed formulation can be further convexified to efficiently compute the equilibrium ride-sourcing prices. We conduct numerical experiments on different settings of transportation networks to gain policy insights. We find that travelers prefer ride-sourcing and multimodal transportation more than the driving option when they are more sensitive to prices. We also find that travelers may need to be subsidized to use multimodal transportation when there is fewer transit hubs in the network or, ride-sourcing drivers become too sensitive to the prices. However, we find that more transit hubs in the network increases the total empty VMT of ride-sourcing drivers by increasing the total relocation time. The proposed model can be used by policymakers and platform operators to design pricing and subsidy schemes that align individual decision-making with system-level efficiency and evaluate the trade-offs between accessibility and environmental impacts in multimodal transportation networks.</description>

      <title>Posterior error bounds for prior-driven balancing in linear Gaussian inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In large-scale Bayesian inverse problems, it is often necessary to apply approximate forward models to reduce the cost of forward model evaluations, while controlling approximation quality. In the context of Bayesian inverse problems with linear forward models, Gaussian priors, and Gaussian noise, we use perturbation theory for inverses to bound the error in the approximate posterior mean and posterior covariance resulting from a linear approximate forward model. We then focus on the smoothing problem of inferring the initial condition of linear time-invariant dynamical systems, using finitely many partial state observations. For such problems, and for a specific model order reduction method based on balanced truncation, we show that the impulse response of a certain prior-driven system is closely related to the prior-preconditioned Hessian of the inverse problem. This reveals a novel connection between systems theory and inverse problems. We exploit this connection to prove the first a priori error bounds for system-theoretic model order reduction methods applied to smoothing problems. The bounds control the approximation error of the posterior mean and covariance in terms of the truncated Hankel singular values of the underlying system.</description>

      <title>On-Device Deep Reinforcement Learning for Decentralized Task Offloading Performance trade-offs in the training process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Allowing less capable devices to offload computational tasks to more powerful devices or servers enables the development of new applications that may not run correctly on the device itself. Deciding where and why to run each of those applications is a complex task. Therefore, different approaches have been adopted to make offloading decisions. In this work, we propose a decentralized Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) agent to address the selection of computing locations. Unlike most existing work, we analyze it in a real testbed composed of various edge devices running the agent to determine where to execute each task. These devices are connected to a Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC) server and a Cloud server through 5G communications. We evaluate not only the agent's performance in meeting task requirements but also the implications of running this type of agent locally, assessing the trade-offs of training locally versus remotely in terms of latency and energy consumption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04111v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efficient navigation in swarms often relies on the emergence of decentralized approaches that minimize traversal time or energy. Stigmergy, where agents modify a shared environment that then modifies their behavior, is a classic mechanism that can encode this strategy. We develop a theoretical framework for stigmergic transport by casting it as a stochastic optimal control problem: agents (collectively) lay and (individually) follow trails while minimizing expected traversal time. Simulations and analysis reveal two emergent behaviors: path straightening in homogeneous environments and path refraction at material interfaces, both consistent with experimental observations of insect trails. While reminiscent of Fermat's principle, our results show how local, noisy agent+field interactions can give rise to geodesic trajectories in heterogeneous environments, without centralized coordination or global knowledge, relying instead on an embodied slow fast dynamical mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.04177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Emergency vehicles require rapid passage through congested traffic, yet existing strategies fail to adapt to dynamic conditions. We propose a novel hierarchical graph neural network (GNN)-based multi-agent reinforcement learning framework to coordinate connected vehicles for emergency corridor formation. Our approach uses a high-level planner for global strategy and low-level controllers for trajectory execution, utilizing graph attention networks to scale with variable agent counts. Trained via Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO), the system reduces emergency vehicle travel time by 28.3% compared to baselines and 44.6% compared to uncoordinated traffic in simulations. The design achieves near-zero collision rates (0.3%) while maintaining 81% of background traffic efficiency. Ablation and generalization studies confirm the framework's robustness across diverse scenarios. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of combining GNNs with hierarchical learning for intelligent transportation systems.</description>

      <title>On Game based Distributed Approach for General Multi-agent Optimal Coverage with Application to UAV Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.01193v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on the optimal coverage problem (OCP) for multi-agent systems with a decentralized optimization mechanism. A game based distributed decision-making method for the multi-agent OCP is proposed to address the high computational costs arising from the large scale of the multi-agent system and to ensure that the game's equilibrium achieves the global performance objective's maximum value. In particular, a distributed algorithm that needs only local information is developed and proved to converge to near-optimal global coverage. Finally, the proposed method is applied to maximize the coverage area of the UAV network for a target region. The simulation results show that our method can require much less computational time than other typical distributed algorithms in related work, while achieving a faster convergence rate. Comparison with centralized optimization also demonstrates that the proposed method has approximate optimization results and high computation efficiency.</description>

      <title>Latent Representations for Control Design with Provable Stability and Safety Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We initiate a formal study on the use of low-dimensional latent representations of dynamical systems for verifiable control synthesis. Our main goal is to enable the application of verification techniques -- such as Lyapunov or barrier functions -- that might otherwise be computationally prohibitive when applied directly to the full state representation. Towards this goal, we first provide dynamics-aware approximate conjugacy conditions which formalize the notion of reconstruction error necessary for systems analysis. We then utilize our conjugacy conditions to transfer the stability and invariance guarantees of a latent certificate function (e.g., a Lyapunov or barrier function) for a latent space controller back to the original system. Importantly, our analysis contains several important implications for learning latent spaces and dynamics, by highlighting the necessary geometric properties which need to be preserved by the latent space, in addition to providing concrete loss functions for dynamics reconstruction that are directly related to control design. We conclude by demonstrating the applicability of our theory to two case studies: (1) stabilization of a cartpole system, and (2) collision avoidance for a two vehicle system.</description>

      <title>Economic zone data-enabled predictive control for connected open water systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.03043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The real-time operation of open water systems is essential for ensuring operational safety, satisfying operational requirements, and optimizing energy usage. However, existing rule-based control strategies rely heavily on human experience, while model-based approaches depend on accurate hydrodynamic models, which limit their applicability to water systems with complex dynamics and uncertain disturbances. In this work, we develop a fully data-driven, zone-based control framework with adaptive control target zone selection for safe and energy-efficient operation of connected open water systems. Specifically, we propose a mixed-integer economic zone data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) approach that aims to maintain the water levels of the branches within the desired water-level zone while reducing real-time operational energy consumption. The DeePC-based approach enables direct use of input-output data for predictive control, eliminating the need for explicit dynamic modeling. To handle multiple control objectives with different priorities, we employ lexicographic optimization and reformulate the traditional DeePC cost function to incorporate zone tracking and energy consumption minimization objectives. Additionally, Bayesian optimization is utilized to determine the control target zone, which enables an effective trade-off between zone tracking and energy consumption in the presence of external disturbances. Comprehensive simulations and comparative analyses demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method maintains water levels within the desired water-level zone for 97.04% of the operating time, with an average energy consumption of 33.5 kWh per 0.5 hour. Compared to rule-based control method, the proposed method lowers zone-violation frequency by 74.96% and the average energy consumption by 22.44%.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Real-Time Scheduling Algorithms for Embedded Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Embedded systems are becoming more in demand to work in dynamic and uncertain environments, and being confined to the strong requirements of real-time. Conventional static scheduling models usually cannot cope with runtime modification in workload, resource availability, or system updates. This brief survey covers the area of feedback-based control (e.g., Feedback Control Scheduling) and interdependence between tasks (e.g., Symbiotic Scheduling of Periodic Tasks) models. It also borders on predictive methods and power management, combining methods based on Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS). In this paper, key mechanisms are briefly summarized, influencing trade-offs relating to adaptivity/predictability, typical metrics of evaluation, and ongoing problems, especially in situations where safety is a critical factor, giving a succinct and easy-to-understand introduction to researchers and practitioners who have to cope with the changing environment of adaptive real-time systems.</description>

      <title>Reliable Grid Forecasting: State Space Models for Safety-Critical Energy Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01410</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01410v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate grid load forecasting is safety-critical: under-predictions risk supply shortfalls, while symmetric error metrics mask this operational asymmetry. We introduce a grid-specific evaluation framework (Asymmetric MAPE, Under-Prediction Rate, and Reserve Margin) that directly measures operational risk rather than statistical accuracy alone. Using this framework, we conduct a systematic evaluation of Mamba-based State Space Models for California grid forecasting on a weather-aligned CA ISO-TAC dataset spanning Nov 2023 to Nov 2025 (84,498 hourly records across 5 transmission areas). Our analysis reveals that standard accuracy metrics are poor proxies for operational safety: models with identical MAPE can require vastly different reserve margins. We demonstrate that forecast errors are weakly but statistically significantly associated with temperature (r = 0.16), motivating weather-aware modeling rather than loss function modification alone. The S-Mamba model achieves the lowest 99.5th-percentile reserve margin (14.12 percent) compared to 16.66 percent for iTransformer, demonstrating superior forecast reliability under a 99.5th-percentile tail-risk reserve proxy.</description>

      <title>From inconsistency to decision: explainable operation and maintenance of battery energy storage systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03007v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESSs) are increasingly critical to power-system stability, yet their operation and maintenance remain dominated by reactive, expert-dependent diagnostics. While cell-level inconsistencies provide early warning signals of degradation and safety risks, the lack of scalable and interpretable decision-support frameworks prevents these signals from being effectively translated into operational actions. Here we introduce an inconsistency-driven operation and maintenance paradigm for large-scale BESSs that systematically transforms routine monitoring data into explainable, decision-oriented guidance. The proposed framework integrates multi-dimensional inconsistency evaluation with large language model-based semantic reasoning to bridge the gap between quantitative diagnostics and practical maintenance decisions. Using eight months of field data from an in-service battery system comprising 3,564 cells, we demonstrate how electrical, thermal, and aging-related inconsistencies can be distilled into structured operational records and converted into actionable maintenance insights through a multi-agent framework. The proposed approach enables accurate and explainable responses to real-world operation and maintenance queries, reducing response time and operational cost by over 80% compared with conventional expert-driven practices. These results establish a scalable pathway for intelligent operation and maintenance of battery energy storage systems, with direct implications for reliability, safety, and cost-effective integration of energy storage into modern power systems.</description>

      <title>Spatial exponential decay of perturbations in optimal control of general evolution equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12279v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the robustness of optimally controlled evolution equations with respect to spatially localized perturbations. We prove that if the involved operators are domain-uniformly stabilizable and detectable, then these localized perturbations only have a local effect on the optimal solution. We characterize this domain-uniform stabilizability and detectability for the transport equation with constant transport velocity, showing that even for unitary semigroups, optimality implies exponential damping. We extend this result to the case of a space-dependent transport velocity. Finally we leverage the results for the transport equation to characterize domain-uniform stabilizability of the wave equation. Numerical examples in one space dimension complement the theoretical results.</description>

      <title>Physics-Driven Data Generation for Contact-Rich Manipulation via Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.20382v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a low-cost data generation pipeline that integrates physics-based simulation, human demonstrations, and model-based planning to efficiently generate large-scale, high-quality datasets for contact-rich robotic manipulation tasks. Starting with a small number of embodiment-flexible human demonstrations collected in a virtual reality simulation environment, the pipeline refines these demonstrations using optimization-based kinematic retargeting and trajectory optimization to adapt them across various robot embodiments and physical parameters. This process yields a diverse, physically consistent dataset that enables cross-embodiment data transfer, and offers the potential to reuse legacy datasets collected under different hardware configurations or physical parameters. We validate the pipeline's effectiveness by training diffusion policies from the generated datasets for challenging contact-rich manipulation tasks across multiple robot embodiments, including a floating Allegro hand and bimanual robot arms. The trained policies are deployed zero-shot on hardware for bimanual iiwa arms, achieving high success rates with minimal human input.

      <title>Optimal Control of an Epidemic with Intervention Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the optimal control of an epidemic governed by a SEIR model with operational delays in vaccination and non pharmaceutical interventions. We address the mathematical challenge of imposing hard healthcare capacity constraints (e.g., ICU limits) over an infinite time horizon. To rigorously bridge the gap between theoretical constraints and numerical tractability, we employ a variational framework based on Moreau--Yosida regularization and establish the connection between finite- and infinite-horizon solutions via $\Gamma$-convergence. The necessary conditions for optimality are derived using the Pontryagin Maximum Principle, allowing for the characterization of singular regimes where the optimal strategy maintains the infection level precisely at the capacity boundary. Numerical simulations illustrate these theoretical findings, quantifying the shadow prices of infection and costs associated with intervention delays.</description>

      <title>Real-time Velocity Profile Optimization for Time-Optimal Maneuvering with Generic Acceleration Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.26428v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computation of time-optimal velocity profiles along prescribed paths, subject to generic acceleration constraints, is a crucial problem in robot trajectory planning, with particular relevance to autonomous racing. However, the existing methods either support arbitrary acceleration constraints at high computational cost or use conservative box constraints for computational efficiency. We propose FBGA, a new \underline{F}orward-\underline{B}ackward algorithm with \underline{G}eneric \underline{A}cceleration constraints, which achieves both high accuracy and low computation time. FBGA operates forward and backward passes to maximize the velocity profile in short, discretized path segments, while satisfying user-defined performance limits. Tested on five racetracks and two vehicle classes, FBGA handles complex, non-convex acceleration constraints with custom formulations. Its maneuvers and lap times closely match optimal control baselines (within $0.11\%$-$0.36\%$), while being up to three orders of magnitude faster. FBGA maintains high accuracy even with coarse discretization, making it well-suited for online multi-query trajectory planning. Our open-source \texttt{C++} implementation is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/FB_public_RAL.</description>

      <title>Steady-State Spread Bounds for Graph Diffusion via Laplacian Regularisation in Networked Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.04924v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how far a diffusion process on a graph can deviate from a designed starting pattern when the pattern is generated via Laplacian regularisation. Under standard stability conditions for undirected, entrywise nonnegative graphs, we give a closed-form, instance-specific upper bound on the steady-state spread, measured as the relative change between the final and initial profiles. The bound separates two effects: (i) an irreducible term determined by the graph's maximum node degree, and (ii) a design-controlled term that shrinks as the regularisation strength increases (with an inverse square-root law). This leads to a design rule: given any target limit on spread, one can choose a sufficient regularisation strength in closed form. Although one motivating application is array beamforming -- where the initial pattern is the squared magnitude of the beamformer weights -- the result applies to any scenario that first enforces Laplacian smoothness and then evolves by linear diffusion on a graph. Overall, the guarantee is non-asymptotic, easy to compute, and certifies the maximum steady-state deviation.</description>
