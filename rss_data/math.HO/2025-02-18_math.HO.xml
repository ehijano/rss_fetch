      <title>Of pashas, popes, and indivisibles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The studies of Bonaventura Cavalieri's indivisibles by Giusti, Andersen, Mancosu and others provide a comprehensive picture of Cavalieri's mathematics, as well as of the mathematical objections to it as formulated by Paul Guldin and other critics. An issue that has been studied in less detail concerns the theological underpinnings of the contemporary debate over indivisibles, its historical roots, the geopolitical situation at the time, and its relation to the ultimate suppression of Cavalieri's religious order. We analyze sources from the 17th through 21st centuries to investigate such a relation.</description>

      <title>How did Fermat discover his theorem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11165v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1640 Pierre de Fermat discovered his theorem that if $p$ is prime and $a$ is not divisible by $p$, then $a^{p-1}-1$ is divisible by $p$; or, as we write today, $a^{p-1}\equiv1\pmod{p}$. This is perhaps the first and the most important surprising property ever discovered about primes. There is little in number theory that is not dependent on it or intertwined with it, and its significance is amply demonstrated by the fact that today, almost four centuries later, Fermat's theorem provides the mathematical foundation for the RSA cryptosystem, which is still central to society's communications security even after several decades serving as its heart.
  Fermat's theorem is totally unexpected and truly astonishing. So why and how did he discover it? We know that Fermat was studying perfect numbers from classical Greek mathematics. But exactly how did that lead to his discovery? The secret lies in patterns in prime factorizations of Mersenne numbers, and Fermat's letters reveal hints of his path. We can reconstruct details of how Mersenne numbers led to Fermat's discoveries.</description>

      <title>Explaining Necessary Truths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11251v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Knowing the truth is rarely enough -- we also seek out reasons why the fact is true. While much is known about how we explain contingent truths, we understand less about how we explain facts, such as those in mathematics, that are true as a matter of logical necessity. We present a framework, based in computational complexity, where explanations for deductive truths co-emerge with discoveries of simplifying steps during the search process. When such structures are missing, we revert, in turn, to error-based reasons, where a (corrected) mistake can serve as fictitious, but explanatory, contingency-cause: not making the mistake serves as a reason why the truth takes the form it does. We simulate human subjects, using GPT-4o, presented with SAT puzzles of varying complexity and reasonableness, validating our theory and showing how its predictions can be tested in future human studies.</description>

      <title>On the robustness of ChatGPT in teaching Korean Mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ChatGPT, an Artificial Intelligence model, has the potential to revolutionize education. However, its effectiveness in solving non-English questions remains uncertain. This study evaluates ChatGPT's robustness using 586 Korean mathematics questions. ChatGPT achieves 66.72% accuracy, correctly answering 391 out of 586 questions. We also assess its ability to rate mathematics questions based on eleven criteria and perform a topic analysis. Our findings show that ChatGPT's ratings align with educational theory and test-taker perspectives. While ChatGPT performs well in question classification, it struggles with non-English contexts, highlighting areas for improvement. Future research should address linguistic biases and enhance accuracy across diverse languages. Domain-specific optimizations and multilingual training could improve ChatGPT's role in personalized education.</description>

      <title>On foundations for deductive mathematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02507v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article was motivated by the discovery of a potential new foundation for mainstream mathematics. The goals are to clarify the relationships between primitives, foundations, and deductive practice; to understand how to determine what is, or isn't, a foundation; and get clues as to how a foundation can be optimized for effective human use.
  For this we turn to history and professional practice of the subject. We have no asperations to Philosophy.
  The first section gives a short abstract discussion, focusing on the significance of consistency. The next briefly describes foundations, explicit and implicit, at a few key periods in mathematical history. We see, for example, that at the primitive level human intuitions are essential, but can be problematic. We also see that traditional axiomatic set theories, Zermillo-Fraenkel-Choice (ZFC) in particular, are not quite consistent with mainstream practice. The final section sketches the proposed new foundation and gives the basic argument that it is uniquely qualified to be considered {the} foundation of mainstream deductive mathematics. The ``coherent limit axiom'' characterizes the new theory among ZFC-like theories. This axiom plays a role in recursion, but is implicitly assumed in mainstream work so does not provide new leverage there. In principle it should settle set-theory questions such as the continuum hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Proof of the Goldbach's Strong Conjecture by Using Semi-Continuous Model of Even Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.13230</link>
      <description>arXiv:1909.13230v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present an explicit and analytic proof for still unproven Goldbach's strong conjecture. To derive this proof, we first define a heuristic model for representing even numbers called Semi-continuous Model for Even Numbers or briefly S.C.E Model, and then we employ this model along with using the inequality
  \begin{center}
  $\dfrac{x}{\ln x}\leq_{x\geq 17}\pi(x)\leq_{x&gt;1}1.2251\dfrac{x}{\ln x}$,
  \end{center}
  where $\pi(x)$ denotes the number of all primes smaller than and equal to $x$, and is presented by Pierre Dusart in his paper [P. Dusart, \textit{Explicit estimates of some functions over primes}, Ramanujan J. \textbf{45} (2016), No. 1, 227--251].
  On the one hand, this proof is given for all even numbers $E\geq22864$. On the other hand, since the assertion of Goldbach's strong conjecture is easy to verify for all even numbers $4\leq E&lt;22864$, we turn this conjecture into a theorem.</description>

      <title>Ho\`ang Xu\^an S\'inh's Thesis: Categorifying Group Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05119v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During what Vietnamese call the American War, Alexander Grothendieck spent three weeks teaching mathematics in and near Hanoi. Ho\`ang Xu\^an S\'inh took notes on his lectures and later did her thesis work with him by correspondence. In her thesis she developed the theory of "Gr-categories", which are monoidal categories in which all objects and morphisms have inverses. Now often called "2-groups", these structures allow the study of symmetries that themselves have symmetries. After a brief account of how Ho\`ang Xu\^an S\'inh wrote her thesis, we explain some of its main results, and its context in the history of mathematics.</description>
