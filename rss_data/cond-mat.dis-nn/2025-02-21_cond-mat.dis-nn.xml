      <title>High-dimensional random landscapes: from typical to large deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In these notes we discuss tools and concepts that emerge when studying high-dimensional random landscapes, i.e., random functions on high-dimensional spaces. As an example, we consider a high-dimensional inference problem in two forms: matrix denoising (Case 1) and tensor denoising (Case 2). We show how to map the inference problem onto the optimization problem of a high-dimensional landscape, which exhibits distinct geometrical properties in the two Cases. We discuss methods for characterizing typical realizations of these landscapes and their optimization through local dynamics. We conclude by highlighting connections between the landscape problem and Large Deviation Theory.</description>

      <title>Scale-free localization versus Anderson localization in unidirectional quasiperiodic lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scale-free localization emerging in non-Hermitian physics has recently garnered significant attention. In this work, we explore the interplay between scale-free localization and Anderson localization by investigating a unidirectional quasiperiodic model with generalized boundary conditions. We derive analytical expressions of Lyapunov exponent from the bulk equations. Together with the boundary equation, we can determine properties of eigenstates and spectrum and establish their exact relationships with the quasiperiodic potential strength and boundary parameter. While eigenstates exhibit scale-free localization in the weak disorder regime, they become localized in the strong disorder regime. The scale-free and Anderson localized states satisfy the boundary equation in distinct ways, leading to different localization properties and scaling behaviors. Generalizing our framework, we design a model with exact energy edges separating the scale-free and Anderson localized states via the mosaic modulation of quasiperiodic potentials. Our models can be realized experimentally in electric circuits.</description>

      <title>Decoherence-induced self-dual criticality in topological states of matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum measurements can be employed to induce decoherence in a restricted segment of a quantum many-body state, while simultaneously engineering long-range entanglement for its remaining constituents. Though this two-fold character of measurements in open quantum systems has been appreciated for entangled state preparation, a deeper conceptual understanding is called for regarding symmetry as an organizing principle. Here we discuss the role of self-dual symmetry -- a fundamental notion in theoretical physics -- in mixed states, showing that the decoherence of electric and magnetic vortices from the 2D bulk of the toric code, or a 2D cluster state with symmetry-protected topological order, can leave a (1+1)D quantum critical mixed state on the boundary protected by a weak Kramers-Wannier self-dual symmetry. The corresponding self-dual critical bulk is described by the $N\to1$ limit of the 2D Non-linear Sigma Model in symmetry class $D$ at $\Theta$-angle $\pi$, with target space $SO(2N)/U(N)$, established as a Born-measurement version of the Cho-Fisher model. An explicit breaking of the self-duality, by incoherent noise amounting to fermion interactions or non-interacting coherent deformation, is shown to induce an RG crossover from this self-dual critical state to Nishimori criticality or to it from a novel type of Ising+ criticality, respectively, both of which are related to the random-bond Ising model in different replica limits and are described by non-unitary conformal field theories of non-interacting fermions, as is the self-dual point. Using numerical approaches combining tensor network, Monte Carlo, and Gaussian fermion simulations, we chart out a global phase diagram by coherent information and entanglement entropy measures. Our results point a way towards a general understanding of mixed-state criticality in open quantum systems in terms of symmetry and topology.</description>

      <title>Passive leakage removal unit based on a disordered transmon array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.</description>

      <title>Identification of soft modes in amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ via first-principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ is a fundamental component of modern superconducting qubits. While amphorphous oxides offer distinct advantages, such as directional isotropy and a consistent bulk electronic gap, in realistic systems these compounds support two-level systems (TLSs) which couple to the qubit, expediting decoherence. In this work, we perform a first-principles study of amorphous Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$ and identify low-energy modes in the electronic and phonon spectra as a possible origin for TLSs.</description>

      <title>Optimal coordination of resources: A solution from reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14970v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient allocation is important in nature and human society, where individuals frequently compete for limited resources. The Minority Game (MG) is perhaps the simplest toy model to address this issue. However, most previous solutions assume that the strategies are provided a priori and static, failing to capture their adaptive nature. Here, we introduce the reinforcement learning (RL) paradigm to MG, where individuals adjust decisions based on accumulated experience and expected rewards dynamically. We find that this RL framework achieves optimal resource coordination when individuals balance the exploitation of experience with random exploration. Yet, the imbalanced strategies of the two lead to suboptimal partial coordination or even anti-coordination. Our mechanistic analysis reveals a symmetry-breaking in action preferences at the optimum, offering a fresh solution to the MG and new insights into the resource allocation problem.</description>

      <title>The planted directed polymer: inferring a random walk from noisy images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07263v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study the planted directed polymer, in which the path of a random walker is inferred from noisy 'images' accumulated at each timestep. Formulated as a nonlinear problem of Bayesian inference for a hidden Markov model, this problem is a generalization of the directed polymer problem of statistical physics, coinciding with it in the limit of zero signal to noise. For a 1D walker we present numerical investigations and analytical arguments that no phase transition is present. When formulated on a Cayley tree, methods developed for the directed polymer are used to show that there is a transition with decreasing signal to noise where effective inference becomes impossible, meaning that the average fractional overlap between the inferred and true paths falls from one to zero.</description>

      <title>$NVU$ view on energy polydisperse Lennard-Jones systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When energy polydispersity is introduced into the Lennard-Jones (LJ) system, there is little effect on structure and dynamics [Ingebrigtsen and Dyre, J. Phys. Chem. B 127, 2837 (2023)]. For instance, at a given state point both the radial distribution function and the mean-square displacement as a function of time are virtually unaffected by even large energy polydispersity, which is in stark contrast to what happens when size polydispersity is introduced. We here argue -- and validate by simulations of up to 30\% polydispersity -- that this almost invariance of structure and dynamics reflects an approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface. Because $NVU$ dynamics defined as geodesic motion at constant potential energy is equivalent to Newtonian dynamics in the thermodynamic limit, the approximate invariance of the constant-potential-energy surface implies virtually the same physics of energy polydisperse LJ systems as of the standard single-component version. In contrast, the constant-potential-energy surface is significantly affected by introducing size polydispersity.</description>

      <title>Microscopic mechanism of electric field-induced superconductivity suppression in metallic thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supercurrent field-effect transistors made from thin metallic films are a promising option for next-generation high-performance computation platforms. Despite extensive research, there is still no complete quantitative microscopic explanation for how an external DC electric field suppresses superconductivity in thin films. This study aims to provide a quantitative description of superconductivity as a function of film thickness based on Eliashberg's theory. The calculation considers the electrostatics of the electric field, its realistic penetration depth in the film, and its effect on the Cooper pair, which is described as a standard s-wave bound state according to BCS theory. The estimation suggests that an external electric field of approximately $10^8$ V/m is required to suppress superconductivity in 10-30-nm-thick films, which aligns with experimental observations. Ultimately, the study offers "materials by design" guidelines for suppressing supercurrent when an external electric field is applied to the film surface. Furthermore, the proposed framework can be easily extended to investigate the same effects for ultrathin films.</description>
