      <title>Correlation and collective behaviour in Adler-type locally coupled oscillators at the edge of chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamical systems can be analyzed as computational devices capable of performing information processing. In coupled oscillators, enlarged capabilities are expected when the set of units is formed by subsets with collective behaviour within them but weak correlation between the subsets. A system of non-linear oscillators weakly coupled in the phase approximation is studied. The informational distance maps show different regimes of collective behaviour, ranging from independent, local, and global, as the control parameters of the system are changed. This rich set of behaviours happens despite the simple nature of the model used. Complex hierarchies between oscillators can be identified near the edge of chaos region in the informational distance dendrograms. We identify the emergence of local collective regimes, further corroborated by the spatiotemporal maps. Correlation diagrams also exhibit non-trivial dependence for the system at the edge of chaos.</description>

      <title>Universal resonancelike emergence of chaos in complex networks of damped-driven nonlinear systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16861v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Characterizing the emergence of chaotic dynamics of complex networks is an essential task in nonlinear science with potential important applications in many fields such as neural control engineering, microgrid technologies, and ecological networks. Here, we solve a critical outstanding problem in this multidisciplinary research field: The emergence and persistence of spatio-temporal chaos in complex networks of damped-driven nonlinear oscillators in the significant weak-coupling regime, while they exhibit regular behavior when uncoupled. By developing a comprehensive theory with the aid of standard analytical methods, a hierarchy of lower-dimensional effective models, and extensive numerical simulations, we uncover and characterize the basic physical mechanisms concerning both heterogeneity-induced and impulse-induced emergence, enhancement, and suppression of chaos in starlike and scale-free networks of periodically driven, dissipative nonlinear oscillators.</description>

      <title>The Efficiency of Synchronization Dynamics and the Role of Network Syncreactivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Synchronization of coupled oscillators is a fundamental process in both natural and artificial networks. While much work has investigated the asymptotic stability of the synchronous solution, the fundamental question of the efficiency of the synchronization dynamics has received far less attention. Here we address this question in terms of both coupling efficiency and energy efficiency. We use our understanding of the transient dynamics towards synchronization to design a coupling-efficient and energy-efficient synchronization strategy, which varies the coupling strength dynamically, instead of using the same coupling strength at all times. Our proposed synchronization strategy is able in both simulation and in experiments to synchronize networks by using an average coupling strength that is significantly lower (and, when there is an upper bound on the coupling strength, significantly higher) than what is needed for the case of constant coupling. In either case, the improvement can be of orders of magnitude. In order to characterize the effects of the network topology on the transient dynamics towards synchronization, we propose the concept of network syncreactivity. This is distinct from the previously introduced network synchronizability, which describes the ability of a network to synchronize asymptotically. We classify real-world examples of complex networks in terms of both their synchronizability and syncreactivity.</description>

      <title>Phase control of escapes in the fractional damped Helmholtz oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the nonlinear Helmholtz oscillator in the presence of fractional damping, a characteristic feature in several physical situations. In our specific scenario, as well as in the non-fractional case, for large enough excitation amplitudes, all initial conditions are escaping from the potential well. To address this, we incorporate the phase control technique into a parametric term, a feature commonly encountered in real-world situations. In the non-fractional case it has been shown that, a phase difference of {\phi_{OPT}} \simeq {\pi}, is the optimal value to avoid the escapes of the particles from the potential well. Here, our investigation focuses on understanding when particles escape, considering both the phase difference {\phi} and the fractional parameter {\alpha} as control parameters. Our findings unveil the robustness of phase control, as evidenced by the consistent oscillation of the optimal {\phi} value around its non-fractional counterpart when varying the fractional parameter. Additionally, our results underscore the pivotal role of the fractional parameter in governing the proportion of bounded particles, even when utilizing the optimal phase.</description>

      <title>Transition from topological to chaos in the nonlinear Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies on topological materials are expanding into the nonlinear regime, while the central principle, namely the bulk-edge correspondence, is yet to be elucidated in the strongly nonlinear regime. Here, we reveal that nonlinear topological edge modes can exhibit the transition to spatial chaos by increasing nonlinearity, which can be a universal mechanism of the breakdown of the bulk-edge correspondence. Specifically, we unveil the underlying dynamical system describing the spatial distribution of zero modes and show the emergence of chaos. We also propose the correspondence between the absolute value of the topological invariant and the dimension of the stable manifold under sufficiently weak nonlinearity. Our results provide a general guiding principle to investigate the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence that can potentially be extended to arbitrary dimensions.</description>
