      <title>Learning to refine domain knowledge for biological network inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14436v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perturbation experiments allow biologists to discover causal relationships between variables of interest, but the sparsity and high dimensionality of these data pose significant challenges for causal structure learning algorithms. Biological knowledge graphs can bootstrap the inference of causal structures in these situations, but since they compile vastly diverse information, they can bias predictions towards well-studied systems. Alternatively, amortized causal structure learning algorithms encode inductive biases through data simulation and train supervised models to recapitulate these synthetic graphs. However, realistically simulating biology is arguably even harder than understanding a specific system. In this work, we take inspiration from both strategies and propose an amortized algorithm for refining domain knowledge, based on data observations. On real and synthetic datasets, we show that our approach outperforms baselines in recovering ground truth causal graphs and identifying errors in the prior knowledge with limited interventional data.</description>

      <title>Change-point detection in anomalous-diffusion trajectories utilising machine-learning-based uncertainty estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When recording the movement of individual animals, cells or molecules one will often observe changes in their diffusive behaviour at certain points in time along their trajectory. In order to capture the different diffusive modes assembled in such heterogeneous trajectories it becomes necessary to segment them by determining these change-points. Such a change-point detection can be challenging for conventional statistical methods, especially when the changes are subtle. We here apply Bayesian Deep Learning to obtain point-wise estimates of not only the anomalous diffusion exponent but also the uncertainties in these predictions from a single anomalous diffusion trajectory generated according to four theoretical models of anomalous diffusion. We show that we are able to achieve an accuracy similar to single-mode (without change-points) predictions as well as a well calibrated uncertainty predictions of this accuracy. Additionally, we find that the predicted uncertainties feature interesting behaviour at the change-points leading us to examine the capabilities of these predictions for change-point detection. While the series of predicted uncertainties on their own are not sufficient to improve change-point detection, they do lead to a performance boost when applied in combination with the predicted anomalous diffusion exponents.</description>

      <title>Modeling the mechanisms of antibody mixtures in viral infections: the cases of sequential homologous and heterologous dengue infections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Antibodies play an essential role in the immune response to viral infections, vaccination, or antibody therapy. Nevertheless, they can be either protective or harmful during the immune response. Moreover, competition or cooperation between mixed antibodies can enhance or reduce this protective or harmful effect. Using the laws of chemical reactions, we propose a new approach to modeling the antigen-antibody complex activity. The resulting expression covers not only purely competitive or purely independent binding but also synergistic binding which, depending on the antibodies, can promote either neutralization or enhancement of viral activity. We then integrate this expression of viral activity in a within-host model and investigate the existence of steady-states and their asymptotic stability. We complete our study with numerical simulations to illustrate different scenarios: firstly, where both antibodies are neutralizing, and secondly, where one antibody is neutralizing and the other enhancing. The results indicate that efficient viral neutralization is associated with purely independent antibody binding, whereas strong viral activity enhancement is expected in the case of purely competitive antibody binding. Finally, data collected during a secondary dengue infection were used to validate the model. The data set includes sequential measurements of virus and antibody titers during viremia in patients. Data fitting shows that the two antibodies are in strong competition, as the synergistic binding is low. This contributes to the high levels of virus titers and may explain the Antibody-Dependent Enhancement phenomenon. Other applications of the model may be considered, such as the efficacy of vaccines and antibody-based therapies.</description>

      <title>MolecularGPT: Open Large Language Model (LLM) for Few-Shot Molecular Property Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12950v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Molecular property prediction (MPP) is a fundamental and crucial task in drug discovery. However, prior methods are limited by the requirement for a large number of labeled molecules and their restricted ability to generalize for unseen and new tasks, both of which are essential for real-world applications. To address these challenges, we present MolecularGPT for few-shot MPP. From a perspective on instruction tuning, we fine-tune large language models (LLMs) based on curated molecular instructions spanning over 1000 property prediction tasks. This enables building a versatile and specialized LLM that can be adapted to novel MPP tasks without any fine-tuning through zero- and few-shot in-context learning (ICL). MolecularGPT exhibits competitive in-context reasoning capabilities across 10 downstream evaluation datasets, setting new benchmarks for few-shot molecular prediction tasks. More importantly, with just two-shot examples, MolecularGPT can outperform standard supervised graph neural network methods on 4 out of 7 datasets. It also excels state-of-the-art LLM baselines by up to 15.7% increase on classification accuracy and decrease of 17.9 on regression metrics (e.g., RMSE) under zero-shot. This study demonstrates the potential of LLMs as effective few-shot molecular property predictors. The code is available at https://github.com/NYUSHCS/MolecularGPT.</description>
