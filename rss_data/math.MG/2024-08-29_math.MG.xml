      <title>Iterated graph systems and the combinatorial Loewner property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce iterated graph systems which yield fractal spaces through a projective sequence of self-similar graphs. Our construction yields new examples of self-similar fractals, such as the pentagonal Sierpi\'nski carpet and a pillow-space, and it yields a new framework to study potential theory on many standard examples in the literature, including generalized Sierpi\'nski carpets. We demonstrate that a fractal arising from an iterated graph system satisfying mild geometric conditions and having enough reflection symmetries, satisfies the combinatorial Loewner property (CLP) of Bourdon and Kleiner. For certain exponents, one can also obtain the conductive homogeneity condition of Kigami. This shows, in a precise sense, that self-similarity and sufficient symmetry yields CLP.
  Furthermore, we show that our examples satisfy important asymptotic behaviors of discrete moduli. In particular, we establish the so-called super-multiplicative inequality for our examples - which when $p=2$ plays a crucial role in the study of Dirichlet forms and random walks on fractals. This implies the super-multiplicativity bound also for many fractals for which it was not known before, such as the Menger sponge. A particular feature here is using replacement flows and the notion of a flow basis. This yields a simpler way to establish many known estimates, and allows us to prove several new ones. Further, super-multiplicativity shows that one can effectively estimate the conformal dimensions numerically for many self-similar fractals.</description>

      <title>Holographic Foliations: Self-Similar Quasicrystals from Hyperbolic Honeycombs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete geometries in hyperbolic space are of longstanding interest in pure mathematics and have come to recent attention in holography, quantum information, and condensed matter physics. Working at a purely geometric level, we describe how any regular tessellation of ($d+1$)-dimensional hyperbolic space naturally admits a $d$-dimensional boundary geometry with self-similar ''quasicrystalline'' properties. In particular, the boundary geometry is described by a local, invertible, self-similar substitution tiling, that discretizes conformal geometry. We greatly refine an earlier description of these local substitution rules that appear in the 1D/2D example and use the refinement to give the first extension to higher dimensional bulks; including a detailed account for all regular 3D hyperbolic tessellations. We comment on global issues, including the reconstruction of bulk geometries from boundary data, and introduce the notion of a ''holographic foliation'': a foliation by a stack of self-similar quasicrystals, where the full geometry of the bulk (and of the foliation itself) is encoded in any single leaf in a local invertible way. In the $\{3,5,3\}$ tessellation of 3D hyperbolic space by regular icosahedra, we find a 2D boundary quasicrystal admitting points of 5-fold symmetry which is not the Penrose tiling, and record and comment on a related conjecture of William Thurston. We end with a large list of open questions for future analytic and numerical studies.</description>

      <title>A characterisation of graphs quasi-isometric to $K_4$-minor-free graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that there is a function $f$ such that every graph with no $K$-fat $K_4$ minor is $f(K)$-quasi-isometric to a graph with no $K_4$ minor. This solves the $K_4$-case of a general conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu. Our proof technique also yields a new short proof of the respective $K_4^-$-case, which was first established by Fujiwara and Papasoglu.</description>

      <title>Orthogonal Fourier Analysis on Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we go over the history of the Fuglede or Spectral Set Conjecture as it has developed over the last 30 years or so. We do not aim to be exhaustive and we do not cover important areas of development such as the results on the problem in classes of finite groups or the version of the problem that focuses on spectral measures instead of sets. The selection of the material has been strongly influenced by personal taste, history and capabilities. We are trying to be more descriptive than detailed and we point out several open questions.</description>

      <title>The Fourier transform of planar convex bodies and discrepancy over intervals of rotations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work investigates the relation between the Fourier transform of a planar convex body and its geometric properties. The second matter of study is the quadratic discrepancy of planar convex bodies, and we present sharp results on its asymptotic behaviour. In particular, averages over intervals of rotations are considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.15468v1 Announce Type: cross

We also prove integration by substitution, integration by parts and term-by-term integration and give examples of the properties.</description>

      <title>A nonlinear d'Alembert comparison theorem and causal differential calculus on metric measure spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15968v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a variational first-order Sobolev calculus on metric measure spacetimes. The key object is the maximal weak subslope of an arbitrary causal function, which plays the role of the (Lorentzian) modulus of its differential. It is shown to satisfy certain chain and Leibniz rules, certify a locality property, and be compatible with its smooth analog. In this setup, we propose a quadraticity condition termed infinitesimal Minkowskianity, which singles out genuinely Lorentzian structures among Lorentz-Finsler spacetimes. Moreover, we establish a comparison theorem for a nonlinear yet elliptic $p$-d'Alembertian in a weak form under the timelike measure contraction property. As a particular case, this extends Eschenburg's classical estimate past the timelike cut locus.</description>

      <title>An overview of maximal distance minimizers problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a compact $M \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ and $l &gt; 0$. A maximal distance minimizer problem is to find a connected compact set $\Sigma$ of the length (one-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\mathcal H$) at most $l$ that minimizes \[ \max_{y \in M} dist (y, \Sigma), \] where $dist$ stands for the Euclidean distance.
  We give a survey on the results on the maximal distance minimizers and related problems. Also we fill some natural gaps by showing NP-hardness of the maximal distance minimizing problem, establishing its $\Gamma$-convergence, considering the penalized form and discussing uniqueness of a solution. We finish with open questions.</description>

      <title>Products of hyperbolic spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14093v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The class of uniformly smooth hyperbolic spaces was recently introduced by Pinto as a common generalization of both CAT(0) spaces and uniformly smooth Banach spaces, in a way that Reich's theorem on resolvent convergence could still be proven. We define products of such spaces, showing that they are reasonably well-behaved. In this manner, we provide the first example of a space for which Reich's theorem holds and which is neither a CAT(0) space, nor a convex subset of a normed space.</description>
