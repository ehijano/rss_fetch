      <title>Physics-Informed Generative Approaches for Wireless Channel Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly popular in wireless communication systems for several applications. A critical bottleneck for designing ML systems for wireless communications is the availability of realistic wireless channel datasets, which are extremely resource intensive to produce. To this end, the generation of realistic wireless channels plays a key role in the subsequent design of effective ML algorithms for wireless communication systems. Generative models have been proposed to synthesize channel matrices, but outputs produced by such methods may not correspond to geometrically viable channels and do not provide any insight into the scenario of interest. In this work, we aim to address both these issues by integrating a parametric, physics-based geometric channel (PBGC) modeling framework with generative methods. To address limitations with gradient flow through the PBGC model, a linearized reformulation is presented, which ensures smooth gradient flow during generative model training, while also capturing insights about the underlying physical environment. We evaluate our model against prior baselines by comparing the generated samples in terms of the 2-Wasserstein distance and through the utility of generated data when used for downstream compression tasks.</description>

      <title>Gradient-Driven Graph Neural Networks for Learning Digital and Hybrid Precoder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) precoders is a widely recognized challenging problem. Existing work has demonstrated the potential of graph neural networks (GNNs) in learning precoding policies. However, existing GNNs often exhibit poor generalizability for the numbers of users or antennas. In this paper, we develop a gradient-driven GNN design method for the learning of fully digital and hybrid precoding policies. The proposed GNNs leverage two kinds of knowledge, namely the gradient of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) to the precoders and the permutation equivariant property of the precoding policy. To demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed method for accommodating different optimization objectives and different precoding policies, we first apply the proposed method to learn the fully digital precoding policies. We study two precoder optimization problems for spectral efficiency (SE) maximization and log-SE maximization to achieve proportional fairness. We then apply the proposed method to learn the hybrid precoding policy, where the gradients to analog and digital precoders are exploited for the design of the GNN. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods for learning different precoding policies and better generalization performance to the numbers of both users and antennas compared to baseline GNNs.</description>

      <title>Exploring the usage of Probabilistic Neural Networks for Ionospheric electron density estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fundamental limitation of traditional Neural Networks (NN) in predictive modelling is their inability to quantify uncertainty in their outputs. In critical applications like positioning systems, understanding the reliability of predictions is critical for constructing confidence intervals, early warning systems, and effectively propagating results. For instance, Precise Point Positioning in satellite navigation heavily relies on accurate error models for ancillary data (orbits, clocks, ionosphere, and troposphere) to compute precise error estimates. In addition, these uncertainty estimates are needed to establish robust protection levels in safety critical applications.
  To address this challenge, the main objectives of this paper aims at exploring a potential framework capable of providing both point estimates and associated uncertainty measures of ionospheric Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC). In this context, Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) offer a promising approach to achieve this goal. However, constructing an effective PNN requires meticulous design of hidden and output layers, as well as careful definition of prior and posterior probability distributions for network weights and biases.
  A key finding of this study is that the uncertainty provided by the PNN model in VTEC estimates may be systematically underestimated. In low-latitude areas, the actual error was observed to be as much as twice the model's estimate. This underestimation is expected to be more pronounced during solar maximum, correlating with increased VTEC values.</description>

      <title>A Novel Distributed PV Power Forecasting Approach Based on Time-LLM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems are essential for advancing renewable energy applications and achieving energy independence. Accurate DPV power forecasting can optimize power system planning and scheduling while significantly reducing energy loss, thus enhancing overall system efficiency and reliability. However, solar energy's intermittent nature and DPV systems' spatial distribution create significant forecasting challenges. Traditional methods often rely on costly external data, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP) and satellite images, which are difficult to scale for smaller DPV systems. To tackle this issue, this study has introduced an advanced large language model (LLM)-based time series forecasting framework Time-LLM to improve the DPV power forecasting accuracy and generalization ability. By reprogramming, the framework aligns historical power data with natural language modalities, facilitating efficient modeling of time-series data. Then Qwen2.5-3B model is integrated as the backbone LLM to process input data by leveraging its pattern recognition and inference abilities, achieving a balance between efficiency and performance. Finally, by using a flatten and linear projection layer, the LLM's high-dimensional output is transformed into the final forecasts. Experimental results indicate that Time-LLM outperforms leading recent advanced time series forecasting models, such as Transformer-based methods and MLP-based models, achieving superior accuracy in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Time-LLM also demonstrates exceptional adaptability in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to explore the application of LLMs to DPV power forecasting, which can offer a scalable solution that eliminates reliance on costly external data sources and improve real-world forecasting accuracy.</description>

      <title>Optimization of An Induced Magnetic Field-Based Positioning System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using oscillating magnetic fields for indoor positioning is a robust way to resist dynamic environments. This work presents the hard- and software-related optimizations of an induced magnetic field positioning system. We describe a new coil architecture for both the transmitter and receiver, reducing inter-axes cross-talk. A new analog circuit design on the receiver side attains an acceptable noise level and increases the detection range from 4m to 8m (the covered area is increased from $50m^2$ to $200m^2$). The median positioning error is reduced from 0.56~m to 0.25m in the near field with fingerprinting methods. Experiments in office and factory areas (including robotic and industrial equipment) demonstrate the system's robustness in large areas. This work aims to enlighten researchers working on the same topic with constructive optimization directions on their own induced magnetic field-based systems.</description>

      <title>Hybrid CNN-Dilated Self-attention Model Using Inertial and Body-Area Electrostatic Sensing for Gym Workout Recognition, Counting, and User Authentification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While human body capacitance ($HBC$) has been explored as a novel wearable motion sensing modality, its competence has never been quantitatively demonstrated compared to that of the dominant inertial measurement unit ($IMU$) in practical scenarios. This work is thus motivated to evaluate the contribution of $HBC$ in wearable motion sensing. A real-life case study, gym workout tracking, is described to assess the effectiveness of $HBC$ as a complement to $IMU$ in activity recognition. Fifty gym sessions from ten volunteers were collected, bringing a fifty-hour annotated $IMU$ and $HBC$ dataset. With a hybrid CNN-Dilated neural network model empowered with the self-attention mechanism, $HBC$ slightly improves accuracy to the $IMU$ for workout recognition and has substantial advantages over $IMU$ for repetition counting. This work helps to enhance the understanding of $HBC$, a novel wearable motion-sensing modality based on the body-area electrostatic field. All materials presented in this work are open-sourced to promote further study \footnote{https://github.com/zhaxidele/Toolkit-for-HBC-sensing}.</description>

      <title>Experimental Demonstration of Over the Air Federated Learning for Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) offers an exciting new direction over classical FL by averaging model weights using the physics of analog signal propagation. Since each participant broadcasts its model weights concurrently in time and frequency, this paradigm conserves communication bandwidth and model upload latency. Despite its potential, there is no prior large-scale demonstration on a real-world experimental platform. This paper proves for the first time that OTA-FL can be deployed in a cellular network setting within the constraints of a 5G compliant waveform. To achieve this, we identify challenges caused by multi-path fading effects, thermal noise at the radio devices, and maintaining highly precise synchronization across multiple clients to perform coherent OTA combining. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework for real-time channel estimation, model weight to OFDM symbol mapping and dual-layer synchronization interface to perform OTA model training. We experimentally validate OTA-FL using two relevant applications - Channel Estimation and Object Classification, at a large-scale on ORBIT Testbed and a portable setup respectively, along with analyzing the benefits from the perspective of a telecom operator. Under specific experimental conditions, OTA-FL achieves equivalent model performance, supplemented with 43 times improvement in spectrum utilization and 7 times improvement in energy efficiency over classical FL when considering 5 nodes.</description>

      <title>Pulse Processing -- Overview and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of irregularly spaced pulses of non-negligible width is a fascinating yet under-explored topic in signal processing. It sits adjacent to other core topics such as radar and symbol detection yet has its own distinctive challenges. Even modern techniques such as compressed sensing perform worse than may be expected on pulse processing problems. Real-world applications include nuclear spectroscopy, flow cytometry, seismic signal processing and neural spike sorting, and these in turn have applications to environmental radiation monitoring, surveying, diagnostic medicine, industrial imaging, biomedical imaging, top-down proteomics, and security screening, to name just a few. This overview paper endeavours to position the pulse processing problem in the context of signal processing. It also describes some current challenges in the field.</description>

      <title>UAV-Assisted Coverage Hole Detection Using Reinforcement Learning in Urban Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deployment of cellular networks in urban areas requires addressing various challenges. For example, high-rise buildings with varying geometrical shapes and heights contribute to signal attenuation, reflection, diffraction, and scattering effects. This creates a high possibility of coverage holes (CHs) within the proximity of the buildings. Detecting these CHs is critical for network operators to ensure quality of service, as customers in such areas experience weak or no signal reception. To address this challenge, we propose an approach using an autonomous vehicle, such as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), to detect CHs, for minimizing drive test efforts and reducing human labor. The UAV leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to find CHs using stored local building maps, its current location, and measured signal strengths. As the UAV moves, it dynamically updates its knowledge of the signal environment and its direction to a nearby CH while avoiding collisions with buildings. We created a wide range of testing scenarios using building maps from OpenStreetMap and signal strength data generated by NVIDIA Sionna raytracing simulations. The results demonstrate that the RL-based approach performs better than non-machine learning, geometry-based methods in detecting CHs in urban areas. Additionally, even with a limited number of UAV measurements, the method achieves performance close to theoretical upper bounds that assume complete knowledge of all signal strengths.</description>

      <title>Performance Analysis of Multi-IRS Aided Multiple Operator Systems at mmWave Frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are envisioned to enhance the performance of mmWave wireless systems. In practice, multiple mobile operators (MO) coexist in an area and provide simultaneous and independent services to user-equipments (UEs) on different frequency bands. Then, if each MO deploys an IRS to enhance its performance, the IRSs also alter the channels of UEs of other MOs. In this context, this paper addresses the following questions: can an MO still continue to control its IRS independently of other MOs and IRSs? Is joint optimization of IRSs deployed by different MOs and inter-MO cooperation needed? To that end, by considering the mmWave bands, we first derive the ergodic sum spectral efficiency (SE) in a $2$-MO system for the following schemes: 1) joint optimization of an overall phase angle of the IRSs with MO cooperation, 2) MO cooperation via time-sharing, and 3) no cooperation between the MOs. We find that even with no cooperation between the MOs, the performance of a given MO is not degraded by the presence of an out-of-band (OOB) MO deploying and independently controlling its own IRS. On the other hand, the SE gain obtained at a given MO using joint optimization and cooperation over the no-cooperation scheme decreases inversely with the number of elements in the IRS deployed by the other MO. We generalize our results to a multiple MO setup and show that the gain in the sum-SE over the no-cooperation case increases at least linearly with the number of OOB MOs. Finally, we numerically verify our findings and conclude that every MO can independently operate and tune its IRS; cooperation via optimizing an overall phase only brings marginal benefits in practice.</description>

      <title>Learning of Uplink Resource Allocation with Multiuser QoS Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the paper the joint optimization of uplink multiuser power and resource block (RB) allocation are studied, where each user has quality of service (QoS) constraints on both long- and short-blocklength transmissions. The objective is to minimize the consumption of RBs for meeting the QoS requirements, leading to a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. We resort to deep learning to solve the problem with low inference complexity. To provide a performance benchmark for learning based methods, we propose a hierarchical algorithm to find the global optimal solution in the single-user scenario, which is then extended to the multiuser scenario. The design of the learning method, however, is challenging due to the discrete policy to be learned, which results in either vanishing or exploding gradient during neural network training. We introduce two types of smoothing functions to approximate the involved discretizing processes and propose a smoothing parameter adaption method. Another critical challenge lies in guaranteeing the QoS constraints. To address it, we design a nonlinear function to intensify the penalties for minor constraint violations. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in reducing the number of occupied RBs and satisfying QoS constraints reliably.</description>

      <title>Intelligent Spectrum Sharing in Integrated TN-NTNs: A Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrating non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) with terrestrial networks (TNs) is key to enhancing coverage, capacity, and reliability in future wireless communications. However, the multi-tier, heterogeneous architecture of these integrated TN-NTNs introduces complex challenges in spectrum sharing and interference management. Conventional optimization approaches struggle to handle the high-dimensional decision space and dynamic nature of these networks. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework to address these challenges and enable intelligent spectrum sharing. The proposed framework leverages the inherent hierarchy of the network, with separate policies for each tier, to learn and optimize spectrum allocation decisions at different timescales and levels of abstraction. By decomposing the complex spectrum sharing problem into manageable sub-tasks and allowing for efficient coordination among the tiers, the HDRL approach offers a scalable and adaptive solution for spectrum management in future TN-NTNs. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework compared to traditional approaches, highlighting its potential to enhance spectral efficiency and network capacity in dynamic, multi-tier environments.</description>

      <title>Sphere Precoding for Robust Near-Field Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near-field communication with large antenna arrays promises significant beamforming and multiplexing gains. These communication links, however, are very sensitive to user mobility as any small change in the user position may suddenly drop the signal power. This leads to critical challenges for the robustness of these near-field communication systems. In this paper, we propose \textit{sphere precoding}, which is a robust precoding design to address user mobility in near-field communications. To gain insights into the spatial correlation of near-field channels, we extend the one-ring channel model to what we call one-sphere channel model and derive the channel covariance considering user mobility. Based on the one-sphere channel model, a robust precoding design problem is defined to optimize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) satisfaction probability among mobile users. By utilizing the eigen structure of channel covariance, we further design a relaxed convex problem to approximate the solution of the original non-convex problem. The low-complexity solution effectively shapes a sphere that maintains the signal power for the target user and also nulls its interference within spheres around the other users. Simulation results highlight the efficacy of the proposed solution in achieving robust precoding yet high achievable rates in near-field communication systems.</description>

      <title>Cell-Free MIMO-ISAC: Joint Location and Velocity Estimation and Fundamental CRLB Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates joint location and velocity estimation, along with their fundamental performance bounds analysis, in a cell-free multi-input multi-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. First, unlike existing studies that derive likelihood functions for target parameter estimation using continuous received signals, we formulate the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for radar sensing based on discrete received signals at a given sampling rate. Second, leveraging the proposed MLEs, we derive closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for joint location and velocity estimation in both single-target and multiple-target scenarios. Third, to enhance computational efficiency, we propose approximate CRLBs and conduct an in-depth accuracy analysis. Additionally, we thoroughly examine the impact of sampling rate, squared effective bandwidth, and time width on CRLB performance. For multiple-target scenarios, the concepts of safety distance and safety velocity are introduced to characterize conditions under which the CRLBs for multiple targets converge to their single target counterparts. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of the proposed CRLBs and the theoretical results using state-of-the-art waveforms, namely orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM).</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming and Compressed Sensing for Uplink Grant-Free Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compressed sensing (CS)-based techniques have been widely applied in the grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to a single-antenna base station (BS). In this paper, we consider the multi-antenna reception at the BS for uplink grant-free access for the massive machine type communication (mMTC) with limited channel resources. To enhance the overloading performance of the BS, we develop a general framework for the synergistic amalgamation of the spatial division multiple access (SDMA) technique with the CS-based grant-free NOMA. We derive a closed-form statistical beamforming and a dynamic beamforming scheme for the inter-cluster interference suppression when applying SDMA. Based on this, we further develop a joint adaptive beamforming and subspace pursuit (JABF-SP) algorithm for the multiuser detection and data recovery, with a novel sparsity level decision method without the accurate knowledge of the noise level. To further improve the data recovery performance, we propose an interference cancellation based J-ABF-SP scheme (J-ABF-SP-IC) by using the initial signal estimates generated from the J-ABF-SP algorithm. Illustrative simulations verify the superior user detection and signal recovery performance of our proposed algorithms in comparison with existing CS-based grant-free NOMA techniques.</description>

      <title>Physically Large Apertures for Wireless Power Transfer: Performance and Regulatory Aspects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising service for the Internet of Things, providing a cost-effective and sustainable solution to deploy so-called energy-neutral devices on a massive scale. The power received at the device side decays rapidly with the distance from a conventional transmit antenna with a physically small aperture. New opportunities arise from the transition from conventional far-field beamforming to near-field beam focusing. We argue that a "physically large" aperture, i.e., large w.r.t. the distance to the receiver, enables a power budget that remains practically independent of distance. Distance-dependent array gain patterns allow focusing the power density maximum precisely at the device location, while reducing the power density near the infrastructure. The physical aperture size is a key resource in enabling efficient yet regulatory-compliant WPT. We use real-world measurements to demonstrate that a regulatory-compliant system operating at sub-10GHz frequencies can increase the power received at the device into the milliwatt range. Our empirical demonstration shows that power-optimal near-field beam focusing inherently exploits multipath propagation, yielding both increased WPT efficiency and improved human exposure safety in real-world scenarios.</description>

      <title>Distributed Resource Block Allocation for Wideband Cell-free System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies distributed resource block (RB) allocation in wideband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) cell-free systems. We propose a novel distributed sequential algorithm and its two variants, which optimize RB allocation based on the information obtained through over-the-air (OTA) transmissions between access points (APs) and user equipments, enabling local decision updates at each AP. To reduce the overhead of OTA transmission, we further develop a distributed deep learning (DL)-based method to learn the RB allocation policy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed distributed algorithms perform close to the centralized algorithm, while the DL-based method outperforms existing baseline methods.</description>

      <title>Graph Neural Network for Location- and Orientation-Assisted mmWave Beam Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, the main bottlenecks of location- and orientation-assisted beam alignment using deep neural networks (DNNs) are large training overhead and significant performance degradation. This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-based beam selection approach that reduces the training overhead and improves the alignment accuracy, by capitalizing on the strong expressive ability and few trainable parameters of GNN. The channels of beams are correlated according to the beam direction. Therefore, we establish a graph according to the angular correlation between beams and use GNN to capture the channel correlation between adjacent beams, which helps accelerate the learning process and enhance the beam alignment performance. Compared to existing DNN-based algorithms, the proposed method requires only 20\% of the dataset size to achieve equivalent accuracy and improves the Top-1 accuracy by 10\% when using the same dataset.</description>

      <title>Graph Chirp Signal and Graph Fractional Vertex-Frequency Energy Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) has emerged as a powerful framework for analyzing data on irregular domains. In recent years, many classical techniques in signal processing (SP) have been successfully extended to GSP. Among them, chirp signals play a crucial role in various SP applications. However, graph chirp signals have not been formally defined despite their importance. Here, we define graph chirp signals and establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for their analysis. We propose the graph fractional vertex-frequency energy distribution (GFED), which provides a powerful tool for processing and analyzing graph chirp signals. We introduce the general fractional graph distribution (GFGD), a generalized vertex-frequency distribution, and the reduced interference GFED, which can suppress cross-term interference and enhance signal clarity. Furthermore, we propose a novel method for detecting graph signals through GFED domain filtering, facilitating robust detection and analysis of graph chirp signals in noisy environments. Moreover, this method can be applied to real-world data for denoising more effective than some state-of-the-arts, further demonstrating its practical significance.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Extensive Cancellation Algorithm and Harmonic Enhanced Heart Rate Estimation based on MMWave Radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heart rate (HR) monitoring is crucial for assessing physical fitness, cardiovascular health, and stress management. Millimeter-wave radar offers a promising noncontact solution for long-term monitoring. However, accurate HR estimation remains challenging in low signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) conditions. To deal with both respiration harmonics and intermodulation interference, this paper proposes a cancellation-before-estimation strategy. Firstly, we present the adaptive extensive cancellation algorithm (ECA) to suppress respiratory and its low-order harmonics. Then, we propose an adaptive harmonic enhanced trace (AHET) method to avoid intermodulation interference by refining the HR search region. Various experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating improvements in accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to conventional approaches based on the FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) system</description>

      <title>Frequency Diverse Array OFDM Transmit System with Partial Overlap in Frequency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frequency-diverse array (FDA) is an alternative array architecture in which each antenna is preceded by a mixer instead of a phase shifter. The mixers introduce a frequency offset between signals transmitted by each antenna resulting in a time-varying beam pattern. However, time-dependent beamforming is not desirable for communication or sensing. In this paper, the FDA is combined with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. The proposed beamforming method splits the OFDM symbol transmitted by all antennas into subcarrier blocks, which are precoded differently. The selected frequency offset between the antennas results in overlap and coherent summation of the differently precoded subcarrier blocks. This allows to achieve fully digital beamforming over a single block with the use of a single digital-to-analog converter. The system's joint communication and sensing performance is evaluated and sensitivity to errors is studied.</description>

      <title>Aliased Time-Modulated Array OFDM System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The time-modulated array is a simple array architecture in which each antenna is connected to an RF switch that serves as a modulator. The phase shift is achieved by digitally controlling the relative delay between the periodic modulating sequences of the antennas. The practical use of this architecture is limited by two factors. First, the switching frequency is high, as it must be a multiple of the sampling frequency. Second, the discrete modulating sequence introduces undesired harmonic replicas of the signal with non-negligible power. In this paper, aliasing is exploited to simultaneously reduce sideband radiation and switching frequency. To facilitate coherent combining of aliased signal blocks, the transmit signal has a repeated block structure in the frequency domain. As a result, a factor $A$ reduction in switching frequency is achieved at the cost of a factor $A$ reduction in communication capacity. Doubling $A$ reduces sideband radiation by around 2.9 dB.</description>

      <title>Secure Wireless-Powered zeRIS Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of wireless-powered zero-energy reconfigurable intelligent surface (zeRIS), and investigates a wireless-powered zeRIS aided communication system in terms of security, reliability and energy efficiency. In particular, we propose three new wireless-powered zeRIS modes: 1) in mode-I, N reconfigurable reflecting elements are adjusted to the optimal phase shift design of information user to maximize the reliability of the system; 2) in mode-II, N reconfigurable reflecting elements are adjusted to the optimal phase shift design of cooperative jamming user to maximize the security of the system; 3) in mode-III, N1 and N2 (N1+N2=N) reconfigurable reflecting elements are respectively adjusted to the optimal phase shift designs of information user and cooperative jamming user to balance the reliability and security of the system. Then, we propose three new metrics, i.e., joint outage probability (JOP), joint intercept probability (JIP), and secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), and analyze their closed-form expressions in three modes, respectively. The results show that under high transmission power, all the diversity gains of three modes are 1, and the JOPs of mode-I, mode-II and mode-III are improved by increasing the number of zeRIS elements, which are related to N2, N, and N^2_1, respectively. In addition, mode-I achieves the best JOP, while mode-II achieves the best JIP among three modes. We exploit two security-reliability trade-off (SRT) metrics, i.e., JOP versus JIP, and normalized joint intercept and outage probability (JIOP), to reveal the SRT performance of the proposed three modes. It is obtained that mode-II outperforms the other two modes in the JOP versus JIP, while mode-III and mode-II achieve the best performance of normalized JIOP at low and high transmission power, respectively.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Calibration Technique for Quantitative Inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative inversion algorithms allow for the reconstruction of electrical properties (such as permittivity, and conductivity) for every point in a scene. However, they are challenging to use on measured datasets due to the need to know the incident wave field in the scene. In general, this is unknown due to factors such as antenna characteristics, path loss, waveform factors, etc. In this paper, we introduce a scalar calibration factor to account for these factors. To solve for the calibration factor, we augment the inversion procedure by including the forward problem, which we solve by training a simple feed-forward fully connected neural network to learn a mapping between the underlying permittivity distribution and the scattered field at the radar. We then minimize the mismatch between the measured and simulated fields to optimize the scalar calibration factor for each transmitter. We use the Fresnel Institute dataset to test our algorithm.</description>

      <title>ECNN: A Low-complex, Adjustable CNN for Industrial Pump Monitoring Using Vibration Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07401v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Industrial pumps are essential components in various sectors, such as manufacturing, energy production, and water treatment, where their failures can cause significant financial and safety risks. Anomaly detection can be used to reduce those risks and increase reliability. In this work, we propose a novel enhanced convolutional neural network (ECNN) to predict the failure of an industrial pump based on the vibration data captured by an acceleration sensor. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed with a focus on low complexity to enable its implementation on edge devices with limited computational resources. Therefore, a detailed design space exploration is performed to find a topology satisfying the trade-off between complexity and accuracy. Moreover, to allow for adaptation to unknown pumps, our algorithm features a pump-specific parameter that can be determined by a small set of normal data samples. Finally, we combine the ECNN with a threshold approach to further increase the performance and satisfy the application requirements. As a result, our combined approach significantly outperforms a traditional statistical approach and a classical CNN in terms of accuracy. To summarize, this work provides a novel, low-complex, CNN-based algorithm that is enhanced by classical methods to offer high accuracy for anomaly detection of industrial pumps.</description>

      <title>Utilizing High Sampling Rate ADCs for Cost Efficient MIMO Radios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07471v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the past decade, $&gt;$1 Gsps ADCs have become commonplace and are used in many modern 5G base station chips. A major driving force behind this adoption is the benefits of digital up/down-conversion and improved digital filtering. Recent works have also advocated for utilizing this high sampling bandwidth to fit-in multiple MIMO streams, and reduce the number of ADCs required to build MIMO base-stations. This can potentially reduce the cost of Massive MIMO RUs, since ADCs are the most expensive electronics in the base-station radio chain. However, these recent works do not model the necessary decimation filters that exist in the signal path of these high sampling rate ADCs. We show in this short paper that because of the decimation filters, there can be introduction of cross-talks which can hinder the performance of these shared ADC interfaces. We simulate the shared ADC interface with Matlab 5G toolbox for uplink MIMO, and show that these cross-talks can be mitigated by performing MMSE equalization atop the PUSCH estimated channels.</description>

      <title>Joint Sampling Frequency Offset Estimation and Compensation Based on the Farrow Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a sampling frequency offset (SFO) estimation method based on the Farrow structure, which is typically utilized for the SFO compensation and thereby enables a reduction of the implementation complexity of the SFO estimation. The proposed method is implemented in the time domain and works for arbitrary bandlimited signals, thus with no additional constraints on the waveform structure. Moreover, it can operate on only the real or imaginary part of a complex signal, which further reduces the estimation complexity. Furthermore, the proposed method can simultaneously estimate the SFO and additional sampling time offset (STO) and it is insensitive to other synchronization errors, like carrier frequency offset. Both the derivations of the proposed method and its implementation are presented, and through simulation examples, it is demonstrated that it can accurately estimate both SFO and STO for different types of bandlimited signals.</description>

      <title>From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part III: Stochastic Process Modeling and Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05799v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This is the third part of a series of studies that model the target trajectory, which describes the target state evolution over continuous time, as a sample path of a stochastic process (SP). By adopting a deterministic-stochastic decomposition framework, we decompose the learning of the trajectory SP into two sequential stages: the first fits the deterministic trend of the trajectory using a curve function of time, while the second estimates the residual stochastic component through parametric learning of either a Gaussian process (GP) or Student's-$t$ process (StP). This leads to a Markov-free data-driven tracking approach that produces the continuous-time trajectory with minimal prior knowledge of the target dynamics. Notably, our approach explicitly models both the temporal correlations of the state sequence and of measurement noises through the SP framework. It does not only take advantage of the smooth trend of the target but also makes use of the long-term temporal correlation of both the data noise and the model fitting error. Simulations in four maneuvering target tracking scenarios have demonstrated its effectiveness and superiority in comparison with existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Decadal analysis of sea surface temperature patterns, climatology, and anomalies in temperate coastal waters with Landsat-8 TIRS observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05843v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) is a fundamental physical parameter characterising the thermal state of sea surface. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat-8, with its 100-meter spatial resolution, offers a unique opportunity to uncover fine-scale coastal SST patterns that would otherwise be overlooked by coarser-resolution thermal sensors. In this study, we first develop an operational approach for SST retrieval from the TIRS sensor, and subsequently propose a novel algorithm for establishing daily SST climatology which serves as the baseline to detect anomalous SST events. We applied the proposed methods to temperate coastal waters in South Australia for the ten-year period from 2014 to 2023. For ground validation purposes, a buoy was deployed off the coast of Port Lincoln, South Australia, to record in-situ time-series SST. The spatiotemporal patterns of SST in the study area were analysed based on the ten years of satellite-derived SST imagery. The daily baseline climatology of SST with 100 m resolution was constructed, which allowed for the detection and analysis of anomalous SST events during the study period of 2014-2023. Our results suggest the following: (1) the satellite-derived SST data, generated with the proposed algorithm, aligned well with the in-situ measured SST values; (2) the semi-enclosed, shallow regions of Upper Spencer Gulf and Upper St Vincent Gulf showed higher temperatures during summer and cooler temperatures during winter than waters closer to the open ocean, resulting in a higher seasonal variation in SST; (3) the near-shore shallow areas in Spencer Gulf and St Vincent Gulf, and regions surrounding Kangaroo Island, were identified to have a higher probability of SST anomalies compared to the rest of the study area; and (4) anomalous SST events were more likely to happen during the warm months than the cool months.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Thin-Film Wafer Inspection With A Multi-Sensor Array And Robot Constraint Maintenance</title>

Abstract: Thin-film inspection on large-area substrates in coating manufacture remains a critical parameter to ensure product quality; however, extending the inspection process precisely over a large area presents major challenges, due to the limitations of the available inspection equipment. An additional manipulation problem arises when automating the inspection process, as the silicon wafer requires movement constraints to ensure accurate measurements and to prevent damage. Furthermore, there are other increasingly important large-area industrial applications, such as Roll-to-Roll (R2R) manufacturing where coating thickness inspection introduces additional challenges. This paper presents an autonomous inspection system using a robotic manipulator with a novel learned constraint manifold to control a wafer to its calibration point, and a novel multi-sensor array with high potential for scalability into large substrate areas. We demonstrate that the manipulator can perform required motions whilst adhering to movement constraints. We further demonstrate that the sensor array can perform thickness measurements statically with an error of $&lt;2\%$ compared to a commercial reflectometer, and through the use of a manipulator can dynamically detect angle variations $&gt;0.5^\circ$ from the calibration point whilst monitoring the RMSE and $R^2$ over 1406 data points. These features are potentially useful for detecting displacement variations in R2R manufacturing processes.</description>

      <title>Generative Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Policy Optimization: Decentralized Wireless Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces. Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 55% lower average policy error (APE), 35% faster convergence, 50% reduced runtime complexity, and 45% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.</description>

      <title>Biased Federated Learning under Wireless Heterogeneity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06078v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework for distributed learning, enabling collaborative model training without sharing private data. Existing wireless FL works primarily adopt two communication strategies: (1) over-the-air (OTA) computation, which exploits wireless signal superposition for simultaneous gradient aggregation, and (2) digital communication, which allocates orthogonal resources for gradient uploads. Prior works on both schemes typically assume \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) to enforce zero-bias updates or permit uncontrolled bias, resulting in suboptimal performance and high-variance model updates in \emph{heterogeneous} environments, where devices with poor channel conditions slow down convergence. This paper addresses FL over heterogeneous wireless networks by proposing novel OTA and digital FL updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias, thereby reducing variance in FL updates. We analyze their convergence under a unified framework and derive an upper bound on the model ``optimality error", which explicitly quantifies the effect of bias and variance in terms of design parameters. Next, to optimize this trade-off, we study a non-convex optimization problem and develop a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based framework to jointly optimize the design parameters. We perform extensive numerical evaluations with several related design variants and state-of-the-art OTA and digital FL schemes. Our results confirm that minimizing the bias-variance trade-off while allowing a structured bias provides better FL convergence performance than existing schemes.</description>

      <title>Wireless Hallucination in Generative AI-enabled Communications: Concepts, Issues, and Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is driving the intelligence of wireless communications. Due to data limitations, random generation, and dynamic environments, GenAI may generate channel information or optimization strategies that violate physical laws or deviate from actual real-world requirements. We refer to this phenomenon as wireless hallucination, which results in invalid channel information, spectrum wastage, and low communication reliability but remains underexplored. To address this gap, this article provides a comprehensive concept of wireless hallucinations in GenAI-driven communications, focusing on hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we first introduce the fundamental, analyze its causes based on the GenAI workflow, and propose mitigation solutions at the data, model, and post-generation levels. Then, we systematically examines representative hallucination scenarios in GenAI-enabled communications and their corresponding solutions. Finally, we propose a novel integrated mitigation solution for GenAI-based channel estimation. At the data level, we establish a channel estimation hallucination dataset and employ generative adversarial networks (GANs)-based data augmentation. Additionally, we incorporate attention mechanisms and large language models (LLMs) to enhance both training and inference performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid solutions reduce the normalized mean square error (NMSE) by 0.19, effectively reducing wireless hallucinations.</description>

      <title>Momentum-based Distributed Resource Scheduling Optimization Subject to Sector-Bound Nonlinearity and Latency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes an accelerated consensus-based distributed iterative algorithm for resource allocation and scheduling. The proposed gradient-tracking algorithm introduces an auxiliary variable to add momentum towards the optimal state. We prove that this solution is all-time feasible, implying that the coupling constraint always holds along the algorithm iterative procedure; therefore, the algorithm can be terminated at any time. This is in contrast to the ADMM-based solutions that meet constraint feasibility asymptotically. Further, we show that the proposed algorithm can handle possible link nonlinearity due to logarithmically-quantized data transmission (or any sign-preserving odd sector-bound nonlinear mapping). We prove convergence over uniformly-connected dynamic networks (i.e., a hybrid setup) that may occur in mobile and time-varying multi-agent networks. Further, the latency issue over the network is addressed by proposing delay-tolerant solutions. To our best knowledge, accelerated momentum-based convergence, nonlinear linking, all-time feasibility, uniform network connectivity, and handling (possible) time delays are not altogether addressed in the literature. These contributions make our solution practical in many real-world applications.</description>

      <title>Efficient Robust Adaptive Beamforming Based on Spatial Sampling with Virtual Sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) based on interference-plus-noise covariance (IPNC) matrix reconstruction can experience serious performance degradation in the presence of look direction and array geometry mismatches, particularly when the input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large. In this work, we present a RAB technique to address covariance matrix reconstruction problems. The proposed method involves IPNC matrix reconstruction using a low-complexity spatial sampling process (LCSSP) and employs a virtual received array vector. In particular, we devise a power spectrum sampling strategy based on a projection matrix computed in a higher dimension. A key feature of the proposed LCSSP technique is to avoid reconstruction of the IPNC matrix by integrating over the angular sector of the interference-plus-noise region. Simulation results are shown and discussed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed LCSSP method against existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Teager Energy Operator as a Metric to Evaluate Local Synchronization of Power System Devices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel formulation to evaluate the local synchronization of power system devices, namely Synchronization Energy (SE). The formulation is derived based on the complex frequency concept and the Teager Energy Operator applied to the complex power. This formulation offers valuable insights into the relationship between complex frequency of voltage and current of the device and its stationary operating. Based on this relationship we derive the conditions for a novel definition of local synchronization of power system devices. Through various case studies, the paper demonstrates how SE can effectively assess local synchronization under diverse operating conditions.</description>

      <title>Hardware-Accelerated Event-Graph Neural Networks for Low-Latency Time-Series Classification on SoC FPGA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As the quantities of data recorded by embedded edge sensors grow, so too does the need for intelligent local processing. Such data often comes in the form of time-series signals, based on which real-time predictions can be made locally using an AI model. However, a hardware-software approach capable of making low-latency predictions with low power consumption is required. In this paper, we present a hardware implementation of an event-graph neural network for time-series classification. We leverage an artificial cochlea model to convert the input time-series signals into a sparse event-data format that allows the event-graph to drastically reduce the number of calculations relative to other AI methods. We implemented the design on a SoC FPGA and applied it to the real-time processing of the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset to benchmark our approach against competitive solutions. Our method achieves a floating-point accuracy of 92.7% on the SHD dataset for the base model, which is only 2.4% and 2% less than the state-of-the-art models with over 10% and 67% fewer model parameters, respectively. It also outperforms FPGA-based spiking neural network implementations by 19.3% and 4.5%, achieving 92.3% accuracy for the quantised model while using fewer computational resources and reducing latency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.06651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores the emerging research direction of electromagnetic information theory (EIT), which aims to integrate traditional Shannon-based methodologies with physical consistency, particularly the electromagnetic properties of communication channels. We propose an EIT-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) paradigm that enhances conventional spatially-discrete MIMO models by incorporating the concepts of electromagnetic (EM) precoding and EM combining. This approach aims to improve the modeling of next-generation systems while remaining consistent with Shannon's theoretical foundations. We explore typical EIT applications, such as densely spaced MIMO, near-field communications, and tri-polarized antennas, and analyze their channel characteristics through theoretical simulations and measured datasets. The paper also discusses critical research challenges and opportunities for EIT applications from an industrial perspective, emphasizing the field's potential for practical applications.</description>

      <title>Scalable Integrated Sensing and Communications for Multi-Target Detection and Tracking in Cell-Free Massive MIMO: A Unified Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system where distributed access points (APs) perform integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) tasks, enabling simultaneous user communication and target detection/tracking. A unified framework and signal model are developed for the detection of potential targets and tracking of previously detected ones, even in arbitrary positions. Leveraging the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test technique, novel detection/tracking algorithms are proposed to handle unknown target responses and interference. Scalable AP-user and AP-target association rules are evaluated, explicitly considering multi-zone sensing scenarios. Additionally, a scalable power control mechanism extends fractional power control principles to ISAC, balancing power allocation between communication and sensing tasks. For benchmarking, a non-scalable power control optimization problem is also formulated to maximize the minimum user data rate while ensuring a Quality of Service constraint for sensing, solved via successive convex approximation. Extensive numerical results validate the proposed framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in both communication and sensing, revealing the impact of interference from other targets, and highlighting fundamental trade-offs between sensing and communication performance.</description>

      <title>Weighted Codebook Scheme for RIS-Assisted Point-to-Point MIMO Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) can reshape the characteristics of wireless channels by intelligently regulating the phase shifts of reflecting elements. Recently, various codebook schemes have been utilized to optimize the reflection coefficients (RCs); however, the selection of the optimal codeword is usually obtained by evaluating a metric of interest. In this letter, we propose a novel weighted design on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook to obtain the optimal RCs for RIS-assisted point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, we first introduce a channel training protocol where we configure the RIS RCs using the DFT codebook to obtain a set of observations through the uplink training process. Secondly, based on these observed samples, the Lagrange multiplier method is utilized to optimize the weights in an iterative manner, which could result in a higher channel capacity for assisting in the downlink data transmission. Thirdly, we investigate the effect of different codeword configuration orders on system performance and design an efficient codeword configuration method based on statistical channel state information (CSI). Finally, numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Optimization for Cross Subcarrier Precoder Design with Channel Smoothing in Massive MIMO-OFDM System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a cross subcarrier precoder design (CSPD) for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The aim is to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) performance while considering the smoothness of the frequency domain effective channel. To quantify the smoothness of the effective channel, we introduce a delay indicator function to measure the large delay components of the effective channel. An optimization problem is then formulated to balance the WSR performance and the delay indicator function. By appropriately selecting the weight factors in the objective function and the parameters in the delay indicator function, the delay spread of the effective channel can be reduced, thereby enhancing the smoothness of the effective channel. To solve the optimization problem, we apply the symplectic optimization, which achieves faster convergence compared to the gradient descent methods. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves satisfying WSR performance while maintaining the smoothness of the effective channel.</description>

Abstract: In this letter, we investigate a coordinated multiple point (CoMP)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that supports multiple users and targets. Multiple base stations (BSs) employ a coordinated power allocation strategy to serve their associated single-antenna communication users (CUs) while utilizing the echo signals for joint radar target (RT) detection. The probability of detection (PoD) of the CoMP-ISAC system is then proposed for assessing the sensing performance. To maximize the sum rate while ensuring the PoD for each RT and adhering to the total transmit power budget across all BSs, we introduce an efficient power allocation strategy. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the analytical findings, demonstrating that the proposed power allocation scheme effectively enhances the sum rate while satisfying the sensing requirements.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Beyond Diagonal RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising architecture for further improving spectral efficiency (SE) with low cost and power consumption. However, conventional RIS has inevitable limitations due to its capability of only reflecting signals. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), with its ability to both reflect and transmit signals, has gained great attention. This correspondence focuses on using BD-RIS to improve the sum SE of CF mMIMO systems. This requires completing the beamforming design under the transmit power constraints and unitary constraints of the BD-RIS, by optimizing active and passive beamformer simultaneously. To tackle this issue, we introduce an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes it using fractional programming and solves the subproblems alternatively. Moreover, to address the challenge introduced by the unitary constraint on the beamforming matrix of the BD-RIS, a manifold optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem optimally. Simulation results show that BD-RISs outperform RISs comprehensively, especially in the case of the full connected architecture which achieves the best performance, enhancing the sum SE by around 40% compared to ideal RISs.</description>

      <title>Virtual VNA 3.0: Unambiguous Scattering Matrix Estimation for Non-Reciprocal Systems by Leveraging Tunable and Coupled Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07239v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the "Virtual VNA 3.0" technique for estimating the scattering matrix of a \textit{non-reciprocal}, linear, passive, time-invariant device under test (DUT) with $N$ monomodal ports using a single measurement setup involving a vector network analyzer (VNA) with only $N_\mathrm{A}&lt;N$ ports -- thus eliminating the need for any reconnections. We partition the DUT ports into $N_\mathrm{A}$ "accessible" and $N_\mathrm{S}$ "not-directly-accessible" (NDA) ports. We connect the accessible ports to the VNA and the NDA ports to the "virtual VNA ports" of a VNA Extension Kit. This kit enables each NDA port to be terminated with three distinct individual loads or connected to neighboring DUT ports via coupled loads. We derive both a closed-form and a gradient-descent method to estimate the complete scattering matrix of the non-reciprocal DUT from measurements conducted with the $N_\mathrm{A}$-port VNA under various NDA-port terminations. We validate both methods experimentally for $N_\mathrm{A}=N_\mathrm{S}=4$, where our DUT is a complex eight-port transmission-line network comprising circulators. Altogether, the presented "Virtual VNA 3.0" technique constitutes a scalable approach to unambiguously characterize a many-port \textit{non-reciprocal} DUT with a few-port VNA (only $N_\mathrm{A}&gt;1$ is required) -- without any tedious and error-prone manual reconnections susceptible to inaccuracies. The VNA Extension Kit requirements match those for the "Virtual VNA 2.0" technique that was limited to reciprocal DUTs.</description>

      <title>Semantic Communications with Computer Vision Sensing for Edge Video Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of vision sensors in edge applications, such as surveillance, the transmission of video data consumes substantial spectrum resources. Semantic communication (SC) offers a solution by extracting and compressing information at the semantic level, preserving the accuracy and relevance of transmitted data while significantly reducing the volume of transmitted information. However, traditional SC methods face inefficiencies due to the repeated transmission of static frames in edge videos, exacerbated by the absence of sensing capabilities, which results in spectrum inefficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a SC with computer vision sensing (SCCVS) framework for edge video transmission. The framework first introduces a compression ratio (CR) adaptive SC (CRSC) model, capable of adjusting CR based on whether the frames are static or dynamic, effectively conserving spectrum resources. Additionally, we implement an object detection and semantic segmentation models-enabled sensing (OSMS) scheme, which intelligently senses the changes in the scene and assesses the significance of each frame through in-context analysis. Hence, The OSMS scheme provides CR prompts to the CRSC model based on real-time sensing results. Moreover, both CRSC and OSMS are designed as lightweight models, ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained sensors commonly used in practical edge applications. Experimental simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed SCCVS framework, demonstrating its ability to enhance transmission efficiency without sacrificing critical semantic information.</description>

      <title>Federated Learning in NTNs: Design, Architecture and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07272v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are emerging as a core component of future 6G communication systems, providing global connectivity and supporting data-intensive applications. In this paper, we propose a distributed hierarchical federated learning (HFL) framework within the NTN architecture, leveraging a high altitude platform station (HAPS) constellation as intermediate distributed FL servers. Our framework integrates both low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and ground clients in the FL training process while utilizing geostationary orbit (GEO) and medium-Earth orbit (MEO) satellites as relays to exchange FL global models across other HAPS constellations worldwide, enabling seamless, global-scale learning. The proposed framework offers several key benefits: (i) enhanced privacy through the decentralization of the FL mechanism by leveraging the HAPS constellation, (ii) improved model accuracy and reduced training loss while balancing latency, (iii) increased scalability of FL systems through ubiquitous connectivity by utilizing MEO and GEO satellites, and (iv) the ability to use FL data, such as resource utilization metrics, to further optimize the NTN architecture from a network management perspective. A numerical study demonstrates the proposed framework's effectiveness, with improved model accuracy, reduced training loss, and efficient latency management. The article also includes a brief review of FL in NTNs and highlights key challenges and future research directions.</description>

      <title>Impact of Microphone Array Mismatches to Learning-based Replay Speech Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generalization of a multi-channel learning-based replay speech detector, which employs adaptive beamforming and detection, across different microphone arrays. In general, deep neural network-based microphone array processing techniques generalize poorly to unseen array types, i.e., showing a significant training-test mismatch of performance. We employ the ReMASC dataset to analyze performance degradation due to inter- and intra-device mismatches, assessing both single- and multi-channel configurations. Furthermore, we explore fine-tuning to mitigate the performance loss when transitioning to unseen microphone arrays. Our findings reveal that array mismatches significantly decrease detection accuracy, with intra-device generalization being more robust than inter-device. However, fine-tuning with as little as ten minutes of target data can effectively recover performance, providing insights for practical deployment of replay detection systems in heterogeneous automatic speaker verification environments.</description>

      <title>Open-Set Gait Recognition from Sparse mmWave Radar Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The adoption of Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) radar devices for human sensing, particularly gait recognition, has recently gathered significant attention due to their efficiency, resilience to environmental conditions, and privacy-preserving nature. In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of Open-set Gait Recognition (OSGR) from sparse mmWave radar point clouds. Unlike most existing research, which assumes a closed-set scenario, our work considers the more realistic open-set case, where unknown subjects might be present at inference time, and should be correctly recognized by the system. Point clouds are well-suited for edge computing applications with resource constraints, but are more significantly affected by noise and random fluctuations than other representations, like the more common micro-Doppler signature. This is the first work addressing open-set gait recognition with sparse point cloud data. To do so, we propose a novel neural network architecture that combines supervised classification with unsupervised reconstruction of the point clouds, creating a robust, rich, and highly regularized latent space of gait features. To detect unknown subjects at inference time, we introduce a probabilistic novelty detection algorithm that leverages the structured latent space and offers a tunable trade-off between inference speed and prediction accuracy. Along with this paper, we release mmGait10, an original human gait dataset featuring over five hours of measurements from ten subjects, under varied walking modalities. Extensive experimental results show that our solution attains F1-Score improvements by 24% over state-of-the-art methods, on average, and across multiple openness levels.</description>

      <title>Interference-Aware Super-Constellation Design for NOMA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has gained significant attention as a potential next-generation multiple access technique. However, its implementation with finite-alphabet inputs faces challenges. Particularly, due to inter-user interference, superimposed constellations may have overlapping symbols leading to high bit error rates when successive interference cancellation (SIC) is applied. To tackle the issue, this paper employs autoencoders to design interference-aware super-constellations. Unlike conventional methods where superimposed constellation may have overlapping symbols, the proposed autoencoder-based NOMA (AE-NOMA) is trained to design super-constellations with distinguishable symbols at receivers, regardless of channel gains. The proposed architecture removes the need for SIC, allowing maximum likelihood-based approaches to be used instead. The paper presents the conceptual architecture, loss functions, and training strategies for AE-NOMA. Various test results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of interference-aware constellations in improving the bit error rate, indicating the adaptability of AE-NOMA to different channel scenarios and its promising potential for implementing NOMA systems</description>

Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) mobile communications have attracted substantial attention in the global research community of information and communication technologies (ICT). 6G systems are expected to support not only extended 5G usage scenarios, but also new usage scenarios, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and communication, and communication and ubiquitous connectivity. To realize this goal, channel characteristics must be comprehensively studied and properly exploited, so as to promote the design, standardization, and optimization of 6G systems. In this paper, we first summarize the requirements and challenges in 6G channel research. Our focus is on channels for five promising technologies enabling 6G, including terahertz (THz), extreme MIMO (E-MIMO), ISAC, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), and space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). Then, a survey of the progress of the 6G channel research regarding the above five promising technologies is presented in terms of the latest measurement campaigns, new characteristics, modeling methods, and research prospects. Moreover, a tutorial on the 6G channel simulations is presented. We introduce the BUPTCMCCCMG-IMT2030, a 6G link-level channel simulator, developed based on the ITU/3GPP 3D geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) methodology. The simulator supports the channel simulation of the aforementioned 6G potential technologies. To facilitate the use of the simulator, the tutorial encompasses the design framework, user guidelines, and application examples. This paper offers in-depth, hands-on insights into the best practices of channel measurements, modeling, and simulations for the evaluation of 6G technologies, the development of 6G standards, and the implementation and optimization of 6G systems.</description>

      <title>A Model Fusion Distributed Kalman Filter For Non-Gaussian Observation Noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.11476v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) represent a critical research domain within the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The distributed Kalman filter (DKF) has garnered significant attention as an information fusion method for WSNs. However, effectively handling non-Gaussian environments remains a crucial challenge for DKF. This paper proposes a solution by partitioning the noise distribution into multiple Gaussian components, thereby approximating the measurement model with sub-models. We introduce a model fusion distributed Kalman filter (MFDKF) that combines sub-models by assuming independent random processes for the model's transition probabilities. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to estimate the relevant parameters. To address specific requirements in WSNs that demand high consensus or have limited communication, two derivative algorithms, namely consensus MFDKF (C-MFDKF) and simplified MFDKF (S-MFDKF), are proposed based on consensus theory. The convergence of MFDKF and its derivative algorithms is analyzed. A series of simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of MFDKF and its derivative algorithms.

      <title>Learning to Localize with Attention: from sparse mmWave channel estimates from a single BS to high accuracy 3D location</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One strategy to obtain user location information in a wireless network operating at millimeter wave (mmWave) is based on the exploitation of the geometric relationships between the channel parameters and the user position. These relationships can be built from the line-of-sight (LOS) path and first-order reflections, or purely first-order reflections, requiring high resolution channel estimates to ensure centimeter level accuracy. In this paper, we consider a mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system employing a hybrid architecture, and develop a low complexity two-stage multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (MOMP) algorithm suitable for accurate estimation of high dimensional channels. Then, a deep neural network (DNN) called PathNet is designed to classify the order of the estimated channel paths, so that only the LOS path and first-order reflections are selected for localization. Next, a 3D localization strategy exploiting the geometry of the environment is developed to operate in both LOS and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions, while considering the unknown clock offset between the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX). Finally, a Transformer based network exploiting attention mechanisms called ChanFormer is proposed to refine the initial position estimate obtained from geometric localization. Simulation results obtained with realistic vehicular channels indicate that localization errors below 28 cm can be achieved for 80% of the users when the LOS path is present, while sub-meter accuracy can be achieved for 55% of the users in NLOS conditions.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Learning Strategies for Estimation Error Minimization with Graph Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03227v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the challenge of sampling and remote estimation for autoregressive Markovian processes in a multi-hop wireless network with statistically-identical agents. Agents cache the most recent samples from others and communicate over wireless collision channels governed by an underlying graph topology. Our goal is to minimize time-average estimation error and/or age of information with decentralized scalable sampling and transmission policies, considering both oblivious (where decision-making is independent of the physical processes) and non-oblivious policies (where decision-making depends on physical processes). We prove that in oblivious policies, minimizing estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the age of information. The complexity of the problem, especially the multi-dimensional action spaces and arbitrary network topologies, makes theoretical methods for finding optimal transmission policies intractable. We optimize the policies using a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where each agent employs a permutation-equivariant graph neural network architecture. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed framework exhibits desirable transferability properties, allowing transmission policies trained on small- or moderate-size networks to be executed effectively on large-scale topologies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) The trained policies are transferable to larger networks, and their performance gains increase with the number of agents; (iii) The training procedure withstands non-stationarity even if we utilize independent learning techniques; and, (iv) Recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity in independent learning.</description>

      <title>Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation for Hyperspectral Image Denoising and Destriping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03313v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel regularization method, named Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation (S3TTV), for denoising and destriping of hyperspectral (HS) images. HS images are inevitably contaminated by various types of noise, during acquisition process, due to the measurement equipment and the environment. For HS image denoising and destriping tasks, Spatio-Spectral Total Variation (SSTV), defined by the l1-norm of second-order spatio-spectral differences, is widely known as a powerful regularization approach that models the underlying spatio-spectral properties. However, since SSTV refers only to adjacent pixels/bands, semi-local spatial structures are not preserved during denoising process. To address this problem, we newly introduce S3TTV, defined using the nuclear norms of matrices formed by arranging second-order spatio-spectral difference vectors for each band in semi-local area (we call these matrices as spatio-spectral structure tensors). The design of this regularization function preserves the semi-local spatial structures and the spectral correlation across all bands while ensuring robust mixed noise removal. Furthermore, we formulate the HS image denoising and destriping problem as a convex optimization problem involving S3TTV and develop an algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method to solve this problem efficiently. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of S3TTV by comparing it with existing methods, including state-of-the-art ones through denoising and destriping experiments.</description>

      <title>MIMO Channel Shaping and Rate Maximization Using Beyond Diagonal RIS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15196v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the limits to which a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can reshape a point-to-point Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) in terms of singular values for improved wireless (e.g., rate and power) performance. We depart from the Diagonal (D) scattering matrix and adopt a Beyond Diagonal (BD) model that exploits element-wise connections for signal amplitude and phase manipulation. Specifically, analytical bounds are derived under popular RIS deployment scenarios to showcase the shaping potentials of BD-RIS on the channel Degrees of Freedom (DoF), singular value spread, power gain, and capacity. A numerical optimization method is then proposed for a broader range of shaping problems and invoked to characterize the achievable singular value region. As a side product, we tackle BD-RIS-aided MIMO rate maximization problem by a local-optimal Alternating Optimization (AO) and a low-complexity shaping-inspired approach. Results show that BD-RIS significantly improves the dynamic range of all channel singular values and the trade-off in manipulating them, resulting in enhanced power gain and achievable rate. Those benefits become more pronounced when the number of RIS elements or MIMO dimensions increase. Of particular interest, BD-RIS is shown to activate multi-stream transmission (hence achieving the asymptotic DoF) at much lower transmit power than D-RIS thanks to its singular value shaping proficiency.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19503v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vector OFDM (VOFDM) is equivalent to OTFS and is good for time-varying channels. However, due to its vector form, its signal spectrum is not as clear as that of the conventional OFDM. In this paper, we study the discrete spectrum of discrete VOFDM signals. We obtain a linear relationship between a vector of information symbols and a vector of the same size of components evenly distributed in the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum, and show that if a vector of information symbols is set to 0, then a corresponding vector of the same size of the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum is 0 as well, where the components of the 0 vector are not together but evenly distributed in the spectrum. With the linear relationship, the information symbol vectors can be locally precoded so that any of the discrete spectrum of VOFDM signals can be set to 0, similar to that of the conventional OFDM signals. These results are verified by simulations.</description>

      <title>Subspace Representation Learning for Sparse Linear Arrays to Localize More Sources than Sensors: A Deep Learning Methodology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16605v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Localizing more sources than sensors with a sparse linear array (SLA) has long relied on minimizing a distance between two covariance matrices and recent algorithms often utilize semidefinite programming (SDP). Although deep neural network (DNN)-based methods offer new alternatives, they still depend on covariance matrix fitting. In this paper, we develop a novel methodology that estimates the co-array subspaces from a sample covariance for SLAs. Our methodology trains a DNN to learn signal and noise subspace representations that are invariant to the selection of bases. To learn such representations, we propose loss functions that gauge the separation between the desired and the estimated subspace. In particular, we propose losses that measure the length of the shortest path between subspaces viewed on a union of Grassmannians, and prove that it is possible for a DNN to approximate signal subspaces. The computation of learning subspaces of different dimensions is accelerated by a new batch sampling strategy called consistent rank sampling. The methodology is robust to array imperfections due to its geometry-agnostic and data-driven nature. In addition, we propose a fully end-to-end gridless approach that directly learns angles to study the possibility of bypassing subspace methods. Numerical results show that learning such subspace representations is more beneficial than learning covariances or angles. It outperforms conventional SDP-based methods such as the sparse and parametric approach (SPA) and existing DNN-based covariance reconstruction methods for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), snapshots, and source numbers for both perfect and imperfect arrays.</description>

Abstract: A concise tutorial is provided for analysis of the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) in continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based continuous electromagnetic (EM) channels. First, a simplified spatial model is introduced using the Fresnel approximation. By leveraging this model and Landau's theorem, a closed-form expression for the spatial DoFs is derived. The results show that the number of DoFs is proportional to the transmit and receive aperture sizes and inversely proportional to the propagation distance. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the properties of EM DoFs in CAPA-based channels.</description>

      <title>Conformal Lyapunov Optimization: Optimal Resource Allocation under Deterministic Reliability Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00486v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces conformal Lyapunov optimization (CLO), a novel resource allocation framework for networked systems that optimizes average long-term objectives, while satisfying deterministic long-term reliability constraints. Unlike traditional Lyapunov optimization (LO), which addresses resource allocation tasks under average long-term constraints, CLO provides formal worst-case deterministic reliability guarantees. This is achieved by integrating the standard LO optimization framework with online conformal risk control (O-CRC), an adaptive update mechanism controlling long-term risks. The effectiveness of CLO is verified via experiments for hierarchal edge inference targeting image segmentation tasks in a networked computing architecture. Specifically, simulation results confirm that CLO can control reliability constraints, measured via the false negative rate of all the segmentation decisions made in the network, while at the same time minimizing the weighted sum of energy consumption and imprecision, with the latter accounting for the rate of false positives.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Approach for High-Resolution Automotive FMCW Radar Interference Avoidance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.02327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nonlinear frequency hopping has emerged as a promising approach for mitigating interference and enhancing range resolution in automotive FMCW radar systems. Achieving an optimal balance between high range-resolution and effective interference mitigation remains challenging, especially without centralized frequency scheduling. This paper presents a game-theoretic framework for interference avoidance, in which each radar operates as an independent player, optimizing its performance through decentralized decision-making. We examine two equilibrium concepts--Nash Equilibrium (NE) and Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE)--as strategies for frequency band allocation, with CCE demonstrating particular effectiveness through regret minimization algorithms. We propose two interference avoidance algorithms: Nash Hopping, a model-based approach, and No-Regret Hopping, a model-free adaptive method. Simulation results indicate that both methods effectively reduce interference and enhance the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Notably, No-regret Hopping further optimizes frequency spectrum utilization, achieving improved range resolution compared to Nash Hopping.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Subarray Segmentation: A New Paradigm of Spatial Non-Stationary Near-Field Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To tackle the complexities of spatial non-stationary (SnS) effects and spherical wave propagation in near-field channel estimation (CE) for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, this paper introduces an innovative SnS near-field CE framework grounded in adaptive subarray partitioning. Conventional methods relying on equal subarray partitioning often lead to suboptimal divisions, undermining CE precision. To overcome this, we propose an adaptive subarray segmentation approach. First, we develop a spherical-wave channel model customized for line-of-sight (LoS) XL-MIMO systems to capture SnS traits. Next, we define and evaluate the adverse effects of over-segmentation and under-segmentation on CE efficacy. To counter these issues, we introduce a novel dynamic hybrid beamforming-assisted power-based subarray segmentation paradigm (DHBF-PSSP), which merges cost-effective power measurements with a DHBF structure, enabling joint subarray partitioning and decoupling. A robust partitioning algorithm, termed power-adaptive subarray segmentation (PASS), exploits statistical features of power profiles, while the DHBF utilizes subarray segmentation-based group time block code (SS-GTBC) to enable efficient subarray decoupling with limited radio frequency (RF) chain resources. Additionally, by utilizing angular-domain block sparsity and inter-subcarrier structured sparsity, we propose a subarray segmentation-based assorted block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm under the multiple measurement vectors framework (SS-ABSBL-MMV), employing discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebooks to lower complexity. Extensive simulation results validate the exceptional performance of the proposed framework over its counterparts.</description>

      <title>Rate-Splitting Multiple Access: Finite Constellations, Receiver Design, and SIC-free Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17178v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has emerged as a novel multiple access technique that enlarges the achievable rate region of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) broadcast channels with linear precoding. In this work, we jointly address three practical but fundamental questions: (1) How to exploit the benefit of RSMA under finite constellations? (2) What are the potential and promising ways to implement RSMA receivers? (3) Can RSMA still retain its superiority in the absence of successive interference cancellers (SIC)? To address these concerns, we first propose low-complexity precoder designs taking finite constellations into account and show that the potential of RSMA is better achieved with such designs than those assuming Gaussian signalling. We then consider some practical receiver designs that can be applied to RSMA. We notice that these receiver designs follow one of two principles: (1) SIC: cancelling upper layer signals before decoding the lower layer and (2) non-SIC: treating upper layer signals as noise when decoding the lower layer. In light of this, we propose to alter the precoder design according to the receiver category. Through link-level simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed precoder and receiver designs are verified. More importantly, we show that it is possible to preserve the superiority of RSMA over Spatial Domain Multiple Access (SDMA), including SDMA with advanced receivers, even without SIC at the receivers. Those results therefore open the door to competitive implementable RSMA strategies for 6G and beyond communications.</description>

      <title>Fully Reversing the Shoebox Image Source Method: From Impulse Responses to Room Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03385v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an algorithm that fully reverses the shoebox image source method (ISM), a popular and widely used room impulse response (RIR) simulator for cuboid rooms introduced by Allen and Berkley in 1979. More precisely, given a discrete multichannel RIR generated by the shoebox ISM for a microphone array of known geometry, the algorithm reliably recovers the 18 input parameters. These are the 3D source position, the 3 dimensions of the room, the 6-degrees-of-freedom room translation and orientation, and an absorption coefficient for each of the 6 room boundaries. The approach builds on a recently proposed gridless image source localization technique combined with new procedures for room axes recovery and first-order-reflection identification. Extensive simulated experiments reveal that near-exact recovery of all parameters is achieved for a 32-element, 8.4-cm-wide spherical microphone array and a sampling rate of 16~kHz using fully randomized input parameters within rooms of size 2X2X2 to 10X10X5 meters. Estimation errors decay towards zero when increasing the array size and sampling rate. The method is also shown to strongly outperform a known baseline, and its ability to extrapolate RIRs at new positions is demonstrated. Crucially, the approach is strictly limited to low-passed discrete RIRs simulated using the vanilla shoebox ISM. Nonetheless, it represents to our knowledge the first algorithmic demonstration that this difficult inverse problem is in-principle fully solvable over a wide range of configurations.</description>

      <title>Surpassing Cosine Similarity for Multidimensional Comparisons: Dimension Insensitive Euclidean Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08623v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in computational power and hardware efficiency have enabled tackling increasingly complex, high-dimensional problems. While artificial intelligence (AI) achieves remarkable results, the interpretability of high-dimensional solutions remains challenging. A critical issue is the comparison of multidimensional quantities, essential in techniques like Principal Component Analysis. Metrics such as cosine similarity are often used, for example in the development of natural language processing algorithms or recommender systems. However, the interpretability of such metrics diminishes as dimensions increase. This paper analyzes the effects of dimensionality, revealing significant limitations of cosine similarity, particularly its dependency on the dimension of vectors, leading to biased and poorly interpretable outcomes. To address this, we introduce a Dimension Insensitive Euclidean Metric (DIEM) which demonstrates superior robustness and generalizability across dimensions. DIEM maintains consistent variability and eliminates the biases observed in traditional metrics, making it a reliable tool for high-dimensional comparisons. An example of the advantages of DIEM over cosine similarity is reported for a large language model application. This novel metric has the potential to replace cosine similarity, providing a more accurate and insightful method to analyze multidimensional data in fields ranging from neuromotor control to machine learning.</description>

      <title>Self-Supervised Speed of Sound Recovery for Aberration-Corrected Photoacoustic Computed Tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10876v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a non-invasive imaging modality, similar to ultrasound, with wide-ranging medical applications. Conventional PACT images are degraded by wavefront distortion caused by the heterogeneous speed of sound (SOS) in tissue. Accounting for these effects can improve image quality and provide medically useful information, but measuring the SOS directly is burdensome and the existing joint reconstruction method is computationally expensive. Traditional supervised learning techniques are currently inaccessible in this data-starved domain. In this work, we introduce an efficient, self-supervised joint reconstruction method that recovers SOS and high-quality images using a differentiable physics model to solve the semi-blind inverse problem. The SOS, parametrized by either a pixel grid or a neural field (NF), is updated directly by backpropagation. Our method removes SOS aberrations more accurately and 35x faster than the current SOTA. We demonstrate the success of our method quantitatively in simulation and qualitatively on experimentally-collected and in-vivo data.</description>

      <title>Hybrid Attention Model Using Feature Decomposition and Knowledge Distillation for Glucose Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10703v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The availability of continuous glucose monitors as over-the-counter commodities have created a unique opportunity to monitor a person's blood glucose levels, forecast blood glucose trajectories and provide automated interventions to prevent devastating chronic complications that arise from poor glucose control. However, forecasting blood glucose levels is challenging because blood glucose changes consistently in response to food intake, medication intake, physical activity, sleep, and stress. It is particularly difficult to accurately predict BGL from multimodal and irregularly sampled data and over long prediction horizons. Furthermore, these forecasting models must operate in real-time on edge devices to provide in-the-moment interventions. To address these challenges, we propose GlucoNet, an AI-powered sensor system for continuously monitoring behavioral and physiological health and robust forecasting of blood glucose patterns. GlucoNet devises a feature decomposition-based transformer model that incorporates patients' behavioral and physiological data and transforms sparse and irregular patient data (e.g., diet and medication intake data) into continuous features using a mathematical model, facilitating better integration with the BGL data. Given the non-linear and non-stationary nature of BG signals, we propose a decomposition method to extract both low and high-frequency components from the BGL signals, thus providing accurate forecasting. To reduce the computational complexity, we also propose to employ knowledge distillation to compress the transformer model. GlucoNet achieves a 60% improvement in RMSE and a 21% reduction in the number of parameters, improving RMSE and MAE by 51% and 57%, using data obtained involving 12 participants with T1-Diabetes. These results underscore GlucoNet's potential as a compact and reliable tool for real-world diabetes prevention and management.</description>
