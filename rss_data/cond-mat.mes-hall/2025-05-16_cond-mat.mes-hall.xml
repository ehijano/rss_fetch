      <title>Quantum Hall Effect without Chern Bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum Hall effect was originally observed in a two-dimensional electron gas forming Landau levels when exposed to a strong perpendicular magnetic field, and has later been generalized to Chern insulators without net magnetization. Here, further extending the realm of the quantum Hall effect, we report on the robust occurrence of an integer quantized transverse conductance at the onset of disorder in a microscopic lattice model all bands of which are topologically trivial (zero Chern number). We attribute this remarkable phenomenon to the energetic separation of substantial but non-quantized Berry fluxes within the topologically trivial bands. Adding a random disorder potential then nudges the system into a stable quantum Hall phase from an extended critical regime of the clean system obtained by placing the Fermi energy within a broad window in either of the trivial bands. Our results are corroborated by extensive numerical transport simulations as well as the analysis of several complementary topological markers.</description>

      <title>Stable Real-Space Invariants and Topology Beyond Symmetry Indicators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09697v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that certain band gaps, which appear topologically trivial from the perspective of symmetry indicators (SIs), must instead be topological, as guaranteed by real-space information that follows from Topological Quantum Chemistry (TQC). To address this, we introduce stable real-space invariants (SRSIs) that generalize the previously discovered local and composite real-space invariants to global topological invariants of a given set of bands. These are linear combinations of Wannier state multiplicities at Wyckoff positions and take the form of $\mathbb{Z}$- and $\mathbb{Z}_n$-valued quantities ($n=2,4$). We enumerate all $\mathbb{Z}$SRSIs and $\mathbb{Z}_n$SRSIs in all non-magnetic space groups (SGs) with and without spin-orbit coupling. SRSIs fully diagnose the stable equivalence of atomic insulators, ensuring that two atomic insulators with matching SRSIs are adiabatically deformable to one another in the presence of auxiliary trivial bands. For both atomic and topological bands, $\mathbb{Z}$SRSIs are determined by the momentum-space symmetry data and thus determine the SIs. $\mathbb{Z}_n$SRSIs provide additional information about trivial band structures not captured by momentum-space data. While split elementary band representations (EBRs), where the bands forming an EBR split into disconnected parts, must induce band topology, there are 211 cases across 51 SGs where the momentum-space data of an EBR decomposes linearly with positive integer coefficients into those of other EBRs. We demonstrate that $\mathbb{Z}_n$SRSIs successfully identify the band topology in the majority of these split EBR cases, diagnosing all but 8 cases in 5 SGs. Our results solidify the conceptual framework of TQC as containing, but going beyond, SIs and momentum-space symmetry data.</description>

      <title>Reduction of fully screened magnetoplasmons in a laterally confined anisotropic two-dimensional electron system to an isotropic one</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of natural two-dimensional (2D) magnetoplasma modes in laterally confined electron systems, such as 2D materials, quantum wells, or inversion layers in semiconductors, with an elliptic Fermi surface. The conductivity of the system is considered in a dynamical anisotropic Drude model. The problem is solved in the fully screened limit, i.e., under the assumption that the distance between the two-dimensional electron system and the nearby metal gate is small compared to all other lengths in the system, including the wavelength of plasmons. Remarkably, in this limit plasma oscillations in an anisotropic 2D confined system are equivalent to plasma oscillations in an isotropic 2D electron system obtained by some stretching, even when the electromagnetic retardation is taken into account. Moreover, accounting for electromagnetic retardation leads only to a renormalization of the effective masses of carriers, somewhat like in relativity. As an example, we reduce the equations describing plasmons in a gated disk with an anisotropic two-dimensional electron gas to the equations describing oscillations in an isotropic ellipse. Without a magnetic field, we solve them analytically and find eigenfrequencies. To find a solution in a magnetic field, we expand the current of plasma oscillations in the complete set of Mathieu functions. Leaving the leading terms of the expansion, we approximately find and analyze magnetodispersion for the lowest modes.</description>

      <title>Resonant and Anti-resonant Exciton-Phonon Coupling in Quantum Dot Molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optically active quantum dot molecules (QDMs) can host multi-spin quantum states with the potential for the deterministic generation of photonic graph states with tailored entanglement structures. Their usefulness for the generation of such non-classical states of light is determined by orbital and spin decoherence mechanisms, particularly phonon-mediated processes dominant at energy scales up to a few millielectronvolts. Here, we directly measure the spectral function of orbital phonon relaxation in a QDM and benchmark our findings against microscopic kp theory. Our results reveal phonon-mediated relaxation rates exhibiting pronounced resonances and anti-resonances, with rates ranging from several ten ns$^{-1}$ to tens of $\mu$s$^{-1}$. Comparison with a kinetic model reveals the voltage (energy) dependent phonon coupling strength and fully explains the interplay between phonon-assisted relaxation and radiative recombination. These anti-resonances can be leveraged to increase the lifetime of energetically unfavorable charge configurations needed for realizing efficient spin-photon interfaces and multi-dimensional cluster states.</description>

      <title>Electron spin resonance with scanning tunneling microscopy: a tool for an on-surface quantum platform of identical qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integration of electron spin resonance (ESR) in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) has enabled an all-electrical control of atomic and molecular spins on solid surfaces with atomic-scale precision and energy resolution beyond thermal limitations. Further, coherent manipulation and detection of individual spins in an ESR-STM establishes a powerful quantum platform, allowing for the implementation of fundamental quantum logic operations to on-surface identical qubits. In this review, we introduce recent advances of ESR-STM, focusing on its application to atomic-scale qubits and extension to molecular qubit systems. We discuss the principles underlying ESR-STM, followed by single-spin addressability, coherent control via Rabi oscillations, and quantum state readout through frequency-resolved detection. We further demonstrate multi-qubit control architectures enabled by atom manipulation and local magnetic field engineering, culminating in the realization of multi-qubit logic gates such as the Controlled-NOT and Toffoli gates. These implementations highlight the specialty of ESR-STM towards atomic-scale quantum circuits. Indeed, ESR-STM can be an excellent tool to perform and evaluate quantum operations in molecular qubits. The results reviewed in this collection establish ESR-STM as a versatile tool for advancing quantum coherent science at the atomic and molecular level in solid-state environments.</description>

      <title>Floquet topological phases of higher winding numbers in extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model under quenched drive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study topological properties of static and dynamic
  Su-Schrieffer-Heeger models with staggered further neighbor hopping terms
  of different extents are investigated. Topological characterization
  of the static chiral models is established in terms of
  conventional winding number while Floquet topological character is
  studied by a pair of winding numbers.
  With the increase of extent of further neighbor terms topological phases
  with higher winding numbers are found to emerge in both static and dynamic
  systems. Topological phase diagrams of static models for four different
  extents of further neighbor terms are presented, which has been generalized
  for arbitrary extent afterwards. Similarly, Floquet topological
  phase diagrams of four such dynamic models have been presented.
  For every model four different parametrizations of hopping terms
  are introduced which
  exhibits different patterns of topological phase diagrams.
  In each case emergence of `0' and `$\pi$' energy edge states
  is noted and they are found to consistent to the
  bulk-boundary correspondence rule applicable for chiral topological systems.</description>

      <title>Generalized Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this Letter, we present a unified theory termed the generalized non-Hermitian skin effect. This framework provides a universal characterization of typical one-dimensional non-Hermitian skin effects within the perturbative regime and unveils a novel type of skin effect that beyond the predictions of the generalized Brillouin zone theory, referred to as the relative skin effect. Previously recognized skin effects are classified as global skin effects, thereby explicitly delineating the scope and limitations of existing non-Bloch band theories. Additionally, we establish, for the first time, a phase transition criterion between global skin effects and relative skin effect, demonstrating the competition between these two distinct types of skin effects, emphasizing the pivotal role of real-space non-Hermitian terms in understanding skin effects and challenging the traditional reliance of non-Bloch band theory on momentum space. Our study substantially advances the conceptual framework of non-Hermitian physics and provides new theoretical tools for investigation.</description>

      <title>Chiral near-field control of quantum light generation using magneto-optical graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10276</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10276v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically explore strategies to actively control photon emission from quantum light sources by leveraging the large magneto-optical response of graphene. The quantum electrodynamic response of graphene -- characterized by the Purcell factor and the Lamb shift of a proximal emitter -- is analyzed for extended two-dimensional sheets, one-dimensional nanoribbons, and zero-dimensional nanodisks, all of which are endowed with an intrinsic chiral near-field response under a static perpendicular magnetic field. Using rigorous semianalytical models of these systems, we reveal that the emission properties can be readily tuned by variations in doping charge carrier density and applied magnetic field strength, both with respect to magnetoplasmon resonances (at infrared frequencies) and Shubnikov-de-Haas oscillations (entering telecommunication bands) associated with optical transitions between discrete Landau levels. Localized magnetoplasmons in graphene nanoribbons are predicted to induce large dissymmetry in the spontaneous emission from left-hand and right-hand circularly polarized transitions in a proximal quantum emitter, presenting applications for chiral quantum optical waveguiding. This chiral dissymmetry is further enhanced in gyrotropic graphene nanodisks, signaling that the spatial shaping of near-fields in nanostructured graphene can significantly boost the intrinsic chiral response induced by the magnetic field. These results indicate that magneto-optical graphene constitutes a versatile and highly tunable platform for quantum light generation and manipulation at the nanoscale.</description>

      <title>High frequency permeability of the composite with ferromagnetic spherical shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper studies high-frequency permeability of the composite materials consisting of hollow ferromagnetic particles embedded into the non-magnetic media. We model the ferromagnetic particles in composite by spherical shell: the thickness of the ferromagnetic region $d$ compared to the particles' diameter $D$ can vary in a wide range, from $d\ll D$ to $d\sim D$. We assume that the magnetization distribution in such a particle is non-uniform, but forms a vortex-like structure: the magnetization is twisted in some plain outside two vortex cores placed at the poles of the particle. The high-frequency permeability of such a composite material has been studied in the limit of non-interacting particles. We study the dependence of the permeability on the ratio $d/D$. It was shown, in particular, that in the limit $d/D\ll1$ the frequency dependence of the particle's susceptibility is quite similar to that for the thin film. At the same time, the magnetization oscillations in the ac field are non-homogeneous.</description>

      <title>Topological properties of domain walls in antiferromagnetic topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the study of stacking faults in weak topological insulators and the observation of magnetic domain walls in MnBi$_{2n}$Te$_{3n+1}$, we explore the topological properties of domain walls in antiferromagnetic topological insulators. We develop two tight-binding models: one based on a strong topological insulator with antiferromagnetic order, and another built from stacked Chern insulators with alternating Chern numbers. Both systems are dual topological insulators, i.e. they are at the same time antiferromagnetic and crystalline topological insulators, but differ by the type of mirror symmetry protecting the crystalline phase: spinful versus spinless. We show that in the spinful case the mirror Chern number is invariant under time reversal and that it changes sign in the spinless case. This influences the properties of the two systems in the presence of a magnetic domain wall, which is created in the system when the magnetization is flipped via a time-reversal transformation. In the first type, the bulk of the domain wall is gapped but the defect will host chiral edge states when it ends on an external ferromagnetic surface. In the second, due to the flip in the mirror Chern number, the domain wall is a two-dimensional embedded semimetal with 2D gapless states protected by mirror symmetry. Our results show that domain walls can be a source of non-trivial topology, allowing to generate and manipulate gapless states within the bulk and the ferromagnetic surfaces of antiferromagnetic topological insulators.</description>

Abstract: We propose a mechanism of current-induced phonon angular momentum, which we call phonon Edelstein effect. We investigate this effect in three-dimensional chiral metals with spin-orbit coupling and chiral phonons, and obtain an analytical expression of phonon angular momentum induced by the current. We also discuss the physical interpretation of this effect and give an estimation of its magnitude.</description>

      <title>Dimensional crossover of class D real-space topological invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological properties of a material depend on its symmetries, parameters, and spatial dimension. Changes in these properties due to parameter and symmetry variations can be understood by computing the corresponding topological invariant. Since topological invariants are typically defined for a fixed spatial dimension, there is no existing framework to understand the effects of changing spatial dimensions via invariants. Here, we introduce a framework to study topological phase transitions as a system's dimensionality is altered using real-space topological markers. Specifically, we consider Shiba lattices, which are class D materials formed by magnetic atoms on the surface of a conventional superconductor, and characterize the evolution of their topology when an initial circular adatom island is deformed into a chain. We also provide a measure of the corresponding protection against disorder. Our framework is generalizable to any symmetry class and spatial dimension, potentially guiding the design of materials by identifying, for example, the minimum thickness of a slab required to maintain three-dimensional topological properties.</description>

      <title>Hopf Bifurcation of Nonlinear Non-Hermitian Skin Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, nonreciprocity-induced anomalous localization of an extensive number of eigenstates, represents a hallmark of non-Hermitian topological systems with no analogs in Hermitian systems. Despite its significance across various open classical and quantum systems, the influence of nonlinearity has remained largely unclear. Here, we reveal the Hopf bifurcation of the nonlinear skin effect as a critical phenomenon unique to nonlinear non-Hermitian systems. We demonstrate that nonlinearity destabilizes skin states and instead gives rise to the emergence of delocalized states associated with limit cycles in phase space. We also uncover the algebraically localized critical skin effect precisely at the Hopf bifurcation point. We illustrate these behavior in a nonlinear extension of the Hatano-Nelson model in both continuum and lattice. Our work shows a significant role of nonlinearity in the skin effect and uncovers rich phenomena arising from the interplay between non-Hermiticity and nonlinearity.</description>

      <title>Giant elastoresistance in magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.10506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strongly correlated and topological phases in moir\'e materials are exquisitely sensitive to lattice geometry at both atomic and superlattice length scales. Twist angle, pressure, and strain directly modify the lattice, and thus act as highly effective tuning parameters. Here we examine electrical transport in twisted bilayer graphene subjected to continuous uniaxial strain. Near the magic angle ($\approx 1.1^{\circ}$), devices exhibit a pronounced elastoresistance that depends on band filling and temperature, with a gauge factor more than two orders of magnitude larger than that of conventional metals. In selected doping regimes the elastoresistance exhibits a Curie-Weiss-like temperature divergence. We discuss possible microscopic origins, including nematic fluctuations and enhanced electronic entropy from fluctuating isospin moments. Our work establishes uniaxial strain as a versatile probe of correlated physics in a moir\'e material.</description>

      <title>Euler topology in classical spin liquids</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09683v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Classical spin liquids have recently been analyzed in view of the single-gap homotopy classification of their dispersive eigenvectors. We show that the recent progress in defining multi-gap topologies, notably exemplified by the Euler class, can be naturally included in these homotopy-based classification schemes and present phases that change topology by band node braiding. This process alters the topology of the pinch points in the spin structure factor and consequently their stability. Furthermore, we discuss how these notions also pertain to models discussed previously in the literature and have a broader range of application beyond our specific results. Our work thus opens up an uncharted avenue in the understanding of spin liquids.</description>

      <title>Full, three-quarter, half and quarter Wigner crystals in Bernal bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09685v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Application of a displacement field opens a gap and enhances the Van-Hove singularities in the band structure of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. By adjusting the carrier density so that the Fermi energy lies in the vicinity of these singularities, recent experiments observe a plethora of highly correlated electronic phases including isospin polarized phases and high-resistance states with non-linear electric transport indicative of a possible Wigner crystal. We perform Hartree-Fock calculations incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions and allowing for translational and rotational symmetry breaking. We obtain the displacement field vs. carrier density phase diagram which shows isospin polarized metallic phases tracking the Van-Hove singularity in the valence band. Between these metallic phases we observe regions where the ground state is a Wigner crystal. The isospin polarization of the Wigner crystals tracks the isospin polarization of the nearby metallic phases. Depending on whether we have four, three, two or one isospin flavours, we obtain a full, three-quarter, half or quarter Wigner crystal.</description>

      <title>Geometric Origin of Phonon Magnetic Moment in Dirac Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theory for the phonon magnetic moment in doped Dirac materials, treating phonons as emergent gauge and gravitational fields coupled to Dirac fermions in curved space. By classifying electron-phonon coupling into angular momentum channels of Fermi surface deformation, we show that the phonon moment arises from two mechanisms: proportional to the electron Hall conductivity through the emergent gauge field coupling, and to the Hall viscosity through the frame field coupling. Applying our theory to Cd$_3$As$_2$ with first-principles calculations, we find quantitative agreement with experiment. Our results reveal a general mechanism for dynamically generating large phonon magnetism in metals and suggest a new route for probing Hall viscosity via phonon dynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09735v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the physics of a mobile impurity immersed in a $1d$ topological superconductor. We discuss the system's phase diagram obtained with exact diagonalization. We argue that the character of the transition from a weak to strong coupling regime depends on the phase of the host superconductor. A smooth crossover between a weakly coupled polaron and a molecular state is observed in the topological phase. In contrast, the impurity undergoes a sharp phase transition in a topologically trivial background.</description>

      <title>Extrinsic contribution to bosonic thermal Hall transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bosonic excitations like phonons and magnons dominate the low-temperature transport of magnetic insulators. Similar to electronic Hall responses, the thermal Hall effect (THE) of charge neutral bosons has been proposed as a powerful tool for probing topological properties of their wavefunctions. For example, the intrinsic contribution of the THE of a perfectly clean system is directly governed by the distribution of Berry curvature, and many experiments on topological magnon and phonon insulators have been interpreted in this way. However, disorder is inevitably present in any material and its contribution to the THE has remained poorly understood. Here we develop a rigorous kinetic theory of the extrinsic side-jump contribution to the THE of bosons. We show that the extrinsic THE can be of the same order as the intrinsic one but sensitively depends on the type of local imperfection. We study different types of impurities and show that a THE can even arise as a pure impurity-induced effect in a system with a vanishing intrinsic contribution. As a side product, we also generalize existing results for the electronic AHE to general types of impurities beyond the standard assumption of local potential scattering. We discuss the importance of our results for the correct interpretation of THE measurements.</description>

      <title>Emergent chirality and enantiomeric selectivity in layered NbOX$_2$ crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous emergence of chirality in crystalline solids has profound implications for electronic, optical, and topological properties, making the control of chiral phases a central challenge in materials design. Here, we investigate the structural and electronic properties of a new family of layered compounds, $\mathrm{NbOX_2}$, and explore the connection between their achiral $I m m m$ phase and chiral $C 2$ phase. Through first-principles calculations, we identify an intermediate achiral $C 2/m$ phase that bridges the high- and low-symmetry phases within a three-dimensional order parameter space. The insulating $C 2$ phase exhibits unique electronic properties, including flat Niobium $d$-orbital bands near the Fermi level associated with an obstructed atomic limit (OAL), hosting topologically non-trivial surface states under specific cleavage conditions. By analyzing the Born-Oppenheimer energy surfaces (BOES), we find that the shallow energy minima of the $C 2$ phase suggest that the intermediate $C 2/m$ phase may be stabilized either by ionic quantum or thermal fluctuations, and the consequent lattice anharmonicity, or by external factors such as pressure. Additionally, we show how an external electric field, by breaking the necessary symmetries, biases the system toward a preferred chirality by lifting the energy degeneracy between the two enantiomers. This, combined with the small energy barrier between the enantiomers in the $C 2$ phase, enables handedness control and allows us to propose a mechanism for selective handedness stabilization by leveraging electric fields and temperature-dependent anharmonic effects. Our findings establish a framework for understanding chirality emergence in layered materials and offer a pathway for designing systems with tunable enantiomeric populations.</description>

      <title>Strain-Gradient and Curvature-Induced Changes in Domain Morphology of BaTiO3 Nanorods: Experimental and Theoretical Studies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the impact of OH- ions incorporation on the lattice strain and spontaneous polarization of BaTiO3 nanorods synthesized under different conditions. It was confirmed that the lattice strain depends directly on Ba supersaturation, with higher supersaturation leading to an increase in the lattice strain. However, it was shown that crystal growth and observed lattice distortion are not primarily influenced by external strain; rather, OH- ions incorporation plays a key role in generating internal chemical strains and driving these processes. By using the less reactive TiO2 precursor instead of TiOCl2 and controlling Ba supersaturation, the slower nucleation rate enables more effective regulation of OH- ions incorporation and crystal growth. This in turn effects both particle size and lattice distortion, leading to c/a ratio of 1.013 - 1.014. The incorporation of OH- ions induces lattice elongation along the c-axis, contributing to anisotropic growth, increasing of the rod diameter and their growth-induced bending. However, the possibility of the curvature-induced changes in domain morphology of BaTiO3 nanorods remains almost unexplored. To study the possibility, we perform analytical calculations and finite element modeling, which provide insights into the curvature-induced changes in the strain-gradient, polarization distribution, and domain morphology in BaTiO3 nanorods. Theoretical results reveal the appearance of the domain stripes in BaTiO3 nanorod when the curvature exceeds a critical angle. The physical origin of the domain stripes emergence is the tendency to minimize its elastic energy of the nanorod by the domain splitting. These findings suggest that BaTiO3 nanorods, with curvature-controllable amount of domain stripes, could serve as flexible race-track memory elements for flexo-tronics and domain-wall electronics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09846v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The semi-empirical pseudopotential method (SEPM) has been widely applied to provide computational insights into the electronic structure, photophysics, and charge carrier dynamics of nanoscale materials. We present "DeepPseudopot", a machine-learned atomistic pseudopotential model that extends the SEPM framework by combining a flexible neural network representation of the local pseudopotential with parameterized non-local and spin-orbit coupling terms. Trained on bulk quasiparticle band structures and deformation potentials from GW calculations, the model captures many-body and relativistic effects with very high accuracy across diverse semiconducting materials, as illustrated for silicon and group III-V semiconductors. DeepPseudopot's accuracy, efficiency, and transferability make it well-suited for data-driven in silico design and discovery of novel optoelectronic nanomaterials.</description>

      <title>Topological photonics of generalized and nonlinear eigenvalue equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological photonics is developed based on the analogy of Schr\"{o}dinger equation which is mathematically reduced to a standard eigenvalue equation. Notably, several photonic systems are beyond the standard topological band theory as they are described by generalized or nonlinear eigenvalue equations. In this article, we review the topological band theory of this category. In the first part, we discuss topological photonics of generalized eigenvalue equations where the band structure may take complex values even when the involved matrices are Hermitian. These complex bands explain the characteristic dispersion relation of hyperbolic metamaterials. In addition, our numerical analysis predicts the emergence of symmetry-protected exceptional points in a photonic crystal composed of negative index media. In the second part, by introducing auxiliary bands, we establish the nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence under ``weak" nonlinearity of eigenvalues. The nonlinear bulk-edge correspondence elucidates the robustness of chiral edge modes in photonic systems where the permittivity and permeability are frequency dependent.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced gyrotropic effects in ferroelectric BaTiS3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gyrotropic effects, including natural optical activity (NOA) and the nonlinear anomalous Hall effect (NAHE), are crucial for advancing optical and transport devices. We explore these effects in the BaTiS3 system, a quasi-one-dimensional crystal that exhibits giant optical anisotropy. (Niu et al. Nat. Photonics 12, 392 (2018); Zhao et al. Chem. Mater. 34, 5680 (2022)). In the P63cm phase which is stable under room temperature, we predict two distinct strain-induced phase transitions: a symmetry-lowering transition from the P63cm to P63 phase under tensile strain, which enhances NOA and enables optical rotation; and an isostructural insulator-to-polar Weyl semimetal (WSM) transition under compressive strain, which activates the NAHE and exhibits a strain-induced sign reversal. The low-temperature P21 phase also transforms into a P212121 phase under enough compressive strains with such phase transition exhibiting a large NOA. All these results highlight BaTiS3 as a viable candidate for novel ferroelectrics, optical and transport devices with strain enhanced or activated gyrotropic properties.</description>

      <title>Complex electronic topography and magnetotransport in an in-plane ferromagnetic kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intricate interplay between flat bands, Dirac cones, and magnetism in kagome materials has recently attracted significant attention from materials scientists, particularly in compounds belonging to the RMn6Sn6 family (R = Sc, Y, rare earths), due to their inherent magnetic frustration. Here, we present a detailed investigation of the ferromagnetic (FM) kagome magnet ScMn6(Sn0.78Ga0.22)6 using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), magnetotransport measurements, and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our findings reveal a paramagnetic-to-FM transition at 375 K, with the in-plane direction serving as the easy magnetization axis. Notably, ARPES measurements reveal a Dirac cone near the Fermi energy, while the Hall resistivity exhibits a substantial contribution from the anomalous Hall effect. Additionally, we observe a flat band spanning a substantial portion of the Brillouin zone, arising from the destructive interference of wave functions in the Mn kagome lattice. Theoretical calculations reveal that the gap in the Dirac cone can be modulated by altering the orientation of the magnetic moment. An out-of-plane orientation produces a gap of approximately 15 meV, while an in-plane alignment leads to a gapless state, as corroborated by ARPES measurements. This comprehensive analysis provides valuable insights into the electronic structure of magnetic kagome materials and paves the way for exploring novel topological phases in this material class.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a study of the spin-to-charge current conversion in compressively strained Ge1-xSnx alloy epilayers as a function of the Sn concentration by means of the inverse spin Hall effect (ISHE). The spin current is generated by spin-pumping effect (SPE) from a thin NiFe layer driven into ferromagnetic resonance (FMR). By simultaneously measuring the magnetic damping of the NiFe layer and the ISHE-induced charge current we extract two key spintronics parameters: the spin Hall angle and the effective spin mixing conductance. Our results reveal a giant spin-to-charge conversion and a non-monotonic dependence of the charge current signal on the Sn concentration, consistent with the variation in the magnetic damping observed in FMR. The values of spin Hall angle are comparable to those reported for heavy metals such as Pt and Ta. Furthermore, we show that the spin conductivity at the Au/GeSn interface can be enhanced by tuning the Sn concentration.</description>

      <title>Sensing a magnetic rare-earth surface alloy by proximity effect with an open-shell nanographene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10313v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-shell nanographenes have attracted significant attention due to their structurally tunable spin ground state. While most characterization has been conducted on weakly-interacting substrates such as noble metals, the influence of magnetic surfaces remains largely unexplored. In this study, we investigate how TbAu2, a rare-earth-element-based surface alloy, affects the magnetic properties of phenalenyl (or [2]triangulene (2T)), the smallest spin-1/2 nanographene. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) measurements reveal a striking contrast: while 2T on Au(111) exhibits a zero-bias Kondo resonance - a hallmark of a spin-1/2 impurity screened by the conduction electrons of the underlying metal - deposition on TbAu2 induces a symmetric splitting of this feature by approximately 20 mV. We attribute this splitting to a strong proximity-induced interaction with the ferromagnetic out-of-plane magnetization of TbAu2. Moreover, our combined experimental and first-principles analysis demonstrates that this interaction is spatially modulated, following the periodicity of the TbAu2 surface superstructure. These findings highlight that TbAu2 serves as a viable platform for stabilizing and probing the magnetic properties of spin-1/2 nanographenes, opening new avenues for the integration of {\pi}-magnetic materials with magnetic substrates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.10435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) technology is a promising platform for developing quantum computers based on spin qubits. Scaling this approach will benefit from compact and sensitive sensors that minimize constraints on qubit connectivity while being industrially manufacturable. Here, we demonstrate a compact dispersive spin-qubit sensor, a single-electron box (SEB), within a bilinear unit cell of planar MOS quantum dots (QDs) fabricated using an industrial grade 300 mm wafer process. By independent gate control of the SEB and double-quantum-dot tunnel rates, we optimize the sensor to achieve a readout fidelity of 99.92% in 340us (99% in 20us), fidelity values on a par with the best obtained with less compact sensors. Furthermore, we develop a Hidden Markov Model of the two-electron spin dynamics that enables a more accurate calculation of the measurement outcome and hence readout fidelity. Our results show how high-fidelity sensors can be introduced within silicon spin-qubit architectures while maintaining sufficient qubit connectivity as well as providing faster readout and more efficient initialisation schemes.</description>

      <title>Vortical currents and reciprocal relations for transport coefficients in the electron hydrodynamic regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06375v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic regime in metals with momentum-conserving electron-electron scattering. The conservation of momentum results in well-defined dynamics whose effects we investigate via the relevant continuity equations. We find anomalous contributions to the charge and heat transport currents arising from gradients of the velocity field in a semiclassical treatment with a Berry curvature. These contributions are non-vanishing for systems lacking inversion symmetry, and the corresponding transport coefficients do not obey the standard Onsager reciprocity relations. Instead, we show that the response coefficients relating the currents to the stress tensor obey independent reciprocity relations with the stress tensor and thus exhibit cross-tensor effects of charge and heat transport with the momentum transport. The Berry curvature contribution to the stress magnetization tensor is also derived.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09145v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that periodically driven Fermions coupled to simple bosonic baths have steady state occupations of Floquet Bloch bands that generically display non-analyticties at certain momenta which resemble the Fermi surfaces of equilibrium non-Fermi liquids. Remarkably these non-equilibrium Fermi surfaces remain sharp even when the bath is at finite temperature, leading to critical power-law decaying correlations at finite temperature, a phenomenon with no analogue in equilibrium. We also show that generically there is in-gap current rectification for clean metals lacking inversion symmetry, and explain why this occurs universally regardless of the details of collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07131v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider electronic spectra of twisted carbon nanotubes and their perturbation by impurity atoms absorbed at different positions on nanotube surface within the framework of Anderson hybrid model. A special attention is given to the cases when 1D Weyl (massless Dirac) modes are present in the nanotube spectrum and their hybridization with localized impurity states produces, with growing impurity concentration c, onset of a mobility gap near the impurity level and then opening, at yet higher c, of some narrow range of delocalized states within this mobility gap. Such behaviors are compared with similar effects in the previously studied 2D graphene, carbon nanoribbons, and non-twisted carbon nanotubes. Some possible practical applications are discussed.</description>

      <title>Femtosecond and attosecond phase-space correlations in few-particle photoelectron pulses</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Temporal correlations in pulsed electron beams reflect the microscopic dynamics of emission and interparticle interaction. In femtosecond electron emission from nanoscale field emitters, Coulomb interactions result in structured few-electron states with strong correlations in energy, time, and transverse momentum. Interactions with external fields may be used to both probe and further manipulate these correlated states. Here, we combine femtosecond-gated, event-based detection with inelastic electron-light scattering to directly map the photoelectron phase-space distribution of two-electron states. Our experiments demonstrate a bimodal structure in longitudinal phase space, with distinct contributions from interparticle interaction and dispersion. Moreover, we theoretically reveal that global phase modulation coherently shapes the few-electron phase-space distribution to exhibit attosecond temporal correlations. This controlled phasing of few-electron states can be harnessed to produce tailored excitations and super-radiance via two-electron energy post-selection.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12537v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report a nanoscale device concept based on a highly doped $\delta$-layer tunnel junction embedded in a semiconductor for charge sensing. Recent advances in Atomic Precision Advanced Manufacturing (APAM) processes have enabled the fabrication of devices based on quasi-2D, highly conductive, highly doped regions, known as $\delta$-layers, in semiconductor materials. In this work, we demonstrate that APAM $\delta$-layer tunnel junctions are ultrasensitive to the presence of charges near the tunnel junction, allowing the use of these devices for detecting charges by observing changes in the electrical current. We demonstrate that these devices can enhance the sensitivity in the limit, i.e., for small concentrations of charges, exhibiting significantly superior sensitivity compared to traditional FET-based sensors. We also propose that the extreme sensitivity arises from the strong quantization of the conduction band in these highly-confined systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13978v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the behaviour of the linear-response coefficients, when in-plane electric field ($\mathbf E$) or/and temperature gradient ($\nabla_{\mathbf r} T$) is/are applied on a two-dimensional semimetal harbouring anisotropic Dirac cones. The anisotropy is caused by (1) differing Fermi velocities along the two mutually perpendicular momentum axes, and (2) tilting parameters. Using the semiclassical Boltzmann formalism, we derive the forms of the response coefficients, in the absence and presence of a nonquantizing magnetic field $\mathbf B$. The magnetic field affects the response only when it is oriented perpendicular to the plane of the material, with the resulting expressions computed with the help of the so-called Lorentz-force operator, appearing in the linearized Boltzmann equation. The solution has to be found in a recursive manner, which produces terms in powers of $|\mathbf B|$. We discuss the validity of the Mott relation and the Wiedemann-Franz law for the Lorentz-operator-induced parts.</description>

Abstract: CrSBr, a van der Waals material, stands out as an air-stable magnetic semiconductor with appealing intrinsic properties such as crystalline anisotropy, quasi-1D electronic characteristics, layer-dependent antiferromagnetism, and non-linear optical effects. In this study, we investigate the differences between the absorption and emission spectra, focusing on the origin of the emission peak near 1.7 eV observed in the photoluminescence spectrum of CrSBr. Our findings are corroborated by excitation-dependent Raman experiments. Additionally, we explore the anti-Stokes Raman spectra and observe an anomalously high anti-Stokes to Stokes intensity ratio of up to 0.8, which varies significantly with excitation laser power and crystallographic orientation relative to the polarization of the scattered light. This ratio is notably higher than that observed in graphene ($\approx$ 0.1) and MoS$_2$ ($\approx$ 0.4), highlighting the unique vibrational and electronic interactions in CrSBr. Lastly, we examine stimulated Raman scattering and calculate the Raman gain in CrSBr, which attains a value of 1 $\times$ 10$^{8}$ cm/GW, nearly four orders of magnitude higher than that of previously studied three-dimensional systems.</description>

      <title>Thermal boundary conductance in standalone and non-standalone GaN/AlN heterostructures predicted using machine learning interatomic potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05084v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GaN/AlN interfaces are essential in advanced high-power and high-frequency electronic devices, where effective thermal management is crucial for optimal performance and reliability. This work investigates the thermal boundary conductance (TBC) of standalone and non-standalone GaN/AlN heterostructures using non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) driven by accurate machine learning interatomic potentials trained from density-functional theory calculations. For the standalone interface, the TBC is found to be ~600 MW m-2 K-1 at room temperature after quantum correction, with possible ~60% elastic and ~40% inelastic contributions. The result revises previous NEMD predictions (400 - 2000 MW m-2 K-1) using empirical interatomic potentials. When a second GaN/AlN interface is brought close to the original interface, the TBC of the original interface can increase to 1000 MW m-2 K-1, and this value gradually decreases with increasing distance between the two interfaces. When multiple interfaces are introduced in proximity, the first interface's TBC can be further enhanced to above 1150 MW m-2 K-1. After comparing double interfaces, superlattices, and random multilayers, it is concluded that such enhancement of TBC is not caused by the emergence of coherent superlattice modes but rather by the ballistic transport of the original bulk phonon modes of each material. Additionally, a "critical separation distance" (l_cs) is defined as the threshold beyond which the two interfaces no longer influence each other and behave independently. l_cs is determined by the mean free path of the phonons filtered by the interfaces that transport in the middle layer between two interfaces. Our findings provide insights into the thermal transport mechanisms that may aid the design of future electronic devices.</description>

      <title>Evidence of competing ground states between fractional Chern insulator and antiferromagnetism in moir\'e MoTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.13213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional moire materials present unprecedented opportunities to explore quantum phases of matter arising from the interplay of band topology and strong correlations.One of the most striking examples is the recent observation of fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe2) with relatively large twist angles(~3.7deg-3.9deg). The electronic ground states are usually expected to be sensitive to the twist angle, as the twist angle determines the electron bandwidth and correlation strength in the moire system. Here, we report the observation of unexpected competing magnetic ground states in tMoTe2 moire superlattice, on which balance can be tipped by both twist angle and electric field (E). Specifically, we observed anomalous antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground states with zero Hall resistance at both v_h=1 and 2/3, at intermediate twist angles ~3deg. The AFM orders are suppressed by applying vertical E, and emergent ferromagnetism accompanied by integer Chern insulator (ICI) or fractional Chern insulator (FCI) states are observed near the critical E (E_c) of moire superlattice symmetry transition. Our results demonstrate tMoTe2 as a fascinating platform for exploring unexpected correlated phases with nontrivial topology and fractional excitations and point to electric-field-controlled ultralow-power spin-valleytronic devices.</description>

Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in a diamond is a promising platform for Floquet engineering. Using the synchronized readout, we investigate the NV center's Floquet state driven by the Carr-Purcell sequence in a large-amplitude AC magnetic field. We observe the dynamics represented as Bessel functions up to 211th orders high in a systematic and quantitative agreement with the theoretical model. Furthermore, numerical calculations show that the effect of finite pulse duration and error limits the modulation amplitude available for Floquet engineering. This work provides an approach to precisely investigate Floquet engineering, showing the extendable range of modulation amplitude for two-level systems.</description>

      <title>Coherent heat transfer leads to genuine quantum enhancement in the performances of continuous engines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional continuous quantum heat engines with incoherent heat transfer perform poorly as they exploit two-body interactions between the system and hot or cold baths, thus having limited capability to outperform their classical counterparts. We introduce distinct continuous quantum heat engines that utilize coherent heat transfer with baths, yielding genuine quantum enhancement in performance. These coherent engines consist of one qutrit system and two photonic baths and enable coherent heat transfer via two-photon transitions involving three-body interactions between the system and hot and cold baths. We demonstrate that coherent engines deliver significantly higher power output with much greater reliability, i.e., lower signal-to-noise ratio of the power, by hundreds of folds over their incoherent counterparts. Importantly, coherent engines can operate close to or at the maximal achievable reliability allowed by the quantum thermodynamic uncertainty relation. Moreover, coherent engines manifest more nonclassical features than incoherent engines because they violate the classical thermodynamic uncertainty relation by a greater amount and for a wider range of parameters. These genuine enhancements in the performance of coherent engines are directly attributed to their capacity to harness higher energetic coherence for the resonant driving case. The experimental feasibility of coherent engines and the improved understanding of how quantum properties can enhance performance may find applications in quantum-enabled technologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04771v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM) has evolved into an indispensable tool for structural and magnetic characterization of surfaces at the nanometer scale. In strong contrast to synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray PEEM as a leading method for element-specific magnetic properties via magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), laboratory ultraviolet (UV) PEEM has seen limited application with much smaller dichroism effects for in-plane magnetization. Here we introduce darkfield PEEM as a novel approach to enhance MCD contrast in threshold photoemission, enabling efficient MCD imaging with significantly enhanced contrast by an order-of-magnitude for Fe(001). This advancement paves the way for MCD imaging on femtosecond timescales using modern lasers. The experimental results will be quantitatively benchmarked against advanced relativistic photoemission calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09938v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the diode effect of the supercurrent in the Josephson junctions with the loop current states as the tunneling barrier. The loop current states are realized by the Haldane model which preserves the inversion symmetry and thus forbids the diode effect. We demonstrate how the inversion symmetry can be broken in the monolayer and bilayer systems. In the monolayer system, inversion symmetry can be broken by either introducing a sublattice staggered potential for the Haldane model or introducing a modified Haldane model, and in the bilayer system, it can be broken by either staking the two layers with opposite current directions or by directly applying an electric field perpendicular to the layers. We further show that the diode efficiency can be tuned by the interlayer coupling and the strength of the electric field or interlayer voltage. Our results provide another route to realize the Josephson diode effect by breaking the time-reversal symmetry through the loop-current states.</description>

      <title>Computing the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Invariant in Two-Dimensional Strongly-Correlated Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12120v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for time-reversal invariant insulators can be formulated in terms of the boundary-condition dependence of the ground state wavefunction for both non-interacting and strongly-correlated insulators. By introducing a family of quasi-single particle states associated to the many-body ground state of an insulator, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant can be expressed as the integral of a certain Berry connection over half the space of boundary conditions, providing an alternative expression to the formulations that appear in [Lee et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{100}$, 186807 (2008)]. We show the equivalence of the different many-body formulations of the invariant, and show how they reduce to known band-theoretic results for Slater determinant ground states. Finally, we apply our results to analytically calculate the invariant for the Kane-Mele model with nonlocal (orbital) Hatsugai-Kohmoto (HK) interactions. This rigorously establishes the topological nontriviality of the Kane-Mele model with HK interactions, and represents one of the few exact calculations of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ invariant for a strongly-interacting system.</description>

      <title>Global well-posedness in a Hartree-Fock model for graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graphene is a monolayer graphitic film in which electrons behave like two-dimensional Dirac fermions without mass. Its study has attracted a wide interest in the domain of condensed matter physics. In particular, it represents an ideal system to test the comprehension of 2D massless relativistic particles in a laboratory, the Fermi velocity being 300 times smaller than the speed of light. In this work, we present a global well-posedness result for graphene in the Hartree- Fock approximation. The model allows to describe the time evolution of graphene in the presence of external time-dependent electric potentials, such as those induced by local charge defects in the monolayer of carbon atoms. Our approach is based on a well established non-perturbative framework originating from the study of three-dimensional quantum electrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Yukawa-Lorentz Symmetry of Tilted Non-Hermitian Dirac Semimetals at Quantum Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Dirac materials, hosting linearly dispersing quasiparticles at low energies, exhibit an emergent Lorentz symmetry close to a quantum critical point (QCP) separating semimetallic state from a strongly-coupled gapped insulator or superconductor. This feature appears to be quite robust even in the open Dirac systems coupled to an environment, featuring non-Hermitian (NH) Dirac fermions: close to a strongly coupled QCP, a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry emerges in terms of a unique terminal velocity for both the fermion and the bosonic order parameter fluctuations, while the system can either retain non-Hermiticity or completely decouple from the environment thus recovering Hermiticity as an emergent phenomenon. We here show that such a Yukawa-Lorentz symmetry can emerge at the quantum criticality even when the NH Dirac Hamiltonian includes a tilt term at the lattice scale. As we demonstrate by performing a leading order $\epsilon=3-d$ expansion close to $d=3$ upper critical dimension of the theory, a tilt term becomes irrelevant close to the QCP separating the NH Dirac semimetal and a gapped (insulating or superconducting) phase. Such a behavior also extends to the case of the linear-in-momentum non-tilt perturbation, introducing the velocity anisotropy for the Dirac quasiparticles, which also becomes irrelevant at the QCP. These predictions can be numerically tested in quantum Monte Carlo lattice simulations of the NH Hubbard-like models hosting low-energy NH tilted Dirac fermions.</description>

      <title>Power Law Behavior in the Spatial and Frequency Domain Governing Thermal Slip at a Liquid/Solid Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated chips for power intensive graphics and computer processing applications dissipate so much heat nowadays that liquid based cooling has become practically essential to prevent breakdown from thermal runaway. Fortunately, cooling schemes based on immersion technology or microfluidic networks are proving effective. However, further progress ultimately requires tackling the intrinsic thermal impedance caused by the discontinuity in properties across the liquid/solid (L/S) interface. Since experimental tools still lack sufficient spatiotemporal resolution for this purpose and given there are no analytic models for phonon propagation across the L/S interface, researchers have come to rely heavily on non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations. The goal of this computational study was to determine whether there exist compact general equations for the thermal slip length based on correlated behavior in the L/S contact zone. The results reveal power law equations for the thermal slip length incorporating the influence of molecular interaction parameters, local temperature, long range translational order and peak vibrational frequencies. These findings offer a promising route forward directed at the influence of surface localized phonons in the L/S contact zone.</description>

      <title>Production-ready double-side fabrication of dual-band infrared meta-optics using deep-UV lithography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09488v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Meta-optics, the application of metasurfaces into optical systems, is seeing an accelerating development owing to advantages in size, weight and cost and the ability to program optical functions beyond traditional refractive optics. The transition of meta-optics from the laboratory into applications is enabled by scalable production methods based on highly reproducible semiconductor process technology. Here, we introduce a novel method for fabrication of double-sided metasurfaces through deep-UV lithography as a production-ready method for achieving high-quality meta-optics. We achieve patterning of a silicon wafer on both sides with mutual alignment of around 25 $\mu$m based on tool accuracy, without requiring through-wafer alignment markers other than the wafer notch. A first novel application highlighting the benefits of double-sided design is demonstrated in the form of a dual-band metalens with independent control over focal lengths in mid- and long-wave infrared bands. Using multi-reticle stitching we demonstrate a 40 mm diameter, large-area metalens with excellent broadband imaging performance, showing partial cancelling of chromatic dispersion when used in a hybrid configuration with a BaF$_2$ refractive lens. Our work opens new avenues for infrared meta-optics designs and double-side meta-optics fabrication through a production-ready technique which can be directly translated into scalable technology for real-world applications.</description>
