      <title>Singular walks in the quarter plane and Bernoulli numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider singular (aka genus $0$) walks in the quarter plane and their associated generating functions $Q(x,y,t)$, which enumerate the walks starting from the origin, of fixed endpoint (encoded by the spatial variables $x$ and $y$) and of fixed length (encoded by the time variable $t$). We first prove that the previous series can be extended up to a universal value of $t$ (in the sense that this holds for all singular models), namely $t=\frac{1}{2}$, and we provide a probabilistic interpretation of $Q(x,y,\frac{1}{2})$. As a second step, we refine earlier results in the literature and show that $Q(x,y,t)$ is indeed differentially transcendental for any $t\in(0,\frac{1}{2}]$. Moreover, we prove that $Q(x,y,\frac{1}{2})$ is strongly differentially transcendental. As a last step, we show that for certain models the series expansion of $Q(x,y,\frac{1}{2})$ is directly related to Bernoulli numbers. This provides a second proof of its strong differential transcendence.</description>

      <title>Strict increase in the number of normally hyperbolic limit tori in 3D polynomial vector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13832v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The second part of Hilbert's 16th problem concerns determining the maximum number $H(m)$ of limit cycles that a planar polynomial vector field of degree $m$ can exhibit. A natural extension to the three-dimensional space is to study the maximum number $N(m)$ of limit tori that can occur in spatial polynomial vector fields of degree $m$. In this work, we focus on normally hyperbolic limit tori and show that the corresponding maximum number $N_h(m)$, if finite, increases strictly with $m$. More precisely, we prove that $N_h(m+1) \geqslant N_h(m) + 1$. Our proof relies on the torus bifurcation phenomenon observed in spatial vector fields near Hopf-Zero equilibria. While conditions for such bifurcations are typically expressed in terms of higher-order normal form coefficients, we derive explicit and verifiable criteria for the occurrence of a torus bifurcation assuming only that the linear part of the unperturbed vector field is in Jordan normal form. This approach circumvents the need for intricate computations involving higher-order normal forms.</description>

      <title>An elementary proof that the set of exceptions to the law of large numbers in Pierce expansions has full Hausdorff dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The digits of the Pierce expansion satisfy the law of large numbers. It is known that the Hausdorff dimension of the set of exceptions to the law of large numbers is 1. We provide an elementary proof of this fact by adapting Jun Wu's method, which was originally used for Engel expansions. Our approach emphasizes the fractal nature of exceptional sets and avoids advanced machinery, thereby relying instead on explicit sequences and constructive techniques. Furthermore, our method opens the possibility of extending similar analyses to other real number representation systems, such as the Engel, L\"uroth, and Sylvester expansions, thus paving the way for further explorations in metric number theory and fractal geometry.</description>

      <title>Borel complexity of sets of ideal limit points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $X$ be an uncountable Polish space and let $\mathcal{I}$ be an ideal on $\omega$. A point $\eta \in X$ is an $\mathcal{I}$-limit point of a sequence $(x_n)$ taking values in $X$ if there exists a subsequence $(x_{k_n})$ convergent to $\eta$ such that the set of indexes $\{k_n: n \in \omega\}\notin \mathcal{I}$. Denote by $\mathscr{L}(\mathcal{I})$ the family of subsets $S\subseteq X$ such that $S$ is the set of $\mathcal{I}$-limit points of some sequence taking values in $X$ or $S$ is empty. In this paper, we study the relationships between the topological complexity of ideals $\mathcal{I}$, their combinatorial properties, and the families of sets $\mathscr{L}(\mathcal{I})$ which can be attained.
  On the positive side, we provide several purely combinatorial (not dependind on the space $X$) characterizations of ideals $\mathcal{I}$ for the inclusions and the equalities between $\mathscr{L}(\mathcal{I})$ and the Borel classes $\Pi^0_1$, $\Sigma^0_2$, and $\Pi^0_3$. As a consequence, we prove that if $\mathcal{I}$ is a $\Pi^0_4$ ideal then exactly one of the following cases holds: $\mathscr{L}(\mathcal{I})=\Pi^0_1$ or $\mathscr{L}(\mathcal{I})=\Sigma^0_2$ or $\mathscr{L}(\mathcal{I})=\Sigma^1_1$ (however we do not have an example of a $\Pi^0_4$ ideal with $\mathscr{L}(\mathcal{I})=\Sigma^1_1$). In addition, we provide an explicit example of a coanalytic ideal $\mathcal{I}$ for which $\mathscr{L}(\mathcal{I})=\Sigma^1_1$.
  On the negative side, we show that there are no ideals $\mathcal{I}$ such that $\mathscr{L}(\mathcal{I})=\Pi^0_2$ or $\mathscr{L}(\mathcal{I})=\Sigma^0_3$. We conclude with several open questions.</description>
