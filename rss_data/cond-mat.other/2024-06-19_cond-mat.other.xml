      <title>Inside the Working Mechanism of Meta-generalized Gradient Density Functional Approximations: The Example of Quantum Spin-Hall Insulator 1T`-WTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum spin Hall (QSH) insulators have attracted intensive experimental and theoretical studies due to their beneficial applications in spintronic devices. Density functional theory (DFT) meets challenges when describing the electronic structure of QSH materials. Only the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) with spin-orbit coupling (SOC) is effective in revealing the band opening in the typical QSH 1T`-WTe2, but with increased computational demands. Here, using DFT, Wannier function simulations, the screened hybrid HSE06 functional, and first-principles-based many body perturbation theory GW, we investigate the sensitive electronic structure in monolayer 1T`-WTe2, with advanced meta-generalized gradient (meta-GGA) density functional approximations. The success of the recent SCAN and r2SCAN meta-GGAs left their predecessor meta-GGA made very simple (MVS) ignored by the scientific community. Largely unnoticed were the increased band gaps of MVS compared to any semilocal approximation including SCAN. We find that the non-empirical MVS approximation yields a positive fundamental band gap, without any help from exact exchange, Hubbard U, or SOC correction. We explain the success of the meta-GGA MVS for the band gap in 1T`-WTe2 by presenting two working mechanisms in meta-GGA approximations. Besides, we point out the difficulty of using G0W0 for 1T`-WTe2. Although the single shot GW correction with an MVS reference yields a smaller band gap than GW with PBE, the G0W0@MVS is still not suitable for simulating 1T`-WTe2, due to its negative band gap. These DFT and beyond DFT results highlight the importance of meta-GGAs and novel construction schemes with enhanced kinetic energy density dependence. The MVS approximation re-appears as an appealing alternative for accurately describing 1T`-WTe2, paving an efficient way for exploring other two-dimensional QSH materials in high-throughput calculations.</description>

      <title>The Green's function Monte Carlo combined with projected entangled pair state approach to the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The tensor network algorithm, a family of prevalent numerical methods for quantum many-body problems, aptly captures the entanglement properties intrinsic to quantum systems, enabling precise representation of quantum states. However, its computational cost is notably high, particularly in calculating physical observables like correlation functions. To surmount the computational challenge and enhance efficiency, we propose integrating the Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) method with the projected entangled pair state (PEPS) ansatz. This approach combines the high-efficiency characteristics of Monte Carlo with the sign-free nature of tensor network states and proves effective in addressing the computational bottleneck. To showcase its prowess, we apply this hybrid approach to investigate the antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice, a model notorious for its sign problem in quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our results reveal a substantial improvement in the accuracy of ground-state energy when utilizing a preliminary PEPS as the guiding wave function for GFMC. By calculating the structure factor and spin-spin correlation functions, we further characterize the phase diagram, identifying a possible columnar valence-bond state phase within the intermediate parameter range of $0.52 &lt; J_2/J_1 &lt; 0.58$. This comprehensive study underscores the efficacy of our combined approach, demonstrating its ability to accurately simulate frustrated quantum spin systems while ensuring computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Borromean supercounterfluids at finite temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While the properties of standard (single-component) superfluids are well understood, principal differences arise in a special type of multicomponent systems -- the so-called Borromean supercounterfluids -- in which (i) supertransport is possible only in the counterflow regime and (ii) there are three or more counterflowing components. Borromean supercounterfluids's correlation and topological properties distinguish them from their single- and two-component counterparts.
  The component-symmetric case characterized by a distinctively different universality class of the supercounterfluid-to-normal phase transition is especially interesting. Using the recently introduced concept of compact-gauge invariance as the guiding principle, we develop the finite-temperature description of Borromean supercounterfluids in terms of an asymptotically exact long-wave effective action. We formulate and study Borromean XY and loop statistical models, capturing the universal long-range properties and allowing us to perform efficient worm algorithm simulations. Numeric results demonstrate perfect agreement with analytic predictions. Particularly instructive is the two-dimensional case, where the Borromean nature of the system is strongly manifested while allowing for an asymptotically exact analytic description.</description>
