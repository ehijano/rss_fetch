      <title>The Coupled Hitchin-He Equations: Integrable Deformations and Rigidity of the Moduli Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the \emph{parameter-geometrization} to the Hitchin system, a paradigm embedding deformation parameters into geometry via the coupled Hitchin-He equations on a surface with boundary. A boundary term couples a second Higgs field $\psi$, recovering the classical system at $\alpha=0$. We prove a unique, smooth solution branch exists near $\alpha=0$ (Theorem A). The system is integrable, admitting a Lax pair (Theorem B). Crucially, the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_\alpha$ is analytically isomorphic to $\mathcal{M}_0$ for small $|\alpha|$, preserving the Hitchin fibration -- revealing a deep rigidity where all moduli are controlled by the primary Higgs field (Theorem C). Using the \emph{nonlinear embedding} technique that casts the deformed system into the form of a classical Higgs bundle system, whose integrability and geometry are well-understood, we extends the framework to compact K\"ahler manifolds (Theorem D).</description>

      <title>Minimal Graph Transformations and their Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a complete classification of minimal graph surfaces that admit graphical transformations into other minimal surfaces. These transformations are functions that map the height function of a minimal graph surface to another height function, which also describes a minimal graph surface. While trivial maps such as translations and reflections exist, we formulate and solve the Non-Trivial Minimal Graph Transformation Problem, governed by a coupled system of partial differential equations. A central result establishes the rigorous equivalence of this original system to a modified problem for a harmonic function. Through a complex variable approach and a weakening technique, the analysis is reduced to solving a fundamental ordinary differential equation parameterized by a real constant k. The explicit integration of this ordinary differential equation involves various elliptic integrals and identities of elliptic functions. Solving the ordinary differential equation for the three cases: when the constant k equals zero, when k is greater than zero, and when k is less than zero yields the full classification of all admissible surfaces and their associated transformations. This process yields several classes of minimal surfaces that, to the best of the author's knowledge, constitute new families of minimal surfaces.</description>

      <title>Length spectrum rigidity and flexibility of spheres of revolution with one equator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define a notion of marked length spectrum for $S^1$-symmetric Riemannian metrics on the two-sphere having only one equator. We prove that isospectral metrics in this class have conjugate geodesic flows. Under a further $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry assumption, we show that the marked length spectrum determines the metric. Finally, we show that every isospectral class of metrics contains a unique $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric metric and give an explicit description of this isospectral class as an infinite dimensional convex set, generalizing the known description of $S^1$-symmetric Zoll metrics. This paper contains also two appendices, in which we provide an elementary proof of the fact that a $C^2$ real valued function on an interval is determined by the set of tangent lines to its graph, and we classify a class of $S^1$-invariant contact forms on three-manifolds.</description>

      <title>Solutions and singularities of the Ricci-harmonic flow and Ricci-like flows of $\mathrm{G_2}$-structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find explicit solutions and singularities of the Ricci-harmonic flow of $\mathrm{G_2}$-structures, the Ricci-like flows of $\mathrm{G_2}$-structures studied by Gianniotis-Zacharopoulos in arXiv:2505.06872 (J. Geom. Anal. 36.2 (2026)) and of the negative gradient flow of an energy functional of $\mathrm{G_2}$-structures, on $7$-dimensional contact Calabi-Yau manifolds and the $7$-dimensional Heisenberg group. We prove that the natural co-closed $\mathrm{G_2}$-structure on a contact Calabi-Yau manifold as the initial condition leads to an ancient solution of the Ricci-harmonic flow with a finite time Type I singularity, and it gives an immortal solution to the Ricci-like flows with an infinite time singularity which are Type III if the transversal Calabi-Yau distribution is flat, and Type IIb otherwise. The same ansatz gives ancient solution to the negative gradient flow of $\mathrm{G_2}$-structures. These are the first examples of Type I singularities of the Ricci-harmonic flow and Type IIb and Type III singularities of the Ricci-like flows. We also obtain similar solutions for all the three flows on the $7$-dimensional Heisenberg group.</description>

      <title>Quasi-projective nilmanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M=V\setminus D$ be a smooth quasi-projective variety for some smooth projective variety $V$ and a divisor $D$ with normal crossings. Assume that $M$ is diffeomorphic to a non-compact nilmanifold $\Gamma\backslash N\times\mathbb{R}^m$. We show that $M$ is diffeomorphic to a trivial bundle $T^n\times \mathbb{R}^m$ over a torus $T^n$ if the first cohomology $H^1(V)$ of $V$ vanishes. Moreover, in general, we show that $M$ is diffeomorphic to a trivial bundle $T^{b_1(M)}\times \mathbb{R}^m$ over a $b_1(M)$-dimensional torus $T^{b_1(M)}$, or a trivial bundle $E\times \mathbb{R}^m$ such that $E$ is a torus bundle $E\rightarrow T^{b_1(M)}$ over a torus $T^{b_1(M)}$. Conversely, we consider whether non-compact nilmanifolds are diffeomorphic to a smooth quasi-projective variety. We determine the Lie groups of dimension up to $8$ such that corresponding non-compact nilmanifolds may be diffeomorphic to smooth quasi-projective varieties.</description>

      <title>A Morse-Bott unification of the Grassmannians of a symplectic vector space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a quadratic Morse-Bott function on the real Grassmannian of a symplectic vector space from a compatible linear complex structure. We show that its critical loci consist of linear subspaces that split into isotropic and complex parts and that its stable manifolds coincide with the orbits of the linear symplectomorphism group. These orbits generalize the Lagrangian, symplectic, isotropic, and coisotropic Grassmannians to include the Grassmannians of linear subspaces that are neither isotropic, coisotropic, nor symplectic. The negative gradient flow deformation retracts these spaces onto compact homogeneous spaces for the unitary group.</description>

Abstract: Under the assumption that data lie on a compact (unknown) manifold without boundary, we derive finite sample bounds for kernel smoothing and its (first and second) derivatives, and we establish asymptotic normality through Berry-Esseen type bounds. Special cases include kernel density estimation, kernel regression and the heat kernel signature. Connections to the graph Laplacian are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.16966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We obtain strict stability inequalities for homogeneous solutions of the one-phase Bernoulli problem. We prove that in dimension $7$ and above, cohomogeneity one solutions with bi-orthogonal symmetry are strictly stable. As a consequence, we obtain a bound on the first eigenvalue and the decay rates of Jacobi fields, with applications to the generic regularity of the one-phase problem.</description>

      <title>Horizontality with infinite complexity in the twistor spaces on tori</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.02748v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the complexity of horizontality in the twistor space $\hat{E}$ associated with an oriented vector bundle $E$ of rank $4$ with a positive-definite metric over a torus. If the horizontality has finite complexity of degree $d&gt;2$ for an element of a fiber of $\hat{E}$, then the complexity is expressed in terms of a finite subgroup of $SO(3)$ ([3]). In the present paper, we observe that if the horizontality has infinite complexity derived from one of the cases studied in [3], then the complexity is expressed by a dense subset of $S^2$.</description>

      <title>Sard properties for polynomial maps in infinite dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02296v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sard's theorem asserts that the set of critical values of a smooth map from one Euclidean space to another one has measure zero. A version of this result for infinite-dimensional Banach manifolds was proven by Smale for maps with Fredholm differential. It is well-known, however, that when the domain is infinite dimensional and the range is finite dimensional, the result is not true -- even under the assumption that the map is ``polynomial'' -- and a general theory is still lacking. Addressing this issue, in this paper, we provide sharp quantitative criteria for the validity of Sard's theorem in this setting. Our motivation comes from sub-Riemannian geometry and, as an application of our results, we prove the sub-Riemannian Sard conjecture for the restriction of the Endpoint map of Carnot groups to the set of piece-wise real-analytic controls with large enough radius of convergence, and the strong Sard conjecture for the restriction to the set of piece-wise entire controls.</description>

Abstract: Based on [1], we study the complexity of horizontality in each twistor space $\hat{E}_{\varepsilon}$ associated with an oriented vector bundle $E$ of rank $4$ with a positive-definite metric over the $2$-torus $T^2$, and obtain classification of the topological holonomy groups in $SO(3)$. We observe that there exist many topological holonomy groups in $SO(3)$ generated by two finite order elements and equipped with noncommutative pairs which consist of infinite order elements. We find topological holonomy groups which are dense in $SO(4)$.</description>

      <title>A Dynamical Approach to the Berezin--Li--Yau Inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08966v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a dynamical method for proving the sharp Berezin--Li--Yau inequality. The approach is based on the volume-preserving mean curvature flow and a new monotonicity principle for the Riesz mean $R_\Lambda(\Omega_t)$. For convex domains we show that $R_\Lambda$ is monotone non-decreasing along the flow. The key input is a geometric correlation inequality between the boundary spectral density $Q_\Lambda$ and the mean curvature $H$, established in all dimensions: in $d=2$ via circular symmetrization, and in $d\ge 3$ via the boundary Weyl expansion together with the Laugesen--Morpurgo trace minimization principle. Since the flow converges smoothly to the ball, the monotonicity implies the sharp Berezin--Li--Yau bound for every smooth convex domain. As an application, we obtain a sharp dynamical Ces\`aro--P\'olya inequality for eigenvalue averages.</description>

      <title>Geometric Quantization by Paths Part II: The General Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In Part I, we established the construction of the Prequantum Groupoid for simply connected spaces. This second part extends the theory to arbitrary connected parasymplectic diffeological spaces $(\mathrm{X}, \omega)$. We identify the obstruction to the existence of the Prequantum Groupoid as the non-additivity of the integration of the prequantum form $\mathbf{K}\omega$ on the space of loops.
  By defining a Total Group of Periods $\mathrm{P}_\omega$ directly on the space of paths, which absorbs the periods arising from the algebraic relations of the fundamental group, we construct a Prequantum Groupoid $\mathbf{T}_\omega$ with connected isotropy isomorphic to the torus of periods $\mathrm{T}_\omega = \mathbf{R}/\mathrm{P}_\omega$.
  Furthermore, we propose that this groupoid $\mathbf{T}_\omega$ constitutes the Quantum System itself. The classical space $\mathrm{X}$ is embedded as the Skeleton of units, surrounded by a Quantum Fog of non-identity morphisms. We prove that the group of automorphisms of the Quantum System is isomorphic to the group of symmetries of the Dynamical System, $\mathrm{Diff}(\mathrm{X}, \omega)$.</description>

      <title>Geometric calculations on probability manifolds from reciprocal relations in Master equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19368v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Onsager reciprocal relations model physical irreversible processes from complex systems. Recently, it has been shown that Onsager principles for master equations on finite states introduce a class of Riemannian metrics on the probability simplex, leading to probability manifolds or finite-state Wasserstein--2 spaces. In this paper, we study geometric calculations on probability manifolds, deriving the Levi-Civita connection, gradient, Hessian operators of energies, parallel transport, and calculating both the Riemannian and sectional curvatures. We present two examples of geometric quantities in probability manifolds. One example is the Levi-Civita connection from the chemical monomolecular triangle reaction. The other example is the sectional, Ricci, and scalar curvatures in Wasserstein space on a three-point lattice graph.</description>
