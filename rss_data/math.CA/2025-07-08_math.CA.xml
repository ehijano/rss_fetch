      <title>Carnot-Carath\'eodory Balls on Manifolds with Boundary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nagel, Stein, and Wainger introduced a detailed quantitative study of Carnot--Carath\'eodory balls on a smooth manifold without boundary. Most importantly, they introduced scaling maps adapted to Carnot--Carath\'eodory balls and H\"ormander vector fields. Their work was extended by many authors and has since become a key tool in the study of the interior theory of subelliptic PDEs; in particular, the study of maximally subelliptic PDEs. We introduce a generalization of this quantitative theory to manifolds with boundary, where we have scaling maps both on the interior and on the part of the boundary which is non-characteristic with respect to the vector fields. This is the first paper in a forthcoming series devoted to studying maximally subelliptic boundary value problems.</description>

      <title>Eigenvalue equations for sieved polynomials or proving Askey right again</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sieved Jacobi polynomials have been introduced by Askey. These can be obtained from conveniently taking $q$ to be a root of unity in the Askey-Wilson polynomials. The question of determining if they are eigenfunctions of some operator has been lingering for a long time. Askey impressed on us his conviction that it had an affirmative answer. It is shown that he was right and that this operator is of Dunkl type with cyclic reflections corresponding to the powers of $q$.</description>

      <title>A Novel Schwartz Space for the $\left(k,\frac{2}{n}\right)-$Generalized Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we introduce the generalized Schwartz space $\mathcal{S}_{k,n}(\mathbb{R})$, designed specifically for the $\left(k,\frac{2}{n}\right)-$generalized Fourier transform $\mathcal{F}_{k,n}:=\mathcal{F}_{k,\frac{2}{n}}$. We establish that $\mathcal{S}_{k,n}(\mathbb{R})$ is invariant under $\mathcal{F}_{k,n}$ and explore its principal properties in detail. Furthermore, by defining the subspace $\mathcal{D}_{k,n}(\mathbb{R})$, consisting of functions with bounded support, we show that the subspace is dense in $L^p(d\mu_{k,n})$ for $1 \leq p &lt; \infty$. Lastly, we address a conjecture regarding the higher-dimensional scenario.</description>

      <title>Explicit Formulas For Generalized Polylogarithmic Integrals, Euler Sums, And BBP-Type Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper explores closed-form expressions for some polylogarithm integrals with integrands containing five parameters. These closed form expressions are given in terms of the Lerch transcendent function, which reduces, in some cases, to well-known special functions, such as the Riemann zeta, Dirichlet eta, Dirichlet beta, the Hurwitz zeta, and the polygamma functions. Related Euler sums and BBP-type series will also be discussed.</description>

      <title>The Bilinear Hilbert-Carleson operator along curves. The purely non-zero curvature case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we provide the maximal boundedness range (up to end-points) for the Bilinear Hilbert-Carleson operator along curves in the (purely) non-zero curvature setting. More precisely, we show that the operator $$ BHC_{[\vec{a},\vec{\alpha}]}(f_1,f_2)(x) := \sup_{\lambda\in\mathbb{R}} \left|\,p.v.\, \int_{\mathbb{R}} f_1(x - a_1 t^{\alpha_1}) \,f_2(x - a_2 t^{\alpha_2}) \,e^{i\,\lambda\,a_3 \,t^{\alpha_3}} \,\frac{dt}{t}\right|$$ obeys the bounds $$\|BHC_{[\vec{a},\vec{\alpha}]} (f_1,f_2)\|_{L^r} \lesssim_{\vec{a} \,\vec{\alpha},r,p_1,p_2} \|f_1\|_{L^{p_1}}\,\|f_2\|_{L^{p_2}}$$ whenever $\vec{a}=(a_1,a_2,a_3),\,\vec{\alpha}=(\alpha_1,\alpha_2,\alpha_3)\in (\mathbb{R}\setminus\{0\})^3$ with $\vec{\alpha}$ having pairwise distinct coordinates and for any H\"older range $\frac{1}{p_1}+\frac{1}{p_2}=\frac{1}{r}$ with $1&lt;p_1,p_2&lt;\infty$ and $\frac{1}{2}&lt;r&lt;\infty$. This result is achieved via the Rank II LGC method introduced in arXiv:2308.10706.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates of the Schr\"{o}dinger type propagators on modulation spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to conducting a comprehensive and self-contained study of the boundedness on modulation spaces of Fourier integral operators arising when solving Schr\"{o}dinger type operators. The symbols of these operators belong to the Sj\"{o}strand class $M^{\infty,1}$, and their phase functions satisfy certain regularity conditions associated with mixed modulation spaces. Our conclusions cover two novel situations corresponding to the so-called mild and high growth of phase functions. These conclusions represent essential improvements and generalizations of existing results. Our method is based on a reasonable decomposition and scaling of the symbol and phase functions, ensuring their membership in appropriate mixed modulation spaces. In a certain sense, all conclusions of this paper are optimal.</description>

      <title>On the approximation properties of Stieltjes polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study the approximation properties of $g$-polynomials, defined as linear combinations of iterated Stieltjes integrals of a constant function. Focusing on the case where the derivator $g$ has finitely many discontinuities, we prove that the space of $g$-polynomials is dense in the space of uniformly $g$-continuous functions. This result establishes a Weierstrass-type approximation theorem within the framework of Stieltjes calculus. The characterization of the closure of the space of $g$-polynomials in the general case, where the derivator may exhibit more complex behavior, remains an open and challenging problem, which we briefly discuss.</description>

      <title>One sided orthogonal polynomials and a pointwise convergence result for $SU(2)$-valued nonlinear Fourier series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We elaborate on a connection between the $SU(2)$-valued nonlinear Fourier series and sequences of left and right orthogonal polynomials for complex measures on the unit circle. We show a convergence result for the associated reproducing kernel. This is a universality type result in the vein of Mate-Nevai-Totik, which turns out to be much simpler in the $SU(2)$ case than in the $SU(1,1)$ case. We then relate a.e. pointwise convergence of the product of left and right polynomials and their squares with both behavior of their zeros as well as behavior of some local parameters for these polynomials. We conclude by proving almost everywhere convergence along lacunary sequences of the functional $(a_n ^* +b_n)(a_n - b_n ^*)$ of the partial $SU(2)$-valued nonlinear Fourier series $(a_n, b_n)$ under the assumption that the nonlinear Fourier series $(a,b)$ itself satisfies both $\|b\|_{L^{\infty} (\mathbb{T})} &lt; 2^{- \frac 1 2}$ and $a^*$ is outer.</description>

      <title>Attraction of the core and the cohesion flow</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02918v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We adopt a continuous-time dynamical system approach to study the evolution of the state of a game driven by the willingness to reduce the total dissatisfaction of the coalitions about their payment. Inspired by the work of Grabisch and Sudh\"olter about core stability, we define a vector field on the set of preimputations from which is defined, for any preimputation, a cohesion curve describing the evolution of the state. We prove that for each preimputation, there exists a unique cohesion curve. Subsequently, we show that, for the cohesion flow of a balanced game, the core is the unique minimal attractor of the flow, the realm of which is the whole preimputation set. These results improve our understanding of the ubiquity of the core in the study of cooperative games with transferable utility.</description>

      <title>P\'olya's conjecture up to $\epsilon$-loss and quantitative estimates for the remainder of Weyl's law</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04307v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$ be a bounded Lipschitz domain. For any $\epsilon\in (0,1)$ we show that for any Dirichlet eigenvalue $\lambda_k(\Omega)&gt;\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$, it holds \begin{align*} k&amp;\le (1+\epsilon)\frac{|\Omega|\omega(n)}{(2\pi)^n}\lambda_k(\Omega)^{n/2}, \end{align*} where $\Lambda(\epsilon,\Omega)$ is given explicitly. This reduces the $\epsilon$-loss version of P\'olya's conjecture to a computational problem. This estimate is based on a uniform estimate on the remainder of the Weyl law on Lipschitz domains, which appears to be the first quantitative estimate for the remainder of Weyl's law since Weyl's seminal work in the year 1911. We also provide in all dimensions $n\ge 2$, a class of domains that may even have rather irregular shapes or boundaries but satisfy P\'olya's conjecture.</description>

Abstract: The general problem of the factorization of a basic hypergeometric series is presented and discussed. The case of the general $_2\psi_2$ series is examined in detail. Connections are found with the theory of basic hypergeometric series on root systems. Alternative proofs of several well-known summation and transformation formulae, including Gustafson's generalization of Ramanujan's $_1\psi_1$ summation, are obtained incidentally.</description>

Abstract: In this work we develop a theory of Stieltjes-analytic functions. We first define the Stieltjes monomials and polynomials and we study them exhaustively. Then, we introduce the Stieltjes analytic functions locally, as an infinite series of these Stieltjes monomials and we study their properties in depth and how they relate to higher order Stieltjes differentiation. We define the exponential series and prove that it solves the first order linear problem. Finally, we apply the theory to solve higher order linear homogeneous Stieltjes differential equations with constant coefficients.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.07783v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide upper bounds for the Assouad spectrum $\dim_A^\theta(\text{Gr}(f))$ of the graph of a real-valued H\"older or Sobolev function $f$ defined on an interval $I \subset \mathbb{R}$. We demonstrate via examples that all of our bounds are sharp. In the setting of H\"older graphs, we further provide a geometric algorithm which takes as input the graph of an $\alpha$-H\"older continuous function satisfying a matching lower oscillation condition with exponent $\alpha$ and returns the graph of a new $\alpha$-H\"older continuous function for which the Assouad $\theta$-spectrum realizes the stated upper bound for all $\theta\in (0,1)$. Examples of functions to which this algorithm applies include the continuous nowhere differentiable functions of Weierstrass and Takagi.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16108v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We put forward a radial principle and a degeneracy locating principle of decoupling. The former generalises the Pramanik-Seeger argument used in the proof of decoupling for the light cone. The latter locates the degenerate part of a manifold and effectively reduces the decoupling problem to two extremes: non-degenerate case and totally degenerate case. Both principles aim to provide a new algebraic approach of reducing decoupling for new manifolds to decoupling for known manifolds.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergeometric class equations are given by second
  order differential operators in one variable whose coefficient at the second derivative
  is a polynomial of degree $\leq2$, at the first derivative of degree
  $\leq1$ and the free term is a number. Their solutions, called hypergeometric class functions, include the Gauss hypergeometric function and its various limiting cases. The paper presents a unified approach to these functions. The main structure behind this approach is a family of complex 4-dimensional Lie algebras, originally due to Willard Miller. Hypergeometric class functions can be interpreted as eigenfunctions of the quadratic Casimir operator in a representation of Miller's Lie algebra given by differential operators in three complex variables. One obtains a unified treatment of various properties of hypergeometric class functions such as recurrence relations, discrete symmetries, power series expansions, integral representations, generating functions and orthogonality of polynomial solutions.</description>

      <title>Gauss-Appell polynomials: An umbral calculus approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article aims to reinforce the broad applicability of the umbral approach to address complex mathematical challenges and contribute to various scientific and engineering endeavors. The umbral methods are used to reformulate the theoretical framework of special functions and provide powerful techniques for uncovering new extensions and relationships among these functions. This research article introduces an innovative class of special polynomials, specifically the Gauss-Appell polynomials. The fundamental attributes of this versatile family of special polynomials are outlined, including generating relations, explicit representations, and differential recurrence relations. Certain examples of the particular members that belong to the class of Gauss-Appell polynomials are also considered.</description>

      <title>Decoupling for surfaces with radial symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17100v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilise the two principles of decoupling introduced in [arXiv:2407.16108] to prove decoupling for two types of surfaces exhibiting radial symmetry. The first type are surfaces of revolution in $\mathbb R^n$ generated by smooth surfaces in $\mathbb R^3$. The second type of surfaces are graphs of trivariate homogeneous smooth functions of a nonzero degree.</description>

      <title>An eigenvalue result for Hammerstein integral equations with sign changing nonlinearities and functional terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss, via a version of the Birkhoff-Kellogg theorem, the existence of positive and negative eigenvalues of Hammerstein integral equations with sign-changing nonlinearities and functional terms. The corresponding eigenfunctions have a given norm that, in turn, provides a location for the eigenvalues. As an application, we study the solvability of parameter-dependent boundary value problems for nonlocal ordinary differential equations. Two examples illustrate the applicability of the theory in the case of mixed and Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Simplified Airy function Asymptotic expansions for Reverse Generalised Bessel Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20934v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Uniform asymptotic expansions are derived for reverse generalised Bessel polynomials of large degree $n$, real parameter $a$, and complex argument $z$, which are simpler than previously known results. The defining differential equation is analysed; for large $n$ and $\frac{3}{2} - n &lt; a &lt; \infty$, it possesses two turning points in the complex $z$ plane which are complex conjugates. Away from these turning points Liouville-Green expansions are obtained for the polynomials and two companion solutions of the differential equation, where asymptotic series appear in the exponent. Then representations involving Airy functions and two slowly varying coefficient functions are constructed. Using the Liouville-Green representations, asymptotic expansions are obtained for the coefficient functions that involve coefficients that can be easily and explicitly computed recursively. In conjunction with a suitable re-expansion, or Cauchy's integral formula, near the turning point, the expansions are valid for $-\Delta_{1} n+\frac{3}{2} \leq a \leq \Delta_{2} n$ for fixed arbitrary $\Delta_{1} \in (0,1)$ and bounded positive $\Delta_{2}$, uniformly for all unbounded complex values of $z$.</description>

Abstract: We show that if $\mathfrak{c} = \aleph_2$ then all covering numbers of Hausdorff measures $\operatorname{cov}(\mathcal{N}^s(\mathbb{R}^d))$ ($0 &lt; s &lt; d, d \in \omega$) are equal and all uniformity numbers $\operatorname{non}(\mathcal{N}^s(\mathbb{R}^d))$ ($0 &lt; s &lt; d, d \in \omega$) are equal. This is a partial answer to Problem 5.3 and 5.4 of [4].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.01722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the convergence exponent of Pierce expansion digit sequences. We explore some basic properties of the convergence exponent as a real-valued function defined on the closed unit interval, as well as those of the level sets of the function. Additionally, we further study subsets of the closed unit interval on which the series of positive $s$th powers of the reciprocals of the Pierce expansion digits diverges.</description>

      <title>Functional differential equations driven by c\`adl\`ag rough paths</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.17573v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The existence of unique solutions is established for rough differential equations (RDEs) with path-dependent coefficients and driven by c\`adl\`ag rough paths. Moreover, it is shown that the associated solution map, also known as It\^o-Lyons map, is locally Lipschitz continuous. These results are then applied to various classes of rough differential equations, such as controlled RDEs and RDEs with delay, as well as stochastic differential equations with delay. To that end, a joint rough path is constructed for a c\`adl\`ag martingale and its delayed version, that corresponds to stochastic It\^o integration.</description>

      <title>Universal approximation results for neural networks with non-polynomial activation function over non-compact domains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14759v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends the universal approximation property of single-hidden-layer feedforward neural networks beyond compact domains, which is of particular interest for the approximation within weighted $C^k$-spaces and weighted Sobolev spaces over unbounded domains. More precisely, by assuming that the activation function is non-polynomial, we establish universal approximation results within function spaces defined over non-compact subsets of a Euclidean space, including $L^p$-spaces, weighted $C^k$-spaces, and weighted Sobolev spaces, where the latter two include the approximation of the (weak) derivatives. Moreover, we provide some dimension-independent rates for approximating a function with sufficiently regular and integrable Fourier transform by neural networks with non-polynomial activation function.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity of ODE Solutions and Quantities of Interest with Respect to Component Functions in the Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.09655v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work analyzes the sensitivities of the solution of a system of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and a corresponding quantity of interest (QoI) to perturbations in a state-dependent component function that appears in the governing ODEs. This extends existing ODE sensitivity results, which consider the sensitivity of the ODE solution with respect to state-independent parameters. It is shown that with Carath\'eodory-type assumptions on the ODEs, the Implicit Function Theorem can be applied to establish continuous Fr\'echet differentiability of the ODE solution with respect to the component function. These sensitivities are used to develop new estimates for the change in the ODE solution or QoI when the component function is perturbed. In applications, this new sensitivity-based bound on the ODE solution or QoI error is often much tighter than classical Gronwall-type error bounds. The sensitivity-based error bounds are applied to Zermelo's problem and to a trajectory simulation for a hypersonic vehicle.</description>
