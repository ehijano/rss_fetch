      <title>Spurious Isospin Breaking in the In-medium Similarity Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robustly quantifying the uncertainty in the isospin-related theoretical correction $\delta_C$ to superallowed beta decay rates is vital for a correct assessment of CKM unitarity. To this end, we identify the sources of artificial or \textit{spurious} isospin symmetry breaking introduced by the IMSRG many-body framework at a computational level and provide remedies. We test our best policy for preventing spurious ISB by evaluating $\delta_C$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Hot QCD Matter 2024 -- Bulk Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The second Hot QCD Matter 2024 conference at IIT Mandi focused on various ongoing topics in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, encompassing theoretical and experimental perspectives. This proceedings volume includes 19 contributions that collectively explore diverse aspects of the bulk properties of hot QCD matter. The topics encompass the dynamics of electromagnetic fields, transport properties, hadronic matter, spin hydrodynamics, and the role of conserved charges in high-energy environments. These studies significantly enhance our understanding of the complex dynamics of hot QCD matter, the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formed in high-energy nuclear collisions. Advances in theoretical frameworks, including hydrodynamics, spin dynamics, and fluctuation studies, aim to improve theoretical calculations and refine our knowledge of the thermodynamic properties of strongly interacting matter. Experimental efforts, such as those conducted by the ALICE and STAR collaborations, play a vital role in validating these theoretical predictions and deepening our insight into the QCD phase diagram, collectivity in small systems, and the early-stage behavior of strongly interacting matter. Combining theoretical models with experimental observations offers a comprehensive understanding of the extreme conditions encountered in relativistic heavy-ion and proton-proton collisions.</description>

      <title>On the negative coupling O(N) model in 2d at high temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10496v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, I consider N-component scalar quantum field theory in two dimensions interacting with an upside-down quartic potential. Working in the large N limit, the model can be solved non-perturbatively using the saddle-point method for sufficiently strong negative coupling. At high temperature, the O(N) model dimensionally reduces to ${\cal PT}$-symmetric quantum mechanics, for which powerful non-perturbative solution methods exist. It is found that the solution from quantum mechanics can be matched by the saddle-point method in quantum field theory when allowing for saddles beyond the principal Riemann sheet. I show that saddle points on non-principal Riemann sheets lead to a fully consistent solution of the 2d negative-coupling O(N) model for all temperatures.</description>

      <title>Neutrinoless double beta decay with light sterile neutrinos: the contact terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10497v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study neutrinoless double-beta decay in extensions of the Standard Model that include $n$ right-handed neutrino singlets, with masses $m_s$ below the GeV scale. Generalizing recently developed matching methods, we determine the $m_s$ dependence of the short-range $nn \to pp$ couplings that appear to leading order in the chiral effective field theory description of neutrinoless double beta decay. We focus on two scenarios, corresponding to the minimal $\nu$SM and left-right symmetric models. We illustrate the impact of our new results in the case of the $\nu$SM, showing a significant impact on the neutrinoless double-beta decay half-life when $m_s$ is in the 200-800 MeV range.</description>

      <title>Bottomonium-like states in proton collisions: Fragmentation and resummation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10549v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the semi-inclusive hadroproduction of doubly bottomed tetraquarks ($X_{b\bar{b}q\bar{q}}$) as well as fully bottomed ones ($T_{4b}$), to which we collectively refer as "bottomonium-like" states. We rely upon the variable-flavor number-scheme fragmentation at leading power, where a single parton perturbatively splits into the corresponding Fock state, which then hadronizes into the color-neutral, observed tetraquark. To this end, we build new sets of DGLAP/HF-NRevo consistent, hadron-structure oriented collinear fragmentation functions, which we name TQHL1.1 and TQ4Q1.1 parametrizations. They extend and supersede the corresponding 1.0 versions recently derived in previous works. The first family describes the fragmentation of doubly heavy tetraquarks and is based on an improved version of the Suzuki model for the heavy-quark channel. The second family depicts the fragmentation of fully heavy tetraquarks and embodies initial-scale inputs for gluon and heavy-quark channels, both of them calculated by the hands of potential nonrelativistic QCD. As a phenomenological application, we provide novel predictions for tetraquark-plus-jet high-energy distributions, computed within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization from (sym)JETHAD, at 14 TeV and 100 TeV FCC.</description>

      <title>Nuclear structure and direct reaction studies in particle-$\gamma$ coincidence experiments at the FSU John D. Fox Superconducting Linear Accelerator Laboratory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Since its foundation in the 1960s, the John D. Fox Superconducting Linear Accelerator Laboratory at Florida State University (FSU) pursued research at the forefront of nuclear science. In this contribution, we present recent highlights from nuclear structure and reaction studies conducted at the John D. Fox Superconducting Linear Accelerator Laboratory, also featuring the general experimental capabilities at the laboratory for particle-$\gamma$ coincidence experiments. Specifically, we focus on light-ion induced reactions measured with the Super-Enge Split-Pole Spectrograph (SE-SPS) and the CATRiNA neutron detectors, respectively. Some results obtained with the CeBrA demonstrator for particle-$\gamma$ coincidence experiments at the SE-SPS are presented. A highlight from the first experimental campaigns with the combined CLARION2-TRINITY setup, showing that weak reaction channels can be selected, is discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Born-Oppenheimer Renormalization group for High Energy Scattering: the Modified BFKL, or where did it all go?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We continue exploring the Born-Oppenheimer renormalization group generating evolution in frequency of physical observables. In this paper we study the evolution of the total cross section for dilute-dilute scattering retaining only eikonal emissions. We derive and analyze the analog of the BFKL equation in this framework. The frequency evolution has a very strong effect on the solutions of the BO-BFKL equation, slowing down the evolution of the scattering amplitude in a spectacular fashion: the intercept of the Pomeron is decreased by about a factor of three relative to the canonical LO BFKL result. The anomalous dimension is also modified significantly - from the BFKL value of one it goes down to the negative value of $\approx-0.2$. Introducing saturation boundary as a proxy for the full saturation dynamics, we find that the dependence of the saturation momentum on rapidity $\eta$ becomes quite weak with $Q^2_s\sim e^{a\bar\alpha_s\eta}$ with $a\approx 0.784$ as opposed to the BFKL value $a=4.88$. Our results underscore the necessity to take into account the DGLAP effects in the high energy evolution. This is left for future work.</description>

      <title>Likelihood of a zero in the proton elastic electric form factor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Working with the $29$ available data on the ratio of proton electric and magnetic form factors, $\mu_p G_E^p(Q^2)/ G_M^p(Q^2)$, and independent of any model or theory of strong interactions, we use the Schlessinger point method to objectively address the question of whether the ratio possesses a zero and, if so, its location. Our analysis predicts that, with 50% confidence, the data are consistent with the existence of a zero in the ratio on $Q^2 \leq 10.37\,$GeV$^2$. The level of confidence increases to $99.9$\% on $Q^2 \leq 13.06\,$GeV$^2$. Significantly, the likelihood that existing data are consistent with the absence of a zero in the ratio on $Q^2 \leq 14.49\,$GeV$^2$ is $1/1$-million.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Corrected Holographic Wilson Loop Correlators and Confinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Confinement is a well-known phenomenon in the infrared regime of (supersymmetric) Yang-Mills theory. Although experiments and numerical simulations have solidly confirmed confinement, its physical origin remains mysterious today, and finding a theoretical explanation for it is a long-standing and challenging problem in physics and mathematics. Inspired by the recent progress in quantum Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, we compute the Wilson loop correlators of the large-$N$ limit of $\mathscr{N}=4$ super-Yang-Mills theory holographically in an extremal AdS$_5$ Reissner-Nordstr\"om black brane background. The quantum gravity fluctuations of the near-horizon region are considered, which consequently affect the holographic Wilson loop correlators. Within this framework, the results suggest that the confinement of the super-Yang-Mills theory is induced by the near-horizon quantum gravity fluctuations of the bulk extremal AdS$_5$ black brane.</description>

      <title>Isotopic Transparency in Central Xe+Sn Collisions at 100 MeV/nucleon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11648v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A new method, based on comparing isotopic yield ratios measured at forward and sideward polar angles and on cross-bombarding heavy nuclei with different neutron-to-proton ratios, is used to quantify the stopping power in heavy-ion collisions. For central collisions of isotopically separated $^{124,129}$Xe+$^{112,124}$Sn at 100~MeV/nucleon bombarding energy, measured with the 4$\pi$ multidetector INDRA at GSI, a moderate transparency is deduced for hydrogen isotopes, whereas for heavier fragmentation products with atomic number $Z \ge 3$ a high transparency exceeding 50\% is observed. An anomalously large transparency is found for alpha particles, and possible explanations are presented.</description>

      <title>Non-Radial Oscillation Modes in Hybrid Stars with Hyperons and Delta Baryons: Full General Relativity Formalism vs. Cowling Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12002v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the effects of hyperons, delta baryons, and quark matter phase transitions on f-mode oscillations in neutron stars. Using the density-dependent relativistic mean-field model (DDME2) for the hadronic phase and the density-dependent quark mass (DDQM) model for the quark phase, we construct hadronic and hybrid equations of state (EoSs) consistent with astrophysical constraints. Including hyperons and delta baryons soften the EoS, reducing maximum masse, while phase transition to the quark matter further softens the EoS, decreasing the speed of sound and hence the maximum mass. f-mode frequencies, calculated using both the Cowling approximation and the general relativistic (GR) frameworks, reveal a significant overestimation by the Cowling method of about 10-30%, with discrepancies decreasing for more massive stars. We derive universal relations connecting the frequencies of the f-mode to the average density, compactness, and tidal deformability, finding significant deviations due to hyperons and delta baryons. Empirical relations for mass-scaled and radius-scaled frequencies are also provided, highlighting the importance of GR calculations for accurate modeling. These findings highlight the potential of gravitational wave asteroseismology to constrain neutron star EoSs and internal structure.</description>

      <title>The causal structure of the quark propagator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the causal structure of the quark propagator with the spectral DSE. The spectral gap equation is solved with the input of the spectral representation of the gluon and a causal STI-construction for the quark-gluon vertex. The latter includes a potential infrared enhancement of the vertex strength of the classical tensor structure that accommodates for the physical strength of chiral symmetry breaking. We find a critical vertex strength, below which the quark has a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation. While the nature of the first singularity does not change above the critical strength, we find that the quark propagator features at least two additional pairs of complex conjugate poles that are located approximately at the sum of quark pole mass and peak position of the quark-gluon coupling. These additional poles lead to violations of causality, if they persist in $S$-matrix elements. While the vertex strength of the classical tensor structure in full QCD is below the critical one, that of commonly used vertex models, which rely solely on the classical vertex structure, is typically above it. Finally, we discuss how these additional poles could be avoided in full QCD, where part of chiral symmetry breaking is generated by the other tensor structures in the quark-gluon vertex.</description>

      <title>QGP Physics from Attractor Perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.17237v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strong longitudinal expansion characteristic of heavy-ion collisions leads to universal attractor behavior of the resulting drop of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) already at very early times. Assuming approximate boost invariance and neglecting transverse expansion at the initial time, we incorporate subsequent transverse dynamics of this system by linearizing the Mueller-Israel-Stewart theory around the transversely homogeneous attractor. The result is a system of coupled ordinary differential equations which describes the proper-time evolution of Fourier modes encoding the transverse structure of the initial energy deposition. The late-time asymptotic behavior of these solutions is described by transseries which make manifest the stability of the attractor against transverse perturbations. In this framework, information about the structure of the plasma in the transverse plane resides mostly in exponentially suppressed corrections to evolution along the attractor, which are not yet negligible at freeze-out. These findings also suggest a simple numerical approach to QGP dynamics using a finite number of Fourier modes. Physical observables can be expressed in terms of the asymptotic data evaluated at freeze-out. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach by calculating the final multiplicity distributions and collective flow coefficients.</description>

      <title>On sensitivity of nucleus deformation on final-state flow harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06249v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the effect of deformation of the nuclei on collective flow in relativistic heavy-ion collisions. The parameter associated with the geometrical deformation in the Glauber model is tuned to reproduce the empirical multiplicity probability distributions correctly. Subsequently, the particle spectra and collective flows for Au+Au and U+U collisions are evaluated using a hybrid hydrodynamic code CHESS. We analyze the effects of the degrees of freedom associated with the IC on the final-state flow harmonics by exploring the parameter space of the former. The connection between the deformation parameters, specifically $\beta_2$ and $\beta_4$, and the flow anisotropies is scrutinized. In particular, deviations in elliptic flow at $p_{\mathrm{T}}\sim 2$ GeV are observed at smaller values of $\beta_2$ in Au+Au collisions. On the other hand, for U+U collisions, the averaged overall flow harmonics are found to be less sensitive to the geometrical parameters. Despite the difference in the model's specifications, our findings largely confirm those obtained in the literature employing different approaches, which indicate that flow harmonics can be used as a sensible probe for the initial geometry fluctuations and to discriminate between different theoretical models.</description>

      <title>How the HESS J1731-347 event could be explained using $\bf{K^{-}}$ condensation</title>

Abstract: The recent observation of a compact star with a mass of $M=0.77^{+0.20}_{-0.17}~{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and a radius of $R=10.4^{+0.86}_{-0.78}$ km, located within the supernova remnant HESS J1731-347, has substantially reinforced the evidence for the presence of exotic matter in neutron stars core. This finding has markedly enhanced our comprehension of the equation of state for dense nuclear matter. In the present work, we investigate the possible existence of a kaon condensation in hadronic neutron stars by employing and comparing two theoretical frameworks: the Relativistic Mean Field model with first order kaon condensate and the Momentum-Dependent Interaction model complemented by chiral effective theory. To the best of our knowledge, this represents a first alternative attempt aimed to explain the bulk properties of the specific object with the inclusion of a kaon condensation in dense nuclear matter. The application of two different models enriches the research, providing insights from the aspect of different theoretical frameworks that accurately predict the existence of HESS J1731-347. In both cases significant insights are extracted for the parameter space of models, emphasizing to those concerning the nucleon-kaon potential, the threshold density for the appearance of a kaon condensation, as well as the parameter $a_{3}m_{s}$ which is related to the strangeness content of the proton. Concluding, the present research indicates that a more systematic investigation of similar objects could offer valuable constraints on the properties of dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>Novel features of asymmetric nuclear matter from terrestrial experiments and astrophysical observations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13210v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The accurate measurement of neutron skin thickness of $^{208}$Pb by the PREX Collaboration suggests a large value of the nuclear symmetry energy slope parameter, $L$, whereas the smaller $L$ is preferred to account for the small neutron-star radii from NICER observations. To resolve this discrepancy between nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations, new effective interactions have been developed using relativistic mean-field models with the isoscalar- and isovector-meson mixing. We investigate the effects of $\delta$-nucleon coupling and $\sigma$--$\delta$ mixing on the ground-state properties of finite nuclei, as well as the characteristics of isospin-asymmetric nuclear matter and neutron stars. Additionally, we explore the role of the quartic $\rho$-meson self-interaction in dense nuclear matter to mitigate the stiff equation of state for neutron stars resulting from the large $\delta$-nucleon coupling. It is found that the nuclear symmetry energy undergoes a sudden softening at approximately twice the saturation density of nuclear matter, taking into account the PREX-2 result, the recent NICER observation of PSR J0437$-$4715, and the binary neutron star merger, GW170817.</description>

      <title>Stochastic relativistic viscous hydrodynamics from the Metropolis algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10306v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm for simulating stochastic relativistic fluid dynamics based on Metropolis updates. Each step of the algorithm begins with an update based on ideal hydrodynamics. This is followed by proposing random (spatial) momentum transfers between fluid cells, keeping the total energy fixed. These proposals are then accepted or rejected using the change in entropy as a statistical weight. The algorithm reproduces relativistic viscous hydrodynamics in the ``Density Frame", which is a formulation of viscous hydrodynamics we review and clarify here. This formulation is first order in time and requires no auxiliary dynamical fields such as $\Pi^{\mu\nu}$. The only parameters are the shear and bulk viscosities and the equation of state. By adopting the 3+1 split of general relativity, we extend the Metropolis algorithm to general space-time coordinates, such as Bjorken coordinates, which are commonly used to simulate heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model with a fractal inspired coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.11080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.11080v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Nambu--Jona-Lasino model is modified by the inclusion of a running-coupling that was obtained by a fractal approach to Quantum Chromodynamics. The coupling follows a $q$-exponential function and, in the context of high energy collisions, explains the origin of the Tsallis non-extensive statistics distributions. The parameter $q$ is completely determined in terms of the number of colours and the number of quark flavours. We study several aspects of the extended model and compare our results to the standard NJL model, where a constant coupling is used in combination with a sharp cutoff to regularize the gap equation. We show that the modified coupling regularizes the model in a smooth cutoff fashion and reproduces the pion mass and decay constant, providing an almost identical Gell-Mann-Oakes-Renner relation as in the standard NJL model. In both models the relation is satisfied in similar cutoff scales. An important novelty of this work is the physical explanation, in terms of the fractal QCD vacuum, for a running coupling that renormalizes the quark condensate.</description>

      <title>Conserved charge susceptibilities in the relativistic mean-field hadron resonance gas model: constraints on hadronic repulsive interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13212v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of repulsive interaction between hadrons on the susceptibilities of conserved charges, namely baryon number (B), electric charge (Q) and strangeness (S). We estimate second fourth and sixth-order susceptibilities of conserved charges, their differences, ratios, and correlations within the ambit of the mean-field hadron resonance gas (MFHRG) model. We consider repulsive mean-field interaction among meson pairs, baryon pairs and anti-baryon pairs separately and constrain them by confronting the results of various susceptibilities with the recent lattice QCD (LQCD) data. We find that the repulsive interactions between baryon-baryon pairs and antibaryon-antibaryon pairs are sufficient to describe the baryon susceptibilities of hadronic matter at temperatures below the QCD transition temperature. However, small but finite mesonic repulsive interaction is needed to describe electric charge and strangeness susceptibilities. We finally conclude that the repulsive interaction between hadrons plays a very important role in describing the thermodynamic properties of hadronic matter, especially near the quark-hadron phase transition temperature ($T_c$). The mean-field parameter for baryons ($K_B$) should be constrained in the range $0.40\le K_B\le 0.450$ $\text{GeV.fm}^{3}$ to get a good agreement of baryon susceptibilities with the LQCD results, whereas meson mean-field parameter $K_M\sim 0.05$ $\text{GeV.fm}^{3}$ must be included with $K_B$ to get a reasonable agreement of the MFHRG model with the LQCD results for electric charge and strangeness susceptibilities.</description>

      <title>Three ways to decipher the nature of exotic hadrons: multiplets, three-body hadronic molecules, and correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06399v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the past two decades, a plethora of hadronic states beyond the conventional quark model of $q\bar{q}$ mesons and $qqq$ baryons have been observed experimentally, which motivated extensive studies to understand their nature and the non-perturbative strong interaction. Since most of these exotic states are near the mass thresholds of a pair of conventional hadrons, the prevailing picture is that they are primarily hadronic molecules. In principle, one can verify the molecular nature of these states by thoroughly comparing their masses, decay widths, and production rates in a particular picture with experimental data. However, this is difficult or impossible. First, quantum mechanics allows for the mixing of configurations allowed by symmetries and quantum numbers. Second, data are relatively scarce because of their small production rates and the many difficulties in the experimental measurements. As a result, other alternatives need to be explored. This review summarizes three such approaches that can help disentangle the nature of the many exotic hadrons discovered. In the first approach, based on the molecular interpretations for some exotic states, we study the likely existence of multiplets of hadronic molecules related by various symmetries, such as isospin symmetry, SU(3)-flavor symmetry, heavy quark spin/flavor symmetry, and heavy antiquark diquark symmetry. In the second approach, starting from some hadronic molecular candidates, one can derive the underlying hadron-hadron interactions. With these interactions, one can study related three-body systems and check whether three-body bound states/resonances exist. In the third approach, one can turn to the femtoscopy technique to derive the hadron-hadron interactions, hence inaccessible. This technique provided an unprecedented opportunity to understand the interactions between unstable hadrons.</description>

      <title>Fully charmed tetraquarks from LHC to FCC: Natural stability from fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14773v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inclusive production of fully charmed tetraquarks, $T_{4c}(0^{++})$ or $T_{4c}(2^{++})$ radial excitations, in high-energy proton collisions. We build our study upon the collinear fragmentation of a single parton in a variable-flavor number scheme, suited to describe the tetraquark formation mechanism from moderate to large transverse-momentum regimes. To this extent, we derive a novel set of DGLAP-evolving collinear fragmentation functions, named TQ4Q1.0 determinations. They encode initial-scale inputs corresponding to both gluon and heavy-quark fragmentation channels, defined within the context of quark-potential and spin-physics inspired models, respectively. We work within the NLL/NLO$^+$ hybrid factorization and make use of the JETHAD numeric interface along with the symJETHAD symbolic calculation plugin. With these tools, we provide predictions for high-energy observables sensitive to $T_{4c}$ plus jet emissions at center-of-mass energies ranging from 14 TeV at the LHC to the 100 TeV nominal energy of the FCC.</description>

      <title>Limiting Rotation Rate of Neutron Stars from Crust Breaking and Gravitational Waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars are not observed to spin faster than about half their breakup rate. This limiting rotational frequency may be related to the strength of their crusts. As a star spins up from accretion, centrifugal forces stress the crust. We perform finite-element simulations of rotating neutron stars and find that the crust fails at rotation rates about half the breakup rate. Given uncertainties in microphysics, we have not determined the crust configuration after this failure. Instead, we argue that the crust may fail in an asymmetric way and could produce a configuration with a significant ellipticity (fractional difference in moments of inertia). If the ellipticity is large, a rotating star will radiate gravitational waves that may limit further spin up. These stars may be promising sources for LIGO / VIRGO and next generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>
