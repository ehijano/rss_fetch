      <title>A Computable Measure of Suboptimality for Entropy-Regularised Variational Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.10393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several emerging post-Bayesian methods target a probability distribution for which an entropy-regularised variational objective is minimised. This increased flexibility introduces a computational challenge, as one loses access to an explicit unnormalised density for the target. To mitigate this difficulty, we introduce a novel measure of suboptimality called 'gradient discrepancy', and in particular a 'kernel gradient discrepancy' (KGD) that can be explicitly computed. In the standard Bayesian context, KGD coincides with the kernel Stein discrepancy (KSD), and we obtain a novel charasterisation of KSD as measuring the size of a variational gradient. Outside this familiar setting, KGD enables novel sampling algorithms to be developed and compared, even when unnormalised densities cannot be obtained. To illustrate this point several novel algorithms are proposed, including a natural generalisation of Stein variational gradient descent, with applications to mean-field neural networks and prediction-centric uncertainty quantification presented. On the theoretical side, our principal contribution is to establish sufficient conditions for desirable properties of KGD, such as continuity and convergence control.</description>

      <title>Computational Study of New Record-Based Transmuted Chen Distribution and Its Applications to the Failure Time and Iron Sheet Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09756v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study is considered to introduce a novel distribution as an alternative to Chen distribution via the record-based transmutation method. This technique is based on the distributions of first two upper record values. Thus, we suggest a new special case based on Chen distribution in the family of record based transmuted distributions. We explore various distributional properties of the proposed model namely, quantile function, hazard function, median, moments, and stochastic ordering. Our distribution has three parameters and to estimate these parameters, we utilize nine different and well-known estimators. Then, we compare the performances of these estimators via a comprehensive simulation study. Also, we provide two real-world data examples to assess the fits the data sets the suggested model and its some competitors.</description>

      <title>Record-based transmuted log-logistic distribution: Properties, simulation, and applications to petroleum rock and reactor pump data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study aims to introduce a new lifetime distribution, called the record-based transformed log-logistic distribution, to the literature. We obtain this distribution using a record-based transformation map based on the distributions of upper record values. We explore some mathematical properties of the suggested distribution, namely the quantile function, hazard function, moments, order statistics, and stochastic ordering. We discuss the point estimation via seven different methods such as maximum likelihood, least squares, weighted least squares, Anderson-Darling, Cramer-von Mises, maximum product spacings, and right tail Anderson Darling. Then, we perform a Monte Carlo simulation study to evaluate the performances of these estimators. Also, we present two practical data examples, reactor pump failure and petroleum rock data to compare the fits of the proposed distribution with its rivals. As a result of data analysis, we conclude that the best-fitted distribution is the record-based transmuted log-logistic distribution for reactor pump failure and petroleum rock data sets.</description>

      <title>Meta-Analysis with JASP, Part I: Classical Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Meta-analyses play a crucial part in empirical science, enabling researchers to synthesize evidence across studies and draw more precise and generalizable conclusions. Despite their importance, access to advanced meta-analytic methodology is often limited to scientists and students with considerable expertise in computer programming. To lower the barrier for adoption, we have developed the Meta-Analysis module in JASP (https://jasp-stats.org/), a free and open-source software for statistical analyses. The module offers standard and advanced meta-analytic techniques through an easy-to-use graphical user interface (GUI), allowing researchers with diverse technical backgrounds to conduct state-of-the-art analyses. This manuscript presents an overview of the meta-analytic tools implemented in the module and showcases how JASP supports a meta-analytic practice that is rigorous, relevant, and reproducible.</description>

      <title>Meta-Analysis with JASP, Part II: Bayesian Approaches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.09850v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference is on the rise, partly because it allows researchers to quantify parameter uncertainty, evaluate evidence for competing hypotheses, incorporate model ambiguity, and seamlessly update knowledge as information accumulates. All of these advantages apply to the meta-analytic settings; however, advanced Bayesian meta-analytic methodology is often restricted to researchers with programming experience. In order to make these tools available to a wider audience, we implemented state-of-the-art Bayesian meta-analysis methods in the Meta-Analysis module of JASP, a free and open-source statistical software package (https://jasp-stats.org/). The module allows researchers to conduct Bayesian estimation, hypothesis testing, and model averaging with models such as meta-regression, multilevel meta-analysis, and publication bias adjusted meta-analysis. Results can be interpreted using forest plots, bubble plots, and estimated marginal means. This manuscript provides an overview of the Bayesian meta-analysis tools available in JASP and demonstrates how the software enables researchers of all technical backgrounds to perform advanced Bayesian meta-analysis.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for Approximating Conditionally Optimal Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15529v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work develops algorithms for non-parametric confidence regions for samples from a univariate distribution whose support is a discrete mesh bounded on the left. We generalize the theory of Learned-Miller to preorders over the sample space. In this context, we show that the lexicographic low and lexicographic high orders are in some way extremal in the class of monotone preorders. From this theory we derive several approximation algorithms: 1) Closed form approximations for the lexicographic low and high orders with error tending to zero in the mesh size; 2) A polynomial-time approximation scheme for quantile orders with error tending to zero in the mesh size; 3) Monte Carlo methods for calculating quantile and lexicographic low orders applicable to any mesh size.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Inference via Langevin Dynamics with Score Matching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03853v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference (SBI) enables Bayesian analysis when the likelihood is intractable but model simulations are available. Recent advances in statistics and machine learning, including Approximate Bayesian Computation and deep generative models, have expanded the applicability of SBI, yet these methods often face challenges in moderate to high-dimensional parameter spaces. Motivated by the success of gradient-based Monte Carlo methods in Bayesian sampling, we propose a novel SBI method that integrates score matching with Langevin dynamics to explore complex posterior landscapes more efficiently in such settings. Our approach introduces tailored score-matching procedures for SBI, including a localization scheme that reduces simulation costs and an architectural regularization that embeds the statistical structure of log-likelihood scores to improve score-matching accuracy. We provide theoretical analysis of the method and illustrate its practical benefits on benchmark tasks and on more challenging problems in moderate to high dimensions, where it performs favorably compared to existing approaches.</description>
