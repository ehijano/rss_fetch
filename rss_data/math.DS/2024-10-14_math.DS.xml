      <title>The Burgers-FKPP advection-reaction-diffusion equation with cut-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of a Heaviside cut-off on the front propagation dynamics of the so-called Burgers-FisherKolmogoroff-Petrowskii-Piscounov (Burgers-FKPP) advection-reaction-diffusion equation. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a travelling front solution in the presence of a cut-off in the reaction kinetics and the advection term, and we derive the leading-order asymptotics for the speed of propagation of the front in dependence on the advection strength and the cut-off parameter. Our analysis relies on geometric techniques from dynamical systems theory and specifically, on geometric desingularisation, which also known as blow-up.</description>

      <title>Koopman correlations underlie linear response and causality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08708v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inference of causal relationships among observed variables is a pivotal, longstanding problem in the scientific community. An intuitive method for quantifying these causal links involves examining the response of one variable to perturbations in another. The fluctuation-dissipation theorem elegantly connects this response to the correlation functions of the unperturbed system, thereby bridging the concepts of causality and correlation. However, this relationship becomes intricate in nonlinear systems, where knowledge of the invariant measure is required but elusive, especially in high-dimensional spaces. In this study, we establish a novel link between the Koopman operator of nonlinear stochastic systems and the response function. This connection provides an alternative method for computing the response function using generalized correlation functions, even when the invariant measure is unknown. We validate our theoretical framework by applying it to a nonlinear high-dimensional system amenable to exact solutions, demonstrating convergence and consistency with established results. Finally, we discuss a significant interplay between the resulting causal network and the relevant time scales of the system.</description>

      <title>Conjugating trivial automorphisms of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N)/\mathrm{Fin}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08789v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A trivial automorphism of the Boolean algebra $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ is an automorphism induced by the action of some function $\mathbb N \rightarrow \mathbb N$. In models of forcing axioms all automorphisms are trivial, and therefore two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if they have the same (modulo finite) cycle structure. We show that the Continuum Hypothesis implies that two trivial automorphisms are conjugate if and only if there are neither first-order obstructions nor index obstructions for their conjugacy. This is equivalent to given trivial automorphisms being conugate in some forcing extension of the universe.
  To each automorphism $\alpha$ of $\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin}$ we associate the first-order structure $\mathfrak{A}_\alpha=(\mathcal P(\mathbb N) / \mathrm{Fin},\alpha)$ and compute the existential theories of these structures.
  These results are applied to resolve a question of Braga, Farah, and Vignati and prove that there are coarse metric spaces $X$ and $Y$ such that the isomorphism between their uniform Roe coronas is independent from $\mathsf{ZFC}$.</description>

      <title>Term structure shapes and their consistent dynamics in the Svensson family</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the shapes attainable by the forward- and yield-curve in the widely-used Svensson family, including the Nelson-Siegel and Bliss subfamilies. We provide a complete classification of all attainable shapes and partition the parameter space of each family according to these shapes. Building upon these results, we then examine the consistent dynamic evolution of the Svensson family under absence of arbitrage. Our analysis shows that consistent dynamics further restrict the set of attainable shapes, and we demonstrate that certain complex shapes can no longer appear after a deterministic time horizon. Moreover a single shape (either inverse of normal curves) must dominate in the long-run.</description>

      <title>Lyapunov stability of the equilibrium of the non-local continuity equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The paper is concerned with the development of Lyapunov methods for the analysis of equilibrium stability in a dynamical system on the space of probability measures driven by a non-local continuity equation. We derive sufficient conditions of stability of an equilibrium distribution relying on an analysis of a non-smooth Lyapunov function. For the linear dynamics we reduce the stability analysis to a study of a quadratic form on a tangent space to the space of probability measures. These results are illustrated by the studies of the stability of the equilibrium measure for gradient flow in the space of probability measures and Gibbs measure for a system of coupled mathematical pendulums.</description>

      <title>Delay Infectivity and Delay Recovery SIR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have derived the governing equations for an SIR model with delay terms in both the infectivity and recovery of the disease. The equations are derived by modelling the dynamics as a continuous time random walk, where individuals move between the classic SIR compartments. With an appropriate choice of distributions for the infectivity and recovery processes delay terms are introduced into the governing equations in a manner that ensures the physicality of the model. This provides novel insight into the underlying dynamics of an SIR model with time delays. The SIR model with delay infectivity and recovery allows for a more diverse range of dynamical behaviours. The model accounts for an incubation effect without the need to introduce new compartments.</description>

      <title>Parrondo paradox in susceptible-infectious-susceptible dynamics over periodic temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Many social and biological networks periodically change over time with daily, weekly, and other cycles. Thus motivated, we formulate and analyze susceptible-infectious-susceptible (SIS) epidemic models over temporal networks with periodic schedules. More specifically, we assume that the temporal network consists of a cycle of alternately used static networks, each with a given duration. We observe a phenomenon in which two static networks are individually above the epidemic threshold but the alternating network composed of them renders the dynamics below the epidemic threshold, which we refer to as a Parrondo paradox for epidemics. We find that network structure plays an important role in shaping this phenomenon, and we study its dependence on the connectivity between and number of subpopulations in the network. We associate such paradoxical behavior with anti-phase oscillatory dynamics of the number of infectious individuals in different subpopulations.</description>

      <title>Efficient, Multimodal, and Derivative-Free Bayesian Inference With Fisher-Rao Gradient Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17263v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study efficient approximate sampling for probability distributions known up to normalization constants. We specifically focus on a problem class arising in Bayesian inference for large-scale inverse problems in science and engineering applications. The computational challenges we address with the proposed methodology are: (i) the need for repeated evaluations of expensive forward models; (ii) the potential existence of multiple modes; and (iii) the fact that gradient of, or adjoint solver for, the forward model might not be feasible.
  While existing Bayesian inference methods meet some of these challenges individually, we propose a framework that tackles all three systematically. Our approach builds upon the Fisher-Rao gradient flow in probability space, yielding a dynamical system for probability densities that converges towards the target distribution at a uniform exponential rate. This rapid convergence is advantageous for the computational burden outlined in (i). We apply Gaussian mixture approximations with operator splitting techniques to simulate the flow numerically; the resulting approximation can capture multiple modes thus addressing (ii). Furthermore, we employ the Kalman methodology to facilitate a derivative-free update of these Gaussian components and their respective weights, addressing the issue in (iii).
  The proposed methodology results in an efficient derivative-free sampler flexible enough to handle multi-modal distributions: Gaussian Mixture Kalman Inversion (GMKI). The effectiveness of GMKI is demonstrated both theoretically and numerically in several experiments with multimodal target distributions, including proof-of-concept and two-dimensional examples, as well as a large-scale application: recovering the Navier-Stokes initial condition from solution data at positive times.</description>

      <title>From chimeras to extensive chaos in networks of heterogeneous Kuramoto oscillator populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20408v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Populations of coupled oscillators can exhibit a wide range of complex dynamical behavior, from complete synchronization to chimera and chaotic states. We can thus expect complex dynamics to arise in networks of such populations. Here we analyze the dynamics of networks of populations of heterogeneous mean-field coupled Kuramoto-Sakaguchi oscillators, and show that the instability that leads to chimera states in a simple two-population model also leads to extensive chaos in large networks of coupled populations. Formally, the system consists of a complex network of oscillator populations whose mesoscopic behavior evolves according to the Ott-Antonsen equations. By considering identical parameters across populations, the system contains a manifold of homogeneous solutions where all populations behave identically. Stability analysis of these homogeneous states provided by the master stability function formalism shows that non-trivial dynamics might emerge on a wide region of the parameter space for arbitrary network topologies. As examples, we first revisit the two-population case, and provide a complete bifurcation diagram. Then, we investigate the emergent dynamics in large ring and Erd\"os-R\'enyi networks. In both cases, transverse instabilities lead to extensive space-time chaos, i.e., irregular regimes whose complexity scales linearly with the system size. Our work provides a unified analytical framework to understand the emergent dynamics of networks of oscillator populations, from chimera states to robust high-dimensional chaos.</description>
