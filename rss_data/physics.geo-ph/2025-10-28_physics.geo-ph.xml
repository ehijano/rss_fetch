      <title>Exploration of Machine Learning Methods to Seismic Event Discrimination in the Pacific Northwest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurately separating tectonic, anthropogenic, and geomorphologic seismic sources is essential for Pacific Northwest (PNW) monitoring but remains difficult as networks densify and signals overlap. Prior work largely treats binary discrimination and seldom compares classic ML (feature-engineered) and deep learning (end-to-end) approaches under a common, multi-class setting with operational constraints. We evaluate methods and features for four-way source discrimination - earthquakes, explosions, surface events, and noise - and identify models that are both accurate and deployable. Using ~200k three-component waveforms from &gt;70k events in an AI-curated PNW dataset, we test random-forest classifiers on TSFEL, physics-informed, and scattering features, and CNNs that ingest time series (1D) or spectrograms (2D); we benchmark on a balanced common test set, a 10k event network dataset, and out-of-domain data (global surface events; near-field blasts). CNNs taking spectrograms lead with accuracy performance over 92% for within-domain (as a short-and-fat CNN SeismicCNN 2D) and out-of-domain (as a long and skinny CNN QuakeXNet 2D), versus 89% for the best random forest; performance remains strong at low SNR and longer distances, and generalizes to independent network and global datasets. QuakeXNet-2D is lightweight (~70k parameters; ~1.2 MB), implemented into seisbench, scans a full day of 100 Hz, three-component data in ~9 s on commodity hardware, with released checkpoints. These results show spectrogram-based CNNs provide state-of-the-art accuracy, efficiency, and robustness for real-time PNW operations and transferable surface-event monitoring.</description>

      <title>Global Chlorophyll-\textit{a} Retrieval algorithm from Sentinel 2 Using Residual Deep Learning and Novel Machine Learning Water Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the Global Water Classifier (GWC), a supervised, geospatially extensive Machine Learning (ML) classifier trained on Sen2Cor corrected Sentinel-2 surface reflectance data. Using nearly 100 globally distributed inland water bodies, GWC distinguishes water across Chlorophyll-a (Chla) levels from non-water spectra (clouds, sun glint, snow, ice, aquatic vegetation, land and sediments) and shows geographically stable performance.
  Building on this foundation model, we perform Chla retrieval based on a matchup Sentinel-2 reflectance data with the United States Geological Survey (USGS) AquaMatch in-situ dataset, covering diverse geographical and hydrological conditions.
  We train an XGBoost regressor on 13626 matchup points. The positive labeled scenes by the GWC consistently outperform the negatives and produce more accurate Chla retrieval values, which confirms the classifiers advantage in reducing various interferences.
  Next, residual analysis of the regression predictions revealed structured errors, motivating a residual CNN (RCNN) correction stage. We add a CNN residual stage trained on normalized residuals, which yield substantial improvement. Our algorithm was tested on 867 water bodies with over 2,000 predictions and Chla values up to 1000~mg$/m^{3}$, achieving $R^2$ = 0.79, MAE = 13.52~mg$/m^{3}$, and slope = 0.91, demonstrating robust, scalable, and globally transferable performance without additional tuning.</description>

      <title>Numerical Modeling of Effective Thermal Conductivity for Polymineralic Rocks using Lattice Element Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of rock thermal conductivity under in-situ conditions is essential for characterizing subsurface heat flow. This study presents a numerical framework based on the Lattice Element Method (LEM) for simulating the effective thermal conductivity of polymineralic rocks under coupled pressure-temperature conditions. The model resolves interactions among heat transfer, grain contacts, and mechanical deformation within a microstructure-representative lattice. The methodology enables consistent treatment of heat conduction, nonlinear contact evolution, and thermally induced intergranular fracturing. Heterogeneity is introduced through a stochastic, volume-fraction-constrained discretization that preserves the measured mineral composition and porosity, while mineral anisotropy and fracture behavior are captured through element-level constitutive laws. The framework is evaluated using experimental data for two dry sandstones under ambient and elevated pressures and temperatures. Effective thermal conductivity is computed over the same pressure-temperature ranges and compared directly with the measurements. The results indicate that the predictions are capable of reproducing the characteristic trends and absolute levels. The close agreement between experimental observations and model predictions confirms that the thermo-mechanical coupled LEM provides a physically grounded and transferable approach for modeling heat transport in heterogeneous, polymineralic media.</description>

      <title>Quality Coefficients for Interferometric Phase Linking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-temporal InSAR, phase linking refers to the estimation of a single-reference interferometric phase history from the information contained in the coherence matrix of a distributed scatterer. Since the phase information in the coherence matrix is typically inconsistent, the extent to which the estimated phase history captures it must be assessed to exclude unreliable pixels from further processing. We introduce three quality criteria in the form of coefficients, for threshold-based pixel selection: a coefficient based on closure phase that quantifies the internal consistency of the phase information in the coherence matrix; a goodness-of-fit coefficient that quantifies how well a resulting phase history estimate approximates the phase information according to the characteristic optimization model of a given phase linking method; and an ambiguity coefficient that compares the goodness of fit of the original estimate with that of an orthogonal alternative. We formulate the phase linking methods and these criteria within a unified mathematical framework and discuss computational and algorithmic aspects. Unlike existing goodness-of-fit indicators, the proposed coefficients are normalized to the unit interval with explicit noise-floor correction, improving interpretability across stacks of different size. Experiments on TerraSAR-X data over Visp, Switzerland, indicate that the closure phase coefficient effectively pre-screens stable areas, the goodness-of-fit coefficient aligns with and systematically generalizes established quality indicators, and the ambiguity coefficient flags solutions that fit well but are unstable. Together, the coefficients enable systematic pixel selection and quality control in the interferometric processing of distributed scatterers.</description>

      <title>LEVITAS: Levitodynamics for Accurate Individual Particle Sensing in Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24524v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurately observing the rarefied media of the upper atmosphere, exosphere, and planetary and solar system environments and beyond requires highly sensitive metrological techniques. We present the operating concept and architecture of an in-situ sensing solution based on the dynamics of a levitated nanoparticle (levitodynamics). It can detect and measure impacts of individual particles in rarefied media. Dubbed `LEVITAS', our sensor consists of a dispenser of dielectric nanoparticles and optical trapping of a single nanoparticle in the focus of a laser beam. The trapped nanoparticle constitutes a harmonic oscillator at frequencies in the kilohertz range whose position can be tracked at the standard quantum limit by interferometric detection of the laser photons it scatters. Here, we simulate microcanonical impacts on the nanoparticle and show that the density, velocity, temperature, and composition of the surrounding medium can be estimated accurately. We illustrate the performance of LEVITAS in circumstances ranging from low Earth orbit out to exospheric distances, across which individual impacts can be detected at favourable rates. Furthermore, LEVITAS may be employed to accurately measure highly rarefied neutral distributions within vastly different areas of momentum space. This we demonstrate by simulating the measurement of high-velocity neutral gas particles from the interstellar medium penetrating the heliosphere and flowing through our solar system.</description>
