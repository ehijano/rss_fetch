      <title>On the electrochemical CO2 reduction by Bi-based catalysts: single crystals or mixture phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metallic bismuth is both non-toxic and cost-effective. Bi-based catalysts have demonstrated the ability to efficiently produce HCOOH through CO2RR while effectively inhibiting the HER. Although many experiments have been reported concerning its performance towards CO2 reduction, the impact its valence states and crystal faces on CO2RR selectivity (e.g. HCOOH versus CO) it still under debate. Here, we performed a comprehensive study via density functional theory, by including three typical valence states of Bi, such as 0 (Bi), +3 (Bi2O3) and +5 (Bi2O5), as well as their often-studied crystal facets. The results show that metallic Bi demonstrates a poor selectivity for HCOOH, but boasts a higher conversion rate for CO2. While Bi2O3 exhibits a good selectivity for HCOOH production, yet it displays a lower conversion rate for CO2. For Bi2O5, all studied surfaces show high energy barriers in both cases of HCOOH and CO production, and lower energy barriers for HER reactions, indicating that Bi at +5 valence state is not the good choice for 2e transfer reactions. Subsequently, we further examined the effects of oxygen contents on the selectivity of HCOOH and the conversion rate for CO2. Interestingly, we found that partial oxidization of Bi benefits both the selectivity and the conversion rate. With these observations, we suggest that a mixture of Bi (0) and Bi2O3 (+3) phases would be a better choice than single crystals for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of mixtures with strongly negative deviations from Raoult's law. XV. Permittivities and refractive indices for 1-alkanol + n-hexylamine systems at (293.15-303.15) K. Application of the Kirkwood-Fr\"ohlich model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Relative permittivities at 1 MHz, $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}$, and refractive indices at the sodium D-line, $n_{\text{D}}$, are reported at 0.1 MPa and at (293.15-303.15) K for the binary systems 1-alkanol + n-hexylamine (HxA). Also, their corresponding excess functions are calculated and correlated. Positive values of the excess permittivities, $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$, are encountered for the methanol system, whereas the remaining mixtures show negative values. This reveals that interactions between unlike molecules contribute positively to $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$. This contribution is dominant for the methanol mixture, while those arising from the breaking of interactions between like molecules are prevalent for the remaining mixtures. At ${\phi}_1$ (volume fraction) = 0.5, $\varepsilon_{\text{r}}^{\text{E}}$ changes in the order: methanol &gt; 1-propanol &gt; 1-butanol &gt; 1-pentanol &lt; 1-heptanol. Similar variation with the chain length of the 1-alkanol is observed for mixtures such as 1-alkanol + heptane, or + cyclohexylamine, and can be explained in terms of the lower and weaker self-association of longer 1-alkanols. The effect of the replacement of HxA by cyclohexylamine, or by aniline, is also shown. Calculations on molar refractions indicate that dispersive interactions in the systems under study increase with the length of the 1-alkanol. The mixtures are studied by means of the application of the Kirkwood-Fr\"ohlich model, and the Kirkwood correlation factors, including the corresponding excess values, are reported.</description>

      <title>Effect of ion structure on the physicochemical properties and gas absorption of surface active ionic liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Surface active ionic liquids (SAILs) combine useful characteristics of both ionic liquids (ILs) and surfactants, hence are promising candidates for a wide range of applications. However, the effect of SAIL ionic structures on their physicochemical properties remains unclear, which limits their uptake. To address this knowledge gap, in this work we investigated the density, viscosity, surface tension, and corresponding critical micelle concentration in water, as well as gas absorption of SAILs with a variety of cation and anion structures. SAILs containing anions with linear alkyl chains have smaller molar volumes than those with branched alkyl chains, because linear alkyl chains are interdigitated to a greater extent, leading to more compact packing. This interdigitation also results in SAILs being about two orders of magnitude more viscous than comparable conventional ILs. SAILs at the liquid-air interface orient alkyl chains towards the air, leading to low surface tensions closer to n-alkanes than conventional ILs. Critical temperatures of about 900 K could be estimated for all SAILs from their surface tensions. When dissolved in water, SAILs adsorb at the liquid-air interface and lower the surface tension, like conventional surfactants in water, after which micelles form. Molecular simulations show that the micelles are spherical and that lower critical micelle concentrations correspond to the formation of aggregates with a larger number of ion pairs. $\mathrm{CO_{2}}$ and $\mathrm{N_{2}}$ absorption capacities are examined and we conclude that ionic liquids with larger non-polar domains absorb larger quantities of both gases.</description>

      <title>Developing Orbital-Dependent Corrections for the Non-Additive Kinetic Energy in Subsystem Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel route to constructing cost-efficient semi-empirical approximations for the non-additive kinetic energy in subsystem density functional theory. The developed methodology is based on the use of Slater determinants composed of non-orthogonal Kohn$\unicode{x2013}$Sham-like orbitals for the evaluation of kinetic energy expectation values and the expansion of the inverse molecular-orbital overlap matrix into a Neumann series. Applying these techniques, we derived and implemented a series of orbital-dependent approximations for the non-additive kinetic energy, which are employed self-consistently. Our proof-of-principle computations demonstrated quantitatively correct results for potential energy curves and electron densities and hinted on the applicability of the introduced empirical parameters to different types of molecular systems and intermolecular interactions. We therefore conclude that the presented study is an important step towards constructing accurate and efficient orbital-dependent approximations for the non-additive kinetic energy applicable to large molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Phase-cycling and double-quantum two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy using a common-path birefringent interferometer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selecting distinct quantum pathways in two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) can give particularly deep insights into coherent and incoherent interactions and quantum dynamics in various materials. This includes isolating rephasing and non-rephasing pathways for conventional single-quantum 2DES, but also the ability to record double- and zero-quantum spectra. Such advanced 2DES schemes usually require phase-cycling when performed in a partially or fully collinear geometry. A particularly simple and effective implementation of 2DES utilizes an in-line birefringent interferometer, the Translating-Wedge-based Identical pulses eNcoding System (TWINS), for the generation of an inherently phase-stable collinear excitation pulse pair. Here, we demonstrate how the TWINS can be adapted to allow for phase-cycling and experimental access to isolated quantum pathways. These new capabilities are demonstrated by recording rephasing, non-rephasing, zero-quantum and double-quantum 2DES on a molecular J-aggregate. This easy-to-implement extension opens up new experimental possibilities for TWINS-based 2DES in multidimensional all-optical and photoemission spectroscopy and microscopy.</description>

      <title>Modeling water radiolysis with Geant4-DNA: Impact of the temporal structure of the irradiation pulse under oxygen conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The differences in H2O2 production between conventional (CONV) and ultra-high dose rate (UHDR) irradiations in water radiolysis are still not fully understood. The lower levels of this radiolytic species, as a critical end product of water radiolysis, are particularly relevant for investigating the connection between the high-density energy deposition during short-duration physical events (ionizations or excitations) and biological responses of the FLASH effect. In this study, we developed a new Geant4-DNA chemistry model to simulate radiolysis considering the time structure of the irradiation pulse at different absorbed doses to liquid water of 0.01, 0.1, 1, and 2 Gy under 1 MeV electron irradiation. The model allows the description of the beam's temporal structure, including the pulse duration, the pulse repetition frequency, and the pulse amplitude for the different beam irradiation conditions through a wide dose rate range, from 0.01 Gy/s up to about 105 Gy/s, at various oxygen concentrations. The preliminary results indicate a correlation between the temporal structure of the pulses and a significant reduction in the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) at different dose rates.</description>

      <title>All-in-one foundational models learning across quantum chemical levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12015v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) potentials typically target a single quantum chemical (QC) level while the ML models developed for multi-fidelity learning have not been shown to provide scalable solutions for foundational models. Here we introduce the all-in-one (AIO) ANI model architecture based on multimodal learning which can learn an arbitrary number of QC levels. Our all-in-one learning approach offers a more general and easier-to-use alternative to transfer learning. We use it to train the AIO-ANI-UIP foundational model with the generalization capability comparable to semi-empirical GFN2-xTB and DFT with a double-zeta basis set for organic molecules. We show that the AIO-ANI model can learn across different QC levels ranging from semi-empirical to density functional theory to coupled cluster. We also use AIO models to design the foundational model {\Delta}-AIO-ANI based on {\Delta}-learning with increased accuracy and robustness compared to AIO-ANI-UIP. The code and the foundational models are available at https://github.com/dralgroup/aio-ani; they will be integrated into the universal and updatable AI-enhanced QM (UAIQM) library and made available in the MLatom package so that they can be used online at the XACS cloud computing platform (see https://github.com/dralgroup/mlatom for updates).</description>

      <title>Mutual neutralization of C$_{60}^+$ and C$_{60}^-$ ions: Excitation energies and state-selective rate coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context: Mutual neutralization between cations and anions play an important role in determining the charge-balance in certain astrophysical environments. However, empirical data for such reactions involving complex molecular species has been lacking due to challenges in performing experimental studies, leaving the astronomical community to rely on decades old models with large uncertainties for describing these processes in the interstellar medium. Aims: To investigate the mutual neutralization (MN) reaction, C$_{60}^+$ + C$_{60}^-$ $\rightarrow$ C$_{60}^*$ + C$_{60}$, for collisions at interstellar-like conditions. Methods: The mutual neutralization reaction between C$_{60}^+$ and C$_{60}^-$ at collision energies of 100\,meV was studied using the Double ElectroStatic Ion Ring ExpEriment, DESIREE, and its merged-beam capabilities. To aid in the interpretation of the experimental results, semi-classical modeling based on the Landau-Zener approach was performed for the studied reaction. Results: We experimentally identify a narrow range of kinetic energies for the neutral reaction products. Modeling was used to calculate the quantum state-selective reaction probabilities, absolute cross sections, and rate coefficients of these MN reactions, using the experimental results as a benchmark. The MN cross sections are compared with model results for electron attachment to C$_{60}$ and electron recombination with C$_{60}^+$. Conclusions: The present results show that it is crucial to take mutual polarization effects, the finite sizes, and the final quantum states of both molecular ions into account for reliable predictions of MN rates expected to strongly influence the charge-balance and chemistry in, e.g., dense molecular clouds.</description>

      <title>Exascale Quantum Mechanical Simulations: Navigating the Shifting Sands of Hardware and Software</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The era of exascale computing presents both exciting opportunities and unique challenges for quantum mechanical simulations. While the transition from petaflops to exascale computing has been marked by a steady increase in computational power, the shift towards heterogeneous architectures, particularly the dominant role of graphical processing units (GPUs), demands a fundamental shift in software development strategies. This review examines the changing landscape of hardware and software for exascale computing, highlighting the limitations of traditional algorithms and software implementations in light of the increasing use of heterogeneous architectures in high-end systems. We discuss the challenges of adapting quantum chemistry software to these new architectures, including the fragmentation of the software stack, the need for more efficient algorithms (including reduced precision versions) tailored for GPUs, and the importance of developing standardized libraries and programming models.</description>

      <title>A High-Temperature Thermocouple Development by Additive Manufacturing: Tungsten-Nickel (W-Ni) and Molybdenum (Mo) Integration with Ceramic Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Additive manufacturing holds more potential to enable the development of ceramic-based components. Ceramics offer high resistance to heat, high fracture toughness, and are extremely corrosion resistant. Thus, ceramics are widely used in sectors such as the aerospace industry, automotive, microelectronics, and biomedicine. Using various additive manufacturing platforms, ceramics with complex and uniquely designed geometry can be developed to suit specific applications. This project aims at innovating high-temperature thermocouples by embedding conductive metal pastes into a ceramic structure. The paste used includes tungsten, molybdenum, and antimony. The metal pastes are precisely extruded into a T-shaped trench inside the ceramic matrix. Following specific temperature ranges, the ceramic matrix is sintered to improve the properties of the material. The sensors produced can function at extremely high temperatures and are thereby suitable for high-temperature environments. Comparative testing of the 3D sintered sensors with conventional temperature sensors shows high correlation between the two classes of sensors. The resulting R-squared value of 0.9885 is satisfactory which implies the reliability and accuracy of 3D sintering sensors are satisfactory in temperature sensing applications.</description>

      <title>On the Onset of Coherent Phonon Motion in Peierls-Distorted Antimony by Attosecond Transient Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy measurements on the Peierls-distorted phase of the semimetal antimony (Sb) are presented. After excitation by an ultrashort, broad band near-infrared (NIR) pulse, the distortion is (partly) lifted causing the well-known coherent phonon motion of the lattice. While the overall observed dynamics generally follow a displacive excitation model, a delayed onset of the pump-induced carrier dynamics due to hot-carrier thermalization is observed, as well as a large spectral phase dependence in the coherent phonon oscillation. This is attributed to significantly different carrier relaxation timescales for carrier energies above and near the Fermi level of the semimetal and corroborated by a simple theoretical model that considers the carrier relaxation timescales in the displacive phonon model to explain the observed dynamics. Our results provide direct experimental evidence about the role of carrier-relaxation in the origin of displacive coherent phonon motion.</description>

      <title>Quantum Information-Assisted Complete Active Space Optimization (QICAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.01676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automated active space selection is arguably one of the most challenging and essential aspects of multiconfigurational methods. In this work we propose an effective quantum information-assisted complete active space optimization (QICAS) scheme. What sets QICAS apart from other correlation-based selection schemes is (i) the use of unique measures from quantum information that assess the correlation in electronic structures in an unambiguous and predictive manner, and (ii) an orbital optimization step that minimizes the correlation discarded by the active space approximation. Equipped with these features QICAS yields for smaller correlated molecules sets of optimized orbitals with respect to which the CASCI energy reaches the corresponding CASSCF energy within chemical accuracy. For more challenging systems such as the Chromium dimer, QICAS offers an excellent starting point for CASSCF by greatly reducing the number of iterations required for numerical convergence. Accordingly, our study validates a profound empirical conjecture: the energetically optimal non-active spaces are predominantly those that contain the least entanglement.</description>

      <title>Model-free quantification of completeness, uncertainties, and outliers in atomistic machine learning using information theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12367v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An accurate description of information is relevant for a range of problems in atomistic machine learning (ML), such as crafting training sets, performing uncertainty quantification (UQ), or extracting physical insights from large datasets. However, atomistic ML often relies on unsupervised learning or model predictions to analyze information contents from simulation or training data. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework that provides a rigorous, model-free tool to quantify information contents in atomistic simulations. We demonstrate that the information entropy of a distribution of atom-centered environments explains known heuristics in ML potential developments, from training set sizes to dataset optimality. Using this tool, we propose a model-free UQ method that reliably predicts epistemic uncertainty and detects out-of-distribution samples, including rare events in systems such as nucleation. This method provides a general tool for data-driven atomistic modeling and combines efforts in ML, simulations, and physical explainability.</description>
