      <title>Dynamic Decision-Making under Model Misspecification: A Stochastic Stability Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.17086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dynamic decision-making under model uncertainty is central to many economic environments, yet existing bandit and reinforcement learning algorithms rely on the assumption of correct model specification. This paper studies the behavior and performance of one of the most commonly used Bayesian reinforcement learning algorithms, Thompson Sampling (TS), when the model class is misspecified. We first provide a complete dynamic classification of posterior evolution in a misspecified two-armed Gaussian bandit, identifying distinct regimes: correct model concentration, incorrect model concentration, and persistent belief mixing, characterized by the direction of statistical evidence and the model-action mapping. These regimes yield sharp predictions for limiting beliefs, action frequencies, and asymptotic regret. We then extend the analysis to a general finite model class and develop a unified stochastic stability framework that represents posterior evolution as a Markov process on the belief simplex. This approach characterizes two sufficient conditions to classify the ergodic and transient behaviors and provides inductive dimensional reductions of the posterior dynamics. Our results offer the first qualitative and geometric classification of TS under misspecification, bridging Bayesian learning with evolutionary dynamics, and also build the foundations of robust decision-making in structured bandits.</description>

      <title>Re-equilibration in Matching Markets with Contracts: Firm-Quasi-Stable Allocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.17948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.17948v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the re-equilibration dynamics of matching markets with contracts following disruptions such as firm entry or worker exit. In a many-to-many framework with substitutable preferences, we identify firm-quasi-stable allocations as the canonical state space for out-of-equilibrium adjustment. We prove that this set forms a complete lattice and characterize stable allocations as the fixed points of a monotone Tarski operator defined on it, thereby establishing the lattice structure of stable allocations.
  We link this static characterization to dynamics by showing that decentralized vacancy chains approximate the centralized Tarski operator asynchronously. Specifically, we prove that the trajectory of a generalized firm-proposing deferred acceptance algorithm is bounded by the operator's iterations. This structural containment ensures both processes converge to the same limit. Consequently, the adjustment process exhibits order independence, with the final outcome invariant to the sequence of proposals. Finally, we derive welfare implications for market participants, and, under the law of aggregate demand, generalize the new-entrant advantage theorem to matching markets with contracts, establishing that entering firms achieve their optimal stable outcomes.</description>

      <title>A Theory of Network Games Part 1: Utility Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16071v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a ubiquitous feature of network games, bilateral strategic interactions, is equivalent to having player utilities that are additively separable across opponents. We distinguish two formal notions of bilateral strategic interactions. Opponent independence means that player i's preferences over opponent j's action do not depend on what other opponents do. Strategic independence means that how opponent j's choice influences i's preference between any two actions does not depend on what other opponents do. If i's preferences jointly satisfy both conditions, then we can represent her preferences over strategy profiles using an additively separable utility. If i's preferences satisfy only strategic independence, then we can still represent her preferences over just her own actions using an additively separable utility. Common utilities based on a linear aggregate of opponent actions satisfy strategic independence and are therefore strategically equivalent to additively separable utilities--in fact, we can assume a utility that is linear in opponent actions.</description>

      <title>Equity in auction design with unit-demand agents and non-quasilinear preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.16211v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a model of auction design where a seller is selling a set of objects to a set of agents who can be assigned no more than one object. Each agent's preference over (object, payment) pair need not be quasilinear. If the domain contains all classical preferences, we show that there is a unique mechanism, the minimum Walrasian equilibrium price (MWEP) mechanism, which is strategy-proof, individually rational, and satisfies equal treatment of equals, no-wastage (every object is allocated to some agent), and no-subsidy (no agent is subsidized). This provides an equity-based characterization of the MEWP mechanism, and complements the efficiency-based characterization of the MWEP mechanism known in the literature.</description>

      <title>Time-Varyingness in Auction Breaks Revenue Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Auction is applied for trade with various mechanisms. A simple but practical question is which mechanism, typically first-price or second-price auctions, is preferred from the perspective of bidders or sellers. A celebrated answer is revenue equivalence, where each bidder's equilibrium payoff is proven to be independent of auction mechanisms (and a seller's revenue, too). In reality, however, auction environments like the value distribution of items would vary over time, and such equilibrium bidding cannot always be achieved. Indeed, bidders must continue to track their equilibrium bidding by learning in first-price auctions, but they can keep their equilibrium bidding in second-price auctions. This study discusses whether and how revenue equivalence is violated in the long run by comparing the time series of non-equilibrium bidding in first-price auctions with those of equilibrium bidding in second-price auctions. We characterize the value distribution by two parameters: its basis value, which means the lowest price to bid, and its value interval, which means the width of possible values. Surprisingly, our theorems and experiments find that revenue equivalence is broken by the correlation between the basis value and the value interval, uncovering a novel phenomenon that could occur in the real world.</description>
