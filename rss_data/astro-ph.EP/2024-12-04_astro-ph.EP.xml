      <title>The Origins of Lithium Enhancement in Polluted White Dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The bulk abundances of exoplanetesimals can be measured when they are accreted by white dwarfs. Recently, lithium from the accretion of exoplanetesimals was detected in relatively high levels in multiple white dwarfs. There are presently three proposed hypotheses to explain the detection of excess lithium in white dwarf photospheres: Big Bang and Galactic nucleosynthesis, continental crust, and an exomoon formed from spalled ring material. We present new observations of three previously known lithium-polluted white dwarfs (WD J1824+1213, WD J2317+1830, and LHS 2534), and one with metal pollution without lithium (SDSS J1636+1619). We also present atmospheric model fits to these white dwarfs. We then evaluate the abundances of these white dwarfs and two additional lithium-polluted white dwarfs that were previously fit using the same atmospheric models (WD J1644$-$0449 and SDSS J1330+6435) in the context of the three extant hypotheses for explaining lithium excesses in polluted white dwarfs. We find Big Bang and Galactic nucleosynthesis to be the most plausible explanation of the abundances in WD J1644$-$0449, WD J1824+1213, and WD J2317+1830. SDSS J1330+6435 will require stricter abundances to determine its planetesimal's origins, and LHS 2534, as presently modeled, defies all three hypotheses. We find the accretion of an exomoon formed from spalled ring material to be highly unlikely to be the explanation of the lithium excess in any of these cases.</description>

      <title>A dry Venusian interior constrained by atmospheric chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Venus's climatic history provides powerful constraint on the location of the inner-edge of the liquid-water habitable zone. However, two very different histories of water on Venus have been proposed: one where Venus had a temperate climate for billions of years, with surface liquid water, and the other where a hot early Venus was never able to condense surface liquid water. Here we offer a novel constraint on Venus's climate history by inferring the water content of its interior. By calculating the present rate of atmospheric destruction of H$_2$O, CO$_2$ and OCS, which must be restored by volcanism to maintain atmospheric stability, we show Venus's interior is dry. Venusian volcanic gases have at most a 6% water mole fraction, substantially drier than terrestrial magmas degassed at similar conditions. The dry interior is consistent with Venus ending its magma ocean epoch desiccated and thereafter having had a long-lived dry surface. Volcanic resupply to Venus's atmosphere therefore indicates that the planet has never been `liquid-water' habitable.</description>

      <title>CO2-rich protoplanetary discs as a probe of dust radial drift &amp; trapping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MIR spectra imply considerable chemical diversity in the inner regions of protoplanetary discs: some are H2O-dominated, others by CO2. Sublimating ices from radially drifting dust grains are often invoked to explain some of this diversity, particularly the H2O-rich discs. We use a 1D protoplanetary disc evolution code to model how radially drifting dust grains that transport ices inwards to snowlines impact the chemistry of the inner regions of protoplanetary discs. We explore differences between smooth discs and those where radial drift is impeded by dust trapping outside gas gaps and quantify the effects of gap location and formation time. Discs evolve through an initial H2O-rich phase due to sublimating ices, followed by a CO2-rich phase as H2O vapour advects onto the star and CO2 advects into the inner disc from its snowline. The inclusion of traps hastens the transition between the phases, raising the CO2/H2O ratio; gaps opened early or close-in produce lower increases by blocking more CO2 ice from reaching the inner disc. This leads to a potential correlation between CO2/H2O and gap location that occurs on Myr timescales for fiducial parameters. We produce synthetic spectra from the models which we analyse with 0D LTE slab models to understand how this evolution may be expressed observationally. Whether the evolution can be retrieved depends on the contribution of dust grains to the optical depth: dust that couples to the gas after crossing the H2O snowline can add to the continuum optical depth and obscure the delivered H2O, largely hiding the evolution in its visible column density. However, the CO2/H2O visible column density ratio is only weakly sensitive to dust continuum obscuration. This suggests it may be a clearer tracer of the impact of transport on chemistry than individual column densities for spectra that show weak features probing deep enough in the disc.

      <title>Three Warm Jupiters orbiting TOI-6628, TOI-3837, TOI-5027 and one sub-Saturn orbiting TOI-2328</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of three new transiting giant planets orbiting TOI-6628, TOI-3837 and TOI-5027, and one new warm sub-Saturn orbiting TOI-2328, whose transits events were detected in the lightcurves of the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite \textbf{(TESS)} space mission. By combining TESS lightcurves with ground-based photometric and spectroscopic follow-up observations we confirm the planetary nature of the observed transits and radial velocity variations. TOI-6628~$b$ has a mass of 0.75$\pm$0.06~$M_\mathrm{J}$, a radius of 0.98$\pm$0.05~$R_J$ and is orbiting a metal-rich star with a period of 18.18424$\pm{0.00001}$ days and an eccentricity of 0.667$\pm0.016$, making it one of the most eccentric orbits of all known warm giants. TOI-3837~$b$ has a mass of 0.59$\pm$0.06~$M_\mathrm{J}$, a radius of 0.96$\pm$0.05~$R_J$ and orbits its host star every 11.88865$\pm$0.00003~days, with a moderate eccentricity of 0.198$^{+0.046}_{-0.058}$. With a mass of 2.01$\pm$0.13~$M_\mathrm{J}$ and a radius of 0.99$^{+0.07}_{-0.12}$ $R_J$, TOI-5027~$b$ orbits its host star in an eccentric orbit with $e$~=~0.395$^{+0.032}_{-0.029}$ every 10.24368$\pm{0.00001}$~days. TOI-2328~$b$ is a Saturn-like planet with a mass of 0.16$\pm$0.02~$M_\mathrm{J}$ and a radius of 0.89$\pm$0.04~$R_J$, orbiting its host star in a nearly circular orbit with $e$~=~0.057$^{+0.046}_{-0.029}$ at an orbital period of 17.10197$\pm{0.00001}$ days.
  All four planets have orbital periods above 10 days, and our planet interior structure models are consistsent a rocky-icy core with a H/He envelope, providing evidence supporting the core accretion model of planet formation for this kind of planets.</description>

      <title>The Terminator Region Atmosphere of the hot Jupiter WASP-77Ab with ESPRESSO/VLT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02095v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Atmospheric studies are essential for elucidating the formation history, evolutionary processes, and atmospheric dynamics of exoplanets. High-resolution transmission spectroscopy offers the advantage of detecting subtle variations in stellar spectral profiles, thereby enabling the identification of the sources of observed signals. In this study, we present the transmission spectra of the exoplanet WASP-77Ab, a hot Jupiter with a 1.36-day orbital period around a G8 host star with $V=11.29$ mag. These observations were conducted using the high-resolution spectrograph ESPRESSO at the Very Large Telescope over three transit events. We analyze the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect for WASP-77A and determine a projected spin-orbit angle of ${\lambda = 16.131^{\circ}}^{+2.106}_{-2.324}$, indicating that the planet's orbit is nearly aligned. Following the generation of transmission spectra for the three nights, we model and correct for center-to-limb variation and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effects. In the residual transmission spectra, we detect H$\alpha$, H$\beta$ and CaII H with a significance exceeding 3.5$\sigma$. After applying 0.1-0.5 \r{A} masks to the cores of these lines to mitigate stellar contamination, all them still shows visible absorptions although not significant, suggesting at least partial planet contribution to them. Therefore, we are yet unable to confirm or reject the planetary origin of these spectral signals based on the current data set. Further investigation of WASP-77Ab's atmosphere, particularly in areas beyond the terminator region, is essential to illuminate the planet's two-dimensional atmospheric structure.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Methods for Automated Interstellar Object Classification with LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Legacy Survey of Space and Time, to be conducted with the Vera C. Rubin Observatory, is poised to revolutionize our understanding of the Solar System by providing an unprecedented wealth of data on various objects, including the elusive interstellar objects (ISOs). Detecting and classifying ISOs is crucial for studying the composition and diversity of materials from other planetary systems. However, the rarity and brief observation windows of ISOs, coupled with the vast quantities of data to be generated by LSST, create significant challenges for their identification and classification. This study aims to address these challenges by exploring the application of machine learning algorithms to the automated classification of ISO tracklets in simulated LSST data. We employed various machine learning algorithms, including random forests (RFs), stochastic gradient descent (SGD), gradient boosting machines (GBMs), and neural networks (NNs), to classify ISO tracklets in simulated LSST data. We demonstrate that GBM and RF algorithms outperform SGD and NN algorithms in accurately distinguishing ISOs from other Solar System objects. RF analysis shows that many derived Digest2 values are more important than direct observables in classifying ISOs from the LSST tracklets. The GBM model achieves the highest precision, recall, and F1 score, with values of 0.9987, 0.9986, and 0.9987, respectively. These findings lay the foundation for the development of an efficient and robust automated system for ISO discovery using LSST data, paving the way for a deeper understanding of the materials and processes that shape planetary systems beyond our own. The integration of our proposed machine learning approach into the LSST data processing pipeline will optimize the survey's potential for identifying these rare and valuable objects, enabling timely follow-up observations and further characterization.</description>

      <title>Forming Earth-like and Low-Mass Rocky Exoplanets Through Pebble and Planetesimal Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02571v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The theory of pebble accretion (PA) has become a popular planet formation theory during the past decade. However, PA studies generally rely on large planetary embryos, much larger than those expected from the streaming instability. This study analyses the formation of terrestrial planets around stars with masses ranging from 0.09 to 1.00 M$_\odot$ through PA, starting with small planetesimals with radii between 175 and 450 km. We perform numerical simulations, using a modified version of the N-body simulator SyMBA, which includes pebble accretion, type I and II migration, and eccentricity and inclination damping. Two prescriptions for the pebble accretion rate are analysed. We find that Earth-mass planets are consistently formed around 0.49, 0.70 and 1.00 M$_\odot$ stars, irrespective of the pebble accretion model. However, Earth-like planets seldom remain in the habitable zone, for they rapidly migrate to the inner edge of the disc. Furthermore, we find that pebble accretion onto small planetesimals cannot produce Earth-mass planets around 0.09 and 0.20 M$_\odot$, challenging the proposed narrative of the formation of the TRAPPIST-1 system. Further research is needed to determine if models with a lower pebble mass flux, or additional migration traps, could produce solar-system-like planetary systems in which Earth-like planets remain in the habitable zone.</description>

      <title>Increased Surface Temperatures of Habitable White Dwarf Worlds Relative to Main-Sequence Exoplanets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02694v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Discoveries of giant planet candidates orbiting white dwarf stars and the demonstrated capabilities of the James Webb Space Telescope bring the possibility of detecting rocky planets in the habitable zones of white dwarfs into pertinent focus. We present simulations of an aqua planet with an Earth-like atmospheric composition and incident stellar insolation orbiting in the habitable zone of two different types of stars - a 5000 K white dwarf and main-sequence K-dwarf star Kepler-62 with a similar effective temperature - and identify the mechanisms responsible for the two differing planetary climates. The synchronously-rotating white dwarf planet's global mean surface temperature is 25 K higher than that of the synchronously-rotating planet orbiting Kepler-62, due to its much faster (10-hr) rotation and orbital period. This ultra-fast rotation generates strong zonal winds and meridional flux of zonal momentum, stretching out and homogenizing the scale of atmospheric circulation, and preventing an equivalent build-up of thick, liquid water clouds on the dayside of the planet compared to the synchronous planet orbiting Kepler-62, while also transporting heat equatorward from higher latitudes. White dwarfs may therefore present amenable environments for life on planets formed within or migrated to their habitable zones, generating warmer surface environments than those of planets with main-sequence hosts to compensate for an ever shrinking incident stellar flux.</description>

      <title>Uranus Study Report: KISS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the internal structure of Uranus is a key objective for planetary science. Knowledge of Uranus's bulk composition and the distribution of elements is crucial to understanding its origin and evolutionary path. In addition, Uranus represents a poorly understood class of intermediate-mass planets (intermediate in size between the relatively well studied terrestrial and gas giant planets), which appear to be very common in the Galaxy. As a result, a better characterization of Uranus will also help us to better understand exoplanets in this mass and size regime. Recognizing the importance of Uranus, a Keck Institute for Space Studies (KISS) workshop was held in September 2023 to investigate how we can improve our knowledge of Uranus's internal structure in the context of a future Uranus mission that includes an orbiter and a probe. The scientific goals and objectives of the recently released Planetary Science and Astrobiology Decadal Survey were taken as our starting point. We reviewed our current knowledge of Uranus's interior and identified measurement and other mission requirements for a future Uranus spacecraft, providing more detail than was possible in the Decadal Survey's mission study and including new insights into the measurements to be made. We also identified important knowledge gaps to be closed with Earth-based efforts in the near term that will help guide the design of the mission and interpret the data returned.</description>

      <title>New insight of time-transformed symplectic integrator I: hybrid methods for hierarchical triples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02124v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate $N$-body simulations of multiple systems such as binaries and triples are essential for understanding the formation and evolution of interacting binaries and binary mergers, including gravitational wave sources, blue stragglers and X-ray binaries. The logarithmic time-transformed explicit symplectic integrator (LogH), also known as algorithmic regularization, is a state-of-the-art method for this purpose.However, we show that this method is accurate for isolated Kepler orbits because of its ability to trace Keplerian trajectories, but much less accurate for hierarichal triple systems. The method can lead to an unphysical secular evolution of inner eccentricity in Kozal-Lidov triples, despite a small energy error. We demonstrate that hybrid methods, which apply LogH to the inner binary and alternative methods to the outer bodies, are significantly more effective, though not symplectic. Additionally, we introduce a more efficient hybrid method, BlogH, which eliminates the need for time synchronization and is time symmetric. The method is implemented in the few-body code SDAR. We explore suitable criteria for switching between the LogH and BlogH methods for general triple systems. These hybrid methods have the potential to enhance the integration performance of hierarchial triples.</description>

      <title>Identifying Hierarchically Triple Star Systems with Gaia DR3 and LAMOST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triple star systems are critical for understanding stellar dynamics and compact objects in astrophysics, yet confirmed hierarchical triples identified via spectroscopy remain limited. In this study, we identified 23 triple systems by cross-matching the Gaia DR3 non-single star catalog with LAMOST DR10 spectroscopic data; 18 of them are new discoveries. For two well-observed triples, we performed radial velocity curve fitting and light curve analysis to determine their orbital parameters, with inner and outer periods of 1.26 days and 656 days for one triple, and 3.42 days and 422 days for the other. We compared the results with other studies. We also analyzed the radial velocities (RVs) of these 23 triples, revealing a range of $V$ from approximately 40~km~s$^{-1}$ to 210~km~s$^{-1}$. Due to spectral resolution and detection limitations, velocity differences below 45~km~s$^{-1}$ in binaries and below 90~km~s$^{-1}$ in the inner binaries of triple systems are challenging to detect. Consequently, our detection range for inner orbital periods is restricted to 0.2--20 days, with the highest efficiency for periods under 10 days. These findings underscore the advantage of spectroscopic observations for identifying triple systems with short inner orbital periods.</description>

Abstract: The satellite Mimas launches a bending wave -- a warping of the rings that propagates radially through self-gravity -- at the 5:3 inner vertical resonance with Saturn's rings. We present a modification of the linear bending wave theory which includes the effects of satellite self-gravity wakes on the particles in the wave. We show that, when treated as rigid, these wakes generate an extra layer of particles whose number density is proportional to the magnitude of the slope of the warped ring. Using a ray-tracing code we compare our predictions with those of linear bending wave theory and with 60 stellar occultations observed by the Cassini Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph (UVIS) and find that the extra layer of particles of our perturbed bending wave model has a considerable explanatory power for the UVIS dataset. Our best model explains the most discrepant and surprising features of the Mimas 5:3 bending wave; the enhancement of the signal for the cases of occultations with high ring opening angle and the bigger-than-expected viscosity, $\nu = 576 \, \mathrm{cm^2/s}$, which is more than double the viscosity computed from density waves. This shows that self-gravity wakes can be effective at transporting angular momentum in a vertically perturbed disk. Relative to neighboring density waves, we find a lower-than-expected value for the surface mass density, $\sigma = 36.7 \, \mathrm{g/cm^2}$, which suggests that the enhanced viscous interactions may be transporting material into the surrounding regions.</description>

      <title>A sub-Earth-mass planet orbiting Barnard's star: No evidence of transits in TESS photometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.00577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A sub-Earth-mass planet orbiting Barnard's star, designated as Barnard b, has been recently announced. At almost the same time, the first photometric data of Barnard's star by the Transit Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) was released in Sector 80. We explore the possibility of emergent transits of Barnard b in TESS photometry. The detrended 2 min light curve appears to be flat, with a flux root mean square of 0.411 parts per thousand. Attempts of blind and informed transit-curve model inference suggest no evidence of transiting Barnard b, or any other body. This provides a 3$\sigma$ upper bound of 87.9 degrees for the orbital inclination of Barnard b.</description>

      <title>The discovery and characterization of minimoon 2024 PT$_5$</title>

Abstract: Minimoons are asteroids that become temporarily captured by the Earth-Moon system. We present the discovery of 2024 PT$_5$, a minimoon discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) Sutherland telescope on 2024 August 7. The minimoon with heliocentric semi-major axis, $a$$\sim$1.01 au, and perihelion, $q$$\sim$0.99 au, became captured by the Earth-Moon system on 2024 September 29 and left on 2024 November 25 UTC. Visible g, r, i, and Z spectrophotometry was obtained using Gemini North/Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) on 2024 September 27. The color indices are g-r = 0.58$\pm$0.04, r-i = 0.29$\pm$0.04, i-Z = -0.27$\pm$0.06, and the spectrum best matches lunar rock samples followed by S-complex asteroids. Assuming an albedo of 0.21 and using our measured absolute magnitude of 28.64$\pm$0.04, 2024 PT$_5$ has a diameter of 5.4$\pm$1.2 m. We also detect variations in the lightcurve of 2024 PT$_5$ with a 0.28$\pm$0.07 magnitude amplitude and a double-peaked period of $\sim$2600$\pm$500 s. We improve the orbital solution of 2024 PT$_5$ with our astrometry and estimate the effect of radiation pressure on its deriving an area-to-mass ratio of 7.02$\pm$2.05$\times$10$^{-5}$ m$^2$/kg, implying a density of $\sim$3.9$\pm$2.1 g/cm$^3$, compatible with having a rocky composition. If we assume 2024 PT$_5$ is from the NEO population, its most likely sources are resonances in the inner Main Belt by comparing its orbit with the NEO population model, though this does not exclude a lunar origin.</description>

      <title>Time Resolved Absorption of Six Chemical Species With MAROON-X Points to Strong Drag in the Ultra Hot Jupiter TOI-1518 b</title>

Abstract: Wind dynamics play a pivotal role in governing transport processes within planetary atmospheres, influencing atmospheric chemistry, cloud formation, and the overall energy budget. Understanding the strength and patterns of winds is crucial for comprehensive insights into the physics of ultra-hot Jupiter atmospheres. Current research has proposed two contrasting mechanisms that limit wind speeds in these atmospheres, each predicting a different scaling of wind speed with planet temperature. However, the sparse nature of existing observations hinders the determination of population trends and the validation of these proposed mechanisms. This study focuses on unraveling the wind dynamics and the chemical composition in the atmosphere of the ultra-hot Jupiter TOI-1518 b. Two transit observations using the high-resolution (R{\lambda} = 85 000), optical (spectral coverage between 490 and 920 nm) spectrograph MAROON-X were obtained and analyzed to explore the chemical composition and wind dynamics using the cross-correlation techniques, global circulating models, and atmospheric retrieval. We report the detection of 14 species in the atmosphere of TOI-1518 b through cross-correlation analysis. Additionally, we measure the time-varying cross-correlation trails for 6 different species, compare them with predictions from General Circulation Models (GCM) and conclude that a strong drag is present in TOI-1518b's atmosphere. The ionized species require stronger drags than neutral species, likely due to the increased magnetic effects in the upper atmosphere. Furthermore, we detect vanadium oxide (VO) using the most up-to-date line list. This result is promising in detecting VO in other systems where inaccuracies in previous line lists have hindered detection. We use a retrieval analysis to further characterize the abundances of the different species detected.</description>
