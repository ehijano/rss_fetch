      <title>Smart leverage? Rethinking the role of Leveraged Exchange Traded Funds in constructing portfolios to beat a benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Leveraged Exchange Traded Funds (LETFs), while extremely controversial in the literature, remain stubbornly popular with both institutional and retail investors in practice. While the criticisms of LETFs are certainly valid, we argue that their potential has been underestimated in the literature due to the use of very simple investment strategies involving LETFs. In this paper, we systematically investigate the potential of including a broad stock market index LETF in long-term, dynamically-optimal investment strategies designed to maximize the outperformance over standard investment benchmarks in the sense of the information ratio (IR). Our results exploit the observation that positions in a LETF deliver call-like payoffs, so that the addition of a LETF to a portfolio can be a convenient way to add inexpensive leverage while providing downside protection. Under stylized assumptions, we present and analyze closed-form IR-optimal investment strategies using either a LETF or standard/vanilla ETF (VETF) on the same equity index, which provides the necessary intuition for the potential and benefits of LETFs. In more realistic settings, we use a neural network-based approach to determine the IR-optimal strategies, trained on bootstrapped historical data. We find that IR-optimal strategies with a broad stock market LETF are not only more likely to outperform the benchmark than IR-optimal strategies derived using the corresponding VETF, but are able to achieve partial stochastic dominance over the benchmark and VETF-based strategies in terms of terminal wealth.</description>

      <title>AD-HOC: A C++ Expression Template package for high-order derivatives backpropagation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This document presents a new C++ Automatic Differentiation (AD) tool, AD-HOC (Automatic Differentiation for High-Order Calculations). This tool aims to have the following features: -Calculation of user specified derivatives of arbitrary order -To be able to run with similar speeds as handwritten code -All derivatives calculations are computed in a single backpropagation tree pass -No source code generation is used, relying heavily on the C++ compiler to statically build the computation tree before runtime -A simple interface -The ability to be used \textit{in conjunction} with other established, general-purpose dynamic AD tools -Header-only library, with no external dependencies -Open source, with a business-friendly license</description>

      <title>Systematic comparison of deep generative models applied to multivariate financial time series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06417v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial time series (FTS) generation models are a core pillar to applications in finance. Risk management and portfolio optimization rely on realistic multivariate price generation models. Accordingly, there is a strong modelling literature dating back to Bachelier's Theory of Speculation in 1901. Generating FTS using deep generative models (DGMs) is still in its infancy. In this work, we systematically compare DGMs against state-of-the-art parametric alternatives for multivariate FTS generation. We initially compare both DGMs and parametric models over increasingly complex synthetic datasets. The models are evaluated through distance measures for varying distribution moments of both the full and rolling FTS. We then apply the best performing DGM models to empirical data, demonstrating the benefit of DGMs through a implied volatility trading task.</description>

      <title>High order approximations and simulation schemes for the log-Heston process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present weak approximations schemes of any order for the Heston model that are obtained by using the method developed by Alfonsi and Bally (2021). This method consists in combining approximation schemes calculated on different random grids to increase the order of convergence. We apply this method with either the Ninomiya-Victoir scheme (2008) or a second-order scheme that samples exactly the volatility component, and we show rigorously that we can achieve then any order of convergence. We give numerical illustrations on financial examples that validate the theoretical order of convergence. We also present promising numerical results for the multifactor/rough Heston model and hint at applications to other models, including the Bates model and the double Heston model.</description>
