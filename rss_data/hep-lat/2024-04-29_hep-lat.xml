      <title>Phase diagram of generalized XY model using tensor renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We use the higher-order tensor renormalization group method to study the two-dimensional generalized XY model that admits integer and half-integer vortices. This model is the deformation of the classical XY model and has a rich phase structure consisting of nematic, ferromagnetic, and disordered phases and three transition lines belonging to the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless and Ising class. We explore the model for a wide range of temperatures, $T$, and the deformation parameter, $\Delta$, and compute specific heat along with integer and half-integer magnetic susceptibility, finding both BKT-like and Ising-like transitions and the region where they meet.</description>

      <title>Towards determining the (2+1)-dimensional Quantum Electrodynamics running coupling with Monte Carlo and quantum computing methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine a compact $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory in $(2+1)$ dimensions and present a strategy for studying the running coupling and extracting the non-perturbative $\Lambda$-parameter. To this end, we combine Monte Carlo simulations and quantum computing, where the former can be used to determine the numerical value of the lattice spacing $a$, and the latter allows for reaching the perturbative regime at very small values of the bare coupling and, correspondingly, small values of $a$. The methodology involves a series of sequential steps (i.e., the step scaling function) to bridge results from small lattice spacings to non-perturbative large-scale lattice calculations. To address the model on current and near-future quantum devices, we propose variational Ansatz circuits adapted to gauge degrees of freedom. Focusing on the pure gauge case, we demonstrate that these quantum circuits are able to capture the relevant physics by studying the expectation value of the plaquette operator, for matching with corresponding Monte Carlo simulations. We also present results for the static potential and static force, which can be related to the renormalized coupling. The procedure outlined in this work can be extended to Abelian and non-Abelian lattice gauge theories with matter fields and might provide a way towards studying lattice quantum chromodynamics utilizing both quantum and classical methods.</description>

      <title>Bootstrap for Finite N Lattice Yang-Mills Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a comprehensive framework for analyzing finite $N$ lattice Yang-Mills theory and finite $N$ matrix models. Utilizing this framework, we examine the bootstrap approach to SU(2) Lattice Yang-Mills Theory in 2,3 and 4 dimensions. The SU(2) Makeenko-Migdal loop equations on the lattice are linear and closed exclusively on single-trace Wilson loops. This inherent linearity significantly enhances the efficiency of the bootstrap approach due to the convex nature of the problem, permitting the inclusion of Wilson loops up to length 24. The exact upper and lower margins for the free energy per plaquette, derived from our bootstrap method, demonstrate good agreement with Monte Carlo data, achieving precision within $0.1\%$ for the physically relevant range of couplings in both three and four dimensions. Additionally, our bootstrap data provides estimates of the string tension, in qualitative agreement with existing Monte Carlo computations.</description>

      <title>Higgs Phases and Boundary Criticality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent work connecting Higgs phases to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, we investigate the interplay of gauge redundancy and global symmetry in lattice gauge theories with Higgs fields in the presence of a boundary. The core conceptual point is that a global symmetry associated to a Higgs field, which is pure-gauge in a closed system, acts physically at the boundary under boundary conditions which allow electric flux to escape the system. We demonstrate in both Abelian and non-Abelian models that this symmetry is spontaneously broken in the Higgs regime, implying the presence of gapless edge modes. Starting with the U(1) Abelian Higgs model in 4D, we demonstrate a boundary phase transition in the 3D XY universality class separating the bulk Higgs and confining regimes. Varying the boundary coupling while preserving the symmetries shifts the location of the boundary phase transition. We then consider non-Abelian gauge theories with fundamental and group-valued Higgs matter, and identify the analogous non-Abelian global symmetry acting on the boundary generated by the total color charge. For SU($N$) gauge theory with fundamental Higgs matter we argue for a boundary phase transition in the O($2N$) universality class, verified numerically for $N=2,3$. For group-valued Higgs matter, the boundary theory is a principal chiral model exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking. We further demonstrate this mechanism in theories with higher-form Higgs fields. We show how the higher-form matter symmetry acts at the boundary and can spontaneously break, exhibiting a boundary confinement-deconfinement transition. We also study the electric-magnetic dual theory, demonstrating a dual magnetic defect condensation transition at the boundary. We discuss some implications and extensions of these findings and what they may imply for the relation between Higgs and SPT phases.</description>

      <title>Bootstrapping the Abelian Lattice Gauge Theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$ Abelian lattice gauge theories using a bootstrap method, in which the loop equations and positivity conditions are employed for Wilson loops with lengths $L\leqslant L_{\textrm{max}}$ to derive two-sided bounds on the Wilson loop averages. We address a fundamental question that whether the constraints from loop equations and positivity are strong enough to solve lattice gauge theories. We answer this question by bootstrapping the 2D $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory. We show that with sufficiently large $L_{\textrm{max}}=60$, the two-sided bounds provide estimates for the plaquette averages with precision near $10^{-8}$ or even higher, suggesting the bootstrap constraints are sufficient to numerically pin down this theory. We compute the bootstrap bounds on the plaquette averages in the 3D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories with $L_{\textrm{max}}=16$. In the regions with weak or strong coupling, the two-sided bootstrap bounds converge quickly and coincide with the perturbative results to high precision. The bootstrap bounds are well consistent with the Monte Carlo results in the nonperturbative region. We observe interesting connections between the bounds generated by the bootstrap computations and the Griffiths' inequalities. We present results towards bootstrapping the string tension and glueball mass in Abelian lattice gauge theories.</description>

      <title>Most general neutron decay correlations: Standard Model recoil and radiative corrections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To continue from our previous work \textit{Phys.Rev.D\textbf{109}(2024),073007}, we derive the full Standard Model prediction of the most general free neutron differential decay rate with all massive particles (neutron, proton and electron) polarized, including the $\mathcal{O}(1/m_N)$ recoil corrections and $\mathcal{O}(\alpha/\pi)$ radiative corrections. For the latter we adopt the newly-developed pseudo-neutrino formalism which is compatible to realistic experimental setups, in which neutrinos and photons are not detected. We also provide readily-executable \textit{Mathematica} notebooks to evaluate these corrections.</description>

      <title>Curvature Correlators in Nonperturbative 2D Lorentzian Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correlation functions are ubiquitous tools in quantum field theory from both a fundamental and a practical point of view. However, up to now their use in theories of quantum gravity beyond perturbative and asymptotically flat regimes has been limited, due to difficulties associated with diffeomorphism invariance and the dynamical nature of geometry. We present an analysis of a manifestly diffeomorphism-invariant, nonperturbative two-point curvature correlator in two-dimensional Lorentzian quantum gravity. It is based on the recently introduced quantum Ricci curvature and uses a lattice regularization of the full path integral in terms of causal dynamical triangulations. We discuss some of the subtleties and ambiguities in defining connected correlators in theories of dynamical geometry, and provide strong evidence from Monte Carlo simulations that the connected two-point curvature correlator in 2D Lorentzian quantum gravity vanishes. This work paves the way for an analogous investigation in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Lellouch-L\"uscher factor for the $K\to 3\pi$ decays</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.04391v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive an explicit expression for the Lellouch-L\"uscher (LL) factor in the $K\to 3\pi$ decays at leading order (without derivative couplings). Several important technical details are addressed, like a proper decomposition into the isospin amplitudes, the choice of a minimal set of effective couplings and the renormalization, as well as the algorithm for the solution of the pertinent Faddeev equations in the infinite volume which is based on the contour deformation method. Most importantly, our numerical results demonstrate that the three-body force contributes very little to the LL factor. This result paves the way for the study of the $K\to 3\pi$ decays on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Moments of Nucleon Unpolarized, Polarized, and Transversity Parton Distribution Functions from Lattice QCD at the Physical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05360v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The second Mellin moments $\langle x\rangle$ of the nucleon's unpolarized, polarized, and transversity parton distribution functions (PDFs) are computed. Two lattice QCD ensembles at the physical pion mass are used: these were generated using a tree-level Symanzik-improved gauge action and 2+1 flavour tree-level improved Wilson Clover fermions coupling via 2-level HEX-smearing. The moments are extracted from forward matrix elements of local leading twist operators. We determine renomalization factors in RI-(S)MOM and match to $\overline{\mathrm{MS}}$ at scale $2\,\mathrm{GeV}$. Our findings show that operators that exhibit vanishing kinematics at zero momentum can have significantly reduced excited-state contamination. The resulting polarized moment is used to quantify the longitudinal contribution to the quark spin-orbit correlation. All our results agree within two sigma with previous lattice results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study double parton distributions with flavor interference in the nucleon and compare them with previous results for the flavor diagonal case. We investigate both unpolarized and polarized partons. We compare our lattice results with those obtained from the simple description of the proton in terms of an SU(6) symmetric three-quark wave function and find that this description fails for both flavor and polarization dependence. We also derive and test a factorization ansatz for the unpolarized flavor interference distribution in terms of single-parton distributions and find that this ansatz fails to a large extent.</description>

      <title>Four-gluon vertex from the Curci-Ferrari model at one-loop order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the four-gluon vertex from the Curci-Ferrari model at one-loop order for a collinear configuration. Our results display a good agreement with the first lattice data for this vertex, released very recently (arXiv:2401.12008). A noteworthy novelty of our work is that we can provide analytical expressions for the four-gluon vertex in collinear configurations, together with a renormalization scheme that allows us to perform reliable perturbative computations even in the infrared regime. We observe an infrared suppression in the form factor associated with the tree-level four-gluon tensor with a possible zero-crossing in the deep infrared which demands new lattice investigations to be confirmed. Moreover, we report an infrared divergence in the completely symmetric tensor form factor due to the ghost-loop contributions. These results come as predictions since previous two-point correlations fix all the available parameters of the model, up to an overall constant factor.</description>
