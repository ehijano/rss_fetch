      <title>Orbital-selective two-gap superconductivity in kagome metal CsV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed anisotropic multigap superconductivity in the kagome metal CsV3Sb5. However, the interplay between its multi-orbital character and electron-phonon coupling (EPC) in governing multiple superconducting gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we theoretically investigate the superconducting gap of CsV3Sb5 by combining first-principles calculations with superconducting density functional theory (SCDFT). Our results demonstrate that orbital-selective pairing drives the observed two-gap superconductivity in CsV3Sb5. Specifically, the two distinct gaps exhibit strong orbital dependence: a large, highly anisotropic gap (average magnitude ~0.64 meV) primarily originates from V-3d orbitals, while a small, isotropic gap (~0.25 meV) is associated with the Sb-5pz orbital. The V-3d orbitals strongly couple to the in-plane V-V bond-stretching and out-of-plane V-Sb bending phonon modes, whereas the kagome-plane Sb-5pz orbital weakly interacts with Cs shearing phonon mode. Moreover, our calculations reveal EPC-induced band renormalization, manifested as kinks at approximately -13 meV and -30 meV in the electronic dispersion, consistent with prior experimental observations. These findings provide fundamental insights into the orbital-selective superconductivity and EPC mechanisms in kagome CsV3Sb5.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Lattice Distortion in the Spin-Triplet Superconductor Cu$_{x}$Bi$_2$Se$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The doped topological insulator Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ has attracted considerable attention as a new platform for studying novel properties of spin-triplet and topological superconductivity. In this work, we performed synchrotron x-ray diffraction measurements on Cu$_x$Bi$_2$Se$_3$ (0.24$\leq x\leq$ 0.46) to investigate the coupling between the superconducting order parameter and crystal lattice. In the crystals in which the vector order parameter (${\boldsymbol d}$ vector) is tilted from the crystal high-symmetry directions as evidenced by nematic diamagnetic susceptibility, we find a sizable lattice distortion ($\sim$100 ppm) associated with the onset of superconductivity. In contrast, in crystals with the ${\boldsymbol d}$ vector aligned along the high-symmetry directions, we find no appreciable change in lattice constant. Together with a pronounced vestigial behavior of the distortion, the results are clear evidence for an odd-parity $E_u$ order parameter that couples with trigonal lattice. Furthermore, in the crystal with $x$ = 0.46 where diamagnetic susceptibility is isotropic in the plane, no lattice distortion accompanying the superconducting transition is found, which is in line with a chiral superconducting state in the highly doped region. Our work shows that lattice distortion can be a powerful diagnosing quantity for nematic superconductivity with two-component order parameter.</description>

      <title>Ambient-Pressure Superconductivity from Boron Icosahedral Superatoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a new family of XB$_{12}$, boron-rich compounds formed by interconnected B$_{12}$ icosahedra and electropositive guest atoms ($X$). These structures emerged from first-principles crystal structure prediction at 50 GPa, as part of a pressure-quenching strategy to discover superconductors that could be synthesized under pressure and retained at ambient conditions. The resulting structures are thermodynamically competitive, dynamically stable at zero pressure, and - when $X$ is a mono- or trivalent element - metallic and superconducting. Predicted critical temperatures reach up to 42 K for CsB$_{12}$, rivaling MgB$_2$, the highest-$T_c$ ambient-pressure conventional superconductor.
  We interpret the XB$_{12}$ phase as a superatomic crystal: the B$_{12}$ units retain their molecular identity while forming extended crystalline networks. Their delocalized orbitals support doping without structural destabilization, while their covalent bonding promotes strong electron-phonon coupling. Unlike MgB$_2$, where superconductivity is driven by a narrow subset of phonon modes, the XB$_{12}$ compounds exhibit broad, mode- and momentum-distributed coupling through both intra- and inter-superatomic vibrations. Our results highlight the XB$_{12}$ family as a promising platform for metastable superconductivity and demonstrate the potential of superatoms as functional building blocks in solid-state materials design.</description>

      <title>Mechanisms of superconductivity and inhomogeneous states in metallic hydrogen and electron systems with attraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Review we discuss anomalous aspects of superconductivity (SC) and normal state, as well as formation of inhomogeneous (droplet-like or cluster-like) states in electron systems with attraction. We consider both the models with the retardation (Eliashberg mechanism of SC for strong electron-phonon interaction in metallic hydrogen) and without retardation (but with local onsite attraction). We concentrate on the mechanism of the BCS-BEC crossover for the Hubbard model with local attraction and diagonal disorder for the two-dimensional films of the dirty metal. We analyze also the model of the inhomogeneous spaceseparated Fermi-Bose mixture for the bismuth oxides BaKBiO, which contains the paired clusters of bosonic states as well as unpaired fermionic clusters. Superconductivity is realized in this system due to local pairs tunneling from one bosonic cluster to the neighboring one via the fermionic barrier. For metallic hydrogen and metallic hydrides, we calculate the critical temperature and discuss important possibility for practical applications how to increase the temperature by decreasing pressure in the framework of the generalized Eliashberg approach. We advocate also interesting analogies with the quantum (vortex) crystal for long-living low-dimensional metastable phases of metallic hydrogen including filamentous phase with proton chains embedded in 3D electron Fermi liquid and planar phase with proton plains. We formulate the concept of two Bose-condensates in SC electron and superfluid (SF) ion subsystems and provide the estimate for the lifetime of the long-living metastable phases at normal pressure. The estimate is connected with the formation and growth of the critical seeds of the new (molecular) phase in the process of quantum under-barrier tunneling.</description>

      <title>Superconducting NbN Resonator Parametric Amplifiers for Millimetre Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the development of a reactive sputtering process for high $T_\mathrm{c}$ NbN films with high normal-state resistivity, tailored for kinetic inductance parametric amplifiers. The process includes precise control to ensure full nitridation of the target prior to deposition. Under optimized conditions, the resulting NbN thin films exhibit a critical temperature of $10.5\,\mathrm{K}$ and a resistivity of $\sim1000\,\mathrm{\mu\Omega\,cm}$. The high $T_\mathrm{c}$ of the NbN thin-films suggests strong potential for application over the entire millimetre-wave frequency range from $24\,\mathrm{GHz}$ to $300\,\mathrm{GHz}$, whereas the high resistivity suggests a reduced power requirement for the pump tone to achieve high gain. Resonator parametric amplifiers have been fabricated from these films using coplanar waveguide geometry. The devices were able to produce high gain exceeding $20\,\mathrm{dB}$ at $25\,\mathrm{GHz}$, with artefact-free, reproducible amplification profiles in good agreement with theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Accounting the size distribution of HTS granules for the critical current density from magnetic measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of the critical current density from magnetic hysteresis loops is widely used to characterize and compare superconducting samples. Magnetic hysteresis loops for tapes and single crystals depend on both the critical current density and sample size. The latter sets the scale of supercurrent circulation. However, in polycrystalline high-temperature superconductors prepared by solid-phase synthesis or by sol-gel method, the magnetization is determined by the circulation of supercurrents in individual grains. The paper discusses the effect of the grain size distribution on the effective scale of current circulation. Log-normal and Weibull distributions are both considered as possible for grain sizes. The effective size for calculating the intragrain current density has been shown to be significantly larger than the average grain size.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the landscape of Mottness and its proximity to superconductivity in 4Hb-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mott physics is at the root of a plethora of many-body quantum phenomena in quantum materials. Recently, the stacked or twisted structures of van der Waals (vdW) materials have emerged as a unique platform for realizing exotic correlated states in the vicinity of the Mott transition. However, the definitive feature of Mottness and how it rules the low-energy electronic state remain elusive and experimentally inaccessible in many interesting regimes. Here, we quantitatively describe a filling-controlled Mott state and its interplay with superconductivity by scanning tunnelling spectroscopy in a vdW bulk heterostructure, 4Hb-TaS$_2$, that interleaves strongly correlated 1T-TaS$_2$ layers with superconducting 1H-Ta$_2$ layers. The fine tunability of electron doping induced by interlayer charge transfer allows us to continuously track the spectral function with unsurpassed energy resolution from a depleted narrow band (0.2 electrons per site) toward a Mott transition at half filling. The gradually emerging Mott-Hubbard bands, followed by the sharpening and vanishing of the central quasiparticle peak as predicted in the Brinkman-Rice scenario, unambiguously demonstrate the Mott physics at play. Importantly, the renormalization of the low-energy electrons acts destructively on the superconducting pairing potential, leaving behind nonsuperconducting, paramagnetic puddles at the nanoscale. Our results reveal a seminal system near the border of the Mott criterion that enables us to illustrate the predictive power of the Hubbard model, and set such heterostructures as promising ground for realizing new correlated states in the heavily doped Mott regime.</description>

      <title>Optimization of superconducting properties of F-doped SmFeAsO by cubic anvil high-pressure technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We optimize the synthesis conditions for SmFeAsO0.80F0.20 (Sm1111) bulks using a cubic-anvil high-pressure (CA-HP) apparatus through both ex-situ and in-situ processes, applying pressures of up to 4 GPa and heating temperatures of up to 1600{\deg}C. A comprehensive characterization has been performed, including structural, microstructural, transport, and magnetic measurements. Our findings indicate that a modest growth pressure of approximately 0.5 GPa is sufficient for the formation of the Sm1111 phase in the ex-situ process. In contrast, the in-situ process requires higher synthesis pressure (4 GPa) and temperature (1400 {\deg}C for 1 hour) to achieve the Sm1111 phase with enhanced superconducting properties. Notably, the optimized in-situ process significantly reduces the reaction time needed for the formation of the Sm1111 phase compared to conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP), leading to an increase in the transition temperature by 3 K and improvements in critical current density (Jc). Conversely, the optimized ex-situ process results in an onset transition temperature (Tc) of approximately 53 K, similar to that of CSP, though it enhances the Jc by an order of magnitude. Despite these advancements, a small amount of impurity phases, as observed during CSP, persists in all Sm1111 samples prepared through either the in-situ or ex-situ CA-HP processes. These results suggest that the in-situ process under optimized conditions (1400 {\deg}C, 4 GPa for 1 hour) can effectively improve the superconducting properties of Sm1111. Additionally, a comprehensive analysis comparing these results with high gas pressure techniques, spark plasma sintering, and CSP methods suggests that a small amount of impurity phases in Sm1111 is persistent and cannot be completely eliminated by various pressure techniques, even at the applied pressure of up to 4 GPa.</description>

      <title>Anomalous narrow-band correlation in a natural superconducting heterostructure</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new frontier in condensed matter physics is to stack atomically thin layered-materials with different properties and create intriguing phenomena which do not exist in any of the constituent layers. Transition metal dichalcogenide 4Hb-TaS$_2$, with an alternating stacking of a spin liquid candidate 1T-TaS$_2$ and a superconductor 1H-TaS$_2$, is a natural heterostructure for such a purpose. Recently, rare phenomena are indeed observed, including chiral superconductivity, two-component nematic superconductivity, topological surface superconductivity and enigmatic magnetic memory. A widely proposed starting point to understand such a mysterious heterostructure requires strong electronic correlation, presumably provided by 1T-TaS$_2$ layers with a narrow flat band near the Fermi level ($E_F$). Here, by using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we reveal the theoretically expected flat band near $E_F$ in the energy-momentum space for the first time. However, this flat band only exists on the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer with broken translational symmetry, but not on the 1T-TaS$_2$ layers buried in the bulk. These results directly challenge the foundation of the current theoretical paradigm. On the 1T-TaS$_2$ terminated surface layer, we further reveal a pseudogap and an anomalous doping effect. These phenomena and the dichotomy between surface and bulk layers also shed new light on the unusual coexistence of distinct electronic orders in this mysterious heterostructure.</description>

      <title>Growth optimization of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate high-temperature superconducting thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of ambient-pressure nickelate high-temperature superconductivity provides a new platform for probing the underlying superconducting mechanisms. However, the thermodynamic metastability of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates Lnn+1NinO3n+1 (Ln = lanthanide) presents significant challenges in achieving precise control over their structure and oxygen stoichiometry. This study establishes a systematic approach for growing phase-pure, high-quality Ln3Ni2O7 thin films on LaAlO3 and SrLaAlO4 substrates using gigantic-oxidative atomic-layer-by-layer epitaxy. The films grown under an ultrastrong oxidizing ozone atmosphere are superconducting without further post annealing. Specifically, the optimal Ln3Ni2O7/SrLaAlO4 superconducting film exhibits an onset transition temperature (Tc,onset) of 50 K. Four critical factors governing the crystalline quality and superconducting properties of Ln3Ni2O7 films are identified: 1) precise cation stoichiometric control suppresses secondary phase formation; 2) complete atomic layer-by-layer coverage coupled with 3) optimized interface reconstruction minimizes stacking faults; 4) accurate oxygen content regulation is essential for achieving a single superconducting transition and high Tc,onset. These findings provide valuable insights for the layer-by-layer epitaxy growth of diverse oxide high-temperature superconducting films.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric stress engineering of dense dislocations in brittle superconductors for strong vortex pinning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large lossless currents in high-temperature superconductors (HTS) critically rely on dense defects with suitable size and dimensionality to pin vortices, with dislocations being particularly effective due to their one-dimensional geometry to interact extensively with vortex lines. However, in non-metallic compounds such as HTS with rigid lattices, conventional deformation methods typically lead to catastrophic fracture rather than dislocation-mediated plasticity, making it a persistent challenge to introduce dislocations at high density. Here, we propose an asymmetric stress field strategy using extrusion to directly nucleate a high-density of dislocations in HTS by activating shear-driven lattice slip and twisting under superimposed hydrostatic compression. As demonstrated in iron-based superconductors (IBS), atomic displacements of nearly one angstrom trigger the formation of tilted dislocation lines with a density approaching that of metals. With further structural refinement, these dislocations serve as strong pinning centers that lead to a fivefold enhancement in the current-carrying capacity of IBS at 33 T, along with low anisotropy and a large irreversibility field. This work not only establishes a scalable route to engineer pinning landscapes in HTS, but also offers a generalizable framework for manipulating dislocation structures in rigid crystalline systems.</description>

      <title>Hunting for superconductivity in doped triangular lattice Kitaev magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by exploring correlated metals with frustrating bond-dependent exchange interactions, we study hole and electron doped Kitaev Mott insulators on the triangular lattice. Using homogeneous parton mean field theory, we find that the stripe antiferromagnetic (AFM) order for Kitaev coupling $K&gt;0$ and the ferromagnetic (FM) order for $K&lt;0$, both vanish at sufficiently large doping, beyond which we find regimes with chiral $d\pm i d$ singlet pairing and $p\pm ip$ triplet pairing respectively. Our tensor network computations however reveal that the superconducting correlations are strongly suppressed; while FM order stubbornly persists for the doped $K&lt;0$ model, the doped $K&gt;0$ model features emergent spin-charge modulated stripe orders. At higher hole doping for $K &gt; 0$, where AFM order is more strongly suppressed than for the electron doped case, incorporating a sufficiently strong nearest-neighbor attraction yields evidence for singlet $d$-wave superconductivity with Luttinger parameter $K_{\rm sc} &lt; 1$. Our work sets the stage for a broader exploration of doping effects in triangular lattice magnets such as NaRuO$_2$ which feature bond-dependent exchange interactions.</description>

Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW), a symmetry-breaking collective phenomenon in condensed matter systems, exhibits periodic modulations of electron density coupled with lattice distortions, where the lattice plays a critical role via electron-phonon coupling. In transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) 1T-TaS2/TaSe2, experiments reveal rich temperature- and pressure-dependent CDW phase behaviors, along with metastable CDW states induced by ultrafast optical excitation. Nevertheless, the underlying mechanisms governing thermal/pressure-driven transitions and particularly the microscopic evolution of CDW phases remain incompletely understood. Here, we perform first-principles anharmonic phonon calculations and machine-learning force-field molecular dynamics at finite temperatures/pressures to investigate the CDW transitions in 1T-TaS2/TaSe2. The calculated CDW transition temperature TCDW and critical pressure Pc are in quantitative agreement with experimental values. Our results demonstrate that the melting of CDW originates from phonon anharmonicity, with ionic fluctuations dominating the transition dynamics. We observe the microscopic evolution of CDW under varying temperature/pressure, revealing an ultrafast nucleation process of CDW (~3 ps). Our results emphasize the essential role of phonon anharmonicity in elucidating CDW transition mechanisms underlying, and advance fundamental understanding of CDW-related phenomena in TMDs.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the adiabatic limit in ballistic multiterminal Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on multiterminal Josephson junctions (MJJs) that probe different ranges of the size and bias voltage parameters, we introduce a two-dimensional (2D) cross-over diagram to map the relationship between device dimension (x-axis) and bias voltage (y-axis). This cross-over diagram conveniently separates the different physical regimes of the devices. This framework is used to explore the regime of increasing bias voltage in large-scale devices near the x-axis, where the electrochemical potential becomes comparable to the 1D energy level spacing. In a perfect waveguide geometry, we find that the relative number of quantum-correlated pairs formed by colliding Floquet-Kulik levels is equal to the inverse of the number of transverse channels, due to the number of conserved quantities equal to the number of channels. This observation motivates a model for the intermediate regime in which the ballistic central two-dimensional normal metal is treated as a continuum under the adiabatic approximation, while Andreev modes propagate in a background of voltage- and flux-tunable nonequilibrium electronic populations. The model predicts characteristic voltage scales that govern the mesoscopic oscillations of the critical current, and these scales are at the crossroads of interpreting experiments in all sectors of the MJJs: quartets, topology, and Floquet theory.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in bilayer nickelates: Impact of quasi-quantum metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17668v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently discovered high-$T_c$ superconductivity in thin-film bilayer nickelates La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under ambient pressure has attracted great interest. Non-Fermi-liquid transport behaviors, such as $T$-linear resistivity and positive Hall coefficient increasing at low temperatures, have been reported in this system. In this study, we analyze the non-Fermi-liquid transport phenomena in the thin-film bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using a multiorbital tight-binding model. In La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, the orbital-selective cold spots composed of Ni $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital emerge since the spin fluctuations cause stronger quasi-particle damping $\gamma$ in the Ni $d_{z^2}$ orbital. Notably, in the present study, we derive a rigorous formula for the Hall coefficient $R_H$ incorporating the $\gamma$ in the quasi-quantum metric (qQM) term. We discover that the $T$-dependence of $\gamma$ in the qQM term is important in determining $R_H$, and that the qQM term is inevitably enhanced by the nearly degenerate bands at the orbital-selective cold spots located around $(\pi/4,\pi/4)$. Moreover, the qQM term plays an essential role in describing the Nernst coefficient and other transport phenomena involving the second derivative velocity $v^{\mu\nu}$. La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ provides a novel platform for exploring the physics of the qQM.</description>

      <title>Ab initio study of anomalous temperature dependence of resistivity in V-Al alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$ is a representative example of highly resistive metallic alloys exhibiting a crossover to a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity (TCR), known as the Mooij correlation. Despite numerous proposals to explain this anomalous behavior,none have provided a satisfactory quantitative explanation thus far. In this work, we calculate the electrical conductivity using an ab initio methodology that combines the Kubo-Greenwood formalism with the coherent potential approximation (CPA). The temperature dependence of the conductivity is obtained within a CPA-based model of thermal atomic vibrations. Using this approach, we observe the crossover to the negative TCR behavior in V$_{1-x}$Al$_x$, with the temperature coefficient following the Mooij correlation, which matches experimental observations in the intermediate-to-high temperature range.Analysis of the results allows us to clearly identify a non-Boltzmann contribution responsible for this behavior and describe it as a function of temperature and composition.</description>

      <title>Directional driving of vortex lines with oscillating magnetic field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09321v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possibility of driving vortex lines with an oscillating magnetic field could be useful in many applications. For example, it can be used for the removal of undesired trapped flux from contactless elements of superconducting devices. We investigate the dynamics of vortex lines in a superconducting film with a ratchet thickness profile driven by an oscillating magnetic field applied parallel to the film. We numerically simulate the dynamics of a single flux line modeled as an elastic string with a variable length. We explore the behavior for different frequencies and amplitudes of the oscillating magnetic field and find several dynamic regimes. For moderate frequencies, the average velocity is finite only within specific amplitude ranges. A notable feature is the presence of extended velocity plateaus, which correspond to regimes when the line moves by integer multiples of the spatial period $w$ during integer multiples of the time period $T$. The transitions to these plateau states are rather steep, especially at low frequencies. The plateau at velocity $w/T$ dominates at intermediate frequencies but vanishes at high frequencies. The onset field amplitude of finite velocity nonmonotonically depends on the frequency and passes through a minimum at a certain frequency value. At low frequencies, the velocity exceeds $w/T$ and progressively increases with the amplitude. These findings provide valuable insights into the dynamic behavior of vortex lines driven by oscillating magnetic field in patterned superconducting films, offering potential pathways for controlling the magnetic flux in superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Lattice Quantum Geometry Controlling 118 K Multigap Superconductivity in Heavily Overdoped CuBa2Ca3Cu4O10+d</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13796v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchrotron X-ray diffraction has been used to study the thermal structure evolution in CuBa2Ca3Cu4O10+d (Cu1234), a superconductor which exhibits a high critical temperature (Tc 118 K), high critical current density and large upper critical magnetic field. The lattice geometry at nanoscale of this cuprate belongs to the class of natural heterostructures at atomic limit like the artificial high Tc superlattices made of interface space charge in Mott insulator units intercalated by metal units. Temperature-dependent lattice parameters reveal a distinct structural transition at TC characterized by a drop of the c-axis and in plane Cu-O negative thermal expansion below TC. These results provide clear evidence of lattice reorganization associated with the chemical potential changes due to the opening of multiple superconducting gaps. Additionally, evidence for oxygen defects rearrangement is observed at temperatures above 200 K. We construct a phase diagram correlating temperature, the c/a axis ratio, and in plane Cu-O strain, identifying regions associated with gaps opening and oxygen rearrangement. These findings provide new insights into how lattice geometry control superconductivity to inform the material design of advanced nanoscale superconducting artificial quantum heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Quantized resonant tunneling effect in Josephson junctions with ferromagnetic bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20366v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the Josephson effect in one-dimensional SF$_1$F$_2$S junctions, which consist of conventional s-wave superconductors (S) connected by two ferromagnetic layers (F$_1$ and F$_2$). At low temperatures, the potential barrier at the F$_1$/F$_2$ interface can induce a quantized resonant tunneling effect. This effect not only modifies the amplitude of the critical current but also affects the phase of the Josephson current. As the exchange fields ($h_1$, $h_2$) and thicknesses ($d_1$, $d_2$) of the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers vary, the critical current displays periodic resonance peaks. These peaks occur under the quantization conditions $Q_{1(2)} d_{1(2)} = \left(n_{1(2)} + 1/2\right) \pi$, where $Q_{1(2)} = 2h_{1(2)}/(\hbar v_F)$ is the center-of-mass momentum carried by Cooper pairs, with $v_F$ being the Fermi velocity, and $n_{1(2)} = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$. It can be inferred that the potential barrier suppresses the transport of spin-singlet pairs while allowing spin-triplet pairs with zero spin projection along the magnetization axis to pass through. As these spin-triplet pairs traverse the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers, the total phase they acquire determines the ground state of the Josephson junction. At the resonance peaks, the Josephson current primarily arises from the first harmonic in both the parallel and antiparallel magnetization configurations. However, in perpendicular configurations, the second harmonic becomes more significant. In scenarios where both ferromagnetic layers have identical exchange fields and thicknesses, the potential barrier selectively suppresses the current in the 0-state while allowing it to persist in the $\pi$-state for parallel configurations. Conversely, in antiparallel configurations, the current in the 0-state is consistently preserved.</description>
