      <title>The von Neumann algebraic quantum group $\mathrm{SU}_q(1,1)\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$ and the DSSYK model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The double-scaling limit of the SYK (DSSYK) model is known to possess an underlying $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(1,1))$ quantum group symmetry. In this paper, we provide, for the first time, a von Neumann algebraic quantum group-theoretical description of the degrees of freedom and the dynamics of the DSSYK model. In particular, we construct the operator-algebraic quantum Gauss decomposition for the von Neumann algebraic quantum group $\mathrm{SU}_q(1,1)\rtimes \mathbb{Z}_2$, i.e. the $q$-deformation of the normaliser of $\mathrm{SU}(1,1)$ in $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$, and derive the Casimir action on its quantum homogeneous spaces. We then show that the dynamics on quantum AdS$_{2,q}$ space reduces to that of the DSSYK model. Furthermore, we argue that the extension of the global symmetry group to its normaliser is not only necessary for a consistent definition of the locally compact quantum group, but that, moreover, the reduction to the DSSYK model works exclusively at the level of the normaliser. The von Neumann algebraic description is shown to give a natural restriction on the allowed quantised coordinates, elegantly ensuring length positivity and non-negative integer chord numbers. Lastly, we make remarks on the correlation function related to the strange series representation, which is argued to interpolate between the AdS and dS regions of our $q$-homogeneous space.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics of Multi-Species Driven Diffusive Systems with Open Boundaries: A Two-Tasep Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this short note, we review a recently developed method for analysing multi-component driven diffusive systems with open boundaries. The approach generalises the extremal-current principle known for single-component models and is based on solving the Riemann problem for the corresponding hydrodynamic equations. As a case study, we focus on a two-species exclusion process on a lattice (Two-TASEP), where two types of particles move in opposite directions with two arbitrary rates and exchange positions upon encounter with a third rate. Despite its simplicity, this toy model effectively captures the key features of multi-species driven diffusive systems, including phase separation phenomena. This allows us to illustrate the critical role played by the underlying Riemann invariants in determining the system's macroscopic behavior.</description>

      <title>Wildfire Propagation Modeling using Satellite-Derived Parameters and Generalized Elliptical Frames</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wildfires pose significant threats to ecosystems and communities, yet accurately modeling fire spread remains challenging, particularly in regions where environmental and fuel data are scarce or unavailable. This study introduces an innovative conceptual and methodological framework for simulating wildfire propagation and estimating the rate of spread using a hybrid geometric and data-driven approach that relies exclusively on multi-source satellite observations. The framework integrates thermal fire-front detections, atmospheric conditions, and vegetation indices using two complementary geometric modeling strategies. The first strategy applies the Huygens principle, where generalized elliptical frames are expanded locally at every point along the fire perimeter, and their combined envelope forms the evolving wavefront. This method is best suited for situations in which environmental variables are available and can be incorporated to refine the anisotropic spread function. The second strategy relies solely on the generalized elliptical frames themselves; for each time step, an elliptical frame is constructed from the inferred head and back rates of spread and wind, and the burned area is obtained by enclosing the region determined by these curves. Together, these two methods provide a flexible toolkit that adapts to both data-rich and data-limited conditions while retaining a unified geometric interpretation of wildfire spread. To demonstrate the applicability of the method, we present a case study based on the Eaton Fire, January 2025, using publicly available multi-day satellite imagery. Despite the absence of complete operational datasets for that event, the model driven only by satellite-derived parameters reproduces key qualitative features of the observed propagation pattern, underscoring the flexibility and robustness of the proposed approach in data-limited contexts.</description>

      <title>Geometric Origin of Lepton Anomalous Magnetic Moments: A Dimensionless Framework from Primitive Triangle Families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a phenomenological geometric framework deriving the anomalous magnetic moments of leptons from a single dimensionless constant V0 = 0.658944. This value emerges as a geometric attractor identified from exactly 18 primitive triangle families, whose completeness is supported by Diophantine constraints and extensive computational searches. The methodology connects three classical mathematical frameworks: De Moivre s theorem (1707), Chebyshev polynomials (1854), and results on the finiteness of integral points. Extended searches expanding the parameter space by a factor of 15 yield no new families, confirming saturation. The constant V0 connects to the Koide formula through Delta = 2/3 - V0 and approximates cos(13*pi/48) to 0.06 percent, suggesting links to cyclotomic fields. Using only dimensionless quantities, we obtain the electron anomaly ae with precision 0.15 ppb, the muon anomaly a_mu with 17 ppb, and the tau anomaly a_tau with 3.4 ppm. The framework is phenomenological and does not claim a derivation from quantum field theory, but its mathematical constraints yield testable predictions for future precision measurements.</description>

      <title>The Radon Transform-Based Sampling Methods for Biharmonic Sources from the Scattered Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents three quantitative sampling methods for reconstructing extended sources of the biharmonic wave equation using scattered field data. The first method employs an indicator function that solely relies on scattered fields $ u^s$ measured on a single circle, eliminating the need for Laplacian or derivative data. Its theoretical foundation lies in an explicit formula for the source function, which also serves as a constructive proof of uniqueness. To improve computational efficiency, we introduce a simplified double integral formula for the source function, at the cost of requiring additional measurements $\Delta u^s$. This advancement motivates the second indicator function, which outperforms the first method in both computational speed and reconstruction accuracy. The third indicator function is proposed to reconstruct the support boundary of extended sources from the scattered fields $ u^s$ at a finite number of sensors. By analyzing singularities induced by the source boundary, we establish the uniqueness of annulus and polygon-shaped sources. A key characteristic of the first and third indicator functions is their link between scattered fields and the Radon transform of the source function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed sampling methods achieve high-resolution imaging of the source support or the source function itself.</description>

      <title>Algebraic approach to the inverse spectral problem for rational matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstruction of an $n\times n$ matrix with coefficients depending rationally on $x\in \mathbb P^1$ from the data of: (a) its characteristic polynomial and (b) a line bundle of degree $g+n-1$, with $g$ the geometric genus of the spectral curve, represented by a choice of $g+n+1$ points forming a (non-positive) divisor of the given degree.
  We thus provide a reconstruction formula that does not involve transcendental functions; this includes formulas for the spectral projectors and for the change of line bundle, thus integrating the isospectral flows.
  The formula is a single residue formula which depends rationally on the coordinates of the points involved, the coefficients of the spectral curve, and the position of the finite poles of $L$. We also discuss the canonical bi-differential associated with the Lax matrix and its relationship with other bi-differentials that appear in Topological Recursion and integrable systems.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Projective Collapse and Sharp Distortion Bounds for Products of Positive Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce an elementary framework that captures the mechanism driving the alignment of rows and columns in products of positive matrices. All worst-case misalignment occurs already in dimension two, leading to an explicit collapse principle and a sharp nonlinear bound for finite products. The proof avoids Hilbert-metric and cone-theoretic techniques, relying instead on basic calculus. In the Hilbert metric, the classical Birkhoff-Bushell contraction captures only the linearized asymptotic regime, whereas our nonlinear envelope function gives the exact worst-case behavior for finite products.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces differential-geometric methods to study $n$-dimensional locally conformally flat spaces as submanifolds in $\mathbb{R}^{n+2}$. We derive explicit formulas relating intrinsic and ambient differential-geometric objects, including curvature tensors, the codifferential and laplacian operators. We apply this approach to Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) spaces using newfound embedding formulas, obtaining new and simplified expressions for the photon propagator in four dimensions.</description>

      <title>Alternatives of entanglement depth and metrological entanglement criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15350v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We work out the general theory of one-parameter families of partial entanglement properties and the resulting entanglement depth-like quantities. Special cases of these are the depth of partitionability, the depth of producibility (or simply entanglement depth) and the depth of stretchability, which are based on one-parameter families of partial entanglement properties known earlier. We also construct some further physically meaningful properties, for instance the squareability, the toughness, the degree of freedom, and also several ones of entropic motivation. Metrological multipartite entanglement criteria with the quantum Fisher information fit naturally into this framework. Here we formulate these for the depth of squareability, which therefore turns out to be the natural choice, leading to stronger bounds than the usual entanglement depth. Namely, the quantum Fisher information turns out to provide a lower bound not only on the maximal size of entangled subsystems, but also on the average size of entangled subsystems for a random choice of elementary subsystems. We also formulate criteria with convex quantities for both cases, which are much stronger than the original ones. In particular, the quantum Fisher information puts a lower bound on the average size of entangled subsystems. We also argue that one-parameter partial entanglement properties, which carry entropic meaning, are more suitable for the purpose of defining metrological bounds.</description>

      <title>The three kinds of three-qubit entanglement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.07617v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an important missing piece in the entanglement theory of pure three-qubit states, which is a polynomial measure of W-entanglement, working in parallel to the three-tangle, which is a polynomial measure of GHZ-entanglement, and to the bipartite concurrence, which is a polynomial measure of bipartite entanglement. We also show that these entanglement measures are ordered, the bipartite measure is larger than the W measure, which is larger than the GHZ measure. It is meaningful then to consider these three types of three-qubit entanglement, which are also ordered, bipartite is weaker than W, which is weaker than GHZ, in parallel to the order of the three equivalence classes of entangled three-qubit states.</description>

      <title>The meaning of "Big Bang"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: What does ``Big Bang'' actually mean? What was the origin of these two words? It has often been said that the expression ``Big Bang'' began as an insult. Even if this were true, it would be just an irrelevant part of the whole issue. There are many more aspects hidden under this name, and which are seldom explained. They will be discussed in this work. In order to frame the analysis, help will be sought from the highly authoritative voices of two exceptional writers: William Shakespeare and Umberto Eco. Both Shakespeare and Eco have explored the tension existing between words and the realities they name. With the conclusion that names are, in general, just labels, simple stickers put to identify things. And this includes those given to great theorems or spectacular discoveries. Not even ``Pythagoras' theorem'' was discovered by Pythagoras, as is now well-known. Stigler's law of eponymy is recalled to further substantiate those statements. These points will be at the heart of the investigation carried out here, concerning the very important concept of ``Big Bang''. Everybody thinks to know what ``the Big Bang'' is, but only very few do know it, in fact. When Fred Hoyle first pronounced these two words together, on a BBC radio program, listeners were actually left with the false image that Hoyle was trying to destroy. That is, the tremendous explosion of Lema\^itre's primeval atom (or cosmic egg), which scattered all its enormous matter and energy content throughout the rest of the Universe. This image is absolutely wrong! As will be concluded, today the label ``Big Bang'' is used in several different contexts: (a) the Big Bang Singularity; (b) as the equivalent of cosmic inflation; (c) speaking of the Big Bang cosmological model; (d) to name a very popular TV program; and more.</description>

      <title>A Unified Linear Algebraic Framework for Physical Models and Generalized Contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a bottom-up, statistics-first framework in which the full probabilistic content of an operational theory is encoded in its matrix of conditional outcome probabilities of events (COPE). Within this setting, five model classes (preGPTs, GPTs, quasiprobabilistic, ontological, and noncontextual ontological) are unified as constrained factorizations of the COPE matrix. We identify equirank factorizations as the structural core of GPTs and noncontextual ontological models and establish their relation to tomographic completeness. This yields a simple, model-agnostic criterion for noncontextuality: an operational theory admits a noncontextual ontological model if and only if its COPE matrix admits an equirank nonnegative matrix factorization (ENMF). Failure of the equirank condition in all ontological models therefore establishes contextuality. We operationalize rank separation via two complementary methods provided by the linear-algebraic framework. First, we use ENMF to interpret noncontextual ontological models as nested polytopes. This allows us to establish that the boxworld operational theory is ontologically contextual. Second, we apply techniques from discrete mathematics to derive a lower bound on the ontological dimensionality of COPE matrices exhibiting sparsity patterns, and use this bound to establish a new proof that a discrete version of qubit theory exhibits ontological contextuality. By reframing contextuality as a problem in matrix analysis, our work provides a unified structure for its systematic study and opens new avenues for exploring nonclassical resources.</description>

      <title>Towards a Mathematical Theory of Adaptive Memory: From Time-Varying to Responsive Fractional Brownian Motion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10057v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work develops a comprehensive mathematical theory for a class of stochastic processes whose local regularity adapts dynamically in response to their own state. We first introduce and rigorously analyze a time-varying fractional Brownian motion (TV-fBm) with a deterministic, H\"older-continuous Hurst exponent function. Key properties are established, including its exact variance scaling law, precise local increment asymptotics, local non-determinism, large deviation asymptotics for its increments, and a covariance structure that admits a closed-form hypergeometric representation. We then define a novel class of processes termed Responsive Fractional Brownian Motion (RfBm). Here,the Hurst exponent is governed by a Lipschitz-H\"older response function depending on the process state itself, creating an intrinsic feedback mechanism between state and memory. We establish the well-posedness of this definition, prove pathwise H\"older regularity of the induced instantaneous scaling exponent, and analyze associated cumulative memory processes along with their asymptotic convergence. The mathematical structure of RfBm naturally gives rise to a continuous-time, pathwise attention mechanism. We show that its kernel induces a well-defined attention weight distribution, derive fundamental bounds for these weights, and quantify the stability of attentional allocation through residence measures and volatility functionals. This work develops a stochastic-process-theoretic framework for concepts central to adaptive memory and content-sensitive information processing, offering a mathematically grounded perspective that may complement existing empirical approaches.</description>

In our setting, the s-embedding approximates a maximal surface in the Minkowski space $\mathbb R^{2,1}$, an `exact' criticality condition identified in arXiv:2006.14559, which is stronger than the percolation-theoretic `near-critical' setup studied in, e.g., arXiv:2309.08470. The proof relies on a careful discretisation of the Laplace-Beltrami operator on the s-embedding, which is crucial in identifying the limit of the martingale observable.</description>

      <title>Diagonal boundary conditions in critical loop models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In critical loop models, we define diagonal boundaries as boundaries that couple to diagonal fields only. Using analytic bootstrap methods, we show that diagonal boundaries are characterised by one complex parameter, analogous to the boundary cosmological constant in Liouville theory. We determine disc 1-point functions, and write an explicit formula for disc 2-point functions as infinite combinations of conformal blocks. For a discrete subset of values of the boundary parameter, the boundary spectrum becomes discrete, and made of degenerate representations. In such cases, we check our results by numerically bootstrapping disc 2-point functions. We sketch the interpretation of diagonal and non-diagonal boundaries in lattice loop models. In particular, a loop can neither end on a diagonal boundary, nor change weight when it touches it. In bulk-to-boundary OPEs, numbers of legs can be conserved, or increase by even numbers.</description>

      <title>On Simplest Kochen-Specker Sets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10483v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In Phys. Rev. Lett. 135, 190203 (2025) a discovery of the simplest 3D contextual set with 33 vertices, 50 bases, and 14 complete bases is claimed. In this paper, we show that it was previously generated in Quantum 7, 953 (2023) and analyze the meaning, origin, and significance of the simplest contextual sets in any dimension. In particular, we prove that there is no ground to consider the aforementioned set as fundamental since there are many 3D contextual sets with a smaller number of complete bases. We also show that automatic generation of contextual sets from basic vector components automatically yields all known minimal contextual sets of any kind in any dimension and therefore also the aforementioned set in no CPU-time. In the end, we discuss varieties of contextual sets, in particular Kochen-Specker (KS), extended KS, and non-KS sets as well as ambiguities in their definitions.</description>

      <title>Fano and Reflexive Polytopes from Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify the Fano and reflexive polytopes that arise from quasi-finite Feynman integrals. These polytopes appear as scaled Minkowski sums of the Newton polytopes associated with the Symanzik graph polynomials. For one-loop graphs and multiloop sunset graphs, we identify the Fano and reflexive cases by computing the number of interior points from the associated bivariate Ehrhart polynomials. More generally, we utilize the properties of Symanzik polynomials and their symmetries to conduct a direct search over all Feynman graphs in generic kinematics with up to ten edges and nine loops. We find that such cases are remarkably sparse: for example, we find only two two-dimensional reflexive polytopes, three three-dimensional reflexive polytopes, and four three-dimensional Fano polytopes. We also reveal a surprising feature of one-loop $N$-gon integrals in higher dimensions: their associated reflexive polytopes encode degenerate Calabi--Yau $(N-2)$-folds. We further analyze the geometric structures encoded by these polytopes and exhibit explicit connections with del Pezzo surfaces, $K3$ surfaces, and Calabi--Yau threefolds. Since reflexive polytopes naturally correspond to Calabi--Yau varieties, our classification demonstrates that quasi-finite Feynman integrals, with reflexive polytopes, are intrinsically linked to Calabi--Yau period integrals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10519v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a continuum theory of multicritical dynamical triangulations and causal dynamical triangulations in two-dimensional quantum gravity from the perspective of the Chekhov-Eynard-Orantin topological recursion. The former model lacks a causal time direction and is governed by the two-reduced $W^{(3)}$ algebra, whereas the latter model possesses a causal time direction and is governed by the full $W^{(3)}$ algebra. We show that the topological recursion solves the Schwinger-Dyson equations for both models, and we explicitly compute several amplitudes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove local convergence of the $t$-PNG model with zero boundary to the stationary $t$-PNG model, confirming a recent conjecture of Drillick and Lin (2024). The stationary $t$-PNG model is the one with both left and bottom boundaries of Poisson nucleations with rate parameters $\frac{1}{\lambda(1-t)}$ and $\lambda$, respectively, for some $\lambda&gt;0$. In the proof, we consider the trajectories of certain second class particles via a basic monotone coupling of three $t$-PNG processes, and adapt microscopic concavity ideas used in particle models (e.g., Bal\'azs and Sepp\"al\"ainen (2009)), as well as blocking measure bounds like in Ferrari, Kipnis and Saada (1991).</description>

Abstract: We prove the holding of chaos in the sense of Li-Yorke for a family of four-dimensional discrete dynamical systems that are naturally associated to ODEs systems describing coupled oscillators subject to an external nonconservative force, also giving an example of a discrete map that is Li-Yorke chaotic but not topologically transitive. Analytical results are generalized to a modular definition of the problem and to a system of nonlinear oscillators described by polynomial potentials in one coordinate. We perform numerical simulations looking for a strange attractor of the system; furthermore, we present the bifurcation diagram and perform a bifurcation analysis of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present analytical and numerical results on integrability and transition to chaotic motion for a generalized Ziegler pendulum, a double pendulum subject to an angular elastic potential and a follower force. Several variants of the original dynamical system, including the presence of gravity and friction, are considered, in order to analyze whether the integrable cases are preserved or not in presence of further external forces, both potential and non-potential. Particular attention is devoted to the presence of dissipative forces, that are analyzed in two different formulations. Furthermore, a study of the discrete version is performed. The analysis of periodic points, that is presented up to period 3, suggests that the discrete map associated to the dynamical system has not dense sets of periodic points, so that the map would not be chaotic in the sense of Devaney for a choice of the parameters that corresponds to a general case of chaotic motion for the original system.</description>

      <title>Bessel and Dunkl processes with drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For some discrete parameters $k\ge0$, multivariate (Dunkl-)Bessel processes on Weyl chambers $C$ associated with root systems appear as projections of Brownian motions without drift on Euclidean spaces $V$, and the associated transition densities can be described in terms of multivariate Bessel functions; the most prominent examples are Dyson Brownian motions. The projections of Brownian motions on $V$ with drifts are also Feller diffusions on $C$, and their transition densities and their generators can be again described via these Bessel functions. These processes are called Bessel processes with drifts. In this paper we construct these Bessel processes processes with drift for arbitrary root systems and parameters $k\ge 0$. Moreover, this construction works also for Dunkl processes. We study some features of these processes with drift like their radial parts, a Girsanov theorem, moments and associated martingales, strong laws of large numbers, and central limit theorems.</description>

      <title>The $\ell^p$-boundedness of wave operators for the fourth order Schr\"{o}dinger operators on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the $\ell^p$ boundedness of wave operators $W_\pm(H,\Delta^2)$ associated with discrete fourth-order Schr\"odinger operators $H = \Delta^2 + V$ on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}$, where $$(\Delta\phi)(n)=\phi(n+1)+\phi(n-1)-2\phi(n),\quad n\in\mathbb{Z},$$ and $V(n)$ is a real-valued potential on $\mathbb{Z}$. Under suitable decay assumptions on $V$ (depending on the types of zero resonance of $H$), we show that the wave operators $W_{\pm}(H, \Delta^2)$ are bounded on $\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})$ for all $1 &lt; p &lt; \infty$: $$ \|W_{\pm}(H, \Delta^2) f\|_{\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})} \lesssim \|f\|_{\ell^p(\mathbb{Z})}. $$ In particular, if both thresholds $0$ and $16$ are regular points of $H$, we prove that $W_{\pm}(H, \Delta^2)$ are neither bounded on the endpoint space $\ell^1(\mathbb{Z})$ nor on $\ell^\infty(\mathbb{Z})$. We remark that the proof of these bounds relies fundamentally on the asymptotic expansions of the resolvent of $H$ near the thresholds $0$ and $16$, and on the theory of {\it discrete singular integrals} on the lattice.
  As applications, we derive the following sharp $\ell^p-\ell^{p'}$ decay estimates for solutions to the discrete beam equation with a parameter $a\in \mathbb{R}$ on the lattice $\mathbb{Z}$: $$ \|{\rm cos}(t\sqrt {H+a^2})P_{ac}(H)\|_{\ell^p\rightarrow\ell^{p'}}+\left\|\frac{{\rm sin}(t\sqrt {H+a^2})}{t\sqrt {H+a^2}}P_{ac}(H)\right\|_{\ell^p\rightarrow\ell^{p'}}\lesssim|t|^{-\frac{1}{3}(\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{p'})},\quad t\neq0, $$ where $1&lt;p\le 2$, ${p'}$ is the conjugated index of $p$ and $P_{ac}(H)$ denotes the spectral projection onto the absolutely continuous spectrum space of $H$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vafa and Warner observed that the Landau-Ginzburg model associated to the potential $E_6$ (resp. $E_8$) is a product of two other models, associated to the potentials $A_2$ and $ A_3$ (resp. $A_2 $ and $ A_4$). We translate this along the Landau-Ginzburg / Conformal Field Theory correspondence to a conjecture about the unitary minimal quotients $M_d$ of the $N=2$ superconformal algebra of central charge $c_d=3-\frac{6}{d}$: there should be a conformal embedding $M_{12}\hookrightarrow M_{3} \otimes M_4$ (resp. $M_{30}\hookrightarrow M_{3} \otimes M_5$) that exhibits the product as Ostrik's $E_6$ (resp. $E_8$) algebra in the $\mathrm{Rep}(su(2)_{10})$ (resp. $\mathrm{Rep}(su(2)_{28})$) factor of the NS-sector of $\mathrm{Rep}(M_{12})$ (resp. $\mathrm{Rep}(M_{30})$). We motivate, formulate, and prove this conjecture.</description>

      <title>A tree bijection for cusp-less planar hyperbolic surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a tree bijection has been found for planar hyperbolic surfaces, which allows for an easy computation of the Weil--Petersson volumes, and opens the path to get distance statistic on random hyperbolic surfaces and to find scaling limits when the number of boundaries becomes large. Crucially, this tree bijection requires the hyperbolic surface to have at least one cusp as origin, from which point distances are measured. In this paper we will extend this tree bijection, such that having a cusp is no longer required. We will first extend the bijection to half-tight cylinders. Since general planar hyperbolic surfaces can be naturally decomposed in two half-tight cylinders, this general case is also covered. In the half-tight cylinder the distances to the origin are replaced by the so-called Busemann function. This Busemann function is not well-defined on the surface, but it is on the cylinder cover.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Melnikov method is applied to a class of generalized Ziegler pendulums. We find an analytical form for the separatrix of the system in terms of Jacobian elliptic integrals, holding for a large class of initial conditions and parameters. By working in Duffing approximation, we apply the Melnikov method to the original Ziegler system, showing that the first non-vanishing Melnikov integral appears in the second order. An explicit expression for the Melnikov integral is derived in the presence of a time-periodic external force and for a suitable choice of the parameters, as well as in the presence of a dissipative term acting on the lower rod of the pendulum. These results allow us to define fundamental relationships between the Melnikov integral and a proper control parameter that distinguishes between regular and chaotic orbits for the original dynamical system. Finally, in the appendix, we present proof of a conjecture concerning the non-validity of Devaney's chaoticity definition for a discrete map associated with the system.</description>

Abstract: We consider the ground states of the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation, which stand for radially symmetric and exponentially decaying solutions on the full space. We investigate their behaviors at both endpoint powers of the nonlinearity, up to some rescaling to infer non-trivial limits. One case corresponds to the limit towards a Gaussian function called Gausson, which is the ground state of the stationary logarithmic Schr{\"o}dinger equation. The other case, for dimension at least three, corresponds to the limit towards the Aubin-Talenti algebraic soliton. We prove strong convergence with explicit bounds for both cases, and provide detailed asymptotics. These theoretical results are illustrated with numerical approximations.</description>

      <title>$\Phi^4\_2$ theory limit of a many-body bosonic free energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the quantum Gibbs state of an interacting Bose gas on the 2D torus. We set temperature, chemical potential and coupling constant in a regime where classical field theory gives leading order asymptotics. In the same limit, the repulsive interaction potential is set to be short-range: it converges to a Dirac delta function with a rate depending polynomially on the other scaling parameters. We prove that the free-energy of the interacting Bose gas (counted relatively to the non-interacting one) converges to the free energy of the $\Phi^4\_2$ non-linear Schr{\"o}dinger-Gibbs measure, thereby revisiting recent results and streamlining proofs thereof. We combine the variational method of Lewin-Nam-Rougerie to connect, with controled error, the quantum free energy to a classical Hartree-Gibbs one with smeared non-linearity. The convergence of the latter to the $\Phi^4\_2$ free energy then follows from arguments of Fr{\"o}hlich-Knowles-Schlein-Sohinger. This derivation parallels recent results of Nam-Zhu-Zhu.</description>

      <title>On Quantum Modularity for Geometric 3-Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum modularity conjecture, first introduced by Don Zagier, is a general statement about a relation between $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ quantum invariants of links and 3-manifolds at roots of unity related by a modular transformation. In this note we formulate a strong version of the conjecture for Witten--Reshetikhin--Turaev invariants of closed geometric, not necessarily hyperbolic, 3-manifolds. This version in particular involves a geometrically distinguished $SL(2,\mathbb{C})$ flat connection (a generalization of the standard hyperbolic flat connection to other Thurston geometries) and has a statement about the integrality of coefficients appearing in the modular transformation formula. We prove that the conjecture holds for Brieskorn homology spheres and some other examples. We also comment on how the conjecture relates to a formal realization of the $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ quantum invariant at a general root of unity as a path integral in analytically continued $SU(2)$ Chern--Simons theory with a rational level.</description>

      <title>Spectral Theory of the Weighted Fourier Transform with respect to a Function in $\mathbb{R}^n$: Uncertainty Principle and Diffusion-Wave Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we generalize the weighted Fourier transform with respect to a function, originally proposed for the one-dimensional case in \cite{Dorrego}, to the $n$-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. We develop a comprehensive spectral theory on a weighted Hilbert space, establishing the Plancherel identity, the inversion formula, the convolution theorem, and a Heisenberg-type uncertainty principle depending on the geometric deformation. Furthermore, we utilize this framework to rigorously define the weighted fractional Laplacian with respect to a function, denoted by $(-\Delta_{\phi,\omega})^{s}$. Finally, we apply these tools to solve the generalized time-space fractional diffusion-wave equation, demonstrating that the fundamental solution can be expressed in terms of the Fox H-function, intrinsically related to the generalized $\omega$-Mellin transform introduced in \cite{Dorrego}. In this paper, we generalize the weighted Fourier transform with respect to a function, originally proposed for the one-dimensional case, to the n-dimensional Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$. We develop a comprehensive spectral theory on a weighted Hilbert space, establishing the Plancherel identity, the inversion formula, the convolution theorem, and a Heisenberg-type uncertainty principle depending on the geometric deformation. Furthermore, we utilize this framework to rigorously define the weighted fractional Laplacian with respect to a function, denoted by $(-\Delta_{\phi,\omega})^s$. Finally, we apply these tools to solve the generalized time-space fractional diffusion-wave equation involving the weighted Hilfer derivative. We demonstrate that the fundamental solution can be explicitly expressed in terms of the Fox H-function, revealing an intrinsic connection with the generalized Mellin transform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10897v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a quantitative observability inequality for the von Neumann equation on $\mathbb{R}^d$ in the crystal setting, uniform in small $\hbar$. Following the method of Golse and Paul (2022) proving this result in the non-crystal setting, the method relies on a stability argument between the quantum (von Neumann) and classical (Liouville) dynamics and uses an optimal transport-like pseudo-distance between quantum and classical densities. Our contribution yields in the adaptation of all the required tools to the periodic setting, relying on the Bloch decomposition, notions of periodic Schr\"odinger coherent state, periodic T\"oplitz operator and periodic Husimi densities.</description>

      <title>Anomalous scaling law for the two-dimensional Gaussian free field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10933v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the Gaussian free field $\varphi$ on $\mathbb{Z}^2$ at large spatial scales $N$ and give sharp bounds on the probability $\theta(a,N)$ that the radius of a finite cluster in the excursion set $\{\varphi \geq a\}$ on the corresponding metric graph is macroscopic. We prove a scaling law for this probability, by which $\theta(a,N)$ transitions from fractional logarithmic decay for near-critical parameters $(a,N)$ to polynomial decay in the off-critical regime. The transition occurs across a certain scaling window determined by a correlation length scale $\xi$, which is such that $\theta(a,N) \sim \theta(0,\xi)(\tfrac{N}{\xi})^{-\tau}$ for typical heights $a$ as $N/\xi$ diverges, with an explicit exponent $\tau$ that we identify in the process. This is in stark contrast with recent results from arXiv:2101.02200 and arXiv:2312.10030 in dimension three, where similar observables are shown to follow regular scaling laws, with polynomial decay at and near criticality, and rapid decay in ${N}/\xi$ away from it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.00451v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We review the discrete evolution problem and the corresponding solution as a discrete Dyson series in order to rigorously derive a generalized discrete version of the Magnus expansion. We also systematically derive the discrete analogue of the pre-Lie Magnus expansion and express the elements of the discrete Dyson series in terms of a tridendriform algebra binary operation. In the generic discrete case, extra significant terms that are absent in the continuous or the linear discrete case appear in both Dyson and Magnus expansions. Based on the rigorous discrete derivation key links between quantum algebras, tridendriform and pre-Lie algebras are then established. This is achieved by examining tensor realizations of quantum groups, such as the Yangian. We show that these realizations can be expressed in terms of tridendriform and pre-Lie algebras. The continuous limit as expected provides the corresponding non-local charges of the Yangian as members of the pre-Lie Magnus expansion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper initiates the study of the Einstein equation on homogeneous supermanifolds. First, we produce explicit curvature formulas for graded Riemannian metrics on these spaces. Next, we present a construction of homogeneous supermanifolds by means of Dynkin diagrams, resembling the construction of generalised flag manifolds in classical (non-super) theory. We describe the Einstein metrics on several classes of spaces obtained through this approach. Our results provide examples of compact homogeneous supermanifolds on which the Einstein equation has no solutions, discrete families of solutions, and continuous families of Ricci-flat solutions among invariant metrics. These examples demonstrate that the finiteness conjecture from classical homogeneous geometry fails on supermanifolds, and challenge the intuition furnished by Bochner's vanishing theorem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24294v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft solids with surface energy exhibit complex mechanical behavior, necessitating advanced constitutive models to capture the interplay between bulk and surface mechanics. This interplay has profound implications for material design and emerging technologies. In this work, we set up variational models for bulk-surface elasticity and explore a novel class of surface-polyconvex constitutive models that account for surface energy while ensuring the existence of minimizers. These models are implemented within a finite element framework and validated through benchmark problems and applications, including, e.g., the liquid bridge problem and the Rayleigh-Plateau instability, for which the surface energy plays the dominant role. The results demonstrate the ability of surface-polyconvex models to accurately capture surface-driven phenomena, establishing them as a powerful tool for advancing the mechanics of soft materials in both engineering and biological applications.</description>

The Poisson brackets for the monodromy matrix are calculated as well, thus providing Liouville integrability of the model.

      <description>arXiv:2510.00839v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the time evolution of weakly interacting Bose gases on a three-dimensional torus of arbitrary volume. The coupling constant is supposed to be inversely proportional to the density, which is considered to be large and independent of the particle number. We take into account a class of initial states exhibiting quasi-complete Bose-Einstein condensation. For each fixed time in a finite interval, we prove the convergence of the one-particle reduced density matrix towards the projection onto the normalised order parameter describing the condensate - evolving according to the Hartree equation - in the iterated limit where the volume (and therefore the particle number), and subsequently the density go to infinity. The rate of convergence depends only on the density and on the decay of both the expected number of particles and the energy of the initial quasi-vacuum state.</description>

Abstract: The complete optimal systems of subalgebras of all nonisomorphic three- and four-dimensional real Lie algebras are analyzed by the program \symbolie running in the computer algebra system \emph{Wolfram Mathematica}\texttrademark. The approach uses the definition of $p$-families of Lie subalgebras whose set can be partitioned by introducing a binary relation (reflexive and transitive, though not necessarily symmetric) induced by inner automorphisms of the Lie algebra. The results, produced in a few minutes by \symbolie, represent a good test for the program; in fact, except for minor differences that are discussed, the results confirm those given in 1977 in a paper by Patera and Winternitz.</description>

Abstract: In [Ann. Henri Poincar\'e, {\bf 22} (2021), 3199-3234], De Palma and Trevisan described a one-to-one correspondence between quantum couplings and quantum channels realizing transport between states. The aim of this short note is to demonstrate that taking the Petz recovery map for a given channel and initial state is precisely the counterpart of the swap transpose operation on couplings. That is, the swap transpose of the coupling $\Pi_{\Phi}$ corresponding to the channel $\Phi$ and initial state $\rho$ is the coupling $\Pi_{rec}$ corresponding to the Petz recovery map $\Phi_{rec}.$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2011.06947v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A non-Hermitian generalization of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model driven by a periodic external potential is investigated, and its topological features are explored. We find that the bi-orthonormal geometric phase acts as a topological index, well capturing the presence/absence of the zero modes. The model is observed to display trivial and non-trivial insulator phases and a topologically non-trivial M${\"o}$bius metallic phase. The driving field amplitude is shown to be a control parameter causing topological phase transitions in this model. While the system displays zero modes in the metallic phase apart from the non-trivial insulator phase, the metallic zero modes are not robust, as the ones found in the insulating phase. We further find that zero modes' energy converges slowly to zero as a function of the number of dimers in the M${\"o}$bius metallic phase compared to the non-trivial insulating phase.</description>

      <title>A Quasi-local, Functional Analytic Detection Method for Stationary Limit Surfaces of Black Hole Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.10962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.10962v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a quasi-local, functional analytic method to locate and invariantly characterize the stationary limit surfaces of black hole spacetimes with stationary regions. The method is based on ellipticity-hyperbolicity transitions of the Dirac, Klein-Gordon, Maxwell, and Fierz-Pauli Hamiltonians defined on spacelike hypersurfaces of such black hole spacetimes, which occur only at the locations of stationary limit surfaces and can be ascertained from the behaviors of the principal symbols of the Hamiltonians. Therefore, since it relates solely to the effects that stationary limit surfaces have on the time evolutions of the corresponding elementary fermions and bosons, this method is profoundly different from the usual detection procedures that employ either scalar polynomial curvature invariants or Cartan invariants, which, in contrast, make use of the local geometries of the underlying black hole spacetimes. As an application, we determine the locations of the stationary limit surfaces of the Kerr-Newman, Schwarzschild-de Sitter, and Taub-NUT black hole spacetimes. Finally, we show that for black hole spacetimes with static regions, our functional analytic method serves as a quasi-local event horizon detector and gives rise to relational concepts of event horizons and black hole entropy.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.14615v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a fixed-point iterative algorithm that computes the matrix projection with respect to the Bures distance on the set of positive definite matrices that are invariant under some symmetry. We prove that the fixed-point iteration algorithm converges exponentially fast to the optimal solution in the number of iterations. Moreover, it numerically shows fast convergence compared to the off-the-shelf semidefinite program solvers. Our algorithm, for the specific case of Bures-Wasserstein barycenter, recovers the fixed-point iterative algorithm originally introduced in (\'Alvarez-Esteban et al., 2016). Our proof is concise and relies solely on matrix inequalities. Finally, we discuss several applications of our algorithm in quantum resource theories and quantum Shannon theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03378v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Complex particle is a kind of bilocal particle having unexpected symmetry, which was proposed by the authour. In the present paper, we show that critical dimension of the complex particle in Minkowski spacetime is $D = 4$, while $D = 2, 4$ or $6$ are permitted in Euclid spacetime. The origin of the restriction to the dimension is the existence of tertiary constraint in the canonical theory, quantization of which leads to an eigenvalue equation having single-valued and bounded solutions only in particular dimension of spacetime.

      <title>Characterizing the support of semiclassical measures for higher-dimensional cat maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum cat maps are toy models in quantum chaos associated to hyperbolic symplectic matrices $A\in \operatorname{Sp}(2n,\mathbb{Z})$. The macroscopic limits of sequences of eigenfunctions of a quantum cat map are characterized by semiclassical measures on the torus $\mathbb{R}^{2n}/\mathbb{Z}^{2n}$. We show that if the characteristic polynomial of every power $A^k$ is irreducible over the rationals, then every semiclassical measure has full support. The proof uses an earlier strategy of Dyatlov-J\'ez\'equel [arXiv:2108.10463] and the higher-dimensional fractal uncertainty principle of Cohen [arXiv:2305.05022]. Our irreducibility condition is generically true, in fact we show that asymptotically for $100\%$ of matrices $A$, the Galois group of the characteristic polynomial of $A$ is $S_2 \wr S_n$.
  When the irreducibility condition does not hold, we show that a semiclassical measure cannot be supported on a finite union of parallel non-coisotropic subtori. On the other hand, we give examples of semiclassical measures supported on the union of two transversal symplectic subtori for $n=2$, inspired by the work of Faure-Nonnenmacher-De Bi\`evre [arXiv:nlin/0207060] in the case $n=1$. This is complementary to the examples by Kelmer [arXiv:math-ph/0510079] of semiclassical measures supported on a single coisotropic subtorus.</description>

      <title>Tight relations and equivalences between smooth relative entropies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12447v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise one-shot characterisation of operational tasks in classical and quantum information theory relies on different forms of smooth entropic quantities. A particularly important connection is between the hypothesis testing relative entropy and the smoothed max-relative entropy, which together govern many operational settings. We first strengthen this connection into a type of equivalence: we show that the hypothesis testing relative entropy is equivalent to a variant of the smooth max-relative entropy based on the information spectrum divergence, which can be alternatively understood as a measured smooth max-relative entropy. Furthermore, we improve a fundamental lemma due to Datta and Renner that connects the different variants of the smoothed max-relative entropy, introducing a modified proof technique based on matrix geometric means and a tightened gentle measurement lemma. We use the unveiled connections and tools to strictly improve on previously known one-shot bounds and duality relations between the smooth max-relative entropy and the hypothesis testing relative entropy, establishing provably tight bounds between them. We use these results to refine other divergence inequalities, in particular sharpening bounds that connect the max-relative entropy with R\'enyi divergences.</description>

      <title>Reinforced Loop Soup via Wilson's Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04503v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this note is twofold: first, we explain the relation between the isomorphism theorems in the context of vertex reinforced jump process discovered in [BHS19, BHS21] and the standard Markovian isomorphism theorems for Markovian jump processes; second, we introduce the vertex reinforced counterpart of the standard Poissonian loop soup developed by Le Jan [LJ10]. To this end, we propose an algorithm that can be viewed as a variant of Wilson's algorithm with reinforcement. We establish the isomorphism theorems for the erased loops and the random walk from this algorithm, and in particular provide a concrete construction of the reinforced loop soup via a random process with a reinforcement mechanism.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production in Non-Gaussian Active Matter: A Unified Fluctuation Theorem and Deep Learning Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06628v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for deriving entropy production rates (EPRs) in active matter systems driven by non-Gaussian active fluctuations. Employing the probability-flow equivalence technique, we rigorously obtain an entropy production (EP) decomposition formula. We demonstrate that the EP, $\Delta s_\mathrm{tot}$, satisfies a detailed fluctuation theorem, $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(\Sigma)/\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(-\Sigma)=e^{\Sigma}$, which holds for the distribution $\rho_{\mathcal{R}}(\Sigma)$ defined as the probability of observing a value $\Sigma$ of the quantity $\mathcal{R}\equiv \Delta s_\mathrm{tot}-B_\mathrm{act}$, where $B_\mathrm{act}$ is a path-dependent random variable associated with active fluctuations. Moreover, an integral fluctuation theorem, $\langle e^{- \mathcal{R} } \rangle = 1$, and the generalized second law of thermodynamics, $\langle \Delta s_\mathrm{tot} \rangle \ge \langle B_\mathrm{act} \rangle$, follow directly. Our results hold under steady-state conditions and can be straightforwardly extended to arbitrary initial states. In the limiting case where active fluctuations vanish, these theorems reduce to the established results of stochastic thermodynamics. Building on this theoretical foundation, we introduce a deep-learning-based methodology for efficiently computing the EP, utilizing the L\'{e}vy score we propose. To illustrate the validity of our approach, we apply it to two representative systems: a Brownian particle in a periodic active bath and an active polymer composed of an active Brownian cross-linker interacting with passive Brownian beads. Our work provides a unified framework for analyzing EP in active matter and offers practical computational tools for investigating complex nonequilibrium behavior.</description>

      <title>A Generalized False Vacuum Skyrme model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12235v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the False Vacuum Skyrme model for any simple compact Lie groups $G$ that leads to Hermitian symmetric spaces. The Skyrme field that in the original theory takes its values in $SU(2)$ Lie group, now takes its values in $G$, while the remaining fields correspond to the entries of a symmetric, positive, and invertible $\dim G \times \dim G$-dimensional matrix $h$. This model is also an extension of the generalized BPS Skyrme model. We prove that the global minima correspond to the $h$ fields being self-dual solutions of the generalized BPS Skyrme model, together with a particular field configuration for the Skyrme field that leads to a spherically symmetric topological charge density. As in the case of the original model, the minimization of the energy leads to the so-called reduced problem, defined in the context of false vacuum decay. This imposes a condition on the Skyrme field, which, if satisfied, makes the total energy of the global minima, as well as the main properties of the model, equivalent to those obtained for the $G=SU(2)$ case. We study this condition and its consequences within the generalized rational map ansatz and show how it can be satisfied for $G=SU(p+q)$, where $p$ and $q$ are positive integers, with the Hermitian symmetric spaces being $SU(p+q)/SU(p) \otimes SU(q) \otimes U(1)$. In such a case, the model is completely equivalent to the $G=SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model, independent of the values of $p$ and $q$. We also provide a numerical study of the baryon density, RMS radius, and binding energy per nucleon, which deepens the previous analysis conducted for the $SU(2)$ False Vacuum Skyrme model. Additionaly, in the case of $G = SU(3)$, we have studied the application of our model to the description of the binding energies and masses of the $\Lambda$-hypernuclei.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dynamical systems on networks, one assigns the dynamics to nodes, which are then coupled via links. This approach does not account for group interactions and dynamics on links and other higher dimensional structures. Higher-order network theory addresses this by considering variables defined on nodes, links, triangles, and higher-order simplices, called topological signals (or cochains). Moreover, topological signals of different dimensions can interact through the Dirac-Bianconi operator, which allows coupling between topological signals defined, for example, on nodes and links. Such interactions can induce various dynamical behaviors, for example, periodic oscillations. The oscillating system consists of topological signals on nodes and links whose dynamics are driven by the Dirac-Bianconi coupling, hence, which we call it Dirac-Bianconi driven oscillator. Using the phase reduction method, we obtain a phase description of this system and apply it to the study of synchronization between two such oscillators. This approach offers a way to analyze oscillatory behaviors in higher-order networks beyond the node-based paradigm, while providing a ductile modeling tool for node- and edge-signals.</description>

      <title>Mathematical Analysis for a Class of Stochastic Copolymerization Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05383v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a stochastic model of a copolymerization process that has been extensively investigated in the physics literature. The main questions of interest include: (i) what are the criteria for transience, null recurrence, and positive recurrence in terms of the system parameters; (ii) in the transient regime, what are the limiting fractions of the different monomer types; and (iii) in the transient regime, what is the speed of growth of the polymer? Previous studies in the physics literature have addressed these questions using heuristic methods. Here, we utilize rigorous mathematical arguments to derive the results from the physics literature. Moreover, the techniques developed allow us to generalize to the copolymerization process with finitely many monomer types. We expect that the mathematical methods used and developed in this work will also enable the study of even more complex models in the future.</description>

      <title>Exact Quantum Stochastic Differential Equations for Reverse Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.15919v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ensemble-averaged dynamics of open quantum systems are typically irreversible. We show that this irreversibility need not hold at the level of individually monitored quantum trajectories. Our main results are analytical quantum stochastic differential equations for reverse diffusion, along with corresponding stochastic master equations. These equations describe the exact and approximate stochastic reverse processes for continuously monitored Pauli channels, including time-dependent depolarizing noise. We show that the reverse processes generalize the forward dynamics by combining the noise effects of the forward processes with an additional non-Markovian stochastic drift that dynamically steers a quantum state back to its initial configuration. Consequently, the exact SDEs admit closed-form solutions that can be implemented in real-time without the need for variational techniques. Our findings establish an analytical framework for quantum state recovery, noise-resilient quantum gates, quantum generative modelling, quantum tomography via forward-reverse cycles, and potential paradigms for quantum error correction based on reverse diffusion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08682v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a fully analytical integration of the Maxwell stress tensor and derive exact relations for interparticle forces in systems of multiple dielectric spheres immersed in a polarizable ionic solvent, within the framework of the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann theory. Building upon the screening-ranged (in ascending orders of Debye screening) expansions of the potentials developed and rigorously analyzed in the accompanying works arXiv:2512.08407, arXiv:2512.08684, arXiv:2512.09421, we construct exact screening-ranged many-body expansions for electrostatic forces in explicit analytical form. These results establish a rigorous foundation for evaluating screened electrostatic interactions in complex particle systems and provide direct analytical connections to, and systematic improvements upon, various earlier approximate or limited-case formulations available in the literature, both at zero and finite ionic strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interaction of particles in an electrolytic medium can be calculated by solving the Poisson equation inside the solutes and the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation in the solvent, with suitable boundary conditions at the interfaces. Analytical approaches often expand the potentials in spherical harmonics, relating interior and exterior coefficients and eliminating some coefficients in favor of others, but a rigorous spectral analysis of the corresponding formulations is still lacking. Here, we introduce pertinent composite many-body Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators and prove that they are compact with spectral radii strictly less than one. These results provide the foundation for systematic screening-ranged expansions, in powers of the Debye screening parameters, of electrostatic potentials, interaction energies, and forces, and establish the analytical framework for the accompanying works arXiv:2512.09421, arXiv:2512.08407, arXiv:2512.08682.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Decoherence from Imaginary-Order Spectral Deformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mechanism of spontaneous decoherence is examined in which the generator of quantum dynamics is replaced by the imaginary-order (which is fundamentally different from real-order fractional calculus) spectral deformation $H^{1+i\beta}$ for a positive self-adjoint Hamiltonian $H$. The deformation modifies dynamical phases through the factor $E^{i\beta}=e^{i\beta\log E}$, whose rapid oscillation suppresses interference between distinct energies. A non-stationary-phase analysis yields quantitative estimates: oscillatory contributions to amplitudes or decoherence functionals decay at least as $\mathcal{O}(1/|\beta|)$. The kinematical structure of quantum mechanics -- the Hilbert-space inner product, projection operators, and the Born rule -- remains unchanged; the modification is entirely dynamical and acts only through spectral phases.
  Physical motivations for the deformation arise from clock imperfections, renormalization--group and effective--action corrections that introduce logarithmic spectral terms, and semiclassical gravity analyses in which complex actions produce spectral factors of the form $E^{i\beta}$. The mechanism is illustrated in examples relevant to quantum-gravity-inspired quantum mechanics.
  A detailed related-work analysis contrasts the present mechanism with Milburn-type intrinsic decoherence, Di\'osi-Penrose gravitational collapse, GRW/CSL models, clock-induced decoherence, and energy-conserving collapse models, as well as environmental frameworks such as Lindblad master equations, Caldeira-Leggett baths, and non-Hermitian Hamiltonian deformations. This positions $H^{1+i\beta}$ dynamics as a compact, testable, and genuinely novel phenomenological encapsulation of logarithmic spectral corrections arising in quantum-gravity- motivated effective theories, while remaining fully compatible with standard quantum kinematics.</description>

      <title>Exact Screening-Ranged Expansions for Many-Body Electrostatics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an exact many-body framework for electrostatic interactions among $N$ arbitrarily charged spheres in an electrolyte, modeled by the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation. Building on a spectral analysis of nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators introduced in a companion mathematical work arXiv:2512.08684, we construct convergent screening-ranged series for the potential, interaction energy, and forces, where each term is associated with a well-defined Debye--H\"uckel screening order and can be obtained evaluating an analytical expression rather than numerically solving an infinitely dimensional linear system. This formulation unifies and extends classical and recent approaches, providing a rigorous basis for electrostatic interactions among heterogeneously charged particles (including Janus colloids) and yielding many-body generalizations of analytical explicit-form results previously available only for two-body systems. The framework captures and clarifies complex effects such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, and like-charge attraction, which remain largely analytically elusive in existing treatments. Beyond its fundamental significance, the method leads to numerically efficient schemes, offering a versatile tool for modeling colloids and soft/biological matter in electrolytic solution.</description>
