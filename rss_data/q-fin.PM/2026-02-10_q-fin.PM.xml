      <title>Comparing Mixture, Box, and Wasserstein Ambiguity Sets in Distributionally Robust Asset Liability Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Asset Liability Management (ALM) represents a fundamental challenge for financial institutions, particularly pension funds, which must navigate the tension between generating competitive investment returns and ensuring the solvency of long-term obligations. To address the limitations of traditional frameworks under uncertainty, this paper implements Distributionally Robust Optimization (DRO), an emergent paradigm that accounts for a broad spectrum of potential probability distributions. We propose and evaluate three distinct DRO formulations: mixture ambiguity sets with discrete scenarios, box ambiguity sets of discrete distribution functions, and Wasserstein metric ambiguity sets. Utilizing empirical data from the Canada Pension Plan (CPP), we conduct a comparative analysis of these models against traditional stochastic programming approaches. Our results demonstrate that DRO formulations, specifically those utilizing Wasserstein and box ambiguity sets, consistently outperform both mixture-based DRO and stochastic programming in terms of funding ratios and overall fund returns. These findings suggest that incorporating distributional robustness significantly enhances the resilience and performance of pension fund management strategies.</description>

      <title>Financial Bond Similarity Search Using Representation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.07020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Finding similar bonds remains challenging in fixed-income analytics, as numerical financial attributes often overshadow categorical non-financial ones such as issuer sector and domicile. This paper shows that these categorical attributes dominate the predictability of spread curves and proposes embedding models to capture their semantic similarities, outperforming one-hot and many other baselines. Evaluated via sparse-issuer augmentation, the approach improves risk modeling and curve construction.</description>

      <title>Exponential utility maximization in small/large financial markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.06549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.06549v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obtaining utility maximizing optimal portfolios in closed form is a challenging issue when the return vector follows a more general distribution than the normal one. In this note, we give closed form expressions, in markets based on finitely many assets, for optimal portfolios that maximize the expected exponential utility when the return vector follows normal mean-variance mixture models. We then consider large financial markets based on normal mean-variance mixture models also and show that, under exponential utility, the optimal utilities based on small markets converge to the optimal utility in the large financial market. This result shows, in particular, that to reach optimal utility level investors need to diversify their portfolios to include infinitely many assets into their portfolio and with portfolios based on any set of only finitely many assets, they never be able to reach optimum level of utility. In this paper, we also consider portfolio optimization problems with more general class of utility functions and provide an easy-to-implement numerical procedure for locating optimal portfolios. Especially, our approach in this part of the paper reduces a high dimensional problem in locating optimal portfolio into a three dimensional problem for a general class of utility functions.</description>
