      <title>Adaptive Sample Sharing for Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In many business settings, task-specific labeled data are scarce or costly to obtain, which limits supervised learning on a specific task. To address this challenge, we study sample sharing in the case of ridge regression: leveraging an auxiliary data set while explicitly protecting against negative transfer. We introduce a principled, data-driven rule that decides how many samples from an auxiliary dataset to add to the target training set. The rule is based on an estimate of the transfer gain i.e. the marginal reduction in the predictive error. Building on this estimator, we derive finite-sample guaranties: under standard conditions, the procedure borrows when it improves parameter estimation and abstains otherwise. In the Gaussian feature setting, we analyze which data set properties ensure that borrowing samples reduces the predictive error. We validate the approach in synthetic and real datasets, observing consistent gains over strong baselines and single-task training while avoiding negative transfer.</description>

      <title>Mendelian randomization in a multi-ancestry world: reflections and practical advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many Mendelian randomization (MR) papers have been conducted only in people of European ancestry, limiting transportability of results to the global population. Expanding MR to diverse ancestry groups is essential to ensure equitable biomedical insights, yet presents analytical and conceptual challenges. This review examines the practical challenges of MR analyses beyond the European only context, including use of data from multi-ancestry, mismatched ancestry, and admixed populations. We explain how apparent heterogeneity in MR estimates between populations can arise from differences in genetic variant frequencies and correlation patterns, as well as from differences in the distribution of phenotypic variables, complicating the detection of true differences in the causal pathway.
  We summarize published strategies for selecting genetic instruments and performing analyses when working with limited ancestry-specific data, discussing the assumptions needed in each case for incorporating external data from different ancestry populations. We conclude that differences in MR estimates by ancestry group should be interpreted cautiously, with consideration of how the identified differences may arise due to social and cultural factors. Corroborating evidence of a biological mechanism altering the causal pathway is needed to support a conclusion of differing causal pathways between ancestry groups.</description>
