      <title>A Mathematical Model for Two Solutes Transport in a Poroelastic Material and Its Applications</title>

Abstract: Using well-known mathematical foundations of the elasticity theory, a mathematical model for two solutes transport in a poroelastic material (soft tissue is a typical example) is suggested. It is assumed that molecules of essentially different sizes dissolved in fluid and are transported through pores of different sizes. The stress tensor, the main force leading to the material deformation, is taken not only in the standard linear form but also with an additional nonlinear part. The model is constructed in 1D space and consists of six nonlinear equations. It is shown that the governing equations are integrable in stationary case, therefore all steady-state solutions are constructed. The obtained solutions are used in an example for healthy and tumour tissue, in particular, tissue displacements are calculated and compared for parameters taken from experimental data in cases of the linear and nonlinear stress tensors. Since the governing equations are non-integrable in non-stationary case, the Lie symmetry analysis is used in order to construct time-dependent exact solutions. Depending on parameters arising in the governing equations, several special cases with non-trivial Lie symmetries are identified. As a result, multi-parameter families of exact solutions are constructed including those in terms of special functions(hypergeometric and Bessel functions). A possible application of the solutions obtained is demonstrated.</description>
