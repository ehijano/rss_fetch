      <title>Mountain pine beetle struggles with jack pine: A mechanistic explanation for slowed range expansion in Alberta</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following widespread outbreaks across western North America, mountain pine beetle recently expanded its range from British Columbia into Alberta. However, mountain pine beetle's eastward expansion across Canada has stalled unexpectedly, defying predictions of rapid spread through jack pine, a novel host tree. This study investigates the underlying causes of this deceleration using an integrative approach combining statistical modeling, simulations, and experimental data. We find that the slow spread is primarily due to mountain pine beetle's difficulty in finding and successfully attacking jack pine trees, rather than issues with reproduction or larval development. The underlying mechanism impeding beetle range expansion has been hypothesized to be lower pine volumes in eastern forests, which are primarily a consequence of lower stem density. However, our analysis suggests that jack pine's phenotype itself is the primary impediment. We propose that jack pine's smaller size, thinner phloem, and lower monoterpene concentrations result in weaker chemical cues during the host-finding and mass-attack stages of MPB's life cycle, ultimately leading to fewer successful attacks. These findings suggest a reduced risk of further eastward spread, but should be interpreted cautiously due to enormous policy implications and the inherent limitations of ecological forecasting.</description>

      <title>An assessment of Alberta's strategy for controlling mountain pine beetle outbreaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Canadian province of Alberta spent over 500 million dollars on controlling mountain pine beetle populations, but did it work? Using a statistical modeling framework coupled with long-term field data, we examined how direct control measures, severe winters, and host-tree depletion shaped the trajectory of Alberta's mountain pine beetle outbreak between 2009 and 2020. Simulations suggest that control efforts reduced total tree mortality by 79% (95% predictive interval: 58--89%) and prevented 1.8 (0.91--4.1) trees per hectare from being killed from 2010--2020. Although cold winters had little effect on overall damage, they acted synergistically with control to end the outbreak, causing population collapse circa 2020. This synergy supports a "wait it out" strategy of mountain pine beetle management, where moderate control effort is applied until an extreme weather event delivers the final blow. Any effects of host-tree depletion via beetle attack were negligible. From an economic perspective, removing one infestation tree -- at an approximate cost of 320 CAD -- prevented the loss of roughly six (2.6--15) trees, demonstrating the potential for long-term cost-effectiveness. Our results further indicate that future outbreaks may vary widely in severity due to environmental stochasticity, with potential damage in a no-control scenario ranging from 0.41 to 9.7 trees per hectare killed (over a hypothetical 11-year period). An alternative model predicts an even wider range of outcomes: 1--40 trees per hectare. These findings highlight not only the potential of sustained control efforts in mitigating forest pest outbreaks, but also the inherent uncertainty in long-term ecological forecasting.</description>

      <title>Self-similarity in pandemic spread and fractal containment policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although pandemics are often studied as if populations are well-mixed, disease transmission networks exhibit a multi-scale structure stretching from the individual all the way up to the entire globe. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to an intense debate about whether interventions should prioritize public health or the economy, leading to a surge of studies analyzing the health and economic costs of various response strategies. Here we show that describing disease transmission in a self-similar (fractal) manner across multiple geographic scales allows for the design of multi-scale containment measures that substantially reduce both these costs. We characterize response strategies using multi-scale reproduction numbers -- a generalization of the basic reproduction number $R_0$ -- that describe pandemic spread at multiple levels of scale and provide robust upper bounds on disease transmission. Stable elimination is guaranteed if there exists a scale such that the reproduction number among regions of that scale is less than $1$, even if the basic reproduction number $R_0$ is greater than $1$. We support our theoretical results using simulations of a heterogeneous SIS model for disease spread in the United States constructed using county-level commuting, air travel, and population data.</description>

      <title>The expensive son hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In its initial form, the expensive son hypothesis postulates that sons from male-biased sexually dimorphic species require more food during growth than daughters, which ultimately incur fitness costs for mothers predominantly producing and rearing sons. We first dissect the evolutionary framework in which the expensive son hypothesis is rooted, and we provide a critical reappraisal of its differences from other evolutionary theories proposed in the field of sex allocation. Then, we synthesize the current (and absence of) support for the costs of producing and rearing sons on maternal fitness components (future reproduction and survival). Regarding the consequences in terms of future reproduction, we highlight that species with pronounced sexual size dimorphism display a higher cost of sons than of daughters on subsequent reproductive performance, at least in mammals. However, in most studies, the relative fitness costs of producing and rearing sons and daughters can be due to sex-biased maternal allocation strategies rather than differences in energetic demands of offspring, which constitutes an alternative mechanism to the expensive son hypothesis stricto sensu. We observe that empirical studies investigating the differential costs of sons and daughters on maternal survival in non-human animals remain rare, especially for long-term survival. Indeed, most studies have investigated the influence of offspring sex (or litter sex ratio) at year $T$ on survival at year $T+1$, and they rarely provide a support to the expensive son hypothesis. On the contrary, in humans, most studies have focused on the relationship between proportion of sons and maternal lifespan, but these results are inconsistent. Our study highlights new avenues for future research that should provide a comprehensive view of the expensive son hypothesis, by notably disentangling the effects of offspring behaviour from the effect of sex-specific maternal allocation. Moreover, we emphasize that future studies should also embrace the mechanistic side of the expensive son hypothesis, largely neglected so far, by deciphering the physiological pathways linking son's production to maternal health and fitness.</description>

      <title>Multivariate Aspects of Phylogenetic Comparative Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis concerns multivariate phylogenetic comparative methods. We investigate two aspects of them. The first is the bias caused by measurement error in regression studies of comparative data. We calculate the formula for the bias and show how to correct for it. We also study whether it is always advantageous to correct for the bias as correction can increase the mean square error of the estimate. We propose a criterion, which depends on the observed data, that indicates whether it is beneficial to correct or not. Accompanying the results is an R program that offers the bias correction tool.
  The second topic is a multivariate model for trait evolution which is based on an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck type stochastic process, often used for studying trait adaptation, co-evolution, allometry or trade-offs. Alongside the description of the model and presentation of its most important features we present an R program estimating the model's parameters. To the best of our knowledge our program is the first program that allows for nearly all combinations of key model parameters providing the biologist with a flexible tool for studying multiple interacting traits in the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck framework. There are numerous packages available that include the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process but their multivariate capabilities seem limited.

      <title>Stochastic models in phylogenetic comparative methods: analytical properties and parameter estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phylogenetic comparative methods are well established tools for using inter-species variation to analyse phenotypic evolution and adaptation. They are generally hampered, however, by predominantly univariate approaches and failure to include uncertainty and measurement error in the phylogeny as well as the measured traits. This thesis addresses all these three issues.
  First, by investigating the effects of correlated measurement errors on a phylogenetic regression. Second, by developing a multivariate Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model combined with a maximum-likelihood estimation package in R. This model allows, uniquely, a direct way of testing adaptive coevolution.
  Third, accounting for the often substantial phylogenetic uncertainty in comparative studies requires an explicit model for the tree. Based on recently developed conditioned branching processes, with Brownian and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck evolution on top, expected species similarities are derived, together with phylogenetic confidence intervals for the optimal trait value. Finally, inspired by these developments, the phylogenetic framework is illustrated by an exploration of questions concerning "time since hybridization", the distribution of which proves to be asymptotically exponential.

      <title>Explicit modeling of density dependence in spatial capture-recapture models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Density dependence occurs at the individual level but is often evaluated at the population level, leading to difficulties or even controversies in detecting such a process. Bayesian individual-based models such as spatial capture-recapture (SCR) models provide opportunities to study density dependence at the individual level, but such an approach remains to be developed and evaluated. In this study, we developed a SCR model that links habitat use to apparent survival and recruitment through density dependent processes at the individual level. Using simulations, we found that the model can properly inform habitat use, but tends to underestimate the effect of density dependence on apparent survival and recruitment. The reason for such underestimations is likely due to the fact that SCR models have difficulties in identifying the locations of unobserved individuals while assuming they are uniformly distributed. How to accurately estimate the locations of unobserved individuals, and thus density dependence, remains a challenging topic in spatial statistics and statistical ecology.</description>

      <title>Estimating excess mortality during the Covid-19 pandemic in Aotearoa New Zealand</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background. The excess mortality rate in Aotearoa New Zealand during the Covid-19 pandemic is frequently estimated to be among the lowest in the world. However, to facilitate international comparisons, many of the methods that have been used to estimate excess mortality do not use age-stratified data on deaths and population size, which may compromise their accuracy.
  Methods. We used a quasi-Poisson regression model for monthly all-cause deaths among New Zealand residents, controlling for age, sex and seasonality. We fitted the model to deaths data for 2014-19. We estimated monthly excess mortality for 2020-23 as the difference between actual deaths and projected deaths according to the model. We conducted sensitivity analysis on the length of the pre-pandemic period used to fit the model. We benchmarked our results against a simple linear regression on the standardised annual mortality rate.
  Results. We estimated cumulative excess mortality in New Zealand in 2020-23 was 1040 (95% confidence interval [-1134, 2927]), equivalent to 0.7% [-0.8%, 2.0%] of expected mortality. Excess mortality was negative in 2020-21. The magnitude, timing and age-distribution of the positive excess mortality in 2022-23 were closely matched with confirmed Covid-19 deaths.
  Conclusions. Negative excess mortality in 2020-21 reflects very low levels of Covid-19 and major reductions in seasonal respiratory diseases during this period. In 2022-23, Covid-19 deaths were the main contributor to excess mortality and there was little or no net non-Covid-19 excess. Overall, New Zealand experienced one of the lowest rates of pandemic excess mortality in the world.</description>

      <title>Explaining excitable population dynamics in bark beetles: From life history to large, episodic outbreaks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12590v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bark beetles are significant forest pests, with some species capable of causing widespread tree mortality. Among these, the mountain pine beetle (MPB) stands out for its exceptionally destructive outbreak in the 2000s. We use MPB as a case study to explore the concept of =excitable dynamics, where ephemeral perturbations produce large excursions from equilibrium. Our empirically-calibrated model of reveals five features of MPB biology: stand density-dependent dispersal, an Allee effect, time-scale separation between beetle and tree life cycles, tree size-dependent fecundity, and a large-tree preference. The first three features explain MPB's characteristic boom-bust dynamics, while the latter two explain outbreak magnitude. Other bark beetles lack one or more of these traits, partially explaining their generally lower impact. However, predicting bark beetle impact requires consideration of both life history and landscape factors: total damage increases linearly with host-tree biomass, but this relationship holds only for irruptive (i.e., excitable) beetle species. We distill our findings into a minimal mechanistic model that captures the essence of irruptive bark beetle dynamics. This model firmly establishes MPB as one of the first empirical examples of excitable dynamics in ecology.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and the limit of predictability in protein evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01969v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Protein evolution involves mutations occurring across a wide range of time scales. In analogy with other disordered systems, this dynamical heterogeneity suggests strong correlations between mutations happening at distinct sites and times. To quantify these correlations, we examine the role of various fluctuation sources in protein evolution, simulated using a data-driven epistatic landscape. By applying spatio-temporal correlation functions inspired by statistical physics, we disentangle fluctuations originating from the ancestral protein sequence from those driven by stochastic mutations along independent evolutionary paths. Our analysis shows that, in diverse protein families, fluctuations from the ancestral sequence predominate at shorter time scales. This allows us to identify a time scale over which ancestral sequence information persists, enabling its reconstruction. We link this persistence to the strength of epistatic interactions: ancestral sequences with stronger epistatic signatures impact evolutionary trajectories over extended periods. At longer time scales, however, ancestral influence fades as epistatically constrained sites evolve collectively. To confirm this idea, we apply a standard ancestral sequence reconstruction algorithm and verify that the time-dependent recovery error is influenced by the properties of the ancestor itself.</description>
