      <title>Fast, Accurate Numerical Evaluation of Incomplete Planck Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Methods for computing the integral of the Planck blackbody function over a finite spectral range, the so-called incomplete Planck integral, are necessary to perform multigroup radiative transfer calculations. We present a comparison, in terms of speed and accuracy, of a wide array of approaches to numerically evaluating these integrals. Our results indicate that a direct rational polynomial approximation to these integrals has the best combination of accuracy and efficiency. We also present for the first time a derivation of the polylogarithm form of these integrals and show that modern approaches to polylogarithm evaluation are suitable for numerically evaluating incomplete Planck integrals. This article is dedicated to Prof. B.D. Ganapol, the Transport Cowboy, on the occasion of his retirement.</description>

      <title>The Alamo multiphysics solver for phase field simulations with strong-form mechanics and block structured adaptive mesh refinement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Alamo is a high-performance scientific code that uses block-structured adaptive mesh refinement to solve such problems as: the ignition and burn of solid rocket propellant, plasticity, damage and fracture in materials undergoing loading, and the interaction of compressible flow with eroding solid materials. Alamo is powered by AMReX, and provides a set of unique methods, models, and algorithms that enable it to solve solid-mechanics problems (coupled to other physical behavior such as fluid flow or thermal diffusion) using the power of block-structured adaptive mesh refinement.</description>

      <title>The pseudo-analytical density solution to parameterized Fokker-Planck equations via deep learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficiently solving the Fokker-Planck equation (FPE) is crucial for understanding the probabilistic evolution of stochastic particles in dynamical systems, however, analytical solutions or density functions are only attainable in specific cases. To speed up the solving process of parameterized FPEs with several system parameters, we introduce a deep learning-based method to obtain the pseudo-analytical density (PAD). Unlike previous numerical methodologies that necessitate solving the FPE separately for each set of system parameters, the PAD simultaneously addresses all the FPEs within a predefined continuous range of system parameters during a single training phase. The approach utilizes a Gaussian mixture distribution (GMD) to represent the stationary probability density, the solution to the FPE. By leveraging a deep residual network, each system parameter configuration is mapped to the parameters of the GMD, ensuring that the weights, means, and variances of the Gaussian components adaptively align with the corresponding true density functions. A grid-free algorithm is further developed to effectively train the residual network, resulting in a feasible PAD obeying necessary normalization and boundary conditions. Extensive numerical studies validate the accuracy and efficiency of our method, promising significant acceleration in the response analysis of multi-parameter, multi-dimensional stochastic nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Modelling lined rock caverns subject to hydrogen embrittlement and cyclic pressurisation in fractured rock masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The technology of lined rock cavern (LRC) with great geographical flexibility is a promising, cost-effective solution to underground hydrogen storage. However, the air-tight steel tanks used in this technology are susceptible to material degradation due to hydrogen embrittlement (HE), potentially leading to leakage and structural failure, especial for LRCs constructed in complex geological conditions. In this paper, we develop a 2D multiscale numerical model based on the finite element method to assess the impact of HE on the LRC performance in fractured rock masses under cyclic gas pressurisation. Within this framework, a large-scale model is used to simulate the deformation and damage evolution of both fractured rock and an LRC under in-situ stresses and internal gas pressurisation, while a small-scale model captures HE in the steel lining of the LRC. Our simulations reveal that damage in the rock, concrete, and steel degradation is strongly affected by pre-existing fractures and in-situ stresses. Our results also reveal the presence of a strong positive feedback between hydrogen concentration and stress redistribution in the steel lining. Moreover, a comparison between models with and without considering HE illuminates that hydrogen concentration significantly contributes to steel degradation, particularly during the long-term LRC operation, highlighting the critical role of HE in the safety and performance of the LRC. The findings and insights obtained from our work have important implications for the design optimisation and performance assessment of LRCs for sustainable underground hydrogen storage.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamics in a villi-patterned channel due to pendular-wave activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08852v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the motility of small intestine, we investigate the flow generated by a propagating pendular-wave along the walls of a symmetric 2D channel lined with elongated villi-like microstructures. The rigid villi follow simple harmonic axial motion, but with a phase lag to their neighbours, resulting in travelling intervillous contractions. We use lattice Boltzmann simulations to resolve the flow around the villi and the luminal channel space, sampling small to moderate Womersley numbers. We analyse an emergent `mixing' boundary layer in the lumen, separating two distinct flow regions. A mixing region is formed above the villi, characterised by semi-vortical flow patterns, which travel along with the wave. In the channel centre, unidirectional axial flow emerges, flowing opposite to the imposed wave direction, even in the Stokes flow regime. This behaviour contrasts with canonical wave driven peristaltic flow (Jaffrin &amp; Shapiro 1971). The fluid trapped in the intervillous gaps is forced to take a non-reciprocal path due to the travelling pendular-wave, which breaks time-symmetry in the Stokes regime. We propose an effective velocity boundary condition, incorporating perturbations due to the presence of the villi. In the inertial regime, the boundary layer shrinks due to dynamic flow confinement arising from increased oscillatory flow inertia. We identify the Stokes to inertial transition, and find phenomenological scaling laws for the boundary layer decay and axial and radial fluid fluxes. Our results not only advance the understanding of transport within the gut but also suggest a novel way for microfluidic flow control in confined channels.</description>

      <title>Towards Excitations and Dynamical Quantities in Correlated Lattices with Density Matrix Embedding Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08880v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density matrix embedding theory (DMET) provides a framework to describe ground-state expectation values in strongly correlated systems, but its extension to dynamical quantities is still an open problem. We demonstrate one route to obtaining excitations and dynamical spectral functions by using the techniques of DMET to approximate the matrix elements that arise in a single-mode inspired excitation ansatz. We demonstrate this approach in the 1D Hubbard model, comparing the neutral excitations, single-particle density of states, charge, and spin dynamical structure factors to benchmarks from the Bethe ansatz and density matrix renormalization group. Our work highlights the potential of these ideas in building computationally efficient approaches for dynamical quantities.</description>

      <title>Towards Efficient Parametric State Estimation in Circulating Fuel Reactors with Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent developments in data-driven methods have paved the way to new methodologies to provide accurate state reconstruction of engineering systems; nuclear reactors represent particularly challenging applications for this task due to the complexity of the strongly coupled physics involved and the extremely harsh and hostile environments, especially for new technologies such as Generation-IV reactors. Data-driven techniques can combine different sources of information, including computational proxy models and local noisy measurements on the system, to robustly estimate the state. This work leverages the novel Shallow Recurrent Decoder architecture to infer the entire state vector (including neutron fluxes, precursors concentrations, temperature, pressure and velocity) of a reactor from three out-of-core time-series neutron flux measurements alone. In particular, this work extends the standard architecture to treat parametric time-series data, ensuring the possibility of investigating different accidental scenarios and showing the capabilities of this approach to provide an accurate state estimation in various operating conditions. This paper considers as a test case the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR), a Generation-IV reactor concept, characterised by strong coupling between the neutronics and the thermal hydraulics due to the liquid nature of the fuel. The promising results of this work are further strengthened by the possibility of quantifying the uncertainty associated with the state estimation, due to the considerably low training cost. The accurate reconstruction of every characteristic field in real-time makes this approach suitable for monitoring and control purposes in the framework of a reactor digital twin.</description>

      <title>From Models To Experiments: Shallow Recurrent Decoder Networks on the DYNASTY Experimental Facility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08907v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Shallow Recurrent Decoder networks are a novel paradigm recently introduced for state estimation, combining sparse observations with high-dimensional model data. This architecture features important advantages compared to standard data-driven methods including: the ability to use only three sensors (even randomly selected) for reconstructing the entire dynamics of a physical system; the ability to train on compressed data spanned by a reduced basis; the ability to measure a single field variable (easy to measure) and reconstruct coupled spatio-temporal fields that are not observable and minimal hyper-parameter tuning. This approach has been verified on different test cases within different fields including nuclear reactors, even though an application to a real experimental facility, adopting the employment of in-situ observed quantities, is missing. This work aims to fill this gap by applying the Shallow Recurrent Decoder architecture to the DYNASTY facility, built at Politecnico di Milano, which studies the natural circulation established by internally heated fluids for Generation IV applications, especially in the case of Circulating Fuel reactors. The RELAP5 code is used to generate the high-fidelity data, and temperature measurements extracted by the facility are used as input for the state estimation. The results of this work will provide a validation of the Shallow Recurrent Decoder architecture to engineering systems, showing the capabilities of this approach to provide and accurate state estimation.</description>

      <title>Hyperfine Coupling Constants on Quantum Computers: Performance, Errors, and Future Prospects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09214v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first implementation and computation of electron spin resonance isotropic hyperfine coupling constants (HFCs) on quantum hardware. As illustrative test cases, we compute the HFCs for the hydroxyl radical (OH$^{\bullet}$), nitric oxide (NO$^{\bullet}$), and the triplet hydroxyl cation (OH$^{+}$). Our approach integrates the qubit-ADAPT method with unrestricted orbital optimization in an active space framework. To accurately measure the necessary spin one-electron reduced density matrices on current hardware, we employ a combination of error mitigation, error suppression, and post-selection, including our in-house developed ansatz-based readout and gate error mitigation. The HFCs obtained from the quantum hardware experiments align with results from unrestricted complete active space self-consistent field calculations on classical hardware. These results mark a significant step towards leveraging quantum computing for chemically relevant molecular properties and highlight the critical role of multi-method error strategies in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <title>Towards a Generalized SA Model: Symbolic Regression-Based Correction for Separated Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study focuses on the numerical simulation of high Reynolds number separated flows and proposes a data-driven approach to improve the predictive capability of the SA turbulence model. First, data assimilation was performed on two typical airfoils with high angle-of-attack separated flows to obtain a high-fidelity flow field dataset. Based on this dataset, a white-box model was developed using symbolic regression to modify the production term of the SA model. To validate the effectiveness of the modified model, multiple representative airfoils and wings, such as the SC1095 airfoil, DU91-W2-250 airfoil, and ONERA-M6 wing, were selected as test cases. A wide range of flow conditions was considered, including subsonic to transonic regimes, Reynolds numbers ranging from hundreds of thousands to tens of millions, and angles of attack varying from small to large. The results indicate that the modified model significantly improves the prediction accuracy of separated flows while maintaining the predictive capability for attached flows. It notably enhances the reproduction of separated vortex structures and flow separation locations, reducing the mean relative error in lift prediction at stall angles by 69.2% and improving computational accuracy by more than three times. Furthermore, validation using a zero-pressure-gradient flat plate case confirms the modified model's ability to accurately predict the turbulent boundary layer velocity profile and skin friction coefficient distribution. The findings of this study provide new insights and methodologies for the numerical simulation of high Reynolds number separated flows, contributing to more accurate modeling of complex flow phenomena in engineering applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Schr\"odinger bridge is the most probable time-dependent probability distribution that connects an initial probability distribution $w_{i}$ to a final one $w_{f}$. The problem has been solved and widely used for the case of simple Brownian evolution (non-interacting particles). It is related to the problem of entropy regularized Wasserstein optimal transport. In this article, we generalize Brownian bridges to systems of interacting particles. We derive some equations for the forward and backward single particle ``wave-functions'' which allow to compute the most probable evolution of the single-particle probability between the initial and final distributions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The implementation of convolutional neural networks in programmable logic, for applications in fast online event selection at hadron colliders is studied. In particular, an approach based on full event images for classification is studied, including hardware-aware optimisation of the network architecture, and evaluation of physics performance using simulated data. A range of network models are identified that can be implemented within resources of current FPGAs, as well as the stringent latency requirements of HL-LHC trigger systems. A candidate model that can be implemented in the CMS L1 trigger for HL-LHC was shown to be capable of excellent signal/background discrimination, although the performance depends strongly on the degree of pile-up mitigation possible prior to image generation.</description>

      <title>A Monte Carlo approach for finding optimally controlled quantum gates with differential geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09593v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A unitary evolution in time may be treated as a curve in the manifold of the special unitary group. The length of such a curve can be related to the energetic cost of the associated computation, meaning a geodesic curve identifies an energetically optimal path. In this work, we employ sub-Riemannian geometry on the manifold of the unitary group to obtain optimally designed Hamiltonians for generating single-qubit gates in an environment with the presence of dephasing noise as well as a two-qubit gate under a time-constant crosstalk interaction. The resulting geodesic equation involves knowing the initial conditions of the parameters that cannot be obtained analytically. We then introduce a random sampling method combined with a minimization function and a cost function to find initial conditions that lead to optimal control fields. We also compare the optimized control fields obtained from the solutions of the geodesic equation with those extracted from the well-known Krotov method. Both approaches provide high fidelity values for the desired quantum gate implementation, but the geodesic method has the advantage of minimizing the required energy to execute the same task. These findings bring new insights for the design of more efficient fields in the arsenal of optimal control theory.</description>

Abstract: Large particle systems are often described by high-dimensional (linear) kinetic equations that are simulated using Monte Carlo methods for which the asymptotic convergence rate is independent of the dimensionality. Even though the asymptotic convergence rate is known, predicting the actual value of the statistical error remains a challenging problem. In this paper, we show how the statistical error of an analog particle tracing Monte Carlo method can be calculated (expensive) and predicted a priori (cheap) when estimating quantities of interest (QoI) on a histogram. We consider two types of QoI estimators: point estimators for which each particle provides one independent contribution to the QoI estimates, and analog estimators for which each particle provides multiple correlated contributions to the QoI estimates. The developed statistical error predictors can be applied to other QoI estimators and nonanalog simulation routines as well. The error analysis is based on interpreting the number of particle visits to a histogram bin as the result of a (correlated) binomial experiment. The resulting expressions can be used to optimize (non)analog particle tracing Monte Carlo methods and hybrid simulation methods involving a Monte Carlo component, as well as to select an optimal particle tracing Monte Carlo method from several available options. Additionally, the cheap statistical error predictors can be used to determine a priori the number of particles N that is needed to reach a desired accuracy. We illustrate the theory using a linear kinetic equation describing neutral particles in the plasma edge of a fusion device and show numerical results. The code used to perform the numerical experiments is openly available.</description>

      <title>Complexity order of multiple resource algorithms</title>

Abstract: Algorithmic efficiency is essential to reducing energy and time usage for computational problems. Optimizing efficiency is important for tasks involving multiple resources, for example in stochastic calculations where the size of the random ensemble competes with the time-step. We define the complexity order of an algorithm needing multiple resources as the exponent of inverse total error with respect to the total resources used. The optimum order is predicted for independent, factorable resources. We show that it equals the inverse sum of the inverse resource orders. This is applied to computing averages in a stochastic differential equation. We treat numerical examples for multiple different algorithms and for stochastic partial differential equations, all giving quantitative results in excellent agreement with our more general analytic theory.</description>

      <title>DFT+DMFT study of correlated electronic structure in the monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08601v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By preforming DFT+DMFT calculations, we systematically investigate the correlated electronic structure in the newly discovered monolayer-trilayer (ML-TL) phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La327). Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the result of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML in our zero- and finite-temperature calculations. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is metallic due to self-doping. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Pauli Decomposition via the Fast Walsh-Hadamard Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06206</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06206v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The decomposition of a square matrix into a sum of Pauli strings is a classical pre-processing step required to realize many quantum algorithms. Such a decomposition requires significant computational resources for large matrices. We present an exact and explicit formula for the Pauli string coefficients which inspires an efficient algorithm to compute them. More specifically, we show that up to a permutation of the matrix elements, the decomposition coefficients are related to the original matrix by a multiplication of a generalised Hadamard matrix. This allows one to use the Fast Walsh-Hadamard transform and calculate all Pauli decomposition coefficients in $\mathcal{O}(N^2\log N)$ time and using $\mathcal{O}(1)$ additional memory, for an $N\times N$ matrix. A numerical implementation of our equation outperforms currently available solutions.</description>

      <title>Energy Dissipation Preserving Physics Informed Neural Network for Allen-Cahn Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08760v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates a numerical solution of Allen-Cahn equation with constant and degenerate mobility, with polynomial and logarithmic energy functionals, with deterministic and random initial functions, and with advective term in one, two, and three spatial dimensions, based on the physics-informed neural network (PINN). To improve the learning capacity of the PINN, we incorporate the energy dissipation property of the Allen-Cahn equation as a penalty term into the loss function of the network. To facilitate the learning process of random initials, we employ a continuous analogue of the initial random condition by utilizing the Fourier series expansion. Adaptive methods from traditional numerical analysis are also integrated to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed PINN. Numerical results indicate a consistent decrease in the discrete energy, while also revealing phenomena such as phase separation and metastability.</description>

      <title>High-Rank Irreducible Cartesian Tensor Decomposition and Bases of Equivariant Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18263v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Irreducible Cartesian tensors (ICTs) play a crucial role in the design of equivariant graph neural networks, as well as in theoretical chemistry and chemical physics. Meanwhile, the design space of available linear operations on tensors that preserve symmetry presents a significant challenge. The ICT decomposition and a basis of this equivariant space are difficult to obtain for high-rank tensors. After decades of research, Bonvicini (2024) recently achieves an explicit ICT decomposition for $n=5$ with factorial time/space complexity. In this work we, for the first time, obtains decomposition matrices for ICTs up to rank $n=9$ with reduced and affordable complexity, by constructing what we call path matrices. The path matrices are obtained via performing chain-like contractions with Clebsch-Gordan matrices following the parentage scheme. We prove and leverage that the concatenation of path matrices is an orthonormal change-of-basis matrix between the Cartesian tensor product space and the spherical direct sum spaces. Furthermore, we identify a complete orthogonal basis for the equivariant space, rather than a spanning set (Pearce-Crump, 2023), through this path matrices technique. To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first analytic, rather than numerical, method for theoretically obtaining arbitrary rank orthogonal ICT decomposition matrices and orthogonal equivariant bases. We further extend our result to the arbitrary tensor product and direct sum spaces, enabling free design between different spaces while keeping symmetry. The Python code is available at https://github.com/ShihaoShao-GH/ICT-decomposition-and-equivariant-bases, where the $n=6,\dots,9$ ICT decomposition matrices are obtained in 1s, 3s, 11s, and 4m32s on 28-cores Intel(R) Xeon(R) Gold 6330 CPU @ 2.00GHz, respectively.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.18057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploring the chemistry of materials at high pressures has lead to the discovery of previously unknown exotic compounds. Here, we systematically search for all thermodynamically stable Sr-C compounds under pressure (up to 100 GPa) using the ab initio evolutionary crystal structure prediction method. Our search lead to the discovery of hitherto unknown phases of SrC3, Sr2C5, Sr2C3, Sr2C, Sr3C2, and SrC. The newly discovered crystal structures feature a variety of different carbon environments ranging from isolated C anions and C-dimers to exotic polyatomic carbon anions including chains, stripes, and infinite ribbons consisting of pentagonal C5 and hexagonal C6 rings. Dynamical stability of all predicted compounds is confirmed by phonons calculations. Bader analysis unravels very diverse chemistry in these compounds and bonding patterns in some of them can be described using Zintl-Klemm rule.</description>

      <title>Tensor Learning and Compression of N-phonon Interactions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.05913v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonon interactions from lattice anharmonicity govern thermal properties and heat transport in materials. These interactions are described by n-th order interatomic force constants (n-IFCs), which can be viewed as high-dimensional tensors correlating the motion of n atoms, or equivalently encoding n-phonon scattering processes in momentum space. Here, we introduce a tensor decomposition to efficiently compress n-IFCs for arbitrary order n. Using tensor learning, we find optimal low-rank approximations of n-IFCs by solving the resulting optimization problem. Our approach reveals the inherent low dimensionality of phonon-phonon interactions and allows compression of the 3 and 4-IFC tensors by factors of up to $10^3-10^4$ while retaining high accuracy in calculations of phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal conductivity using the compressed n-IFCs achieve a speed-up by nearly three orders of magnitude with &gt;98% accuracy relative to the reference uncompressed solution. These calculations include both 3- and 4-phonon scattering and are shown for a diverse range of materials (Si, HgTe, MgO, and TiNiSn). In addition to accelerating state-of-the-art thermal transport calculations, the method shown here paves the way for modeling strongly anharmonic materials and higher-order phonon interactions.</description>
