      <title>The effect of multiple extra dimensions on the maximal mass of compact stars in Kaluza-Klein space-time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10920v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact stars in the Kaluza-Klein space-time are investigated, with multiple additional compactified spatial dimensions ($d$). Within the extended phenomenological model, a static, spherically symmetric solution is considered, with the equation of state provided by a zero temperature, interacting multi-dimensional Fermi gas. The maximal masses of compact stars are calculated for different model parameters. We investigated the effect of the existence of multiple extra compactified dimensions within the Kaluza-Klein compact star structure. We found that the number of extra dimensions plays a similar role, and to a similar order, as the excitation number: increasing their number, $d$, reduces the maximal mass by a few percent.</description>

      <title>Stability of non-minimally coupled dark energy in the geometrical trinity of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within the geometrical trinity of gravity, we analyze scalar field dark energy models minimally and non-minimally coupled to gravity, postulating that a Yukawa-like interacting term is \emph{in form} equivalent for general relativity, teleparallel and symmetric-teleparallel theories. Our analysis is pursued within two scalar field representations, where a quintessence and phantom pictures are associated with quasiquintessence and quasiphantom exotic fields. In the latter, we suggest how the phion-pressure can be built up without exhibiting a direct kinetic term. Accordingly, the stability analysis reveals that this quasiquintessence field provides a viable description of the universe indicating, when minimally coupled, how to unify dark energy and dark matter by showing an attractor point where $w_{\phi}=0$. Conversely, in the non-minimally coupling, the alternative field only leaves an attractor where dark energy dominates, mimicking \emph{de facto} a cosmological constant behavior. A direct study is conducted comparing the standard case with the alternative one, overall concluding that the behavior of quintessence is well established across all the gravity scenarios. However, considering the phantom field non-minimal coupled to gravity, the results are inconclusive for power-law potentials in Einstein theory, and for the inverse square power potential in both teleparallel and symmetric-teleparallel theories.</description>

      <title>Symmetries of Vanishing Nonlinear Love Numbers of Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tidal Love numbers parametrize the conservative induced tidal response of self-gravitating objects. It is well established that asymptotically-flat black holes in four-dimensional general relativity have vanishing Love numbers. In linear perturbation theory, this result was shown to be a consequence of ladder symmetries acting on black hole perturbations. In this work, we show that a black hole's tidal response induced by a static, parity-even tidal field vanishes for all multipoles to all orders in perturbation theory. Our strategy is to focus on static and axisymmetric spacetimes for which the dimensional reduction to the fully nonlinear Weyl solution is well-known. We define the nonlinear Love numbers using the point-particle effective field theory, matching with the Weyl solution to show that all static Love number couplings of operators involving only parity-even fields vanish to all orders, a conclusion that holds even for non-axisymmetric configurations. Lastly, we discuss the symmetries underlying the vanishing of the nonlinear Love numbers. An $\mathfrak{sl}(2,\mathbb R)$ algebra acting on a covariantly-defined potential furnishes ladder symmetries analogous to those in linear theory. This is because the dynamics of the potential are isomorphic to those of a static, massless scalar on a Schwarzschild background. We comment on the connection between the ladder symmetries and the Geroch group that is well-known to arise from dimensional reduction.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in Multi-Metric Gravity II: Hairy Solutions and Linear Stability of the Non- and Partially Proportional Branches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10976v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owing to our work in part I of this series of papers, it is understood that the analytically known black hole solutions in the theory of ghost free multi-metric gravity can be split into three distinct classes, and that one of these classes - the proportional branch - exhibits the Gregory-Laflamme instability at linear level in the metric perturbations, whenever the black hole horizon size is smaller than (roughly) the Compton wavelength of the theory's lightest massive graviton. In this first of two sequels, we determine the linear stability of the two remaining classes of black hole solutions - the non-proportional and partially proportional branches - and discuss how our results likely differ at nonlinear level. We also give a general prescription to construct multi-metric solutions describing black holes endowed with massive graviton hair, which may constitute the end state of the instability in the proportional branch. We utilise a tractable example model involving 3 metrics to see how this works in practice, and determine the asymptotic form of its corresponding hairy solutions at infinity, where one can clearly see the individual contributions from each of the graviton mass modes.</description>

      <title>Black Holes in a Gravitational Field: The Non-linear Static Love Number of Schwarzschild Black Holes Vanishes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the static tidal Love number of Schwarzschild black holes in four dimensions and in the vacuum vanishes at any order in the external tidal force. We also identify the underlying non-linear symmetry which is responsible for this result and becomes manifest when the black hole metric is written in axsymmetric static Weyl coordinates.</description>

      <title>Symmetry reduction of gravitational Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze all possible symmetry reductions of Lagrangians that yield fully equivalent field equations for any 4-dimensional metric theory of gravity. Specifically, we present a complete list of infinitesimal group actions obeying the principle of symmetric criticality, identify the corresponding invariant metrics (and $l$-chains), discuss relations among them, and analyze simplifications allowed by the residual diffeomorphism group and Noether identities before and after variation of the reduced Lagrangian. We employ rigorous treatment of the symmetry reduction by Fels and Torre and use the Hicks classification of infinitesimal group actions by means of Lie algebras pairs of isometries and their isotropy subalgebras. The classification is recast in the coordinates in which the well-known symmetries and geometries are easily recognizable and relatable to each other. The paper is accompanied by a code for the symmetry reduction of Lagrangians that we developed in \texttt{xAct} package of \textsc{Mathematica}.</description>

      <title>Thermogeometric Optimization of Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a natural finite-time geometric optimization method designed to analyze thermal fluctuations in black holes. Our approach leverages geodesics in the macro state space to pinpoint optimal processes within thermal systems. We propose a straightforward algorithm for developing these optimal protocols by applying the concept of thermodynamic length to determine the shortest paths between states in the relevant thermodynamic framework. Importantly, since thermodynamic metrics do not need to be positive definite, our method requires only maintaining a positive thermodynamic length through the inclusion of a simple scale factor in the metric. We demonstrate that the thermodynamic length can be positive by appropriately selecting the sign of this scale, which in turn is sensitive to the location of Davies phase transition curves. This addresses a significant gap in Hessian thermodynamic geometry. Furthermore, we can tie this scale to the sign of the thermodynamic curvature and thus to the type of the information geometry allowing the existence of the optimal processes. Finally, we show that the optimal fluctuations can ultimately lead to the complete evaporation of Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes over time, yielding realistic estimates for their lifespans in comparison to evaporation via Hawking radiation.</description>

      <title>Field Sources for Generalized Ellis-Bronnikov Wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work investigates whether phantom scalar fields combined with nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) can serve as sources for generalized Ellis-Bronnikov wormhole (GEB) spacetimes. This generalization of the Ellis-Bronnikov metric holds significant relevance in the literature and introduces a free parameter $m \geq 2$, recovering the original case when $m=2$. We derive analytical expressions for the scalar field, potential, and NED Lagrangian in magnetic and electric cases. Notably, we explicitly express the Lagrangian as a function of the electromagnetic invariant $\mathcal{F}$ for the magnetic solution. These results provide new insights into the field sources for more general wormhole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Strong Gravitational Lensing by Rotating Quantum-Corrected Black Holes: Insights and Constraints from EHT Observations of M87* and Sgr A*</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study gravitational lensing in the strong-field limit using the rotating quantum-corrected black hole (RQCBH) with an additional parameter $\alpha$ besides mass $M$ and spin parameter $a$. We discover a decrease in the deflection angle $\alpha_D$, the photon sphere radius $x_{ps}$, and the angular position $\theta_{\infty}$. The flux ratio of the first image to all subsequent images, $r_{mag}$, decreases rapidly as $\alpha$ increases. We compare RQCBH observables with those of Kerr black holes, using Sgr A* and M87* as lenses to observe the effect of the quantum-corrected parameter $\alpha$. For Sgr A*, the angular position $\theta_\infty$ in $\in~(14.8-26.3)~\mu as$, while for M87* $\in~(11.12-19.78)~\mu as$. The angular separation $s$, for supermassive black holes (SMBHs) SgrA* and M87*, differs significantly, with values ranging $\in~(0.033-0.79)~\mu as$ for Sgr A* and $\in~(0.033-0.59)~\mu as$ for M87*. The deviations of the lensing observables $|\Delta\theta_\infty|$ and $|\Delta s|$ for RQCBH ($a=0.8,\alpha=0.4$) from Kerr black holes can reach up to $1.6~\mu as$ and $0.41~\mu as$ for Sgr A*, and $1.2~\mu as$ and $0.31~\mu as$ for M87*. The relative magnitude $r_{mag}$ $\in~(1.81-6.82)~\mu as$. We also compared the time delays between the relativistic images in the 22 SMBHs at the center of various galaxies. We found that RQCBH can be quantitatively distinguished from Kerr black holes. Interestingly, the time delay for Sgr A* and M87* can reach approximately 24.95 min and 308.15 hrs, respectively. Our analysis concludes that, within the 1$\sigma$ region, a significant portion of the parameter space agrees with the EHT results of M87* and Sgr A*.</description>

      <title>Square-Root Gauge Theory and Modified Gravity -- Gravity-Assisted Confinement/Deconfinement and Emergent Electro-Weak Symmetry Breaking in Cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present contribution to the proceedings of MG17, the main aim is to elucidate the physically important effects of a special nonlinear gauge field with a square-root of the standard Maxwell Lagrangian in its action, interacting with a specific non-canonical modified $f(R)= R + R^2$ gravity formulated in terms of metric-independent spacetime volume elements and in addition coupled to the bosonic fields of the standard electroweak particle model. When applied in the context of cosmological evolution, the above theory consistently describes absence (suppression) of charge confinement and electroweak (Higgs) spontaneous breakdown in the ``early'' Universe, whereas in the post-inflationary ``late'' universe primarily the presence of the ``square-root'' nonlinear gauge field dynamically triggers both the appearance of QCD-like confinement and dynamical generation of the Higgs effect, as well as dynamical generation of non-zero cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Formulation of Relativistic Magnetohydrodynamic Accretion on a General Spherically Symmetric and Static Black Hole: Quantum effects on Shock States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, our aim is to extend our earlier work [A. K. Ahmed et al., Eur. Phys. J. C (2016) 76:280] thereby investigating an axisymmetric plasma flow with the angular momentum onto a spherical black hole. To accomplish that goal, we focus on the case that the ideal magnetohydrodynamic approximation is valid and utilizing certain conservation laws which arise from certain symmetries of the system. After formulating a Hamiltonian of the physical system, we solve the Hamilton equations and look for critical solutions of (both in and out) flows. Reflecting the difference from the Schwarzschild spacetime, the positions of sonic points (fast magnetosonic point, slow magnetosonic point, Alfv\'en point) are altered. We explore several kinds of flows including critical, non-critical, global, magnetically arrested and shock induced. Lastly we analyze the shock states near a specific quantum corrected Schwarzschild black hole and deduce that quantum effects do not favor shock states by pushing the shock location outward.</description>

      <title>Black holes, photon sphere, and cosmology in ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The improved version of ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity introduced in Phys.~Lett.~B \textbf{631} (2005), 1-6 is proposed and investigated. It is demonstrated that improved ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity may be consistently applied to describe the expanding universe (with horizon) as well as the static spacetime like black holes. Interestingly, such a theory looks like a close avatar of scalar-Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with the only difference that the scalar field is not a dynamical one so that many predictions of ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity are very similar to that of sEGB gravity.
  We discuss the gravitational wave in the improved model with the condition that the propagating speed of the gravitational wave is identical to that of the propagation speed of light. A model that describes inflation in the early universe and could satisfy the observational constraints is also constructed. The solution of ghost-free $f(\mathcal{G})$ gravity realising the given static spacetime with spherical symmetry is proposed. Some of such solutions realise explicitly the Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black hole or the Hayward black hole, which is a regular black hole without curvature singularity, We also construct a black hole in our theory which contains the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) mass, the horizon radius, and the radius of the photon sphere as independent parameters. The radius of the black hole shadow in this model as well as photon sphere radius are estimated. It is shown that there exists a parameter region which satisfies the constraints coming from Event Horizon Telescope observations. Furthermore, we construct model where the radius of the black hole shadow or photon orbit is smaller than the horizon radius supposed from the ADM mass.</description>

      <title>On destabilising quasi-normal modes with a radially concentrated perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we explore some aspects of the spectral instability of back hole quasi-normal modes, using a specific model as an example. The model is that of a small bump perturbation to the effective potential of linear axial gravitational waves on a Schwarzschild background, and our focus is on three different aspects of the instability: identifying and distinguishing between the two different types of instabilities studied previously in the literature, quantifying the size of the perturbations applied to the system and testing the validity of the pseudospectral numerical method in providing a convergent result for this measure, and finally, relating the size and other features of the perturbation to the degree of destabilisation of the spectrum.</description>

      <title>Spin induction from scattering of two spinning black holes in dense clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study with numerical relativity the spin induction effect within close hyperbolic encounters for equal-mass black holes. We review the initially nonspinning case and explore the cases of initially aligned, anti-aligned and orthogonal spins with respect to the orbital angular momentum $\vec L$. We find that, for a given initial effective spin, the black hole with a smaller initial spin acquires a greater spin-up than the other black hole after the close hyperbolic encounter. We study three different scenarios regarding initial effective spin ($\chi_{\rm eff}=-0.1, \ 0.0, \ 0.1$), using three different scattering angles in order to obtain maximally spin-inducing scenarios. We also find that the final effective spins with respect to the initial spins are well-fitted by a parabola. When considering spins orthogonal to $\vec L$, we observe that the black hole spins precess, and that the induced spin in the $z$-direction depends quadratically on the value of the initial spins. These new phenomena suggest that dense black hole clusters are very interesting dynamical systems where black hole spins may acquire a non trivial distribution, both for aligned and isotropic spins.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we meticulously construct a 3-form Lagrangian designed to mimic the dynamics of both dust matter in the past and dark energy driving the acceleration in the present era. A dynamical systems approach is used to investigate the underlying behavior of the cosmological background. By investigating the influence of the potential slope and initial conditions on the dynamical solutions, we identify distinct viable scenarios capable of replicating a De Sitter universe in the present epoch. An intriguing aspect of the model is the existence of solutions describing multiple inflationary phases in which the 3-form self-interacting potential decays rapidly.</description>

      <title>Squeezed vacua and primordial features in effective theories of inflation at N2LO</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11812v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A finite duration of cosmic inflation can result in features $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}(k)=|\alpha_k-\beta_k\,\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\delta_k}|^2 \mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}^{(0)}(k)$ in the primordial power spectrum that carry information about a quantum gravity phase before inflation. While the almost-scale-invariant power spectrum $\mathcal{P}_{\mathcal{R}}^{(0)}$ for the quasi-Bunch-Davies vacuum is fully determined by the inflationary background dynamics, the Bogoliubov coefficients $\alpha_k$ and $\beta_k$ for the squeezed vacuum depend on new physics beyond inflation and have been used to produce phenomenological templates for the features. In this paper, we consider a large class of effective theories of inflation and compute the relative phase $\delta_k$. While this phase vanishes in de Sitter space, here we show that it is fully determined by the inflationary background dynamics and we compute it up to the next-to-next-leading order (N2LO) in a Hubble-flow expansion. In particular, for the Starobinsky model of inflation we find that this relative phase can be expressed in terms of the scalar tilt $n_\mathrm{s}$ as $\delta_k=\frac{\pi}{2}(n_\mathrm{s}-1)-\frac{\pi}{4}(n_\mathrm{s}-1)^2\,\ln(k/k_*)$. The relative phase results in a negative shift and a running frequency that have been considered in the most studied phenomenological templates for primordial features, thus providing precise theoretical predictions for upcoming cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Positivity Bounds on parity-violating scalar-tensor EFTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using dispersion relations of the scattering amplitudes and semi-definite programming, we calculate causality bounds on the Wilson coefficients in scalar-tensor effective field theories that include parity-violating operators. Particular attention has been paid to the dynamical-Chern-Simons (dCS) and scalar-Gauss-Bonnet (sGB) couplings, along with higher order coefficients, and the interplay between them. For the leading terms, the bounds on the parity-conserving and -violating coefficients are simply projections of the complex coefficients. Some parity-violating coefficients are found to be upper bounded by the the parity-conserving counterparts, or the higher order parity-conserving coefficients. While the observational constraints on parity-violating coefficients are weaker than the parity-conserving counterparts, the causality bounds are of comparable strength and thus may play a more prominent role in constraining strong gravity effects in upcoming observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed the longest numerical-relativity neutrino-radiation magnetohydrodynamics simulation for a binary neutron star merger that extends to $\approx1.5\mathrm{\,s}$ after the merger. We consider the binary model that undergoes the prompt collapse to a black hole after the merger with asymmetric mass 1.25$\,M_{\odot}$ and 1.65$\,M_{\odot}$ and SFHo equation of state. We find the Poynting flux-driven collimated outflow as well as the gravitational wave emission, neutrino emission, dynamical mass ejection, and post-merger mass ejection facilitated by magnetorotational instability-driven turbulent viscosity in a single self-consistent binary neutron star merger simulation. A magnetosphere dominated by the aligned global magnetic field penetrating the black hole develops along the black-hole spin axis after the turbulence in the remnant disk is enhanced. A jet with the Poynting flux with isotropic-equivalent luminosity of $\sim10^{49}\mathrm{\,erg/s}$ is launched, and the duration of the high luminosity is expected to be $O(1)\mathrm{\,s}$.</description>

Abstract: We investigate time delays of gravitational wave and scalar wave scatterings around black hole backgrounds in scalar-Gauss-Bonnet effective field theories of gravity. By requiring infrared causality, we impose a lower bound on the cutoff scale of the theories. With this bound, we further discuss the detectability of scalar-Gauss-Bonnet gravity in gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers. Comparing with the gravitational effective field theories that only contain the two tensor modes, adding a scalar degree of freedom opens up a detectable window in the planned observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10996v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an inflation scenario with three independent stages of cold, warm and thermal inflation, respectively, driven by different scalar fields, motivated by the large number of such fields predicted in most extensions of the Standard Model. We show, in particular, that the intermediate period of warm inflation naturally leads to large density fluctuations on small scales, which can lead to primordial black hole formation in the mass window where they may account for all dark matter. This type of scenario yields a distinctive primordial black hole mass function with a mass gap, with the final period of thermal inflation diluting the abundance of very light black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11029v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A common feature of the extended phase space of gauge theory, the crossed product of quantum theory, and quantum reference frames (QRFs) is the adjoining of degrees of freedom followed by a constraining procedure for the resulting total system. Building on previous work, we identify non-commutative or quantum geometry as a mathematical framework which unifies these three objects. We first provide a rigorous account of the extended phase space, and demonstrate that it can be regarded as a classical principal bundle with a Poisson manifold base. We then show that the crossed product is a trivial quantum principal bundle which both substantiates a conjecture on the quantization of the extended phase space and facilitates a relational interpretation. Combining several crossed products with possibly distinct structure groups into a single object, we arrive at a novel definition of a quantum orbifold. We demonstrate that change of frame maps within the quantum orbifold correspond to quantum gauge transformations, which are QRF preserving maps between crossed product algebras. Finally, we conclude that the quantum orbifold is equivalent to the G-framed algebra proposed in prior work, thereby placing systems containing multiple QRFs squarely in the context of quantum geometry.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Axio-dilaton Dark Sector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In scalar-tensor theories it is the two-derivative sigma-model interactions that like to compete at low energies with the two-derivative interactions of General Relativity (GR) $\unicode{x2014}$ at least once the dangerous zero-derivative terms of the scalar potential are suppressed (such as by a shift symmetry). But nontrivial two-derivative interactions require at least two scalars to exist and so never arise in the single-scalar models most commonly explored. Axio-dilaton models provide a well-motivated minimal class of models for which these self-interactions can be explored. We review this class of models and investigate whether these minimal two fields can suffice to describe both Dark Matter and Dark Energy. We find that they can $\unicode{x2014}$ the axion is the Dark Matter and the dilaton is the Dark Energy $\unicode{x2014}$ and that they robustly predict several new phenomena for the CMB and structure formation that can be sought in observations. These include specific types of Dark Energy evolution and small space- and time-dependent changes to particle masses post-recombination that alter the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe effect, cause small changes to structure growth and more.</description>

      <title>Spectrum of high-frequency gravitational waves from graviton bremsstrahlung by the decay of inflaton: case with polynomial potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the generation of high-frequency gravitational waves (GWs) through graviton bremsstrahlung during the decay of inflaton in the post-inflationary universe, focusing on scenarios with a polynomial inflaton potential. Two main reheating channels are considered: decays into bosons (spin 0) and fermions (spin $\frac{1}{2}$). We compute the resulting GW spectra from three-body decays, where the inflaton decays into a pair of daughter particles and a graviton. We numerically compute the GW spectra for various polynomial exponents by employing two distinct approaches: one treating the inflaton as a collection of rest particles and the other treating it as a coherently oscillating classical field. In the former approach, only gravitons with energies below half the inflaton mass are produced, while the latter allows for the production of gravitons with arbitrarily high energies when the potential exponent is 4 or greater. This difference arises because the inflaton's oscillations are no longer described by a single harmonic mode but instead consist of infinitely many harmonic modes with different frequencies. As a result, the GW spectrum exhibits multiple peaks, with these peaks being less pronounced for higher powers of the potential. We also examine the dependence of the GW spectrum on the coupling constant between the inflaton and daughter particles. Our findings suggest that future GW detectors targeting GWs in the GHz band, such as resonant cavities, may have the capability to detect these signals, offering potential insights into the reheating phase of the early universe.</description>

      <title>Towards a classification of UV completable Higgs inflation in metric-affine gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Towards a classification of UV completable Higgs inflation in the framework of parity-even metric-affine gravity, we investigate the particle spectrum of a deformed theory in the large-$N$ limit. In a simple Higgs inflation model in metric-affine gravity, it is known that its UV cutoff is much smaller than the Planck scale. While it calls for UV completion, a concrete example has not yet been found, even with the large-$N$ limit known as a successful technique to complete an original Higgs inflation defined on the Riemannian geometry. This motivates us to study how small deformation of the simple Higgs inflation affects the emergence and properties of dynamical fields particularly in the large-$N$ limit. As a UV theory has to be free of ghosts or tachyons at least around Minkowski space, we perform the parameter search and find the healthy parameter region where a new heavy particle can propagate without these pathologies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate pure geometric $f(R)$ cosmology branes embedded in five-dimensional spacetime. The form of $f(R)$ is chosen as a polynomial. The Five-dimensional scalar curvature $R$ is assumed to be constant. Based on the value of the four-dimensional cosmological constant $\lambda_4$, the branes can be classified into Minkowski, de Sitter, and de anti-de Sitter cases. Solutions for each case can be calculated. These solutions are stable against linear tensor perturbations in all cases. In the Minkowski brane case, the zero mode of gravity can be localized on the brane. In the de Sitter brane case, the zero mode and one massive Kaluza-Klein mode can be localized on the brane. In the anti-de Sitter brane case, all massive Kaluza-Klein modes can be localized on the brane. The results of the analysis of tensor fluctuations are the same in both the Einstein frame and the Jordan frame.</description>

Abstract: Strong gravity in the immediate vicinity of compact objects (e.g., black holes, neutron stars) necessitates inclusion of general relativistic effects. Traditionally, pseudo-Newtonian potential representation of gravity were favored to simulate the fluid motion in this region since that reduced the calculation complexity. However, with the advent of easily implementable, reliable numerical algorithms and computer hardware, more and more research groups are shifting towards the numerical solutions of general relativistic fluid dynamics equations. In this work, we report our progress on the development of such simulation tool and present results of sub-Keplerian accretion flow onto black holes.</description>

      <title>Quantum Corrections to Holographic Strange Metal at Low Temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The holographic approach to the strange metal phase relies on near-extremal asymptotically AdS$_4$ electrically charged black branes with important input from their AdS$_2$ near-horizon throat geometry. Motivated by the current understanding of the role of quantum fluctuations in the throat of near-extremal black holes, we revisit some transport properties. We model quantum gravitational and gauge fluctuations in the throat region by adopting results in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity, effectively leading to quantum corrections for the dual CFT$_1$ Green's function in the near-horizon infrared region. We use the quantum-corrected Green's function to compute the conductivity for (2+1)-dimensional holographic strange metals and obtain corrections for the DC resistivity and the optical conductivity. We also compare the quantum-corrected holographic approach with results from the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and point out qualitative differences. Although experimental detection for the quantum-corrected holographic approach to the DC resistivity requires higher precision than current experimental accuracy, future experiments with improved technologies could detect these quantum corrections. Interestingly, including quantum corrections to the optical conductivity does provide a plausible explanation for the experimental anomalous power-law behavior detected in various strange metals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields are frequently used in modern physics, for example, as candidates for dark energy or dark matter. Open quantum dynamical effects, like frequency shifts, induced by such fields in probe particles used in interferometry experiments might open up new perspectives for constraining such models. In this article, we consider a probe scalar particle as a rough approximation for an atom in matter wave interferometry and discuss the frequency shifts induced by interactions with an environment comprising either one of two screened scalar field models: chameleons or symmetrons. For the $n=-4$ chameleon, we revise a previously obtained expression for the induced frequency shift, but confirm that it can likely not be used to obtain new constraints. However, for symmetrons, we find that induced frequency shifts have the potential to tightly constrain previously unreachable parts of the parameter space.</description>

      <title>Breaking Parity: the case of the Trispectrum from Chiral Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.11801v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, possible hints of parity violation have been observed in the connected galaxy four-point correlation function. Although the true origin of the signal from the analysis has been debated, should they have a physical origin, they might point to primordial non-Gaussianity and would be evidence of new physics. In this work, we examine the single-field slow-roll model of inflation within chiral scalar-tensor theories of modified gravity. These theories extend the Chern-Simons one by including parity-violating operators containing first and second derivatives of the non-minimally coupled scalar (inflaton) field. This model is capable of imprinting parity-violating signatures in late-time observables, such as the galaxy four-point correlation function. We perform an analysis of the graviton-mediated scalar trispectrum of the gauge-invariant curvature perturbation $\zeta(t,\mathbf{x})$. We estimate that for a set of parameters of the theory it is possible to produce a signal-to-noise ratio for the parity-violating part of the trispectrum of order one without introducing modifications to the single-field slow-roll setup. Even if the signal found in the analysis turns out to be spurious or if no parity violation is ever detected in the galaxy four-point correlation function, our analysis can be used to constrain the free parameters of these theories.</description>

Abstract: We propose a self-supervised learning model to denoise gravitational wave (GW) signals in the time series strain data without relying on waveform information. Denoising GW data is a crucial intermediate process for machine-learning-based data analysis techniques, as it can simplify the model for downstream tasks such as detections and parameter estimations. We use the blind-spot neural network and train it with whitened strain data with GW signals injected as both input data and target. Under the assumption of a Gaussian noise model, our model successfully denoises 38% of GW signals from binary black hole mergers in H1 data and 49% of signals in L1 data detected in the O1, O2, and O3 observation runs with an overlap greater than 0.5. We also test the model's potential to extract glitch features, loud inspiral compact binary coalescence signals a few seconds before the merger, and unseen CCSN signals during training.</description>

      <title>Rotating Fermion-Boson Stars</title>

Abstract: Rotating fermion-boson stars are hypothetical celestial objects that consist of both fermionic and bosonic matter interacting exclusively through gravity. Bosonic fields are believed to arise in certain models of particle physics describing dark matter and could accumulate within neutron stars, modifying some of their properties and gravitational wave emission. Fermion-boson stars have been extensively studied in the static non-rotating case, exploring their combined stability and their gravitational radiation in binary mergers. However, stationary rotating configurations were yet to be found and investigated. The presence of a bosonic component could impact the development of the bar-mode instability in differentially rotating neutron stars. Therefore, the study of rotating fermion-boson stars has important implications for astrophysics, as they could provide a new avenue for the detection of gravitational waves. In addition, these objects may shed light on the behavior of matter under extreme conditions, such as those found in the cores of neutron stars, and explain any tension in the determination of the dense-matter equation of state from multi-messenger observations. In this work we study a new consistent method of constructing uniformly rotating fermion-boson stars and we analyse some of their main properties. These objects might offer alternative explanations for current observations populating the lower black-hole mass gap, as the $2.6 M_\odot$ compact object involved in GW190814.</description>

      <title>Sensing Gravity with Polarized Electromagnetic Radiation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06513v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polarization wiggling is a direct gravitational effect exerted by a gravitational field on any electromagnetic radiation traversing it. This effect is investigated in linear gravity for spacetimes with flat or conformally flat backgrounds. First, we show how the polarization wiggle rates can be computed in the conformal frame and transformed to the physical frame. Then it is shown that polarization wiggling is not sensitive to scalar perturbations to the metric, while vector and tensor perturbations do induce polarization wiggling. This poses two natural questions: Can polarized electromagnetic radiation be used to measure vectorial and tensorial components of gravitational fields directly? And if so, how? Next, polarization wiggling is studied for an arbitrary vector perturbation to the spacetime metric. In a stationary spacetime, the polarization wiggle rate is proportional to the difference in frame dragging rates between radiation emission and measurement events. We show how this can be used to measure the angular momentum of a gravitational source if the emitter orbits the gravitational source on a known orbit. Next, the effect of a gravitational tensor mode with arbitrary polarization is studied. Finally, the polarization wiggling effect induced by a gravitational tensor mode is analyzed. Two cases are demonstrated: A spacetime with a flat Minkowski background and an expanding cosmology with a conformally flat background. In both cases, the polarization wiggling frequency equals the frequency of the gravitational tensor mode, while the other state parameters are encoded in the polarization wiggling amplitude and phase of the polarized radiation. We show that measurements of polarization wiggling frequency, amplitude and phase of polarized radiation from different directions enables all state parameters of a gravitational tensor mode to be determined.</description>

      <title>Theory of interacting vector dark energy and fluid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06565v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study interaction between dark energy and dark matter, where dark energy is described by a massive vector field, and dark matter is modelled as a fluid. We present a new interaction term, which affects only perturbations and can give interesting phenomenology. Then we present a general Lagrangian for the interacting vector dark energy with dark matter. For the dark energy, we choose Proca theory with $G_{3}$ term to study its phenomenological consequence. For this model, we explore both background and perturbation dynamics. We also present the no-ghost condition for tensor modes, vector modes and scalar modes. Subsequently, we also study the evolution of the overdensities of both baryon and cold dark matter in the high$-k$ limit. We show that the effective gravitational coupling is modified for cold dark matter and baryon. We also choose a simple concrete model and numerically show a suppression of the effective gravitational coupling for cold dark matter. However, in this simple model, the suppression of the effective gravitational coupling does not result in a suppression of the matter overdensity compared to that in the $\Lambda$CDM model due to the modified background expansion.</description>

Abstract: After initial tests performed during previous observing runs, a Newtonian Calibrator (NCal) system was developed and installed on the Virgo gravitational wave detector for the O4 observing run. This system, which is continuously operated, provides the absolute calibration of Virgo for this run. Its $1\mbox{-}\sigma$ uncertainty of $0.17\%$ on the amplitudes of the injected signals is better than that obtained with other calibration techniques like the photon calibrator (PCal). This paper presents this NCal system and details the different sources of uncertainties</description>

      <title>Strong field behavior of Wang-Yau Quasi-local energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10751v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We look at the strong field behavior of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy. In particular, we examine the limit of the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy as the defining spacelike $2$-surface $\Sigma$ approaches an apparent horizon from outside. Assuming that coordinate functions of the isometric embedding are bounded in $W^{2,1}$ and mean curvature vector of the image surface remains spacelike, we find that the limit falls in two exclusive cases: 1) If the horizon cannot be isometrically embedded into $R^3$, the Wang-Yau quasi-local energy blows up as $\Sigma$ approaches the horizon while the optimal embedding equation is not solvable for $\Sigma$ near the horizon; 2) If the horizon can be isometrically embedded into $R^3$, the optimal embedding equation is solvable up to the horizon with the unique solution at the horizon corresponding to isometric embedding into $R^3$ and the Wang-Yau quasi-local mass admits a finite limit at the horizon. We discuss the implications of our results in the conclusion section.</description>

      <title>Black Holes, Warp Drives, and Energy Conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04495v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following the work of H. Ellis, we study warp drives in the gravitational field of a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that as long as the warp drive crosses the black hole horizon at a subluminal speed, the horizon would be effectively absent inside the warp bubble. Moreover, we discover that the black hole's gravitational field can alleviate the violations of the weak energy condition (WEC) and the null energy condition (NEC) and therefore decrease the amount of negative energy required to sustain a warp drive, which may be instrumental for creating microscopic warp drives in lab experiments. We also consider the thermodynamics of a warp bubble interacting with a black hole and point out some paradoxes that may indicate a gap in our understanding of them from the thermodynamic point of view.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we revise the concept of foliation and related aspects that are crucial when formulating the Hamiltonian evolution for various theories beyond General Relativity. In particular, we show the relation between the kinematic characteristics of timelike congruences (observers) and the existence of foliations orthogonal to them. We then explore how local Lorentz transformations acting on observers affect the existence of transversal foliations, provide examples, and discuss the implications of these results for the $3+1$ formulation of tetrad modified theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>STEGR in Internal-Space Formulation: Formalisms, Primary Constraints, and Possible Internal Symmetries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04848v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the theories of Symmetric Teleparallel Equivalent to General Relativity (STEGR) in the internal-space and investigate possible internal-space symmetries among primary constraint densities in the theories. First of all, we revisit STEGR in terms of the gauge approach to gravity and formulate that in the internal-space set-up. We find three possible formalisms according to the vanishing-torsion property. Then, we investigate possible internal-space symmetries in each formalism. We find that in our formulation there are two possible symmetries. One satisfies the translation symmetry but broken in the local symmetry provided by the general linear group which contains the local Lorentz symmetry. The other satisfies the latter symmetry but is absent in the former symmetry. Finally, we conclude this work and show future perspectives.</description>

      <title>Influence of GUP corrected Casimir energy on zero tidal force wormholes in modified teleparallel gravity with matter coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent times, the study of the Casimir effect in quantum field theory has garnered increasing attention because of its potential to be an ideal source of exotic matter needed for stabilizing traversable wormholes. It has been confirmed through experimental evidence that this phenomenon involves fluctuations in the vacuum field, leading to a negative energy density. Motivated by the above, we have investigated Casimir wormholes with corrections from the Generalized Uncertainty Principle (GUP) within the framework of matter-coupled teleparallel gravity. Our analysis includes three well-known GUP models: the Kempf, Mangano, and Mann (KMM) model, the Detournay, Gabriel, and Spindel (DGS) model, and a third model called Model II. For a broader analysis, we have considered two well-known model functions for the teleparallel theory: a linear $f(T,\mathcal{T})=\alpha T+\beta\mathcal{T}$ and a quadratic model $f(T,\mathcal{T})=\eta T^2+\chi\mathcal{T}$. The shape function solutions corresponding to both models are examined in the absence of tidal forces in spacetime. We also demonstrate the crucial role played by the parameters of the $f(T,\mathcal{T})$ models in the violation of the energy conditions. With the increasing interest in detecting gravitational waves from astrophysical objects, we have thoroughly discussed the perturbation of the wormhole solutions in the scalar, electromagnetic, axial gravitational, and Dirac field backgrounds. We employ the $3^{rd}$ order WKB expansion to find the complex frequencies associated with the quasinormal modes of energy dissipation. Additionally, we also calculate the active mass and total gravitational energy for the wormhole geometry. The amount of exotic matter involved in sustaining these wormholes is also found in this paper. Furthermore, the physical stability of such Casimir wormholes is examined using the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equation.</description>

Abstract: We discuss the problem of canonical quantization of electromagnetic field in the Schwarzschild spacetime. It is shown that a consistent procedure of canonical quantization of the field can be carried out without taking into account the internal region of the black hole. We prove that there exists a unitary gauge, which can be viewed as a combination of the Coulomb and Poincare gauges and is compatible with the field equations. The solutions corresponding to the stationary one-particle states of the electromagnetic field are studied, the canonical commutation relations and the Hamiltonian of the quantized electromagnetic field are obtained.</description>

      <title>Torsional oscillations of magnetized neutron stars: Impacts of Landau-Rabi quantization of electron motion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05676v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Torsional oscillations of magnetized neutron stars have been well studied since they may be relevant to the physical interpretation of some of the observed quasiperiodic oscillations in the magnetar giant flares. In the crustal region of a magnetar, the strong magnetic field can alter the equation of state and composition due to the Landau-Rabi quantization of electron motion. In this paper, we study this effect on the crust-confined, torsional oscillation modes of neutron stars with mixed poloidal-toroidal magnetic fields in general relativity under the Cowling approximation. Furthermore, the inner and outer crusts are treated consistently based on the nuclear-energy density functional theory. Depending on the magnetic-field configurations, we find that the Landau-Rabi quantization of electrons can change the frequencies of the fundamental torsional oscillation mode of $1.4 M_\odot$ neutron star models with a normal fluid core by about 10% when the magnetic field strength at the pole reaches the order of $10^{16}$ G. The shift can even approach 20% at a field strength of $10^{15}$ G for neutron stars with a simple model of superconducting core where the magnetic field is assumed to be expelled completely.</description>

      <title>Mach's principle and dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we entertain a Machian setting where local physics is non-locally affected by the whole Universe, taking the liberty to identify the local (``Newton's bucket'') with our visible Universe, and the whole Universe (Mach's ``fixed stars'') with the global Universe beyond our horizon. Crucially, we allow for the two to have different properties, so that we are beyond the traditional FRW setting. For definiteness we focus on theories where non-locality arises from evolution in the laws of physics in terms of spatially global time variables dual to the constants of Nature. Since non-local theories are foliation-dependent, the {\it local} (but not the global) Hamiltonian constraint is lost. This is true not only while non-locality is taking place, but also after it ceases: the local Hamiltonian constraint is only recovered up to a constant in time, keeping a memory of the integrated past non-locality. We show that this integration constant is equivalent to preserving the local Hamiltonian constraint and adding an extra fluid with the same cosmological properties as conventional pressureless dark matter. The equivalence breaks down in terms of clustering properties, with the new component attracting other matter, but not budging from its location. This is the ultimate ``painted-on'' dark matter, attracting but not being attracted, and nailing down a preferred frame.</description>

      <title>Role of local anisotropy in hybrid stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the Bower-Liang model, we discuss how pressure anisotropies affect the microscopic and macroscopic properties of hybrid stars. We find that anisotropies affect the maximum mass, central density, and radius of the canonical stars. Anisotropies also affect the minimum neutron star mass that presents quarks in their core, as well as the total amount of quarks for the maximally massive stars. We also confront our results with standard constraints, such as the radius and the tidal parameter of the canonical star, as well as the mass and radius of the PSR J0740+6620 pulsar. We observe that moderate values for anisotropies could fulfill these constraints simultaneously. On the other hand, within more extreme degrees of anisotropies, more speculative constraints such as black widow pulsars PSR J0952-0607 and the mass-gap object in the GW190814 event can be explained as hybrid stars. We also investigate the role of anisotropies in the neutron stars' moment of inertia.</description>

Abstract: Soft hairs are an intrinsic infrared feature of a black hole, which may also affect near-horizon physics. In this work, we study some of the subtleties surrounding one of the primary observables with which we can study their effects in the context of Einstein's gravity: the black hole shadow. First, we clarify the singular pathology associated with black holes with soft hairs and demonstrate the metrics of linearly superrotated black holes are free of near-zone pathologies due to appropriate asymptotic falloff conditions imposed on the event horizon. We then analytically construct the photon orbits around such black holes and derive the shadow equation, and find that the linear superrotation hairs will deform the circular shadow of a bald Schwarzchild black hole into ellipses. This is in sharp contrast to their supertranslated counterparts, which only shift the position of the center of the circular shadow but do not change its shape. Our results suggest a richness to the observable effects due to the infrared structures of Einstein's gravity and demand their observations by future black hole imaging projects.</description>

      <title>The Absolute Swampland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20386v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ``Swampland Program'' aims to discriminate consistent-looking effective field theories that do not admit a UV completion in quantum gravity from those that do. While most often developed under the umbrella of string theory, several swampland criteria have been explored also in other contexts, especially asymptotically safe gravity. A comparison between different approaches can help to clarify the dependence of low-energy constraints on UV physics and thereby shed light on the universality of quantum gravity itself. In this short review we summarise what is known about three important swampland conjectures in string theory and in asymptotic safety. We point out future lines of research that can help to understand to what extent swampland conjectures are absolute, i.e. hold in quantum gravity in general, or relative, i.e. belong only to a specific UV framework.</description>

      <title>Multiple peaks in gravitational waves induced from primordial curvature perturbations with non-Gaussianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05034v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: First-order primordial curvature perturbations are known to induce gravitational waves at the second-order, which can in turn probe the small-scale curvature perturbations near the end of the inflation. In this work, we extend the previous analysis in the Gaussian case into the non-Gaussian case, with particular efforts to obtain some thumb rules of sandwiching the associated peaks in gravitational waves induced from multiple peaks of non-Gaussian curvature perturbations.</description>

      <title>Dynamics around supermassive black holes: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals as gravitational-wave sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19443v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supermassive black holes and their surrounding dense stellar environments nourish a variety of astrophysical phenomena. We focus on the distribution of stellar-mass black holes around the supermassive black hole and the consequent formation of extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). We derive a steady-state distribution, considering the effects of two-body scatterings and gravitational wave emission, and calculate the EMRI formation rate, eccentricity distribution and EMRI-to-plunge ratio. Our model predicts: (I) A stronger segregation than previously estimated at the outskirts of the sphere of influence (at $\sim0.01\rm pc$ to $2\rm pc$ for a Milky Way-like galaxy). (II) An increased EMRI-to-plunge ratio, favoring EMRIs at galaxies where stellar-mass black holes are scarce. (III) A detection of about $2\times10^3$ resolvable EMRIs, with a signal-to-noise ratio above $20$, along a $4$ year LISA mission time. (IV) A confusion noise, induced by a cosmological population of unresolved EMRIs, reducing LISA sensitivity in the $1-5\ \rm mHz$ frequency range by up to a factor of $\approx2$, relative to the instrumental noise.</description>

      <title>Quantum Time and the Time-Dilation induced Interaction Transfer mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00161</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00161v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a bipartite quantum system in an energy eigenstate, the dynamical description for one component can be derived via entanglement using the other component as a clock. This is the essence of the Page and Wootters mechanism. Moreover, if the clock is subject to a gravitational-like interaction, relative time evolution is then described by a Time-Dilated Schr\"odinger equation, in which the so-called Redshift Operator describes a purely quantum effect, analogue to gravitational time-dilation. Here we adopt a non-perturbative approach and present a finite-dimensional generalisation of this mechanism, expressing the quantum time-dilation effect as an effective interaction involving previously non-interacting system components. We name this a Time-Dilation induced Interaction Transfer (TiDIT) mechanism and discuss an example using two coupled spins as a quantum clock model. Our approach is suitable for implementations in current quantum technology and provides a new tool for exploring gravity at the intersection with quantum physics.</description>

      <title>Expected insights on type Ia supernovae from LISA's gravitational wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nature of progenitors of Type Ia supernovae has long been debated, primarily due to the elusiveness of the progenitor systems to traditional electromagnetic observation methods. We argue that gravitational wave observations with the upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) offer the most promising way to test one of the leading progenitor scenarios - the double-degenerate scenario, which involves a binary system of two white dwarf stars. In this study we review published results, supplementing them with additional calculations for the context of Type Ia supernovae. We discuss the fact that LISA will be able to provide a complete sample of double white dwarf Type Ia supernova progenitors with orbital periods shorter than 16-11 minutes (gravitational wave frequencies above 2-3 millihertz). Such a sample will enable a statistical validation of the double-degenerate scenario by simply counting whether LISA detects enough double white dwarf binaries to account for the measured Type Ia merger rate in Milky Way-like galaxies. Additionally, we illustrate how LISA's capability to measure the chirp mass will set lower bounds on the primary mass, revealing whether detected double white dwarf binaries will eventually end up as a Type Ia supernova. We estimate that the expected LISA constraints on the Type Ia merger rate for the Milky Way will be 4-9%. We also discuss the potential gravitational wave signal from a Type Ia supernova assuming a double-detonation mechanism and explore how multi-messenger observations could significantly advance our understanding of these transient phenomena.</description>

      <title>On the uncertainty of the White Dwarf Astrophysical Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10642v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context: The astrophysical gravitational wave background (AGWB) is a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) signal that is emitted by different populations of inspiralling binary systems containing compact objects throughout the Universe. In the frequency range between 0.1 and 100 mHz it will be detected by future space-based gravitational wave detectors like the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). Recently, we concluded that the white dwarf (WD) contribution to the AGWB dominates over that of black holes (BHs) and neutron stars (NSs).
  Aims: We aim to investigate the uncertainties of the WD AGWB that arise from the use of different stellar metallicities, different star formation rate density (SFRD) models, and different binary evolution models.
  Methods: We use the code developed before to determine the WD component of the AGWB. We use a metallicity dependent SFRD based on earlier work to construct five different SFRD models. We use four different population models that use different common-envelope treatment and six different metallicities for each model.
  Results: For all possible combinations, the WD component of the AGWB is dominant over other populations of compact objects. The effects of metallicity and population model are smaller than the effect of a (metallicity dependent) SFRD model. We find a range of about a factor of 5 in the level of the WD AGWB around a mid value of $\Omega_{\rm WD} = 4\times10^{-12}$ at 1 mHz and a shape that depends weakly on the model.
  Conclusions: We find an uncertainty for the WD component of the AGWB of about a factor 5. We note that there exist other uncertainties that have an effect on this signal as well. We discuss whether the turnover of the WD AGWB at 10 mHz will be detectable by LISA, and find that this is likely. We confirm the previous finding that the WD component of the AGWB dominates over other populations, in particular BHs.</description>

      <title>Gravity from AKSZ-Manin theories in two, three, and four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10755v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that various dynamical gauge theories in two, three and four dimensions, which are obtained as Manin deformations of topological Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky theories, are equivalent to gravitational theories. Since gravity is topological in two and three dimension, this equivalence requires a diffeomorphism breaking background source term. In four dimensions, however, the MacDowell-Mansouri formulation of Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant is obtained identically via the Manin deformation of a particular Alexandrov-Kontsevich-Schwarz-Zaboronsky theory.</description>
