      <title>$M$-TF equivalences in the real Grothendieck groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For an abelian length category $\mathcal{A}$ with only finitely many isoclasses of simple objects, we have the wall-chamber structure and the TF equivalence in the dual real Grothendeick group $K_0(\mathcal{A})_\mathbb{R}^*=\operatorname{Hom}_\mathbb{R}(K_0(\mathcal{A})_\mathbb{R},\mathbb{R})$, which are defined by semistable subcategories and semistable torsion pairs in $\mathcal{A}$ associated to elements $\theta \in K_0(\mathcal{A})_\mathbb{R}^*$. In this paper, we introduce the $M$-TF equivalence for each object $M \in \mathcal{A}$ as a systematic way to coarsen the TF equivalence. We show that the set $\Sigma(M)$ of the closures of $M$-TF equivalence classes is a finite complete fan in $K_0(\mathcal{A})_\mathbb{R}^*$, and that $\Sigma(M)$ is the normal fan of the Newton polytope $\mathrm{N}(M)$ in $K_0(\mathcal{A})_\mathbb{R}$.</description>

      <title>Quasi-Frobenius Novikov algebras and pre-Novikov bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-Novikov algebras and quasi-Frobenius Novikov algebras naturally appear in the theory of Novikov bialgebras. In this paper, we show that there is a natural pre-Novikov algebra structure associated to a quasi-Frobenius Novikov algebra. Then we introduce the definition of double constructions of quasi-Frobenius Novikov algebras associated to two pre-Novikov algebras and show that it is characterized by a pre-Novikov bialgebra. We also introduce the notion of pre-Novikov Yang-Baxter equation, whose symmetric solutions can produce pre-Novikov bialgebras. Moreover, the operator forms of pre-Novikov Yang-Baxter equation are also investigated.</description>

      <title>Weights for $\pi$-partial characters of $\pi$-separable groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to confirm an inequality predicted by Isaacs and Navarro in 1995, which asserts that for any $\pi'$-subgroup $Q$ of a $\pi$-separable group $G$, the number of $\pi'$-weights of $G$ with $Q$ as the first component always exceeds that of irreducible $\pi$-partial characters of $G$ with $Q$ as their vertex. We also give some sufficient condition to guarantee that these two numbers are equal, and thereby strengthen their main theorem on the $\pi$-version of the Alperin weight conjecture.</description>

      <title>Highest-weight vectors and three-point functions in GKO coset decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the classical Goddard-Kent-Olive coset construction. We find the formulas for the highest weight vectors in coset decomposition and calculate their norms. We also derive formulas for matrix elements of natural vertex operators between these vectors. This leads to relations on conformal blocks. Due to the AGT relation, these relations are equivalent to blowup relations on Nekrasov partition functions with the presence of the surface defect. These relations can be used to prove Kyiv formulas for the Painlev\'e tau-functions (following Nekrasov's method).</description>

      <title>The product of simple modules over KLR algebras and quiver Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.08244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2107.08244v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the product of two simple modules over KLR algebras using the quiver Grassmannians for Dynkin quivers. More precisely, we establish a bridge between the Induction functor on the category of modules of KLR algebras and the irreducible components of quiver Grassmannians for Dynkin quivers via a sort of extension varieties, which is an analogue of the extension group in Hall algebras. As a result, we give a necessary condition when the product of two simple modules over a KLR algebra is simple using the set of irreducible components of quiver Grassmannians. In particular, in some special cases, we provide a proof for the conjecture recently proposed by Lapid and Minguez.</description>

      <title>Semisimple elements and the little Weyl group of real semisimple $Z_m$-graded Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.03775v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the semisimple orbits of a Vinberg $\theta$-representation. First we take the complex numbers as base field. By a case by case analysis we show a technical result stating the equality of two sets of hyperplanes, one corresponding to the restricted roots of a Cartan subspace, the other corresponding to the complex reflections in the (little) Weyl group. The semisimple orbits have representatives in a finite number of sets that correspond to reflection subgroups of the (little) Weyl group. One of the consequences of our technical result is that the elements in a fixed such set all have the same stabilizer in the acting group. Secondly we study what happens when the base field is the real numbers. We look at Cartan subspaces and show that the real Cartan subspaces can be classified by the first Galois cohomology set of the normalizer of a fixed real Cartan subspace. In the real case the orbits can be classified using Galois cohomology. However, in order for that to work we need to know which orbits have a real representative. We show a theorem that characterizes the orbits of homogeneous semisimple elements that do have such a real representative. This closely follows and generalizes a theorem from \cite{bgl}.</description>

      <title>Bijection between positive clusters and projectively signed exceptional sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.05997v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2017, Igusa and Todorov gave a bijection between signed exceptional sequences and ordered partial clusters. In this paper, we show that every term in an exceptional sequence is either relatively projective or relatively injective or both and we refine this bijection to one between projectively signed exceptional sequences and ordered partial positive clusters by assigning signs to objects that are not relatively injective. We also give a characterization of relatively projective/injective objects in terms of supports of the objects in the exceptional sequence.</description>

Abstract: Let $\mathscr{C}$ be an extriangulated category with enough projectives and injectives. We give a new definition of tilting subcategories of $\mathscr{C}$ and prove it coincides with the definition given in [19]. As applications, we introduce the notions of support $\tau$-tilting subcategories and $\tau$-cotorsion pairs of $\mathscr{C}$. Then we show that there is a bijection between tilting subcategories and certain cotorsion pairs.</description>

      <title>Typical blocks of the category $\mathcal O$ and Whittaker modules for Takiff superalgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07894v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the simplicity of Kac induced modules over the $\ell$-th Takiff superalgebras $\widetilde{\mathfrak g}_\ell:= \widetilde{\mathfrak g}\otimes \mathbb C[\theta]/(\theta^{\ell+1})$, for $\ell&gt;0$, associated with the Lie superalgebras $\widetilde{\mathfrak g}$ of type I. We formulate a general notion of typical weights and typical Jordan blocks of the category $\mathcal O$ for $\widetilde{\mathfrak g}_\ell$ associated with Lie superalgebras $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$, $\mathfrak{osp}(2|2n)$ and $\mathfrak{pe}(n)$. For Lie superalgebras $\mathfrak{gl}(m|n)$ and $\mathfrak{osp}(2|2n)$, we establish an equivalence from an arbitrary typical Jordan block of the category $\mathcal O$ for $\widetilde{\mathfrak g}_\ell$ to a Jordan block of the category $\mathcal O$ for the even subalgebra of $\widetilde{\mathfrak g}_\ell$. This provides a solution to the problem of determining the composition multiplicities of the Verma modules over $\widetilde{\mathfrak g}_\ell$ with typical highest weights. We also investigate non-singular Whittaker modules over these Takiff superalgebras. In particular, we obtain a classification of non-singular simple Whittaker modules and a criterion for simplicity of non-singular standard Whittaker modules.</description>

      <title>Irreducible components in Hochschild cohomology of flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10266v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple, simply-connected complex algebraic group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, and $G/B$ the associated complete flag variety. The Hochschild cohomology $HH^\bullet(G/B)$ is a geometric invariant of the flag variety related to its generalized deformation theory and has the structure of a $\mathfrak{g}$-module. We study this invariant via representation-theoretic methods; in particular, we give a complete list of irreducible subrepresentations in $HH^\bullet(G/B)$ when $G=SL_n(\mathbb{C})$ or is of exceptional type (and conjecturally for all types) along with nontrivial lower bounds on their multiplicities. These results follow from a conjecture due to Kostant on the structure of the tensor product representation $V(\rho) \otimes V(\rho)$.</description>

Abstract: Fabian Januszewski and the author established the theory of twisted D-modules over general base schemes. In this short note, we construct a $K$-invariant positive exhaustive filtration on the globalization of the twisted D-module on a smooth quasi-compact $K$-scheme over a Dedekind scheme $S$ obtained by the direct image of a $K$-equivariant twisted integrable connection along a $K$-equivariant closed immersion from a smooth proper $K$-scheme $Y$ with $K$ a smooth $S$-affine group scheme, whose $p$th associated graded $\mathcal{O}_S$-module is locally free of finite rank for every integer $p$. In particular, the $k$-module of its global sections is projective if $S$ is affine with coordinate ring $k$.</description>

Abstract: A purely local approach has been developed by Krishnamurthy and Kutzko to compute Langlands-Shahidi local coefficient for ${\rm SL}(2)$ via types and covers \`{a} la Bushnell-Kutzko. In this paper, we extend their method to the non-split case and complete their project. We also study the algebraic structure of Gelfand-Graev representations, which generalizes the results of Chan-Savin and Mishra-Pattanayak to ${\rm SL}(2)$ over non-archimidean local fields without any restriction on the characteristic.</description>

      <title>A determinantal point process approach to scaling and local limits of random Young tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.11885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.11885v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain scaling and local limit results for large random Young tableaux of fixed shape $\lambda^0$ via the asymptotic analysis of a determinantal point process due to Gorin and Rahman (2019). More precisely, we prove:
  (1) an explicit description of the limiting surface of a uniform random Young tableau of shape $\lambda^0$, based on solving a complex-valued polynomial equation;
  (2) a simple criteria to determine if the limiting surface is continuous in the whole domain;
  (3) and a local limit result in the bulk of a random Poissonized Young tableau of shape $\lambda^0$.
  Our results have several consequences, for instance: they lead to explicit formulas for the limiting surface of $L$-shaped tableaux, generalizing the results of Pittel and Romik (2007) for rectangular shapes; they imply that the limiting surface for $L$-shaped tableaux is discontinuous for almost-every $L$-shape; and they give a new one-parameter family of infinite random Young tableaux, constructed from the so-called random infinite bead process.</description>

      <title>Symmetric varieties for endoscopic groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09156v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a quasi-split reductive group $G$ and a symmetric variety $X$, we introduce a notion of endoscopic varieties for $(G,X)$, and establish the foundational properties of these varieties such as matching of stable semi-simple orbits. To do this, we introduce certain automorphism groups of homogeneous spherical varieties, which encode the fine rational structure needed to work over non-algebraically closed fields. In particular, we establish the existence and uniqueness of the corresponding symmetric varieties under a mild restriction of the characteristic of the field of definition. We conjecture that this construction plays a role analogous to endoscopic groups in the context of the relative trace formula. As evidence, we show how our construction gives a pre-stabilization of regular elliptic terms of relative trace formulae for many pairs $(G,X)$.
  When the cotangent bundle of the symmetric variety is hyperspherical, we relate our theory to the Hamiltonian variety of the Langlands dual group introduced by Ben-Zvi, Sakellaridis, and Venkatesh, proving some structural conjectures for this variety in the symmetric setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that certain embeddings of Coxeter groups within other Coxeter groups are injective using the notion of Coxeter partitions. Moreover, we study Lusztig's partitions, which are generalizations of Lusztig's admissible maps and Crisp's foldings. We show that they classify the simplest type of Coxeter partitions, whose embeddings of Coxeter groups send each generator to a product of commuting generators. Consequently, these embeddings are also injective, and we prove that they preserve Coxeter numbers. These results were previously known, due to work of M\"{u}hlherr and Dyer.</description>

Abstract: We study path rings, Cohn path rings, and Leavitt path rings associated to directed graphs, with coefficients in an arbitrary ring $R$. For each of these types of rings, we stipulate conditions on the graph that are necessary and sufficient to ensure that the ring satisfies either the rank condition or the strong rank condition whenever $R$ enjoys the same property. In addition, we apply our result for path rings and the strong rank condition to characterize the graphs that give rise to amenable path algebras and exhaustively amenable path algebras.</description>

      <title>The Stanley-Stembridge Conjecture for $\bf 2 + 1 +1$-avoiding unit interval orders: a diagrammatic proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07280v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A natural unit interval order is a naturally labelled partially ordered set that avoids patterns ${\bf 3} + {\bf 1}$ and $\bf 2 + 2$. To each natural unit interval order one can associate a symmetric function. The Stanley-Stembridge conjecture states that each such symmetric function is positive in the basis of complete homogenous symmetric functions. This conjecture has connections to cohomology rings of Hessenberg varieties, and to Kazhdan-Lusztig theory. We use a diagrammatic technique to re-prove the special case of the conjecture for unit interval orders additionally avoiding pattern $\bf 2 + 1 + 1$. Originally this special case is due to Gebhard and Sagan.</description>
