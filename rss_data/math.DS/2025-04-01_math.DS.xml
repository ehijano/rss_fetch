      <title>Generalized entropy of induced zero-entropy systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a compact metric space $X$ and a continuous map $T: X \to X$, the induced hyperspace map $T_\mathcal{K}$ acts on the hyperspace $\mathcal{K}(X)$ of nonempty closed sets of $X$, and the measure-induced map $T_*$ acts on the space of probability measures $\mathcal{M}(X)$. It is proven that a large class of zero-entropy dynamical systems exhibits infinite metric mean dimension in its induced hyperspace map $T_\mathcal{K}$. This work also builds on the concept of generalized entropy, which is fundamental for studying the complexity of zero-entropy systems. Lower bounds of the generalized entropy of the measure-induced map $T_*$ are established, assuming that the base system $T$ has zero topological entropy. Moreover, upper bounds of the generalized entropy are explicitly computed for the measure-induced map of the Morse-Smale diffeomorphisms on the circle. Finally, it is shown that the generalized entropy of $T_*$ is a lower bound for the generalized entropy of $T_\mathcal{K}$.</description>

      <title>Transitive Anosov flows on non-compact manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22975v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study topological transitivity of Anosov flows on non-compact 3-manifolds. We provide homological conditions under which the lifts of a transitive Anosov flow to certain infinite covers of the manifold remain transitive. With some deep results in 3-manifold topology, we then deduce that such cover can be obtained for any non-graph manifold admitting a transitive Anosov flow. Moreover, for a large class of Anosov flows known as $\R$-covered, which are always transitive, we show that their lifts to any regular covers are either transitive or consist exclusively of wandering orbits. Finally, we construct a family of transitive Anosov flows on non-compact manifolds that satisfy a homotopical characterization of suspension flows, answering the flow version of a question concerning the existence of transitive Anosov diffeomorphisms on non-compact manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a continuous linear cocycle over an expanding base dynamics for which the Lyapunov exponents of all ergodic invariant probability measures are small, except for one measure whose Lyapunov exponents are away from zero. The support of this distinguished measure is not a periodic orbit. In particular, our example violates the periodic approximation property.</description>

      <title>Finding attracting sets using combinatorial multivector fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the identification of attracting sets using combinatorial multivector fields (CMVF) from Conley-Morse-Forman theory. A CMVF is a dynamical system induced by the action of a continuous dynamical system on a phase space discretization that can be represented as a Lefschetz complex. There is a rich theory under development establishing the connections between the induced and underlying dynamics and emphasizing computability. We introduce the main ideas behind this theory and demonstrate how it can be used to identify regions of interest within the global dynamics via graph-based algorithms and the connection matrix.</description>

      <title>On Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture for non-uniform cellular automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture for a group $G$ states that it is impossible for cellular automata (CA) over the universe $G$ with finite alphabet to produce strict embeddings of the full shift into itself. A group universe $G$ satisfying Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture is called a surjunctive group. The surjunctivity theorem of Gromov and Weiss shows that every sofic group is surjunctive. In this paper, we study the surjunctivity of local perturbations of CA and more generally of non-uniform cellular automata (NUCA) with finite memory and uniformly bounded singularity over surjunctive group universes. In particular, we show that such a NUCA must be invertible whenever it is reversible. We also obtain similar results which extend to the class of NUCA a certain dual-surjunctivity theorem of Capobianco, Kari, and Taati for CA.</description>

      <title>Topological entropy dimension on subsets for nonautonomous dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The topological entropy dimension is mainly used to distinguish the zero topological entropy systems. Two types of topological entropy dimensions, the classical entropy dimension and the Pesin entropy dimension, are investigated for nonautonomous dynamical systems. Several properties of the entropy dimensions are discussed, such as the power rule, monotonicity and equiconjugacy et al. The Pesin entropy dimension is also proved to be invariant up to equiconjugacy. The relationship between these two types of entropy dimension is also discussed in more detail. It's proved that these two entropy dimensions coincide and are equal to one provided that the classical topological entropy is positive and finite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a non-autonomous allelopathic phytoplankton competition ODE model, incorporating the influence of fear effects observed in natural biological phenomena. Based on Mawhin's coincidence degree theory some sufficient conditions for existence of periodic solutions are obtained. We validate our findings through an illustrative example and numerical simulations, showing that constant coefficients lead to steady-state dynamics, while periodic variations induce oscillatory behavior.</description>

      <title>A predator-prey model with Allee effect for a type of predator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the dynamical behaviors of a Holling type I Leslie-Gower predator-prey model where the predator exhibits an Allee effect and is subjected to constant harvesting. The model demonstrates three types of equilibrium points under different parameter conditions, which could be either stable or unstable nodes (foci), saddle nodes, weak centers, or cusps. The system exhibits a saddle-node bifurcation near the saddle-node point and a Hopf bifurcation near the weak center. By calculating the first Lyapunov coefficient, the conditions for the occurrence of both supercritical and subcritical Hopf bifurcations are derived. Finally, it is proven that when the predator growth rate and the prey capture coefficient vary within a specific small neighborhood, the system undergoes a codimension-2 Bogdanov-Takens bifurcation near the cusp point.</description>

      <title>A Comparison of Parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition Algorithms for Thermal-Hydraulics Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.24205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, algorithms aiming at learning models from available data have become quite popular due to two factors: 1) the significant developments in Artificial Intelligence techniques and 2) the availability of large amounts of data. Nevertheless, this topic has already been addressed by methodologies belonging to the Reduced Order Modelling framework, of which perhaps the most famous equation-free technique is Dynamic Mode Decomposition. This algorithm aims to learn the best linear model that represents the physical phenomena described by a time series dataset: its output is a best state operator of the underlying dynamical system that can be used, in principle, to advance the original dataset in time even beyond its span. However, in its standard formulation, this technique cannot deal with parametric time series, meaning that a different linear model has to be derived for each parameter realization. Research on this is ongoing, and some versions of a parametric Dynamic Mode Decomposition already exist. This work contributes to this research field by comparing the different algorithms presently deployed and assessing their advantages and shortcomings compared to each other. To this aim, three different thermal-hydraulics problems are considered: two benchmark 'flow over cylinder' test cases at diverse Reynolds numbers, whose datasets are, respectively, obtained with the FEniCS finite element solver and retrieved from the CFDbench dataset, and the DYNASTY experimental facility operating at Politecnico di Milano, which studies the natural circulation established by internally heated fluids for Generation IV nuclear applications, whose dataset was generated using the RELAP5 nodal solver.</description>

      <title>Pareto-Nash Allocations under Incomplete Information: A Model of Stable Optima</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22825v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prior literature on two-firm two-market and two-stage extended dynamic models has introduced what Guth (2016) succinctly terms a social dilemma. A state in which conglomerate firms competing in a Bertrand duopoly consider jointly optimizing profits under a tacit self-enforcing agreement to deter market entry. This theoretical article reinterprets the social dilemma highlighted by Guth (2016) not only in the context of allocation but also through the lens of competition where entry must legally be permitted even if cooperative signalling would otherwise sustain joint profitability. This study explores the significance of a sufficiency condition on each firms non-instantaneous reaction function requiring the maintenance of a stable long-run equilibrium through retaliative restraint characterized by either two negative eigenvalues or a saddle-path trajectory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23099v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the super-shadowing property in linear dynamics, where pseudotrajectories are approximated by sequences of the form $(\lambda_nT^nx)$, with $(\lambda_n)_n$ being complex scalars. For compact operators on Banach spaces, we characterize the operators that possess the positive super-shadowing property and the positive limit super-shadowing property. Additionally, we demonstrate that no surjective isometric operator on a separable Banach space $X$ with $\text{dim}(X)&gt;1$ can exhibit the positive super-shadowing property. Finally, we provide some results on upper frequently supercyclic and reiteratively supercyclic operators.</description>

Abstract: We study the problem of finding positive integers $n$ such that all the decimal digits of $2^n$ are even, i.e., belong to $\{0, 2, 4, 6, 8\}$. Computational checks up to $n = 10^{13}$ reveal the known cases $n = 1, 2, 3, 6, 11$ and no additional instances. We present a self-contained argument, based on equidistribution and a shrinking targets approach, showing there are only finitely many positive integers $n$ for which $2^n$ has all even decimal digits.</description>

      <title>On Hausdorff covers for non-Hausdorff groupoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23203v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a new approach to non-Hausdorff \'etale groupoids and their algebras based on Timmermann's construction of Hausdorff covers. As an application, we completely characterise when singular ideals vanish in Steinberg algebras over arbitrary rings. We also completely characterise when $C^*$-algebraic singular ideals have trivial intersection with the non-Hausdorff analogue of subalgebras of continuous, compactly supported functions. This leads to a characterisation when $C^*$-algebraic singular ideals vanish for groupoids satisfying a finiteness condition. Moreover, our approach leads to further sufficient vanishing criteria for singular ideals and reduces questions about simplicity, the ideal intersection property, amenability and nuclearity for non-Hausdorff \'etale groupoids to the Hausdorff case.</description>

      <title>Tractable Characterization of Discrete-Time Periodic Monotonicity Preserving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper studies three classes of discrete-time linear time-invariant systems, which differ by the set of periodic signals that they leave invariant. The first class preserves the property of periodic monotonicity, i.e., period-wise unimodality. The second class is invariant to signals with at most two sign changes per period, and the third class results from the second by additionally requiring that periodic signals with zero sign-changes are mapped to the same kind. We provide tractable characterizations for each system class by the use and extension of total positivity theory and combination with its geometric interpretations. In particular, central to our results is the characterization of sequentially convex contours.
  Moreover, as many static non-linearities, e.g., ideal relay, saturation, sigmoid function, quantizer, etc. also preserve these signal sets, our invariance characterizations also apply to the loop gain of Lur'e feedback systems. Thus, potentially forming the base for new developments of signal-based fixed-point theorems towards the prediction of self-sustained oscillations. In particular, our examples provide first indications for how the property of periodic monotonicity preservation is valuable to the study of relay feedback systems.</description>

      <title>A Low-complexity Structured Neural Network to Realize States of Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23697</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data-driven learning is rapidly evolving and places a new perspective on realizing state-space dynamical systems. However, dynamical systems derived from nonlinear ordinary differential equations (ODEs) suffer from limitations in computational efficiency. Thus, this paper stems from data-driven learning to advance states of dynamical systems utilizing a structured neural network (StNN). The proposed learning technique also seeks to identify an optimal, low-complexity operator to solve dynamical systems, the so-called Hankel operator, derived from time-delay measurements. Thus, we utilize the StNN based on the Hankel operator to solve dynamical systems as an alternative to existing data-driven techniques. We show that the proposed StNN reduces the number of parameters and computational complexity compared with the conventional neural networks and also with the classical data-driven techniques, such as Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) and Hankel Alternative view of Koopman (HAVOK), which is commonly known as delay-Dynamic Mode Decomposition(DMD) or Hankel-DMD. More specifically, we present numerical simulations to solve dynamical systems utilizing the StNN based on the Hankel operator beginning from the fundamental Lotka-Volterra model, where we compare the StNN with the LEarning Across Dynamical Systems (LEADS), and extend our analysis to highly nonlinear and chaotic Lorenz systems, comparing the StNN with conventional neural networks, SINDy, and HAVOK. Hence, we show that the proposed StNN paves the way for realizing state-space dynamical systems with a low-complexity learning algorithm, enabling prediction and understanding of future states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A powerful tool in control and systems engineering is represented by Nyquist plots, for which a qualitative representation often gives a clearer visualization of the frequency response function that is typically not given by computer programs, especially if portions of the Nyquist plot extend to infinity. This letter addresses the graphical analysis of the frequency response function, with the objective of enhancing the procedure for the qualitative construction of Nyquist plots. Several results supported by analytical proofs are derived for what concerns the low and high frequency behavior, which enable to improve the qualitative construction of Nyquist plots in the vicinity of the initial and final points.</description>

      <title>Algebraic dynamics and recursive inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We get three basic results in algebraic dynamics:
  (1). We give the first algorithm to compute the dynamical degrees to arbitrary precision.
  (2). We prove that for a family of dominant rational self-maps, the dynamical degrees are lower semi-continuous with respect to the Zariski topology. This implies a conjecture of Call and Silverman.
  (3). We prove that the set of periodic points of a cohomologically hyperbolic rational self-map is Zariski dense.
  Moreover, we show that, after a large iterate, every degree sequence grows almost at a uniform rate. This property is not satisfied for general submultiplicative sequences. Finally, we prove the Kawaguchi-Silverman conjecture for a class of self-maps of projective surfaces including all the birational ones.
  In fact, for every dominant rational self-map, we find a family of recursive inequalities of some dynamically meaningful cycles. Our proofs are based on these inequalities.</description>

      <title>On the Uniqueness of Participation Factors in Nonlinear Dynamical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07156v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the modal analysis and control of nonlinear dynamical systems, the participation factors of state variables with respect to a critical or selected mode serve as a pivotal tool for simplifying stability studies by focusing on a subset of highly influential state variables. For linear systems, the participation factors of state variables regarding a mode are uniquely determined by the mode's composition and shape, defined by the system's left and right eigenvectors, respectively. However, the uniqueness of other types of participation factors necessitates further investigation. This paper establishes a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of nonlinear participation factors and five other variants of participation factors, accounting for uncertain scaling factors in a mode's shape and composition. These scaling factors arise from variations in the selection of physical units or the value ranges of state variables when analyzing and controlling real-world dynamical systems. Understanding the sufficient condition of the uniqueness is therefore crucial for the correct application of participation factors in practical scenarios. Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between perturbation magnitudes in state variables and the selection of optimal scaling factors.</description>

Abstract: We establish three variational principles for the upper metric mean dimension with potential of level sets of continuous maps in terms of the entropy of partitions and Katok's entropy of the underlying system. Our results hold for dynamical systems exhibiting the specification property. Moreover, we apply our results to study the metric mean dimension of suspension flows.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.06548v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a class of $(N+1)$-dimensional systems of differential delay equations with a cyclic and monotone negative feedback structure, we construct a two-dimensional invariant manifold, on which phase curves spiral outward towards a bounding periodic orbit. For this to happen we assume essentially only instability of the zero equilibrium. Methods of the Poincar\'e-Bendixson theory due to Mallet-Paret and Sell are combined with techniques used by Walther for the scalar case $(N = 0)$. Statements on the attractor location and on parameter borders concerning stability and oscillation are included. The results apply to models for gene regulatory systems, e.g. the `repressilator' system.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of the Nose-Hoover and Moore-Spiegel Oscillators, and in particular, their topological dynamics. We prove the dynamics of both these systems can be reduced to a flow on a solid torus, with at most a finite number of attracting periodic trajectories. As a consequence, we obtain that every periodic trajectory for the Nose-Hoover and the Moore-Spiegel Oscillators is a Torus knot.</description>

      <title>Existence and Nonexistence of Invariant Curves of Coin Billiards</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the coin billiard introduced by M. Bialy. It is a modification of the classical billiard, obtained as the return map of a nonsmooth geodesic flow on a cylinder that has homeomorphic copies of a classical billiard on the top and on the bottom (a coin). The return dynamics is described by a map $T$ of the annulus $\mathbb A = \mathbb T \times (0,\pi)$. We prove the following three main theorems: in two different scenarios (when the height of the coin is small, or when the coin is near-circular) there is a family of KAM curves close to, but not accumulating on, the boundary $\partial \mathbb A$; for any noncircular coin, if the height of the coin is sufficiently large, there is a neighbourhood of $\partial \mathbb A$ through which there passes no invariant essential curve; and the only coin billiard for which the phase space $\mathbb A$ is foliated by essential invariant curves is the circular one. These results provide partial answers to questions of Bialy. Finally, we describe the results of some numerical experiments on the elliptical coin billiard.</description>

      <title>On the dimension of pullback attractors in recurrent neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are high-dimensional state space models capable of learning functions on sequence data. Recently, it has been conjectured that reservoir computers, a particular class of RNNs, trained on observations of a dynamical systems can be interpreted as embeddings. This result has been established for the case of linear reservoir systems. In this work, we use a nonautonomous dynamical systems approach to establish an upper bound for the fractal dimension of the subset of reservoir state space approximated during training and prediction phase. We prove that when the input sequences comes from an Nin-dimensional invertible dynamical system, the fractal dimension of this set is bounded above by Nin. The result obtained here are useful in dimensionality reduction of computation in RNNs as well as estimating fractal dimensions of dynamical systems from limited observations of their time series. It is also a step towards understanding embedding properties of reservoir computers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a minimal Anosov $\mathbb R^{\kappa}$-action on a closed manifold, we study the measure of maximal entropy constructed by Carrasco and Rodriguez-Hertz in \cite{CarHer} and show that it fits into the theory of Ruelle-Taylor resonances introduced by Guedes Bonthonneau, Guillarmou, Hilgert, and Weich in \cite{GBGHW}. More precisely, we show that the topological entropy corresponds to the first Ruelle-Taylor resonance for the action on a certain bundle of forms and that the measure of maximal entropy can be retrieved as the distributional product of the corresponding resonant and co-resonant states. As a consequence, we prove a Bowen-type formula for the measure of maximal entropy and a counting result on the number of periodic torii.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.13621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A decentralized feedback controller for multi-agent systems, inspired by vehicle platooning, is proposed. The closed loop resulting from the decentralized control action has three distinctive features: the generation of collision-free trajectories, flocking of the system towards a consensus state in velocity, and asymptotic convergence to a prescribed pattern of distances between agents. For each feature, a rigorous dynamical analysis is provided, yielding a characterization of the set of parameters and initial configurations where collision avoidance, flocking, and pattern formation are guaranteed. Numerical tests assess the theoretical results presented.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2104.03949v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stabilization and sufficient conditions for mixing by stochastic transport are shown. More precisely, given a second order linear operator with possibly unstable eigenvalues on a smooth compact Riemannian manifold, it is shown that the inclusion of transport noise can imply global asymptotic stability. Moreover, it is shown that an arbitrary large exponential rate of convergence can be reached, implying enhanced dissipation. The sufficient conditions are shown to be satisfied by the so-called Kraichnan model for stochastic transport of passive scalars in turbulent fluids. In addition, an example is given showing that it can be sufficient to force four modes in order to induce stabilization.</description>

Abstract: We solve in the negative two open problems, related to the linear and topological structure of the set of recurrent vectors, asked by Sophie Grivaux, Alfred Peris and the first author of this paper. Firstly, we show that there exist recurrent operators whose set of recurrent vectors is not dense lineable; and secondly, we construct operators which are reiteratively recurrent and cyclic, but whose set of reiteratively recurrent vectors is meager.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.13447v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a sequence $(p_n)_{n=1}^\infty$ of polynomials with uniformly bounded zeros and $\deg p_1\geq 1$, $\deg p_n\geq 2$ for $n\geq 2$, satisfying certain asymptotic conditions. We prove that the function sequence $\left(\frac{1}{\deg p_n\cdot...\cdot \deg p_1}\log^+|p_n\circ...\circ p_1|\right)_{n=1}^\infty$ is uniformly convergent in $\mathbb{C}$. The non-autonomous filled Julia set $\mathcal{K}[(p_{n})_{n=1}^\infty]$ generated by the polynomial sequence $(p_{n})_{n=1}^\infty$ is defined and shown to be compact and regular with respect to the Green function. Our toy example is generated by $t_n=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}}T_n,\ n\in\{1,2,...\}$, where $T_n$ is the classical Chebyshev polynomial of degree $n$.</description>

      <title>A Minimal Control Family of Dynamical Systems for Universal Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12903v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The universal approximation property (UAP) holds a fundamental position in deep learning, as it provides a theoretical foundation for the expressive power of neural networks. It is widely recognized that a composition of linear and nonlinear functions, such as the rectified linear unit (ReLU) activation function, can approximate continuous functions on compact domains. In this paper, we extend this efficacy to a scenario containing dynamical systems with controls. We prove that the control family $\mathcal{F}_1$ containing all affine maps and the nonlinear ReLU map is sufficient for generating flow maps that can approximate orientation-preserving (OP) diffeomorphisms on any compact domain. Since $\mathcal{F}_1$ contains only one nonlinear function and the UAP does not hold if we remove the nonlinear function, we call $\mathcal{F}_1$ a minimal control family for the UAP. On this basis, several mild sufficient conditions, such as affine invariance, are established for the control family and discussed. Our results reveal an underlying connection between the approximation power of neural networks and control systems and could provide theoretical guidance for examining the approximation power of flow-based models.</description>

Abstract: We consider labelings of a finite regular tree by a finite alphabet subject to restrictions specified by a nonnegative transition matrix, propose an algorithm for determining whether the set of possible configurations on the last row of the tree is independent of the symbol at the root, and prove that the algorithm succeeds in a bounded number of steps, provided that the dimension of the tree is greater than or equal to the maximum row sum of the transition matrix. (The question was motivated by calculation of topological pressure on trees and is an extension of the idea of primitivity for nonnegative matrices.)</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00885v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain an inverse of Furstenberg's correspondence principle in the setting of countable cancellative, amenable semigroups. Besides being of intrinsic interest on its own, this result allows us to answer a variety of questions concerning sets of recurrence and van der Corput (vdC) sets, which were posed by Bergelson and Lesigne \cite{BL}, Bergelson and Ferr\'e Moragues \cite{BF}, Kelly and L\^e \cite{KL}, and Moreira \cite{Mor}. We also prove a spectral characterization of vdC sets and prove some of their basic properties in the context of countable amenable groups.
  Several results in this article were independently found by Sohail Farhangi and Robin Tucker-Drob, see \cite{FT}.</description>

Abstract: We associate $n$-component Lotka-Volterra systems which admit $k$ additional linear Darboux polynomials, with admissible hypergraphs of order $n$ and size $k$. We study the equivalence relation on admissible hypergraphs induced by linear transformations of the associated LV-systems, for $n\leq 5$. We present a new 13-parameter 5-component superintegrable Lotka-Volterra system, i.e. one that is not equivalent to a so-called tree-system. We conjecture that tree-systems associated with nonisomorphic trees are not equivalent, which we verified for $n&lt;9$.</description>

Abstract: This article deals with the stability of the pushforward operation on currents with respect to $C^0$ limits of diffeomorphisms on compact Riemannian manifolds. We have established the uniform convergence of pullbacks of smooth forms and weak-* convergence of pushforwards of general currents. The key lemma brings convergence on closed 1-forms for the evaluation of 1-currents. The main theorem shows that the pushforward of rectifiable $k$-currents converges in the flat topology for $C^0$ convergent sequences of diffeomorphisms. We discuss implications in symplectic, cosymplectic, and contact geometry, making connections with the $C^0$ rigidity of certain geometric structures. We also consider applications to free boundary problems and stochastic currents. These results provide insight into the behavior of geometric objects under non-smooth perturbations, which have relevance in geometric measure theory, dynamical systems, and optimal transport. We highlight various open problems regarding weaker regularity and more involved geometric settings.</description>

Abstract: Let $\psi : \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{&gt;0}$ be a non-increasing function. Denote by $W(\psi)$ the set of $\psi$-well-approximable points and by $E(\psi)$ the set of points $x\in[0,1]$ such that for any $0 &lt; \epsilon &lt; 1$ there exist infinitely many $(p,q)\in\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{N} $ with $$\left(1-\epsilon\right)\psi(q)&lt; \left| x-\frac{p}{q}\right|&lt; \psi(q) .$$ In this paper, we investigate the metric properties of the set $E(\psi).$ Specifically, we compute the $s$-dimensional Hausdorff measure $\mathcal{H}^s(E(\psi))$ of $E(\psi)$ for a large class of $s \in (0,1].$ Additionally, we establish that $$\dim_{\mathcal H} E(\psi_1) \times \cdots \times E(\psi_n) =\min \{ \dim_{\mathcal H} E(\psi_i)+n-1: 1\le i \le n \},$$ where $\psi_i:\mathbb{R}_{&gt; 0}\rightarrow \mathbb{R}_{&gt; 0} $ is a non-increasing function satisfying $\psi_i(x)=o(x^{-2}) $ for $1\le i \le n.$</description>

Abstract: In this paper we first prove the precise description of each of type-$III_0$, type-$III_{\lambda}$ and type-$III_1$ Bernoulli schemes, and use this result to prove the precise description of each of type-$III_0$, type-$III_{\lambda}$ and type-$III_1$ ITPFI factor.</description>
