      <title>Asymptotically Minimax Regret by Bayes Mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problems of data compression, gambling and prediction of a sequence $x^n=x_1x_2...x_n$ from an alphabet ${\cal X}$, in terms of regret and expected regret (redundancy) with respect to various smooth families of probability distributions. We evaluate the regret of Bayes mixture distributions compared to maximum likelihood, under the condition that the maximum likelihood estimate is in the interior of the parameter space. For general exponential families (including the non-i.i.d.\ case) the asymptotically mimimax value is achieved when variants of the prior of Jeffreys are used. %under the condition that the maximum likelihood estimate is in the interior of the parameter space. Interestingly, we also obtain a modification of Jeffreys prior which has measure outside the given family of densities, to achieve minimax regret with respect to non-exponential type families. This modification enlarges the family using local exponential tilting (a fiber bundle). Our conditions are confirmed for certain non-exponential families, including curved families and mixture families (where either the mixture components or their weights of combination are parameterized) as well as contamination models. Furthermore for mixture families we show how to deal with the full simplex of parameters. These results also provide characterization of Rissanen's stochastic complexity.</description>

      <title>Rate-Distortion-Perception Tradeoff for Gaussian Vector Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18008v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the rate-distortion-perception (RDP) tradeoff for a Gaussian vector source coding problem where the goal is to compress the multi-component source subject to distortion and perception constraints. The purpose of imposing a perception constraint is to ensure visually pleasing reconstructions. This paper studies this RDP setting with either the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence or Wasserstein-2 metric as the perception loss function, and shows that for Gaussian vector sources, jointly Gaussian reconstructions are optimal. We further demonstrate that the optimal tradeoff can be expressed as an optimization problem, which can be explicitly solved. An interesting property of the optimal solution is as follows. Without the perception constraint, the traditional reverse water-filling solution for characterizing the rate-distortion (RD) tradeoff of a Gaussian vector source states that the optimal rate allocated to each component depends on a constant, called the water-level. If the variance of a specific component is below the water-level, it is assigned a {zero} compression rate. However, with active distortion and perception constraints, we show that the optimal rates allocated to the different components are always {positive}. Moreover, the water-levels that determine the optimal rate allocation for different components are unequal. We further treat the special case of perceptually perfect reconstruction and study its RDP function in the high-distortion and low-distortion regimes to obtain insight to the structure of the optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Dependence Analysis and Structured Construction for Batched Sparse Code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In coding theory, codes are usually designed with a certain level of randomness to facilitate analysis and accommodate different channel conditions. However, the resulting random code constructed can be suboptimal in practical implementations. Represented by a bipartite graph, the Batched Sparse Code (BATS Code) is a randomly constructed erasure code that utilizes network coding to achieve near-optimal performance in wireless multi-hop networks. In the performance analysis in the previous research, it is implicitly assumed that the coded batches in the BATS code are independent. This assumption holds only asymptotically when the number of input symbols is infinite, but it does not generally hold in a practical setting where the number of input symbols is finite, especially when the code is constructed randomly. We show that dependence among the batches significantly degrades the code's performance. In order to control the batch dependence through graphical design, we propose constructing the BATS code in a structured manner. A hardware-friendly structured BATS code called the Cyclic-Shift BATS (CS-BATS) code is proposed, which constructs the code from a small base graph using light-weight cyclic-shift operations. We demonstrate that when the base graph is properly designed, a higher decoding rate and a smaller complexity can be achieved compared with the random BATS code.</description>

      <title>Filtering Reconfigurable Intelligent Computational Surface for RF Spectrum Purification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing demand for communication is degrading the electromagnetic (EM) transmission environment due to severe EM interference, significantly reducing the efficiency of the radio frequency (RF) spectrum. Metasurfaces, a promising technology for controlling desired EM waves, have recently received significant attention from both academia and industry. However, the potential impact of out-of-band signals has been largely overlooked, leading to RF spectrum pollution and degradation of wireless transmissions. To address this issue, we propose a novel surface structure called the Filtering Reconfigurable Intelligent Computational Surface (FRICS). We introduce two types of FRICS structures: one that dynamically reflects resonance band signals through a tunable spatial filter while absorbing out-of-band signals using metamaterials and the other one that dynamically amplifies in-band signals using computational metamaterials while reflecting out-of-band signals. To evaluate the performance of FRICS, we implement it in device-to-device (D2D) communication and vehicular-to-everything (V2X) scenarios. The experiments demonstrate the superiority of FRICS in signal-to-interference-noise ratio (SINR) and energy efficiency (EE). Finally, we discuss the critical challenges faced and promising techniques for implementing FRICS in future wireless systems.</description>

      <title>Exploiting Data Significance in Remote Estimation of Discrete-State Markov Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the semantics-aware remote estimation of a discrete-state Markov source with normal (low-priority) and alarm (high-priority) states. Erroneously announcing a normal state at the destination when the source is actually in an alarm state (i.e., missed alarm error) incurs a significantly higher cost than falsely announcing an alarm state when the source is in a normal state (i.e., false alarm error). Moreover, successive reception of an estimation error may cause significant lasting impact, e.g., maintenance cost and misoperations. Motivated by this, we assign different costs to different estimation errors and introduce two new age metrics, namely the Age of Missed Alarm (AoMA) and the Age of False Alarm (AoFA), to account for the lasting impact incurred by different estimation errors. Notably, the two age processes evolve dependently and can distinguish between different types of estimation errors and different synced states. The aim is to achieve an optimal trade-off between the cost of estimation error, lasting impact, and communication utilization. The problem is formulated as an average-cost, countably infinite state-space Markov decision process (MDP). We show that the optimal policy exhibits a switching-type structure, making it amenable to policy storage and algorithm design. Notably, when the source is symmetric and states are equally important, the optimal policy has identical thresholds, i.e., threshold-type. Theoretical and numerical results underscore that our approach extends the current understanding of the Age of Incorrect Information (AoII) and the cost of actuation error (CAE), showing that they are specific instances within our broader framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, linear codes having their Lee-weight distributions over the semi-local ring $\mathbb{F}_{q}+u\mathbb{F}_{q}$ with $u^{2}=1$ are constructed using the defining set and Gauss sums for an odd prime $q $. Moreover, we derive complete Hamming-weight enumerators for the images of the constructed linear codes under the Gray map. We finally show an application to secret sharing schemes.</description>

Abstract: For any positive integer $m$ and an odd prime $p$; let $\mathbb{F}_{q}+u\mathbb{F}_{q}$, where $q=p^{m}$, be a ring extension of the ring $\mathbb{F}_{p}+u\mathbb{F}_{p}.$
  In this paper, we construct linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_{p}+u\mathbb{F}_{p}$ by using trace function defined on $\mathbb{F}_{q}+u\mathbb{F}_{q}$ and determine their Hamming weight distributions by employing symplectic-weight distributions of their Gray images.</description>

      <title>Rauzy dimension and finite-state dimension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a paper of 1976, Rauzy studied two complexity notions, $\underline{\beta}$ and $\overline{\beta}$, for infinite sequences over a finite alphabet. The function $\underline{\beta}$ is maximum exactly in the Borel normal sequences and $\overline{\beta}$ is minimum exactly in the sequences that, when added to any Borel normal sequence, the result is also Borel normal. Although the definition of $\underline{\beta}$ and $\overline{\beta}$ do not involve finite-state automata, we establish some connections between them and the lower $\underline{\rm dim}$ and upper $\overline{\rm dim}$ finite-state dimension (or other equivalent notions like finite-state compression ratio, aligned-entropy or cumulative log-loss of finite-state predictors). We show tight lower and upper bounds on $\underline{\rm dim}$ and $\overline{\rm dim}$ as functions of $\underline{\beta}$ and $\overline{\beta}$, respectively. In particular this implies that sequences with $\overline{\rm dim}$ zero are exactly the ones that that, when added to any Borel normal sequence, the result is also Borel normal. We also show that the finite-state dimensions $\underline{\rm dim}$ and $\overline{\rm dim}$ are essentially subadditive. We need two technical tools that are of independent interest. One is the family of local finite-state automata, which are automata whose memory consists of the last $k$ read symbols for some fixed integer $k$. We show that compressors based on local finite-state automata are as good as standard finite-state compressors. The other one is a notion of finite-state relational (non-deterministic) compressor, which can compress an input in several ways provided the input can always be recovered from any of its outputs. We show that such compressors cannot compress more than standard (deterministic) finite-state compressors.</description>

      <title>Distribution Learnability and Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the relationship between learnability and robust (or agnostic) learnability for the problem of distribution learning. We show that, contrary to other learning settings (e.g., PAC learning of function classes), realizable learnability of a class of probability distributions does not imply its agnostic learnability. We go on to examine what type of data corruption can disrupt the learnability of a distribution class and what is such learnability robust against. We show that realizable learnability of a class of distributions implies its robust learnability with respect to only additive corruption, but not against subtractive corruption.
  We also explore related implications in the context of compression schemes and differentially private learnability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we revisit some combinatorial and information-theoretic extension techniques for detecting non-algebraic matroids. These are the Dress-Lov\'asz and Ahlswede-K\"orner extension properties. We provide optimizations of these techniques to reduce their computational complexity, finding new non-algebraic matroids on 9 and 10 points. In addition, we use the Ahlswede-K\"orner extension property to find better lower bounds on the information ratio of secret sharing schemes for ports of non-algebraic matroids.</description>

      <title>Multicarrier ISAC: Advances in Waveform Design, Signal Processing and Learning under Non-Idealities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18476v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the topic of integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) in 5G and emerging 6G wireless networks. ISAC systems operate within shared, congested or even contested spectrum, aiming to deliver high performance in both wireless communications and radio frequency (RF) sensing. The expected benefits include more efficient utilization of spectrum, power, hardware (HW) and antenna resources. Focusing on multicarrier (MC) systems, which represent the most widely used communication waveforms, it explores the co-design and optimization of waveforms alongside multiantenna transceiver signal processing for communications and both monostatic and bistatic sensing applications of ISAC. Moreover, techniques of high practical relevance for overcoming and even harnessing challenges posed by non-idealities in actual transceiver implementations are considered. To operate in highly dynamic radio environments and target scenarios, both model-based structured optimization and learning-based methodologies for ISAC systems are covered, assessing their adaptability and learning capabilities under real-world conditions. The paper presents trade-offs in communication-centric and radar-sensing-centric approaches, aiming for an optimized balance in densely used spectrum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.10005v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Generating functions for the size of a $r$-sphere, with respect to the Manhattan distance in an $n$-dimensional grid, are used to provide explicit formulas for the minimum and maximum size of an $r$-ball centered at a point of the grid. This allows us to offer versions of the Hamming and Gilbert-Varshamov bounds for codes in these grids. Relations between the Hamming, Manhattan, and Lee distances defined in an abelian group $G$ are studied. A formula for the minimum Hamming distance of codes that are cyclic subgroups of $G$ is presented. Furthermore, several lower bounds for the minimum Manhattan distance of these codes based on their minimum Hamming and Lee distances are established. Examples illustrating the main results are presented, including several SageMath implementations.</description>

      <title>Reliable computation by large-alphabet formulas in the presence of noise</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.13262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two new positive results for reliable computation using formulas over physical alphabets of size $q &gt; 2$. First, we show that for logical alphabets of size $\ell = q$ the threshold for denoising using gates subject to $q$-ary symmetric noise with error probability $\varepsilon$ is strictly larger than that for Boolean computation, and is possible as long as signals remain distinguishable, i.e. $\epsilon &lt; (q - 1) / q$, in the limit of large fan-in $k \rightarrow \infty$. We also determine the point at which generalized majority gates with bounded fan-in fail, and show in particular that reliable computation is possible for $\epsilon &lt; (q - 1) / (q (q + 1))$ in the case of $q$ prime and fan-in $k = 3$. Secondly, we provide an example where $\ell &lt; q$, showing that reliable Boolean computation can be performed using $2$-input ternary logic gates subject to symmetric ternary noise of strength $\varepsilon &lt; 1/6$ by using the additional alphabet element for error signaling.</description>

      <title>Gradient Coding with Iterative Block Leverage Score Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.03096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We generalize the leverage score sampling sketch for $\ell_2$-subspace embeddings, to accommodate sampling subsets of the transformed data, so that the sketching approach is appropriate for distributed settings. This is then used to derive an approximate coded computing approach for first-order methods; known as gradient coding, to accelerate linear regression in the presence of failures in distributed computational networks, \textit{i.e.} stragglers. We replicate the data across the distributed network, to attain the approximation guarantees through the induced sampling distribution. The significance and main contribution of this work, is that it unifies randomized numerical linear algebra with approximate coded computing, while attaining an induced $\ell_2$-subspace embedding through uniform sampling. The transition to uniform sampling is done without applying a random projection, as in the case of the subsampled randomized Hadamard transform. Furthermore, by incorporating this technique to coded computing, our scheme is an iterative sketching approach to approximately solving linear regression. We also propose weighting when sketching takes place through sampling with replacement, for further compression.</description>

      <title>Embracing Errors Is More Efficient Than Avoiding Them Through Constrained Coding for DNA Data Storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05952v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: DNA is an attractive medium for digital data storage. When data is stored on DNA, errors occur, which makes error-correcting coding techniques critical for reliable DNA data storage. To reduce the errors, a common technique is to include constraints that avoid homopolymers (consecutive repeated nucleotides) and balance the GC content, as sequences with homopolymers and unbalanced GC content are often associated with higher error rates. However, constrained coding comes at the cost of an increase in redundancy. An alternative is to control errors by randomizing the sequences, embracing errors, and paying for them with additional coding redundancy. In this paper, we determine the error regimes in which embracing substitutions is more efficient than constrained coding for DNA data storage. Our results suggest that constrained coding for substitution errors is inefficient for existing DNA data storage systems. Theoretical analysis indicates that for constrained coding to be efficient, the increase in substitution errors for nucleotides in homopolymers and sequences with unbalanced GC content must be very large. Additionally, empirical results show that the increase in substitution, deletion, and insertion rates for these nucleotides is minimal in existing DNA storage systems.</description>

Abstract: In this article, We introduce a condition that is both necessary and sufficient for a linear code to achieve minimality when analyzed over the rings $\mathbb{Z}_{n}$.The fundamental inquiry in minimal linear codes is the existence of a $[m,k]$ minimal linear code where $k$ is less than or equal to $m$. W. Lu et al. ( see \cite{nine}) showed that there exists a positive integer $m(k;q)$ such that for $m\geq m(k;q)$ a minimal linear code of length $m$ and dimension $k$ over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ must exist. They give the upper and lower bound of $m(k;q)$. In this manuscript, we establish both an upper and lower bound for $m(k;p^l)$ and $m(k;p_1p_2)$ within the ring $\mathbb{Z}_{p^l}$ and $\mathbb{Z}_{p_1p_2}$ respectively.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Geometry Analysis of EMF Exposure of Idle Users and Network Performance with Dynamic Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01190</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01190v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel mathematical framework based on stochastic geometry to investigate the electromagnetic field exposure (EMFE) of both active and idle users located at a specific distance from each other, in cellular networks with dynamic beamforming. Accurate antenna gain modeling, encompassing both the main and side lobes, becomes crucial in this context. To address this need, the multi-cosine antenna pattern is introduced. The marginal distribution of EMFE for each user type is derived. The paper then examines network performance by introducing a new metric designed to ensure minimal downlink coverage for active users while keeping EMFE for idle users below a specified limit. This metric addresses questions such as, "What is the probability that idle users at a distance of $x$~m from an active user will experience EMFE below a specific limit while the active user meets a specific coverage requirement, and how many antenna elements are needed at the base station to increase this probability of, let us say, 20\%?".</description>

      <title>An Multi-resources Integration Empowered Task Offloading in Internet of Vehicles: From the Perspective of Wireless Interference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16078v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The task offloading technology plays a vital role in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), by satisfying the diversified demands of the vehicles, such as the energy consumption and processing latency of the computing task. Different from the previous works, on the one hand, they ignored the wireless interference of communications among vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V), as well as between vehicles and roadside units (RSU); on the other hand, the available resources of parked vehicles on the roadside and other moving vehicles on the road are also ignored. In this paper, first of all, we adopt a truncated Gaussian distribution for modeling the vehicle moving speed, instead of the simplistic average speed models in prior studies. Then, with the consideration of wireless interference and effective communication duration existing in V2V and RSUs, we establish an analytical framework of the task offloading, characterized by the energy consumption and processing delay, by integrating computing resources of parked/moving vehicles and RSUs. Furthermore, inspired by the method of multi-agent deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG), we address a joint optimization of the energy consumption and processing delay of the computing task, while ensuring the load balancing of the resources. Finally, the simulations demonstrate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed MADDPG. In particular, compared with the current popular methods of the task offloading, the MADDPG shows the best performance, in terms of convergence speed, energy consumption and processing delay.</description>

      <title>Joint Metrics for EMF Exposure and Coverage in Real-World Homogeneous and Inhomogeneous Cellular Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03559v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper evaluates the downlink performance of cellular networks in terms of coverage and electromagnetic field exposure (EMFE), in the framework of stochastic geometry. The model is constructed based on datasets for sub-6~GHz macro cellular networks but it is general enough to be applicable to millimeter-wave networks as well. On the one hand, performance metrics are calculated for $\beta$-Ginibre point processes which are shown to faithfully model a large number of motion-invariant networks. On the other hand, performance metrics are derived for inhomogeneous Poisson point processes with a radial intensity measure, which are shown to be a good approximation for motion-variant networks. For both cases, joint and marginal distributions of the EMFE and the coverage, and the first moments of the EMFE are provided and validated by Monte Carlo simulations using realistic sets of parameters from two sub-6~GHz macro urban cellular networks, i.e., 5G~NR~2100 (Paris, France) and LTE~1800 (Brussels, Belgium) datasets. In addition, this paper includes the analysis of the impact of the network parameters and discusses the achievable trade-off between coverage and EMFE.</description>

      <title>Pointwise convergence of Fourier series and deep neural network for the indicator function of d-dimensional ball</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.08172v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we clarify the crucial difference between a deep neural network and the Fourier series. For the multiple Fourier series of periodization of some radial functions on $\mathbb{R}^d$, Kuratsubo (2010) investigated the behavior of the spherical partial sum and discovered the third phenomenon other than the well-known Gibbs-Wilbraham and Pinsky phenomena. In particular, the third one exhibits prevention of pointwise convergence. In contrast to it, we give a specific deep neural network and prove pointwise convergence.</description>

      <title>On Convex Data-Driven Inverse Optimal Control for Nonlinear, Non-stationary and Stochastic Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with a finite-horizon inverse control problem, which has the goal of reconstructing, from observations, the possibly non-convex and non-stationary cost driving the actions of an agent. In this context, we present a result enabling cost reconstruction by solving an optimization problem that is convex even when the agent cost is not and when the underlying dynamics is nonlinear, non-stationary and stochastic. To obtain this result, we also study a finite-horizon forward control problem that has randomized policies as decision variables. We turn our findings into algorithmic procedures and show the effectiveness of our approach via in-silico and hardware validations. All experiments confirm the effectiveness of our approach.</description>

      <title>On the Uplink and Downlink EMF Exposure and Coverage in Dense Cellular Networks: A Stochastic Geometry Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.08978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.08978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing studies analyzing electromagnetic field (EMFE) in wireless networks have primarily considered downlink communications. In the uplink, the EMFE caused by the user's smartphone is usually the only considered source of radiation, thereby ignoring contributions caused by other active neighboring devices. In addition, the network coverage and EMFE are typically analyzed independently for both the uplink and downlink, while a joint analysis would be necessary to fully understand the network performance and answer various questions related to optimal network deployment. This paper bridges these gaps by presenting an enhanced stochastic geometry framework that includes the above aspects. The proposed topology features base stations modeled via a homogeneous Poisson point process. The users active during a same time slot are distributed according to a mixture of a Mat\'ern cluster process and a Gauss-Poisson process, featuring groups of users possibly carrying several equipments. In this paper, we derive the marginal and meta distributions of the downlink and uplink EMFE and we characterize the uplink to downlink EMFE ratio. Moreover, we derive joint probability metrics considering the uplink and downlink coverage and EMFE. These metrics are evaluated in four scenarios considering BS, cluster and/or intracluster densifications. Our numerical results highlight the existence of optimal node densities maximizing these joint probabilities.</description>

      <title>An Information Theoretic Perspective on Conformal Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.02140v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a distribution-free uncertainty estimation framework that constructs prediction sets guaranteed to contain the true answer with a user-specified probability. Intuitively, the size of the prediction set encodes a general notion of uncertainty, with larger sets associated with higher degrees of uncertainty. In this work, we leverage information theory to connect conformal prediction to other notions of uncertainty. More precisely, we prove three different ways to upper bound the intrinsic uncertainty, as described by the conditional entropy of the target variable given the inputs, by combining CP with information theoretical inequalities. Moreover, we demonstrate two direct and useful applications of such connection between conformal prediction and information theory: (i) more principled and effective conformal training objectives that generalize previous approaches and enable end-to-end training of machine learning models from scratch, and (ii) a natural mechanism to incorporate side information into conformal prediction. We empirically validate both applications in centralized and federated learning settings, showing our theoretical results translate to lower inefficiency (average prediction set size) for popular CP methods.</description>

      <title>Learning Low-dimensional Latent Dynamics from High-dimensional Observations: Non-asymptotics and Lower Bounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06089v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on learning a linear time-invariant (LTI) model with low-dimensional latent variables but high-dimensional observations. We provide an algorithm that recovers the high-dimensional features, i.e. column space of the observer, embeds the data into low dimensions and learns the low-dimensional model parameters. Our algorithm enjoys a sample complexity guarantee of order $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n/\epsilon^2)$, where $n$ is the observation dimension. We further establish a fundamental lower bound indicating this complexity bound is optimal up to logarithmic factors and dimension-independent constants. We show that this inevitable linear factor of $n$ is due to the learning error of the observer's column space in the presence of high-dimensional noises. Extending our results, we consider a meta-learning problem inspired by various real-world applications, where the observer column space can be collectively learned from datasets of multiple LTI systems. An end-to-end algorithm is then proposed, facilitating learning LTI systems from a meta-dataset which breaks the sample complexity lower bound in certain scenarios.</description>
