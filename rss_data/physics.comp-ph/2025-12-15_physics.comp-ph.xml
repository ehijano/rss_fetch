      <title>HPRMAT: A high-performance R-matrix solver with GPU acceleration for coupled-channel problems in nuclear physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I present HPRMAT, a high-performance solver library for the linear systems arising in R-matrix coupled-channel scattering calculations in nuclear physics. Designed as a drop-in replacement for the linear algebra routines in existing R-matrix codes, HPRMAT employs direct linear equation solving with optimized libraries instead of traditional matrix inversion, achieving significant performance improvements. The package provides four solver backends: (1) double-precision LU factorization, (2) mixed-precision arithmetic with iterative refinement, (3) a Woodbury formula approach exploiting the kinetic-coupling matrix structure, and (4) GPU acceleration. Benchmark calculations demonstrate that the GPU solver achieves up to 9$\times$ speedup over optimized CPU direct solvers, and 18$\times$ over legacy inversion-based codes, for large matrices ($N=25600$). The mixed-precision strategy is particularly effective on consumer GPUs (e.g., NVIDIA RTX 3090/4090), where single-precision throughput exceeds double-precision by a factor of 64:1; by performing factorization in single precision with iterative refinement, HPRMAT overcomes the poor FP64 performance of consumer hardware while maintaining double-precision accuracy. This makes large-scale CDCC and coupled-channel calculations accessible to researchers using standard desktop workstations, without requiring expensive data-center GPUs. CPU-only solvers provide 5--7$\times$ speedup through optimized libraries and algorithmic improvements. All solvers maintain physics accuracy with relative errors below $10^{-5}$ in cross-section calculations, validated against Descouvemont's reference code (Comput.\ Phys.\ Commun.\ 200, 199--219 (2016)). HPRMAT provides interfaces for Fortran, C, Python, and Julia.</description>

      <title>Stable spectral neural operator for learning stiff PDE systems from limited data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate modeling of spatiotemporal dynamics is crucial to understanding complex phenomena across science and engineering. However, this task faces a fundamental challenge when the governing equations are unknown and observational data are sparse. System stiffness, the coupling of multiple time-scales, further exacerbates this problem and hinders long-term prediction. Existing methods fall short: purely data-driven methods demand massive datasets, whereas physics-aware approaches are constrained by their reliance on known equations and fine-grained time steps. To overcome these limitations, we introduce an equation-free learning framework, namely, the Stable Spectral Neural Operator (SSNO), for modeling stiff partial differential equation (PDE) systems based on limited data. Instead of encoding specific equation terms, SSNO embeds spectrally inspired structures in its architecture, yielding strong inductive biases for learning the underlying physics. It automatically learns local and global spatial interactions in the frequency domain, while handling system stiffness with a robust integrating factor time-stepping scheme. Demonstrated across multiple 2D and 3D benchmarks in Cartesian and spherical geometries, SSNO achieves prediction errors one to two orders of magnitude lower than leading models. Crucially, it shows remarkable data efficiency, requiring only very few (2--5) training trajectories for robust generalization to out-of-distribution conditions. This work offers a robust and generalizable approach to learning stiff spatiotemporal dynamics from limited data without explicit \textit{a priori} knowledge of PDE terms.</description>

      <title>Molecular Dynamics Simulations of Bubble Nucleation in a Liquid-Noble Scintillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Scintillating Bubble Chamber collaboration is searching for Weakly Interacting Massive Particles using a novel bubble chamber with intended thresholds as low as 100eV. Existing molecular dynamics simulations of bubble formation in bubble chambers were conducted with non-scintillating target materials and therefore do not account for the energy transfer to photons or time-delayed releases that occur in atomic de-excitation. In this study, we use the HOOMD-blue molecular dynamics framework to simulate bubble formation in liquid argon, including photon creation, ionization, and direct nuclear recoils. A multi-stage bubble growth process similar to that reported in the literature was observed. When comparing simulated thresholds with and without scintillation effects, we found that scintillation raises the average energy required to form a bubble by a factor of 2.16. This is larger than the fraction of energy lost to photon creation, and demonstrates that energy stored in excited molecular states with lifetimes longer than the rapid growth phase of nucleation (~250 ps) does not contribute significantly to bubble formation. This conclusion was further supported by simulations showing increased bubble nucleation thresholds when the excited molecular state lifetimes were increased, even under identical thermodynamic conditions.</description>

      <title>Defect-Engineered Multifunctionality in Cu-Doped Bi2Te2: Interplay of Thermoelectric, Piezoelectric, and Optoelectronic Properties from First-Principles Insights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Defect engineering can improve the linked charge, spin, and lattice behavior of thermoelectric topological insulators. Using density functional theory with spin orbit coupling, we study structural, electronic, optical, thermoelectric, piezoelectric, and charge density features of pristine and Cu doped Bi2Te3. Cu substitution slightly expands the lattice and lowers the total energy minimum, which stabilizes the structure. The density of states shows that Cu d and Te p hybridization creates sharp states near the Fermi level, raising the carrier concentration and supporting higher Seebeck coefficient and power factor. Transport calculations show an increase in the Seebeck coefficient from about 180 microvolts per kelvin in pristine Bi2Te3 to about 220 microvolts per kelvin at 300 K while keeping the electrical conductivity nearly unchanged. Optical spectra reveal strong low energy absorption and very large static dielectric constants (greater than 600), indicating tunable light matter coupling. The piezoelectric coefficient e33 rises from 0.19 C/m2 in pristine Bi2Te3 to 0.38 C/m2 at 5 percent Cu and 0.51 C/m2 at 10 percent Cu, reflecting symmetry breaking and strain driven polarization. Charge density difference maps show anisotropic redistribution, with Cu donating about 0.8 electrons mainly to Te sites, which enhances p type behavior and phonon scattering. Overall, Cu doping reshapes Bi2Te3 into a multifunctional material with coupled thermoelectric, piezoelectric, and optical responses suitable for hybrid energy harvesting, infrared detection, and spin based devices.</description>

      <title>Temporal Substepping Scheme for Magnetohydrodynamics with Cell-based Adaptive Mesh Refinement on Staggered Grid</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.11365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for numerical magnetohydrodynamics on staggered meshes preserving $\nabla \cdot B = 0$. Our algorithm is based on the constrained transport method and supports both cell-based adaptive mesh refinement and temporal substepping. We handle resolution changes directly on the logically Cartesian grid without needing interpolation or projection between nested or neighboring grids, nor coupling the solution between refinement levels.</description>

      <title>Predicting the mechanical properties of spring networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.07844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.07844v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The elastic response of mechanical, chemical, and biological systems is often modeled using a discrete arrangement of Hookean springs, either representing finite material elements or even the molecular bonds of a system. However, to date, there is no direct derivation of the relation between a general discrete spring network\blu{, with arbitrary geometry,} and it's corresponding elastic continuum. Furthermore, understanding the network's mechanical response requires simulations that may be expensive computationally. Here we report a method to derive the exact elastic continuum model of any discrete network of springs, requiring network geometry and topology only. We identify and calculate the so-called "non-affine" displacements. Explicit comparison of our calculations to simulations of different crystalline and disordered configurations, shows we successfully capture the mechanics even of auxetic materials. Our method is valid for residually stressed systems with non-trivial geometries, and is an essential step in generalizing active stresses on such discrete systems. It is easily generalizable to other discrete models, and opens the possibility of a rational design of elastic systems.</description>

      <title>A Wave-Based Simulation Model for Cross-Beam Energy Transfer and Stimulated Brillouin Scattering in Laser-Plasma Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10626v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present WEBS (WavE-Based Simulations), an efficient wave-based simulation model designed to investigate the dynamic interplay between cross-beam energy transfer (CBET) and stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS) in laser-plasma systems. By employing a unified Schrodinger-type envelope formulation for the laser and ion-acoustic waves, our model enables the use of a single, unconditionally stable Du Fort-Frankel numerical scheme, which maintains excellent long-term energy conservation even with coarse spatial grids. This approach not only achieves high computational efficiency validated against particle-in-cell simulations but also allows the selective activation or suppression of CBET and SBS processes, offering a clear diagnostic of their mutual coupling. Our simulations reveal that at high laser intensities, CBET and SBS reach a coupled steady state, leading to significant deviations from classical fluid theory predictions. Specifically, CBET gain is suppressed due to enhanced SBS reflectivity, while strong asymmetry in SBS reflectivity emerges between the interacting beams. These findings highlight regimes where the two instabilities strongly influence each other, providing critical insights for inertial confinement fusion research and offering a practical numerical tool for instability control and scenario design.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning of Mean First Passage Time Scape: Chemical Short-Range Order and Kinetics of Diffusive Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Processes slow compared to atomic vibrations pose significant challenges in atomistic simulations, particularly for phenomena such as diffusive relaxations and phase transitions, where repeated crossings and the shear number of thermally activated transitions make direct numerical simulations impossible. We present a computational framework that captures atomic-scale diffusive relaxation over extended timescales by learning the mean first passage time (MFPT) with a deep neural network. The model is trained via a self-consistent recursive formulation based on the Markovian assumption, relying solely on local residence times and transition probabilities between neighboring states. Furthermore, we leverage deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-accelerated atomistic simulations to expedite the identification of thermodynamic equilibrium and the generation of accurate physical transition probabilities. Applied to vacancy-mediated chemical short-range order (SRO) evolution in equiatomic CrCoNi, our method uncovers disorder-to-order transition timescales in quantitative agreement with experimental measurements. By bridging the gap between simulation and experiment, our approach extends atomistic modeling to previously inaccessible timescales and offers a predictive tool for navigating process-structure-property relationships.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Informed Neural Operator Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19452v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine-learning-based surrogate models offer significant computational efficiency and faster simulations compared to traditional numerical methods, especially for problems requiring repeated evaluations of partial differential equations. This work introduces the Geometry-Informed Neural Operator Transformer (GINOT), which integrates the transformer architecture with the neural operator framework to enable forward predictions on arbitrary geometries. GINOT employs a sampling and grouping strategy together with an attention mechanism to encode surface point clouds that are unordered, exhibit non-uniform point densities, and contain varying numbers of points for different geometries. The geometry information is seamlessly integrated with query points in the solution decoder through the attention mechanism. The performance of GINOT is validated on multiple challenging datasets, showcasing its high accuracy and strong generalization capabilities for complex and arbitrary 2D and 3D geometries.</description>

      <title>Stability of Continuous Time Quantum Walks in Complex Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the stability of continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) in a range of network topologies under different decoherence mechanisms, defining stability as the system's ability to preserve quantum properties over time. The networks studied range from homogeneous to heterogeneous structures, including cycle, complete, Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi, small-world, scale-free, and star topologies. The decoherence models considered are energy-based intrinsic decoherence, node-based Haken-Strobl noise, and edge-based quantum stochastic walks (QSWs). To assess quantum stability, we employ several metrics: node occupation probabilities, $\ell_1$-norm of coherence fidelity with the initial state, quantum-classical distance, and von Neumann entropy. The stability ranking among network topologies varies depending on the decoherence model and the quantifier used. For example, we show that for Haken-Strobl noise, topologies like complete, star and scale-free with high degree nodes are most stable. Conversely, under the QSW decoherence, these same networks with initialization on high degree node becomes uniquely fragile, exhibiting rapid coherence loss. In general, networks such as star and scale-free networks, exhibit the highest stability in all cases except for QSW. However, these same networks, due to their high degree of localization, also show lower values of coherence even in the noiseless case, highlighting a fundamental trade-off between localization and coherence. Furthermore, in heterogenous networks, the centrality (degree or closeness) of the initialized node has a pronounced impact on stability, underscoring the critical role of local topological features in quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>High Purcell enhancement in all-TMDC nanobeam resonator designs with active monolayers for nanolasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05333v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a nanobeam resonator incorporating an active monolayer, designed to achieve a high Purcell enhancement. The resonator is fully composed of transition-metal-dichalcogenide materials and intended to operate as a high-beta-factor nanolaser. A theoretical framework that models and optimizes the Purcell enhancement associated with the emission from atomically thin layers is developed. This framework is based on a resonance expansion, enabling spectral resolution of physical quantities governed by high-Q resonances. The numerical optimization of the resonator leads to the presence of a high-Q resonance supporting a strong electric field confinement in the monolayer to maximize the modal gain.</description>

      <title>Many interacting particles in solution. I. Screening-ranged expansions of electrostatic potential and energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08407v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an analytical many-body formalism for systems of spherical particles carrying arbitrary free charge distributions and interacting in a polarizable electrolyte solution, that we model within the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann framework. Building on the detailed spectral analysis of the associated nonstandard Neumann--Poincar\'e-type operators developed in our companion study arXiv:2512.08684, we construct exact explicit expansions of the electrostatic potential and energy in ascending orders of Debye screening thereby obtaining systematic "screening-ranged" series for potentials and energies. These screening-ranged expansions provide a unified and tractable description of many-body electrostatics. We demonstrate the versatility of the approach by showing how it generalizes and improves upon both classical and modern methods, enabling rigorous treatment of heterogeneously charged systems (such as Janus particles) and accurate modeling of higher-order phenomena (such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, like-charge attraction) as well as yielding many-body generalizations to analytical explicit results previously known only in the two-body setting.</description>
