      <title>An Automated Theorem Generator with Theoretical Foundation Based on Rectangular Standard Contradiction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Currently, there is a lack of rigorous theoretical system for systematically generating non-trivial and logically valid theorems. Addressing this critical gap, this paper conducts research to propose a novel automated theorem generation theory and tool. Based on the concept of standard contradiction which possesses unique deductive advantages, this paper defines and proves, for the first time, a new logical structure known as rectangular standard contradiction. Centered on this structure, a complete Automated Theorem Generation (ATG) theory is put forward. Theoretical proofs clarify two core properties of rectangular standard contradiction: first, it is a standard contradiction (necessarily unsatisfiable); second, it exhibits non-redundancy (the remaining clause set becomes satisfiable after removing any clause). Leveraging these properties, this paper proves that partitioning a rectangular standard contradiction into a premise subset $A$ and negation of its complement $H$, a valid theorem $A \vdash \neg H$ can be formed, and all such theorems are logically equivalent. To implement this theory, an efficient template-based ATG algorithm is designed, and a Rectangular Automated Theorem Generator is developed. This research enables machines to transition from "verifiers" to "discoverers", opening up new avenues for fundamental research in the fields of logic and artificial intelligence.</description>

      <title>Compact Quantitative Theories of Convex Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce the concept of compact quantitative equational theory. A quantitative equational theory is defined to be compact if all its consequences are derivable by means of finite proofs. We prove that the theory of interpolative barycentric (also known as convex) quantitative algebras of Mardare et. al. is compact. This serves as a paradigmatic example, used to obtain other compact quantitative equational theories of convex algebras, each axiomatizing some distance on finitely supported probability distributions.</description>

      <title>The Size of Interpolants in Modal Logics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We start a systematic investigation of the size of Craig interpolants, uniform interpolants, and strongest implicates for (quasi-)normal modal logics. Our main upper bound states that for tabular modal logics, the computation of strongest implicates can be reduced in polynomial time to uniform interpolant computation in classical propositional logic. Hence they are of polynomial dag-size iff NP $\subseteq$ P$_{/\text{poly}}$. The reduction also holds for Craig interpolants and uniform interpolants if the tabular modal logic has the Craig interpolation property. Our main lower bound shows an unconditional exponential lower bound on the size of Craig interpolants and strongest implicates covering almost all non-tabular standard normal modal logics. For normal modal logics contained in or containing S4 or GL we obtain the following dichotomy: tabular logics have ``propositionally sized'' interpolants while for non-tabular logics an unconditional exponential lower bound holds.</description>

      <title>Attractors Is All You Need: Parity Games In Polynomial Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03752v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a polynomial-time algorithm for solving parity games that runs in $\mathcal{O}(n^{2}\cdot(n + m))$ time-ending a search that has taken decades. Unlike previous attractor-based algorithms, the presented algorithm only removes regions with a determined winner. The paper introduces a new type of attractor that can guarantee finding the minimal dominion of a parity game. The attractor runs in polynomial time and can peel the graph empty.</description>

      <title>Polynomial Universes in Homotopy Type Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19176v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Awodey, later with Newstead, showed how polynomial functors with extra structure (termed ``natural models'') hold within them the categorical semantics for dependent type theory. Their work presented these ideas clearly but ultimately led them outside of the usual category of polynomial functors to a particular \emph{tricategory} of polynomials in order to explain all of the structure possessed by such models. This paper builds off that work -- explicating the categorical semantics of dependent type theory by axiomatizing them entirely in terms of the usual category of polynomial functors. In order to handle the higher-categorical coherences required for such an explanation, we work with polynomial functors in the language of Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT), which allows for higher-dimensional structures to be expressed purely within this category. The move to HoTT moreover enables us to express a key additional condition on polynomial functors -- \emph{univalence} -- which is sufficient to guarantee that models of type theory expressed as univalent polynomials satisfy all higher coherences of their corresponding algebraic structures, purely in virtue of being closed under the usual constructors of dependent type theory. We call polynomial functors satisfying this condition \emph{polynomial universes}. As an example of the simplification to the theory of natural models this enables, we highlight the fact that a polynomial universe being closed under dependent product types implies the existence of a distributive law of monads, which witnesses the usual distributivity of dependent products over dependent sums.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.01754v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Following Hoare's seminal invention, later called Hoare logic, to reason about correctness of computer programs, we advocate a related but fundamentally different approach to reason about access security of computer programs such as access control. We define the formalism, which we denote access Hoare logic, and present examples which demonstrate its usefulness and fundamental difference to Hoare logic. We prove soundness and completeness of access Hoare logic, and provide a link between access Hoare logic and standard Hoare logic.</description>

      <title>Discussion Graph Semantics of First-Order Logic with Equality for Reasoning about Discussion and Argumentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12163v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We make three contributions. First, we formulate a discussion-graph semantics for first-order logic with equality, enabling reasoning about discussion and argumentation in AI more generally than before. This addresses the current lack of a formal reasoning framework capable of handling diverse discussion and argumentation models. Second, we generalise Dung's notion of extensions to cases where two or more graph nodes in an argumentation framework are equivalent. Third, we connect these two contributions by showing that the generalised extensions are first-order characterisable within the proposed discussion-graph semantics. Propositional characterisability of all Dung's extensions is an immediate consequence.</description>

      <title>Mathematics with large language models as provers and verifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12829v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: During 2024 and 2025 the discussion about the theorem-proving capabilities of large language models started reporting interesting success stories, mostly to do with difficult exercises (such as problems from the International Mathematical Olympiad), but also with conjectures [Feldman &amp; Karbasi, arXiv:2509.18383v1] formulated for the purpose of verifying whether the artificial intelligence could prove it. In this paper we report a theorem proving feat achieved by ChatGPT by using a protocol involving different prover and verifier instances of the gpt-5 model working collaboratively. To make sure that the produced proofs do not suffer from hallucinations, the final proof is formally verified by the lean proof assistant, and the conformance of premises and conclusion of the lean code is verified by a human. Our methodology is by no means complete or exact. It was nonetheless able to solve five out of six 2025 IMO problems, and close about a third of the sixty-six number theory conjectures in [Cohen, Journal of Integer Sequences, 2025].</description>

      <title>FATE: A Formal Benchmark Series for Frontier Algebra of Multiple Difficulty Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02872v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in formal theorem proving, particularly on contest-based mathematical benchmarks like the IMO. However, these contests do not reflect the depth, breadth, and abstraction of modern mathematical research. To bridge this gap, we introduce FATE (Formal Algebra Theorem Evaluation), a new benchmark series in formal algebra designed to chart a course toward advanced mathematical reasoning. We present two new components, FATE-H and FATE-X, each with 100 problems in abstract and commutative algebra. The FATE series spans a difficulty spectrum from undergraduate exercises to problems exceeding PhD qualifying exams. Notably, FATE-X is the first formal benchmark to surpass both PhD-level exam difficulty and the coverage of the Mathlib library. Our evaluations of state-of-the-art LLM provers on this new benchmark reveal a stark performance gap compared to contest math: the best model achieves only 3% (pass@64) accuracy on FATE-H and 0% on FATE-X. Our two-stage evaluation reveals that models' natural-language reasoning is notably more accurate than their ability to formalize this reasoning. We systematically classify the common errors that arise during this formalization process. Furthermore, a comparative study shows that a specialized prover can exhibit less effective reflection than general-purpose models, reducing its accuracy at the natural-language stage. We believe FATE provides a robust and challenging benchmark that establishes essential checkpoints on the path toward research-level formal mathematical reasoning.</description>
