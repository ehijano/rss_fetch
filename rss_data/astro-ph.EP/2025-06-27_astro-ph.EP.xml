      <title>A Ground-Based Transit Observation of the Long-Period Extremely Low-Density Planet HIP 41378 f</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a ground-based transit detection of HIP 41378 f, a long-period ($P = 542$ days), extremely low-density ($0.09 \pm 0.02$ g cm$^{-3}$) giant exoplanet in a dynamically complex system. Using photometry from Tierras, TRAPPIST-North, and multiple LCOGT sites, we constrain the transit center time to $T_{C,6} = 2460438.889 \pm 0.049$ BJD TDB. This marks only the second ground-based detection of HIP 41378 f, currently the longest-period and longest-duration transiting exoplanet observed from the ground. We use this new detection to update the TTV solution for HIP 41378 f and refine the predicted times of its next two transits in November 2025 and April 2027. Incorporating new TESS Sector 88 data, we also rule out the 101-day orbital period alias for HIP 41378 d, and find that the remaining viable solutions are centered on the 278, 371, and 1113-day aliases. The latter two imply dynamical configurations that challenge the canonical view of planet e as the dominant perturber of planet f. Our results suggest that HIP 41378 d may instead play the leading role in shaping the TTV of HIP 41378 f.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Volatile Gas in the Giant Impact Disk around the 150-Myr old HD 23514</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of CO$_2$ gas emission around HD 23514, an F5V star in the $\sim$150 Myr-old Pleiades cluster, hosting one of the rare giant-impact disks with unique mineralogy dominated by silica dust. We show that the dust feature remains stable over several decades, and that the sub-$\mu$m grains, which give rise to the $\sim$9 $\mu$m feature, are co-spatial with the hot CO$_2$ molecules within the sub-au vicinity of the star. Examining the Spitzer spectrum taken 15 years earlier, we show that the CO$_2$ emission was also present at 4.3 $\sigma$ significance. The existence of tiny silica grains and volatile gas requires special conditions to prevent the rapid loss caused by stellar radiation pressure and photodissociation. We explore several pathways explaining the observed properties and suggest that a past giant impact and/or stripping atmospheric event, involving large bodies with volatile content similar to the carbonaceous chondritic material, can simultaneously explain both the silica and volatile emission. Our discovery provides an important context for the amount of volatiles that a newly formed planet or the largest planetesimals could retain during the giant impact phase in the early solar system evolution.</description>

      <title>Phosphates Reveal High pH Ocean Water on Enceladus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enceladus offers our best opportunity for exploring the chemistry of an ocean on another world. Here, we perform geochemical modeling to show how the distribution of phosphate species found in ice grains from Enceladus's plume provides a very straightforward constraint on the pH of the host solution. The ratio of HPO$_4$/PO$_4$ species serves as a pH indicator. We find evidence of moderately alkaline water (pH 10.1-11.6)--significantly more alkaline than current estimates (~8-9) of the pH of Enceladus's ocean. Nevertheless, the pH range from phosphates is consistent with the CO$_2$/H$_2$O ratio measured in the plume if CO$_2$ exsolves from ocean water according to its equilibrium solubility. A simple energy balance can be used to quantify volatile fractionation during gas transport inside Enceladus's tiger stripes; we deduce that ~83% of water vapor is removed as ice during transport between the liquid-vapor interface and where gases exit the subsurface. We also explore how CO$_2$ degassing may lead to an increase in the apparent pH of ocean water. We generate maps of allowed combinations of pH and dissolved inorganic carbon concentration of the source water for a wide range of scenarios. Our preferred interpretation, constrained by the observed heat flux, implies minimal CO$_2$ degassing from ocean water. Hence, the pH recorded by phosphates should closely approximate that of the ocean; our best estimate is pH ~10.6. Such a high pH seems to reflect a major role of silicates enriched in Na, Mg, or Fe(II) interacting extensively with ocean water. Silica nanoparticles would not form or would subsequently dissolve if the pH is too high (&gt;10.5). The outgassing model presented here provides a new path to quantify the dissolved concentrations of volatile species.</description>

      <title>Saturns, but not super-Jupiters, occur more frequently in the presence of inner super-Earths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studies from recent years have reached different conclusions regarding how frequently super-Earths are accompanied by long period giant planets and vice versa. This relation has been predicted to be mass dependent by planet formation models. We investigate that as the origin of the discrepancy using a radial velocity sample: the California Legacy Survey. We perform detection completeness corrections in order to discard detection bias as a possible explanation to our results. After bias corrections, we find that cold Jupiters are 5.65 times more massive when not in company of an inner super-Earth, while super-Earths are not significantly more massive while in company of an outer giant planet. We also report an occurrence enhancement for Saturns (median projected mass of 0.6MJ) while in presence of a super-Earth by a factor of 4, and for super-Earths in presence of Saturns by the same factor. This positive correlation disappears for super-Jupiters (median projected mass of 3.1MJ). These results show that while cold Jupiters are generally accompanied by inner super-Earths, this does not hold for the largest giant planets, such as those that will be discovered by Gaia, which will likely not be accompanied by transiting planets. The mass dependence, in combination with different detection limits of different surveys, may explain the discrepancies concerning occurrence relations between cold Jupiters and super-Earths.</description>

      <title>Metal Polluted White Dwarfs with 21 {\mu}m IR excesses from JWST/MIRI: Planets or Dust?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: White dwarfs with metal pollution are caused by the accretion of rocky dust from tidally disrupted minor bodies and are signposts for planetary systems. These minor bodies are perturbed by planets that have survived post-main sequence evolution. Open questions exist as to the typical mass of the perturbers and the specific planetary architectures that cause metal pollution. JWST's sensitivity in the mid-IR has opened new doors to deciphering polluted white dwarfs. We present JWST Cycle 1 MIRI imaging of four nearby metal-polluted white dwarfs with the goal of detecting and characterizing planetary companions. With deep mid-IR imaging we are sensitive to cold Jupiter-mass planet analogs. In addition to finding two candidate planetary companions, for the first time we detect significant excesses above the expected photospheric emission at 21~$\mu$m for two of our targets, WD 2149+021 and WD 2105-820. WD 2105-280 has a candidate planetary companion at a projected separation of 34 au and an infrared excess--if both candidates are confirmed, it would represent the first WD multi-planet system. We investigate whether these excesses could be caused by very low luminosity warm dust disks or planets. While both are likely, we argue that the most likely explanation for the excesses is that they are the thermal emission from jovian-mass planets in orbits with semi-major axes $&lt;$10 au, using a combination of observational constraints. If most of the candidate planets presented here are confirmed, it would suggest that metal polluted white dwarfs are frequently orbited by at least one giant planet.</description>

      <title>Wide-field Polarization Imaging and Numerical Modeling of the Coma and Tail of Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Imaging polarimetry is a well-known method for analysing the structure and composition of cometary dust. Accordingly, comets are classified based on the phase angle dependent degree of linear polarization of their comae. The goal of this study is to examine the size and structure of the dust grains in the coma and in particular in the tail of the bright comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan-ATLAS) and to infer possible variations. For this purpose, we rely on the method of telescopic wide-field polarimetric imaging of the comet in order to obtain the dependence of the degree of linear polarization (DoLP) of the coma and tail on the phase angle across a broad range, using an off-the-shelf industrial grade polarization camera combined with a small telescope of short aperture ratio. These observations are accompanied by T-matrix modeling using the MSTM4 software framework for simulation of light scattering by fractal agglomerates of spherical monomer particles. Our observations indicate that the coma exhibits a high maximum DoLP of 0.34, which is further exceeded by a factor of about two by the DoLP of the comet's tail. Differences in the phase angle of maximum DoLP between coma and tail indicate a higher carbon vs.\ silicate fraction in the coma than in the tail. Our simulations are able to reproduce the observations when assuming that the dust agglomerates are formed of larger monomers in the coma than in the tail. A possible explanation of these results is that the coma monomers are coated by a thin layer of frozen volatiles, which sublimate due to solar heating when the dust moves from the coma towards the tail.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Exoplanets for Assessing Their Potential Habitability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Statistical-likelihood Exoplanetary Habitability Index (SEPHI) serves as a valuable tool for prioritizing targets for further study and identifying potentially habitable environments. In this paper, we present SEPHI 2.0, which incorporates several key improvements: (1) updated methods for estimating exoplanet internal structures and magnetic fields; (2) the inclusion of orbital eccentricity in assessing the potential for liquid water on an exoplanet's surface; and (3) a new exoplanet mass-radius relationship. SEPHI 2.0 retains its probabilistic framework and combines the different subindexes by selecting the most restrictive one. In SEPHI 2.0, atmospheric retention is consolidated into a single index that incorporates both thermal (Jeans escape) and nonthermal (stellar wind and magnetic effect) processes. Recent advancements in estimating exoplanet internal structures and magnetic fields have been integrated. Additionally, a new empirical exoplanet mass-radius relationship is introduced. All this is incorporated into the SADE code, which uses key data on exoplanets and their host stars to assess habitability and prioritize targets for further study, providing a comprehensive output of an exoplanetary system's physical characteristics. SADE is available as a free online tool. Notably, this is the first approach to including estimated exoplanet magnetic 8elds in a habitability index. The SADE software facilitates the identification of potentially habitable exoplanets. Among the 5500+ confirmed exoplanets, only a few-such as Kepler-62f and GJ 514b achieve SEPHI 2.0 scores close to 1. It is also noticeable that, according to our studies, TRAPPIST-1 f and g are ranked higher than TRAPPIST-1 e in terms of habitability potential.</description>

      <title>The ESPRESSO transmission spectrum of HD$\,$189733$\,$b : Extracting the planetary sodium and lithium signatures amid stellar contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.21459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.21459v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While transmission spectroscopy has allowed us to detect many atomic and molecular species in exoplanet atmospheres, the improvement in resolution and signal-to-noise ratio enabled us to become sensitive to planet-occulted line distortions (POLDs) in the spectrum that are induced by center-to-limb variations and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. POLDs can bias the interpretation of the transmission spectrum, and it is difficult to correct for them with stellar models. We analyzed two ESPRESSO transits (R $\sim$ 140$\,$000) of the archetypal hot Jupiter HD$\,$189733$\,$b. The transmission spectrum of this aligned system is heavily affected by POLDs, stellar activity, and instrumental effects. It is therefore a challenging study case of how to account for these effects when the planetary signal is retrieved from chemical species through transmission spectroscopy. We confirm the previous detections of the sodium doublet signature in the upper atmosphere of HD$\,$189733$\,$b. When we accounted for POLDs and isolated the planetary signal from uncorrected stellar residuals, we found a shallower (0.432 $\pm$ 0.027 %) and more strongly blueshifted (-7.97 $\pm$ 0.28 km/s) signal. We attempted to reinterpret the other high-resolution sodium studies of this system in light of our results. We suggest that the POLDs and stellar activity are insufficiently corrected for in all analyses, including ours. We also detected a planetary lithium signature of 0.102 $\pm$ 0.016 % (6.4$\sigma$) at a blueshift of -2.4 $\pm$ 1.8 km/s.</description>

      <title>One Giant Leap for Womankind: First Menstrual Cups Tested in Space Flight Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the early days of space exploration, when Sally Ride was offered 100 tampons for a week-long mission, menstrual medical devices first began to be used in space conditions. Since then, hormonal menstrual suppression has become the preferred method for managing menstruation in space, offering significant advantages. However, this is not an option for astronauts who choose to menstruate. The lack of sustainable menstrual technologies will pose challenges for long-duration missions to the Moon and Mars, where astronauts may spend years in space. The AstroCup mission represents the first effort to test menstrual cups in spaceflight, evaluating their durability and functionality. Through material integrity tests and functional assessments using a rheological analogue of human blood, we demonstrate the resilience of menstrual cups and discuss their implications for sustainable menstrual management in future lunar and Martian missions.</description>

      <title>The Rayleigh Criterion: Resolution Limits of Astronomical Periodograms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Rayleigh criterion determines the resolution limit of a periodogram, which is the minimum frequency separation required to barely resolve two sinusoids. Failing to consider the Rayleigh criterion may result in incorrect interpretations of long-period signals or spurious claims that two closely spaced periodogram peaks represent two distinct physical processes. We demonstrate how applying the Rayleigh criterion can help observers avoid false positive detections caused by uneven observing cadence or insufficient observing time baseline. We present three synthetic datasets that illustrate (1) a single oscillation with a split Lomb-Scargle periodogram peak resulting from uneven observing cadence can be mistaken for two oscillations if the Rayleigh criterion is neglected, (2) oversampling a periodogram's frequency grid does not improve resolution, and (3) observing time baseline requirements for resolving two closely spaced oscillations. We use the Rayleigh criterion to revisit detections of planets, stellar activity, and differential rotation from four published datasets. We show that the frequency separation between planet 55~Cnc~d and the activity cycle is too small to distinguish the two phenomena based on published radial velocities (RVs) alone. Likewise, the contested 4970-day planet orbiting HD~99492 cannot be statistically separated from zero frequency. We determine that a cubic polynomial better explains the long-term RV variability of Barnard's star than a sinusoid model. Finally, our re-analysis of {\it Kepler} observations of two active stars shows that the signals previously attributed to differential rotation can be modeled by a Gaussian process with a single quasiperiodicity. This work demonstrates the importance of the Rayleigh criterion when constructing a time-domain model.</description>

      <title>Physics Of Eclipsing Binaries. VII. Interferometric module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interferometric measurements are essential to constrain models of stellar systems, by spatially resolving angular distances and diameters well below the classical diffraction limit. In this work, we describe the interferometric module of Phoebe, which could be used just for this purpose. Since binaries in Phoebe are represented by a triangular mesh, our complex model is based on the integration over triangles. Consequently, Roche distortion, rotation, non-synchronicity, misalignment, eclipses of components, darkening, reflection, or irradiation are all accurately accounted for. For comparison purposes, we provide a simplified model, where components are represented by circular disks. The key point of our approach is a possibility of combination with other datasets (light curves, radial velocities), which allows to construct robust models of stellar systems. This draft refers to a development version of Phoebe, available at https://github.com/miroslavbroz/phoebe2/tree/interferometry . It is not yet included in the official Phoebe repository!</description>

Abstract: We present the analysis of a microlensing event KMT-2022-BLG-0086 of which the overall light curve is not described by a binary-lens single-source (2L1S) model, which suggests the existence of an extra lens or an extra source. We found that the event is best explained by the binary-lens binary-source (2L2S) model, but the 2L2S model is only favored over the triple-lens single-source (3L1S) model by $\Delta\chi^{2} \simeq 9$. Although the event has noticeable anomalies around the peak of the light curve, they are not enough covered to constrain the angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$, thus we only measure the minimum angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E,min}$. From the Bayesian analysis, it is found that that the binary lens system is a binary star with masses of $(m_1,m_2)=(0.46^{+0.35}_{-0.25}\, M_\odot, 0.75^{+0.67}_{-0.55}\, M_\odot)$ at a distance of $D_{\rm L}=5.87^{+1.21}_{-1.79}$ kpc, while the triple lens system is a brown dwarf or a massive giant planet in a low-mass binary-star system with masses of $(m_1,m_2,m_3)=(0.43^{+0.41}_{-0.35}\, M_\odot, 0.056^{+0.055}_{-0.047}\, M_\odot, 20.84^{+20.20}_{-17.04}\, M_{\rm J})$ at a distance of $D_{\rm L}=4.06^{+1.39}_{-3.28}$ kpc, indicating a disk lens system. The 2L2S model yields the relative lens-source proper motion of $\mu_{\rm rel} \geqslant 4.6\, \rm mas\, yr^{-1}$ that is consistent with the Bayesian result, whereas the 3L1S model yields $\mu_{\rm rel} \geqslant 18.9\, \rm mas\, yr^{-1}$, which is more than three times larger than that of a typical disk object of $\sim 6\, \rm mas\, yr^{-1}$ and thus is not consistent with the Bayesian result. This suggests that the event is likely caused by the binary-lens binary-source model.</description>

Abstract: Modeling the internal structure of self-gravitating solid and liquid bodies presents a challenge, as existing approaches are often limited to either overly simplistic constant-density approximations or more complex numerical equations of state. We present a detailed analysis of a tractable and physically motivated model for perfectly elastic, spherically symmetric self-gravitating bodies in hydrostatic equilibrium. The model employs a logarithmic equation of state (logotropic EOS) with a non-zero initial density and constant bulk modulus. Importantly, scaling properties of the model allow all solutions to be derived from a single, universal solution of an ordinary differential equation, resembling the Lane-Emden and Chandrasekhar models. The model provides new insights into stability issues and reveals oscillatory asymptotic behavior in the mass-radius relation, including the existence of both a maximum mass and a maximum radius. We derive useful, simple analytical approximations for key properties, such as central overdensity, moment of inertia, binding energy, and gravitational potential, applicable to small, metallic bodies like asteroids and moons. These new approximations could aid future research, including space mining and the scientific characterization of small Solar System bodies.</description>

      <title>Two neighbours of the ultra-short-period Earth-sized planet K2-157 b in the warm Neptunian savanna</title>

Abstract: The formation and evolution of ultra-short-period (USP) planets is poorly understood. However, it is widely thought that these planets migrated inwards through interactions with outer neighbours. We aim to confirm and characterise the USP Earth-sized planet K2-157 b ($P_{\rm orb}$ = 8.8 h). To do so, we measured 49 radial velocities (RVs) with the ESPRESSO spectrograph and derived the properties of the system through an RV and transit model. We detect two additional super-Neptune-mass planets within the warm Neptunian savanna, K2-157 c ($P_{\rm orb, c}$ = $25.942^{+0.045}_{-0.044}$ d, $M_{\rm p, c} \, \textrm{sin} \, i$ = $30.8 \pm 1.9$ $\rm M_{\oplus}$), and K2-157 d ($P_{\rm orb, d}$ = $66.50^{+0.71}_{-0.59}$ d, $M_{\rm p,d} \, \textrm{sin}\,i$ = $23.3 \pm 2.5$ $\rm M_{\oplus}$). The mass of K2-157 b, $M_{\rm p,b}$ = $1.14^{+0.41}_{-0.42}$ $\rm M_{\oplus}$ ($&lt;$ 2.4 $\rm M_{\oplus}$ at 3$\sigma$), together with its radius, $R_{\rm p}$ = 0.935 $\pm$ 0.090 $\rm R_{\oplus}$, make the planet compatible with a rocky composition. K2 data discard non-grazing transit configurations for K2-157 c ($i_{\rm c}$ $&lt;$ 88.4$^{\circ}$ at 3$\sigma$), and ESPRESSO data constrain the eccentricities of K2-157 c and K2-157 d to $e_{\rm c}$ $&lt;$ 0.2 and $e_{\rm d}$ $&lt;$ 0.5 at 3$\sigma$. At a population level, we find that the trend that the closest USP planets tend to orbit late-type stars does not hold when scaling the orbital separation to the Roche limit, which suggests that the orbital distribution of the closest planets across spectral types is determined by tidal disruption. The orbital architecture of K2-157 is unusual, with only one similar case reported to date: 55 Cnc. The USP planets of these systems, being accompanied by massive, long-period, relatively spaced, and possibly misaligned neighbours, could have migrated inwards through eccentricity-based mechanisms triggered by secular interactions.</description>

      <title>Different Inhomogeneous Evolutionary Histories for Uranus and Neptune</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13857</link>

Abstract: We present updated non-adiabatic and inhomogeneous evolution models for Uranus and Neptune, employing an interior composition of methane, ammonia, water, and rocks. Following formation trends of the gas giants, Uranus and Neptune formation models are applied, where both planets begin with layers stable to convection. Both planets are subject to convective mixing throughout their evolution. Uranus undergoes modest convective mixing, preserving much of its primordial internal heat. In contrast, Neptune's interior undergoes extensive mixing, homogenization, and adiabatic cooling of the outer 40\% of its envelope. The subsequent release of internal energy in Neptune, driven by the convective instability of its primordial outer compositional gradient, accounts for its higher luminosity relative to Uranus. Thus, the observed luminosity differences between Uranus and Neptune could be primarily dictated by the convective stability of their outer envelopes. The extensive convective mixing in Neptune leads to a higher metallicity in its outer region compared to Uranus, a feature seen in atmospheric measurements and shown in past interior models of Neptune. Due to Neptune's more pronounced cooling, our models predict favorable conditions for hydrogen-water immiscibility in its envelope.</description>

      <title>A Homogeneous Catalog of Oscillating Solar-Type Stars Observed by the Kepler Mission and a New Amplitude Scaling Relation Including Chromospheric Activity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a homogeneous catalog of global asteroseismic parameters and derived stellar parameters for 765 Kepler main-sequence and subgiant stars. The catalog was produced by re-analyzing all available Kepler DR25 short-cadence data using pySYD, an automated pipeline to extract global asteroseismic parameters. We find 50 new detections, seven of which are also planet candidate host stars. We find excellent agreement between our $\nu_{\text{max}}$ and $\Delta \nu$ measurements and literature values, with an average offset of $0.2 \pm 0.4\%$ ($\sigma=5\%$) and $0.2 \pm 0.7\%$ ($\sigma=2\%$), respectively. In addition, we derive stellar radii and masses with an average precision of $2.7\%$ and $10.4\%$, respectively, and find a mean offset of $0.8 \pm 0.2\%$ ($\sigma=6\%$) between our radii derived with asteroseismology and those from Gaia parallaxes. Using spectroscopic $\log{R'_{\text{HK}}}$ activity measurements from Keck/HIRES, we derive an amplitude scaling relation with an activity term for main-sequence and subgiant stars, which successfully predicts amplitudes with a precision of $\approx 8-9\%$. Our work is the largest and most homogeneous asteroseismic catalog of Kepler main-sequence and subgiant stars to date, including a total of 101 stars hosting planet candidates and 451 stars with measured rotation periods.</description>
