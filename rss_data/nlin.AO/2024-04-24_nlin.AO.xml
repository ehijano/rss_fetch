      <title>Forecasting the Forced Van der Pol Equation with Frequent Phase Shifts Using a Reservoir Computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A reservoir computer (RC) is a recurrent neural network (RNN) framework that achieves computational efficiency where only readout layer training is required. Additionally, it effectively predicts nonlinear dynamical system tasks and has various applications. RC is effective for forecasting nonautonomous dynamical systems with gradual changes to the external drive amplitude. This study investigates the predictability of nonautonomous dynamical systems with rapid changes to the phase of the external drive. The forced Van der Pol equation was employed for the base model, implementing forecasting tasks with the RC. The study findings suggest that, despite hidden variables, a nonautonomous dynamical system with rapid changes to the phase of the external drive is predictable. Therefore, RC can offer better schedules for individual shift workers.</description>

      <title>Mining higher-order triadic interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex systems often present higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order networks, found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have been so far mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical principle to model and mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions often ignored, which can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.</description>

      <title>Unveiling dynamic bifurcation of Resch-patterned origami for self-adaptive impact mitigation structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14737v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the classic realm of impact mitigation, targeting different impact scenarios with a universally designed device still remains an unassailable challenge. In this study, we delve into the untapped potential of Resch-patterned origami for impact mitigation, specifically considering the adaptively reconfigurable nature of the Resch origami structure. Our unit-cell-level analyses reveal two distinctive modes of deformation, each characterized by contrasting mechanical responses: the folding mode that displays monostability coupled with strain-hardening, and the unfolding mode that manifests bistability, facilitating energy absorption through snap-through dynamics. Drop tests further unveil a novel dynamic bifurcation phenomenon, where the origami switches between folding and unfolding depending on impact speed, thereby showcasing its innate self-reconfigurability in a wide range of dynamic events. The tessellated meter-scale Resch structure mimicking an automotive bumper inherits this dynamically bifurcating behavior, demonstrating the instantaneous morphing into favorable deformation mode to minimize the peak acceleration upon impact. This suggests a self-adaptive and universally applicable impact-absorbing nature of the Resch-patterned origami system. We believe that our findings pave the way for developing smart, origami-inspired impact mitigation devices capable of real-time response and adaptation to external stimuli, offering insights into designing universally protective structures with enhanced performance in response to various impact scenarios.</description>
