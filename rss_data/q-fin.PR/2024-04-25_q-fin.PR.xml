      <title>Joint calibration to SPX and VIX Derivative Markets with Composite Change of Time Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.16295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.16295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) is calculated from SPX options and derivatives of VIX are also traded in market, which leads to the so-called "consistent modeling" problem. This paper proposes a time-changed L\'evy model for log price with a composite change of time structure to capture both features of the implied SPX volatility and the implied volatility of volatility. Consistent modeling is achieved naturally via flexible choices of jumps and leverage effects, as well as the composition of time changes. Many celebrated models are covered as special cases. From this model, we derive an explicit form of the characteristic function for the asset price (SPX) and the pricing formula for European options as well as VIX options. The empirical results indicate great competence of the proposed model in the problem of joint calibration of the SPX/VIX Markets.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Impact: How Decentralized Exchange Designs Shape Traders' Behavior on Perpetual Future Contracts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03953v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze traders' behavior within both centralized exchanges (CEXs) and decentralized exchanges (DEXs), focusing on the volatility of Bitcoin prices and the trading activity of investors engaged in perpetual future contracts. We categorize the architecture of perpetual future exchanges into three distinct models, each exhibiting unique patterns of trader behavior in relation to trading volume, open interest, liquidation, and leverage. Our detailed examination of DEXs, especially those utilizing the Virtual Automated Market Making (VAMM) Model, uncovers a differential impact of open interest on long versus short positions. In exchanges which operate under the Oracle Pricing Model, we find that traders primarily act as price takers, with their trading actions reflecting direct responses to price movements of the underlying assets. Furthermore, our research highlights a significant propensity among less informed traders to overreact to positive news, as demonstrated by an increase in long positions. This study contributes to the understanding of market dynamics in digital asset exchanges, offering insights into the behavioral finance for future innovation of decentralized finance.</description>
