      <title>Strange metal and superconductor in the two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The two-dimensional Yukawa-Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (YSYK) model provides a universal theory of quantum phase transitions in metals in the presence of quenched random spatial fluctuations in the local position of the quantum critical point. It has a Fermi surface coupled to a scalar field by spatially random Yukawa interactions. We present full numerical solutions of a self-consistent disorder averaged analysis of the YSYK model in both the normal and superconducting states, obtaining electronic spectral functions, frequency-dependent conductivity, and superfluid stiffness. Our results reproduce key aspects of observations in the cuprates as analyzed by Michon $et$ $al$. (Nat. Comm. $\bf{14}$, 3033 (2023)). We also find a regime of increasing zero temperature superfluid stiffness with decreasing superconducting critical temperature, as is observed in bulk cuprates.</description>

      <title>$\textit{Ab initio}$ study of highly tunable charge transfer in $\beta$-RuCl$_3$/graphene heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterostructures of graphene in proximity to magnetic insulators open the possibility to investigate exotic states emerging from the interplay of magnetism, strain and charge transfer between the layers. Recent reports on the growth of self-integrated atomic wires of $\beta$-RuCl$_3$ on graphite suggest these materials as versatile candidates to investigate these effects. Here we present detailed first principles calculations on the charge transfer and electronic structure of $\beta$-RuCl$_3$/heterostructures and provide a comparison with the work function analysis of the related honeycomb family members $\alpha$-RuX$_3$ (X = Cl,Br,I). We find that proximity of the two layers leads to a hole-doped graphene and electron-doped RuX$_3$ in all cases, which is sensitively dependent on the distance between the two layers. Furthermore, strain effects due to lattice mismatch control the magnetization which itself has a strong effect on the charge transfer. Charge accumulation in $\beta$-RuCl$_3$ strongly drops away from the chain making such heterostructures suitable candidates for sharp interfacial junctions in graphene-based devices.</description>

      <title>Emergent Universal Quench Dynamics in Randomly Interacting Spin Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Universality often emerges in low-energy equilibrium physics of quantum many-body systems, despite their microscopic complexity and variety. Recently, there has been a growing interest in studying far-from-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems. Such dynamics usually involves highly excited states beyond the traditional low-energy theory description. Whether universal behaviors can also emerge in such non-equilibrium dynamics is a central issue at the frontier of quantum dynamics. Here we report the experimental observation of universal dynamics by monitoring the spin depolarization process in a solid-state NMR system described by an ensemble of randomly interacting spins. The spin depolarization can be related to temporal spin-spin correlation functions at high temperatures. We discover a remarkable phenomenon that these correlation functions obey a universal functional form. This experimental fact helps us identify the dominant interacting processes in the spin depolarization dynamics that lead to this universality. Our observation demonstrates the existence of universality even in non-equilibrium dynamics at high temperatures, thereby complementing the well-established universality in low-energy physics.</description>

      <title>Hinge non-Hermitian skin effect in the single-particle properties of a strongly correlated f-electron system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit novel phenomena without Hermitian counterparts, such as exceptional points and the non-Hermitian skin effect. These non-Hermitian topological phenomena are observable in single-particle excitations of correlated systems in equilibrium, which are described by Green's functions. In this paper, we demonstrate the appearance of the hinge non-Hermitian skin effect in the effective Hamiltonian that describes the single-particle properties of an $f$-electron system. Skin effects result in a strong sensitivity to boundary conditions, and a large number of eigenstates localize at one boundary when open boundary conditions are applied. Our system exhibits such sensitivity and hosts skin modes localized around hinges. This hinge skin effect is induced by a non-Hermitian topology of the surface Brillouin zone. The hinge skin modes are observed for one-dimensional subsystems located between one pair of exceptional points in the surface Brillouin zone. This paper highlights that correlated materials are an exciting platform for analyzing non-Hermitian phenomena.</description>

      <title>Weak anti-localization and spin-momentum locking in topological insulator Ta$_2$Ni$_3$Te$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the synthesis, structural characterization, and investigation of electrical transport, magnetic and specific heat properties of bulk semiconducting layered material Ta$_2$Ni$_3$Te$_5$. Ta$_2$Ni$_3$Te$_5$ crystallizes in the centrosymmetric orthorhombic structure with space group Pnma. Temperature-dependent resistivity shows a transition from semiconducting to metallic nature below 7 K. Low-temperature magnetotransport studies show large magnetoresistance with the signature of weak anti-localization (WAL) effect. The magnetoconductivity data has been used to explore the origin of the WAL effect, extract relevant parameters, and study their variation with temperature. The presence of significant electron-phonon interaction is evident from the MR vs. B/R plot (Kohler's plot). Isothermal field-dependent magnetization studies show Berry paramagnetism as the signature for spin-orbit coupling-induced spin-momentum locking. Observation of WAL effect and spin-momentum locking phenomenon demonstrate Ta$_2$Ni$_3$Te$_5$ as a promising low dimensional material for quantum spin Hall insulator-based applications.</description>

      <title>Charge ordered phases in the hole-doped triangular Mott insulator 4Hb-TaS2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07960</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07960v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 4Hb-TaS2 has been proposed to possess unconventional superconductivity with broken time reveral symmetry due to distinctive layered structure, featuring a heterojunction between a 2D triangular Mott insulator and a charge density wave metal. However, since a frustrated spin state in the correlated insulating layer is susceptible to charge ordering with carrier doping, it is required to investigate the charge distribution driven by inter-layer charge transfer to understand its superconductivity. Here, we use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/S) to investigate the charge ordered phases of 1T-TaS2 layers within 4Hb-TaS2, explicitly focusing on the non-half-filled regime. Our STS results show an energy gap which exhibits an out-of-phase relation with the charge density. We ascribe the competition between on-site and nonlocal Coulomb repulsion as the driving force for the charge-ordered insulating phase of a doped triangular Mott insulator. In addition, we discuss the role of the insulating layer in the enhanced superconductivity of 4Hb-TaS2.</description>

      <title>dx2-y2-wave Bose Metal induced by the next-nearest-neighbor hopping t'</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08131v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity arises when electrons form Cooper pairs with phase coherence. In contrast, a lack of phase coherence in Cooper pairs can lead to an uncondensed metallic ground state known as the Bose metal state. In this study, we investigate an attractively interacting fermionic system with nearest-neighbor (NN) hopping (t) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping (t') anisotropy between two species of spins in a two-dimensional (2D) lattice. Utilizing the constrained path quantum Monte Carlo (CPQMC) method, we demonstrate the existence of a dx2-y2-wave Cooper pair Bose metal (CPBM) phase with t'/t &gt; 0.7. The CPBM phase exhibits a dome-like structure in the phase diagram of filling n~0.65, with the maximal region around an optimal t'/t ~ 0.2, suggesting that an appropriate value of t' facilitates the formation of the Bose metal. Furthermore, we find that a Bose metal formed by fermions with a closed Fermi surface confirms that the crucial condition for this exotic phenomenon is primarily the anisotropy of the Fermi surface, rather than its topology. Our finding of the dx2-y2-wave CPBM demonstrates the same pairing symmetry as the pseudogap behavior in cuprates, and its experimental realization in ultracold atom systems is also feasible.</description>

      <title>Emergent spinon-holon Feshbach resonance in a doped Majumdar-Ghosh model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experimental and numerical spectroscopy have revealed rich physics in antiferromagnets, in particular in frustrated and doped systems. The Majumdar-Ghosh (MG) model has an analytically known spin-disordered ground state of dimerized singlets as a result of magnetic frustration. Here we study the single-hole angle-resolved photoemission spectrum (ARPES) of a doped MG model, where we introduce a spin-hole interaction that is experimentally accessible with ultracold molecules. We report a bound spinon-holon ground state and clear signatures of a spinon-holon molecule state and polarons in the ARPES spectrum at different magnetizations. Moreover, we find signatures of an emergent Feshbach resonance with tunable interactions associated with the unbinding of the spinon and the holon. Our results provide new insights into the physics of dopants in frustrated $t$-$J$ models and establish the latter as a new platform for studies of emergent few-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>Role of Kinetic Exchange and Coulomb Interaction in Bonding of Hydrogen Molecular Systems and Excited States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07729v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of the electronic structure and bonding characteristics of hydrogen-based molecular systems (\ch{H2+}, \ch{H2}, \ch{H2-}) using the Exact Diagonalization Ab Initio (EDABI) approach within the framework of combined first- and second-quantization. By analyzing the relative contributions of kinetic exchange and effective Coulomb interactions, we provide a comprehensive understanding of covalency, atomicity, and ionicity as a function of interatomic distances. Our approach leverages exact solutions of the extended Heitler-London model to quantify these interactions, extending the analysis to the discussion of properties of excited states and the dissociation limit to these molecules. The findings reveal significant differences in bonding characteristics, particularly highlighting the stability and bonding nature of the neutral \ch{H2} molecule compared to its ionic counterparts. This study not only enhances an understanding of molecular interactions in hydrogen systems but also demonstrates the potential of the EDABI approach in developing more accurate computational models in quantum chemistry.</description>

      <title>How to accurately measure the mobility and viscosity of two-dimensional carriers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, a hydrodynamic behavior of ultrahigh mobility viscous two-dimensional electron gas in GaAs/AlGaAs quantum well was intensively studied based on relevant negative magnetoresistance (NMR) data. The two-dimensional Gurzhi model with(without) simplification combined with extra assumptions on electron-electron collisions rate often lead to a certain agreement with experiment. We provide ab initio analysis of the NMR data[Q. Shi et al, Phys. Rev. B. 89, 201301(R) (2014)] and demonstrate exceptional agreement with the uncut Gurzhi model attracting a single fitting parameter of the effective stream width. Our approach allows one to identify the intrinsic carrier mobility higher than that deduced by conventional methods. The NMR data analysis is proposed for powerful tool for two-dimensional viscometry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that spin-singlet $s$-wave multi-band superconductors have a topological phase protected by rotation symmetry and time-reversal symmetry without spin-orbit coupling in two and three dimensions. This topological phase, an example of a representation-protected topological phase, has a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index and is stable as long as the bands at the Fermi energy are formed by a doublet of orbital states with finite angular momenta. In the limit of weak superconducting pair potential, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ index gives a Fermi-surface formula and is related to the winding number of three-dimensional strong topological superconductors of class CI. We present a model of a topological $s_{\pm}$-wave superconductor that has gapless surface states with a quadratic dispersion and suggest a connection with iron-based superconductors.</description>

      <title>Holstein polarons, Rashba-like spin splitting and Ising superconductivity in electron-doped MoSe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Interaction between electrons and phonons in solids is a key effect defining physical properties of materials such as electrical and thermal conductivity. In transitional metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) the electron-phonon coupling results in the creation of polarons, quasiparticles that manifest themselves as discrete features in the electronic spectral function. In this study, we report the formation of polarons at the alkali dosed MoSe2 surface, where Rashba-like spin splitting of the conduction band states is caused by an inversion-symmetry breaking electric field. In addition, we observe the crossover from phonon-like to plasmon-like polaronic spectral features at MoSe2 surface with increasing doping. Our findings support the concept of electron-phonon coupling mediated superconductivity in electron-doped layered TMDC materials, observed using ionic liquid gating technology. Furthermore, the discovered spin-splitting at the Fermi level could offer crucial experimental validation for theoretical models of Ising-type superconductivity in these materials.</description>

      <title>Massive 1D Dirac Line, Solitons and Reversible Manipulation on the Surface of a Prototype Obstructed Atomic Insulator, Silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topologically trivial insulators can be classified into atomic insulators (AIs) and obstructed atomic insulators (OAIs) depending on whether the Wannier charge centers are localized or not at spatial positions occupied by atoms. An OAI can possess unusual properties such as surface states along certain crystalline surfaces, which advantageously appear in materials with much larger bulk energy gap than topological insulators, making them more attractive for potential applications. In this work, we show that a well-known crystal, silicon (Si) is a model OAI, which naturally explains some of Si's unusual properties such as its famous (111) surface states. On this surface, using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we reveal sharp quasi-1D massive Dirac line dispersions; we also observe, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS), topological solitons at the interface of the two atomic chains. Remarkably, we show that the different chain domains can be reversibly switched at the nanometer scale, suggesting the application potential in ultra-high density storage devices.</description>

      <title>Protected gap closing and reopening in topological-insulator Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the seminal proposal by Fu and Kane, the superconducting proximity effect was predicted to transform the surface state of a topological insulator (TI) into a topological superconductor, forming a nonchiral 1D Majorana state within a linear Josephson junction on the TI surface. The hallmark of this 1D Majorana state is a robust gap closing as a function of the superconducting phase difference $\varphi$ across the junction, which alternates in and out of the topological phase. These topological phase-transitions occur at $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$ with integer $n$, leading to a $4\pi$-periodicity of the ground state. While the $4\pi$-periodicity has been indirectly inferred in the AC Josephson effect, the direct observation of the 1D Majorana state in a TI Josephson junction has remained contentious. Here, we report the direct observation of topological phase-transitions in a TI Josephson junction, where the local density of states is probed via tunnel contacts and $\varphi$ is controlled by a flux loop. The observed transitions are independent of the chemical potential, reinforcing their topological origin. Under an applied perpendicular magnetic field, Josephson vortices form, making $\varphi$ position-dependent. In this case, the gap closing occurs locally at the Josephson vortex cores where $\varphi = (2n+1)\pi$, which we also observe. Our findings provide direct confirmation of the Fu-Kane proposal and robust evidence for the emergence of topological superconductivity in a TI Josephson junction.</description>

      <title>GPU-accelerated Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo with multi-Slater determinant trial states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The accuracy of phaseless auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (ph-AFQMC) can be systematically improved with better trial states. Using multi-Slater determinant trial states, ph-AFQMC has the potential to faithfully treat strongly correlated systems, while balancing the static and dynamical correlations on an equal footing. This preprint presents an implementation and application of graphics processing unit-accelerated ph-AFQMC, for multi-Slater determinant trial wavefunctions (GPU-accelerated MSD-AFQMC), to enable efficient simulation of large-scale, strongly correlated systems. This approach allows for nearly-exact computation of ground state energies in multi-reference systems. Our GPU-accelerated MSD-AFQMC is implemented in the open-source code \texttt{ipie}, a Python-based AFQMC package [\textit{J. Chem. Theory Comput.}, 2022, 19(1): 109-121]. We benchmark the performance of the GPU code on transition-metal clusters like [Cu$_2$O$_2$]$^{2+}$ and [Fe$_2$S$_2$(SCH$_3$)]$^{2-}$. The GPU code achieves at least sixfold speedup in both cases, comparing the timings of a single A100 GPU to that of a 32-CPU node. For [Fe$_2$S$_2$(SCH$_3$)]$^{2-}$, we demonstrate that our GPU MSD-AFQMC can recover the dynamical correlation necessary for chemical accuracy with an MSD trial, despite the large number of determinants required ($&gt;10^5$). Our work significantly enhances the efficiency of MSD-AFQMC calculations for large, strongly correlated molecules by utilizing GPUs, offering a promising path for exploring the electronic structure of transition metal complexes.</description>

      <title>Dynamical control in a prethermalized molecular ultracold plasma: Local dissipation drives global relaxation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prethermalization occurs as an important phase in the dynamics of many-body systems when strong coupling drives a quasi-equilibrium in a subspace separated from the thermodynamic equilibrium by the restriction of a gap in energy or other conserved quantity. Here, we report the signature of an enduring prethermal regime of arrested relaxation in the molecular ultracold plasma that forms following the avalanche of a state-selected Rydberg gas of nitric oxide. Electron collisions mix orbital angular momentum, scattering Rydberg molecules to states of very high-$\ell$. Spontaneous predissociation purifies this non-penetrating character, creating an extraordinary gap between the plasma states of $n \approx \ell$, with measured $n&gt;200$ and penetrating states of $\ell = 0, ~1$ and 2. Evolution to a statistically equilibrated state of N and O atoms cannot occur without Rydberg electron penetration, and this gap blocks relaxation for a millisecond or more. Evolving through the critical phase, electrons that balance the NO$^+$ charge behave as though localized in the prethermal phase and play an ineffective role in bridging this gap. However, the application of a weak radiofrequency (RF) field promotes a dramatic degree of relaxation owing to electron collisions. On an entirely different scale, exciting a quantum-state transition in an exceedingly small fraction of the molecules in the prethermalized ensemble acts with even greater effect to drive the entire system toward equilibrium. We ascribe this to dissipative character added to a small fraction of the states in the prethermally localized ensemble. Using the Lindblad master equation, we illustrate qualitatively similar dynamics for a toy model of an open quantum system that consists of a localized set of spins on which dissipation acts locally at a single site.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases are one of the simplest, yet nontrivial, gapped systems that go beyond the Landau paradigm. In this work, we study an extension of the notion of SPT for gapless systems, namely, gapless symmetry protected topological states. We construct several simple gapless-SPT models using the decorated defect construction, which allow analytical understanding of non-trivial topological features including the symmetry charge under twisted boundary conditions, and boundary (quasi)-degeneracy under open boundary conditions. We also comment on the stability of the gapless-SPT models under symmetric perturbations, and apply small-scale exact diagonalization when direct analytic understanding is not available.</description>

Abstract: Quantum spin liquids subject to a periodic drive can display fascinating non-equilibrium heating behavior because of their emergent fractionalized quasi-particles. Here, we investigate a driven Kitaev honeycomb model and examine the dynamics of emergent Majorana matter and $Z_2$ flux excitations. We uncover a distinct two-step heating profile $\textrm{--}$ dubbed fractionalized prethermalization $\textrm{--}$ and a quasi-stationary state with vastly different temperatures for the matter and the flux sectors. We argue that this peculiar prethermalization behavior is a consequence of fractionalization. Furthermore, we discuss an experimentally feasible protocol for preparing a zero-flux initial state of the Kiteav honeycomb model with a low energy density, which can be used to observe fractionalized prethermalization in quantum information processing platforms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite growing interest in beyond-group symmetries in quantum condensed matter systems, there are relatively few microscopic lattice models explicitly realizing these symmetries, and many phenomena have yet to be studied at the microscopic level. We introduce a one-dimensional stabilizer Hamiltonian composed of group-based Pauli operators whose ground state is a $G\times \text{Rep}(G)$-symmetric state: the $G \textit{ cluster state}$ introduced in Brell, New Journal of Physics 17, 023029 (2015) [at http://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/17/2/023029]. We show that this state lies in a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase protected by $G\times \text{Rep}(G)$ symmetry, distinct from the symmetric product state by a duality argument. We identify several signatures of SPT order, namely protected edge modes, string order parameters, and topological response. We discuss how $G$ cluster states may be used as a universal resource for measurement-based quantum computation, explicitly working out the case where $G$ is a semidirect product of abelian groups.</description>

      <title>Stable non-Fermi liquid fixed point at the onset of incommensurate $2k_F$ charge density wave order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of a non-Fermi liquid fixed point in a two-dimensional metal, at the onset of a quantum phase transition from a Fermi liquid state to an incommensurate charge density wave (CDW) ordered phase. The momentum of the CDW boson is centred at the wavevector $ \boldsymbol{ \mathcal Q} $, which connects a single pair of antipodal points on the Fermi surface with antiparallel tangent vectors. We employ the dimensional regularization technique in which the co-dimension of the Fermi surface is extended to a generic value, while keeping the dimension of the Fermi surface itself fixed at one. Although the system is strongly coupled at dimension $d=2$, the interactions become marginal at the upper critical dimension $d=d_c$, whose value is found to be $ 5/2$. Using a controlled perturbative expansion in the parameter $\epsilon = d_c - d $, we compute the critical exponents of the stable infrared fixed point characterizing the quantum critical point. The scalings of the original theory are determined by setting $\epsilon =1/2$, where the fermion self-energy is seen to scale with the frequency with a fractional power law of $2/3$, which is the telltale signature of a typical non-Fermi liquid phase.</description>

      <title>Ubiquitous Flat Bands in a Cr-based Kagome Superconductor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the quest for novel quantum states driven by topology and correlation, kagome lattice materials have garnered significant interest due to their distinctive electronic band structures, featuring flat bands (FBs) arising from the quantum destructive interference of the electronic wave function. The tuning of the FBs to the chemical potential would lead to the possibility of liberating electronic instabilities that lead to emergent electronic orders. Despite extensive studies, direct evidence of FBs tuned to the chemical potential and their participation in emergent electronic orders have been lacking in bulk quantum materials. Here using a combination of Angle-Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) and Density Functional Theory (DFT), we reveal that the low-energy electronic structure of the recently discovered Cr-based kagome metal superconductor CsCr3Sb5 is dominated by a pervasive FB in close proximity to, and below the Fermi level. A comparative analysis with orbital-projected DFT and polarization dependence measurement uncovers that an orbital-selective renormalization mechanism is needed to reconcile the discrepancy with the DFT calculations, which predict the FB to appear 200 meV above the Fermi level. Furthermore, we observe the FB to shift away from the Fermi level by 20 meV in the low-temperature density wave-ordered phase, highlighting the role of the FB in the emergent electronic order. Our results reveal CsCr3Sb5 to stand out as a promising platform for further exploration into the effects of FBs near the Fermi level on kagome lattices, and their role in emergent orders in bulk quantum materials.</description>

      <title>When Superconductivity Crosses Over: From BCS to BEC</title>

Abstract: New developments in superconductivity, particularly through unexpected and often astonishing forms of superconducting materials, continue to excite the community and stimulate theory. It is now becoming clear that there are two distinct platforms for superconductivity: natural and synthetic materials. The study of these artificial materials has greatly expanded in the last decade or so, with the discoveries of new forms of superfluidity in artificial heterostructures and the exploitation of proximitization. Natural superconductors continue to surprise through the Fe-based pnictides and chalcogenides, and nickelates as well as others. It is the goal of this review to present this two-pronged investigation into superconductors, with a focus on those that we have come to understand belong somewhere between the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) regimes. We characterize in detail the nature of this "crossover" superconductivity, which is to be distinguished from crossover superfluidity in atomic Fermi gases. In the process, we address the multiple ways of promoting a system out of the BCS and into the BCS-BEC crossover regime within the context of concrete experimental realizations. These involve natural materials, such as organic conductors, as well as artificial, mostly two-dimensional materials, such as magic-angle twisted bilayer and trilayer graphene, or gate-controlled devices, as well as one-layer and interfacial superconducting films. This work should be viewed as a celebration of BCS theory by showing that even though this theory was initially implemented with the special case of weak correlations in mind, it can in a very natural way be extended to treat the case of these more exotic strongly correlated superconductors.</description>

      <title>Nematicity and Orbital Depairing in Superconducting Bernal Bilayer Graphene with Strong Spin Orbit Coupling</title>

Abstract: Superconductivity (SC) is a ubiquitous feature of graphite allotropes, having been observed in Bernal bilayers[1], rhombohedral trilayers[2], and a wide variety of angle-misaligned multilayers[3-6]. Despite significant differences in the electronic structure across these systems, supporting the graphite layer on a WSe$_2$ substrate has been consistently observed to expand the range of SC in carrier density and temperature[7-10]. Here, we report the observation of two distinct superconducting states (denoted SC$_1$ and SC$_2$) in Bernal bilayer graphene with strong proximity-induced Ising spin-orbit coupling. Quantum oscillations show that while the normal state of SC$_1$ is consistent with the single-particle band structure, SC$_2$ emerges from a nematic normal state with broken rotational symmetry. Both superconductors are robust to in-plane magnetic fields, violating the paramagnetic limit; however, neither reach fields expected for spin-valley locked Ising superconductors. We use our knowledge of the Fermi surface geometry of SC$_1$ to argue that superconductivity is limited by orbital depairing arising from the imperfect layer polarization of the electron wavefunctions. Finally, a comparative analysis of transport and thermodynamic compressibility measurements in SC$_2$ shows that the proximity to the observed isospin phase boundaries, observed in other rhombohedral graphene allotropes, is likely coincidental, constraining theories of unconventional superconducting pairing mechanisms in theses systems.</description>

      <title>Interacting Local Topological Markers: A one-particle density matrix approach for characterizing the topology of interacting and disordered states</title>

Abstract: While topology is a property of a quantum state itself, most existing methods for characterizing the topology of interacting phases of matter require direct knowledge of the underlying Hamiltonian. We offer an alternative by utilizing the one-particle density matrix formalism to extend the concept of the Chern, chiral, and Chern-Simons markers to include interactions. The one-particle density matrix of a free-fermion state is a projector onto the occupied bands, defining a Brillouin zone bundle of the given topological class. This is no longer the case in the interacting limit, but as long as the one-particle density matrix is gapped, its spectrum can be adiabatically flattened, connecting it to a topologically equivalent projector. The corresponding topological markers thus characterize the topology of the interacting phase. Importantly, the one-particle density matrix is defined in terms of a given state alone, making the local markers numerically favorable, and providing a valuable tool for characterizing topology of interacting systems when only the state itself is available. To demonstrate the practical use of the markers we use the chiral marker to identify the topology of midspectrum eigenstates of the Ising-Majorana chain across the transition between the ergodic and many-body localized phases. We also apply the chiral marker to random states with a known topology, and compare it with the entanglement spectrum degeneracy.</description>

Abstract: Modern hybrid superconductor-semiconductor Josephson junction arrays are a promising platform for analog quantum simulations. Their controllable and non-sinusoidal energy/phase relation opens the path to implement nontrivial interactions and study the emergence of exotic quantum phase transitions. Here, we propose the analysis of an array of hybrid Josephson junctions defining a 2-leg ladder geometry for the quantum simulation of the tricritical Ising phase transition. This transition provides the paradigmatic example of minimal conformal models beyond Ising criticality and its excitations are intimately related with Fibonacci non-Abelian anyons and topological order in two dimensions. We study this superconducting system and its thermodynamic phases based on bosonization and matrix-product-states techniques. Its effective continuous description in terms of a three-frequency sine-Gordon quantum field theory suggests the presence of the targeted tricritical point and the numerical simulations confirm this picture. Our results indicate which experimental observables can be adopted in realistic devices to probe the physics and the phase transitions of the model. Additionally, our proposal provides a useful one-dimensional building block to design exotic topological order in two-dimensional scalable Josephson junction arrays.</description>

      <title>Controlled Interlayer Exciton Ionization in an Electrostatic Trap in Atomically Thin Heterostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12941v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Atomically thin semiconductor heterostructures provide a two-dimensional (2D) device platform for creating high densities of cold, controllable excitons. Interlayer excitons (IEs), bound electrons and holes localized to separate 2D quantum well layers, have permanent out-of-plane dipole moments and long lifetimes, allowing their spatial distribution to be tuned on demand. Here, we employ electrostatic gates to trap IEs and control their density. By electrically modulating the IE Stark shift, electron-hole pair concentrations above $2\times10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$ can be achieved. At this high IE density, we observe an exponentially increasing linewidth broadening indicative of an IE ionization transition, independent of the trap depth. This runaway threshold remains constant at low temperatures, but increases above 20 K, consistent with the quantum dissociation of a degenerate IE gas. Our demonstration of the IE ionization in a tunable electrostatic trap represents an important step towards the realization of dipolar exciton condensates in solid-state optoelectronic devices.</description>

Abstract: The accessibility of the Hawking-Page transition in AdS$_5$ through a 1d Heisenberg spin chain is demonstrated. We use the random matrix formulation of the Loschmidt echo for a set of spin chains, and randomize the ferromagnetic spin interaction. It is shown that the thermal Loschmidt echo, when averaged, detects the predicted increase in entropy across the Hawking-Page transition. This suggests that a 1d spin chain exhibits characteristics of black hole physics in 4+1 dimensions. We show that this approach is equally applicable to free fermion systems with a general dispersion relation.</description>

Abstract: Local measurements cannot create entanglement, but they can convert short-range entanglement to long-range entanglement, as in quantum teleportation. This phenomenon of measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) has been widely discussed in recent work on measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions and related phenomena. Here, we situate MIE in a broader context of the growth of long-range conditional mutual information (CMI) under decoherence. We upper-bound the rate at which decoherence can generate long-range CMI, and derive a characterization of states that saturate this bound. We point out that the structure of states saturating the CMI upper bound can be very different under different decoherent dynamics and provide explicit examples. We additionally explore the dynamics of CMI in random quantum circuits subject to random local decoherence, as a function of circuit depth. We argue that the universality class of the finite-depth teleportation transition, as well as its lower critical dimension, are different for erasures than for measurements.</description>

Abstract: Typical BCS superconductors are microscopically homogeneous in real space governed by the coherent Cooper pairs with high phase stiffness of superfluid density, which is characterized by a coherence length. However, a periodic oscillation of superconducting order parameter may develop driven by breaking the time-reversal or translational invariance. To date, such modulated orders were specific to each material systems, with a periodicity much larger than the lattice constant. Here we report the direct observation of a uniform lattice-scale pair density wave (PDW) in single-layer FeSe/SrTiO3 films, enforced by peculiar interfacial structure of crystal symmetries breaking. Our spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy unravels a spatial modulation of Cooper-pairing gap within a single unit-cell, depending on inequivalent atomic sites. Prominent periodic variation of superfluid density is visualized via Josephson current by a superconducting tip, indicating a real-space oscillation of phase stiffness. Such a lattice-scale superconducting modulation, which coexists with a larger length scale of PDW order, indicates the lattice-scale variation of both pairing strength and phase stiffness. Our findings provide new insights into the intertwined density-wave orders of quasiparticle character in correlated electronic systems, and provoke future studies on the unconventional pairing interaction and phase stiffness in the two-dimensional limit.</description>
