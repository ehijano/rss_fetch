      <title>Antichain cutsets in real-ranked lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14826v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that in a rank supersolvable lattice that is graded by a bounded real interval, any antichain cutset is a level set for some appropriately constructed grading. As a consequence, given an antichain cutset in any of the measurable Boolean lattice, a continuous partition lattice, or a continuous projective geometry, we may find a grading in which the cutset is a level set.</description>

      <title>Chordal signed graphs and signed bigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chordal graphs and chordal bigraphs enjoy beautiful characterizations, in terms of forbidden subgraphs, vertex/edge orderings, vertex/edge separating sets, and tree-like representations. In this paper, we introduce chordal signed graphs and chordal signed bigraphs. Interestingly, chordal signed graphs are equivalent to strict chordal digraphs studied by Hell and Hern\'andez-Cruz. A forbidden subdigraph characterization of strict chordal digraphs can be translated to a forbidden subgraph characterization of chordal signed graphs. We give a forbidden subgraph characterization of chordal signed bigraphs. The forbidden subgraphs for chordal signed bigraphs are analogous to those for chordal signed graphs but the proofs are much more complicated and intriguing.</description>

      <title>A Tight Lower bound on Trees in Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mubayi and Verstraete conjectured that if $T$ is a tree on $t + 1$ vertices, then any $n$-vertex graph $G$ with average degree $d$ contains at least \[ n d(d - 1) \cdots (d - t + 1) \] labeled copies of $T$ as long as $d$ is sufficiently large compared to $t$. We prove this is true and show that when the diameter of $T$ is at least $3$, equality holds iff $G$ is the disjoint union of cliques of size $d + 1$. When the diameter is $2$, equality holds iff $G$ is $d$-regular.</description>

      <title>Excluding a line from positroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14939v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For all positive integers $\ell$ and $r$, we determine the maximum number of elements of a simple rank-$r$ positroid without the rank-$2$ uniform matroid $U_{2,\ell+2}$ as a minor, and characterize the matroids with the maximum number of elements. This result continues a long line of research into upper bounds on the number of elements of matroids from various classes that forbid $U_{2,\ell+2}$ as a minor. This is the first paper to study positroids in this context, and it suggests methods to study similar problems for other classes of matroids, such as gammoids or base-orderable matroids.</description>

      <title>A Carousel Property for Compact Convex Sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that if $A_0$ and $A_1$ are compact convex sets contained in a convex $n$-gon with vertices $g_1, \dots, g_n$, and $n$ is strictly greater than the number of common supporting lines of $A_0$ and $A_1$, then there exist $i \in \{0,1\}$ and $j \in \{1,\dots, n\}$ such that $A_i$ is in the convex hull of $A_{1-i}$ and $(\{g_1, \dots, g_n\} \setminus \{g_j\})$. This recovers and generalizes previous results of Adaricheva--Bolat and Cz{\'e}dli. We also show that this bound is sharp for even $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the probabilistic existence of point configurations satisfying the $(0, m, d)$-net property in base $b$ within a randomly generated point set in the $d$-dimensional unit cube. We first derive an upper bound on the number of geometric patterns for $(0, m, d)$-nets in base $b$. By applying the concentration inequalities together with this bound, we give lower and upper estimates for the probability that a set of $N$ random points contains a $(0, m, d)$-net as a subset. This result leads to necessary and sufficient scaling conditions on $N$ and $m$ such that this probability converges to $1$.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic combinatorics at exponentially small scales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In many applications of the probabilistic method, one looks to study phenomena that occur ``with high probability''. More recently however, in an attempt to understand some of the most fundamental problems in combinatorics, researchers have been diving deeper into these probability spaces and understanding phenomena that occur at much smaller probability scales. Here I will survey a few of these ideas from the perspective of my own work in the area.</description>

      <title>Abelian structure in approximate groups and Alon's conjecture on Ramsey Cayley graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A result of Pyber states that every finite group $G$ contains an abelian subgroup whose order is quasi-polynomially large in $\lvert G\rvert$. We prove a similar result for $K$-approximate subgroups of solvable groups under only modest restrictions on $K$. We show that, if $A$ is a finite $K$-approximate group contained in some solvable group, then some abelian group intersects $A^4$ in at least $\exp(\Omega(\log^{1/6}\lvert A\rvert/\log 2K))$ elements. We also prove a similar result for approximate subgroups of finite groups with no large alternating subquotients. Along the way, we obtain polynomial (instead of quasi-polynomial) bounds for the same statement of approximate subgroups of linear groups.
  We give two applications. Firstly, we consider the conjecture of Alon that every finite group $G$ admits a Cayley graph with clique number and independence number $O(\log\lvert G\rvert)$. Conlon, Fox, Pham, and Yepremyan have recently proven that, for almost all positive integers $N$, every abelian group of order $N$ satisfies Alon's conjecture. Extending their result, we verify Alon's conjecture for all (not necessarily abelian) groups of almost all orders. Secondly, we prove a "local" version of Roth's theorem in (many) non-abelian settings with quasi-polynomial bounds, using the recent breakthroughs of Kelley and Meka on Roth's theorem and of Jaber, Liu, Lovett, Ostuni, and Sawhney on the corners problem.</description>

      <title>Duality Relations of Graph Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The duality theorem of Lass relates the matching polynomials of a simple graph $G$ with the matching polynomials of its complement $\bar G$. In particular, this relation gives rise to Godsil's result, which offers a nice interpretation of the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral associated with the Hermite orthogonality measure. In this work, we introduce the concept of path-cover polynomials. Similar to matching polynomials, we show that path-cover polynomials also satisfy duality relations and give combinatorial interpretations of the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral and the inner product in the space of associated Laguerre polynomials. Similar duality relations hold for clique-cover polynomials and chromatic polynomials. As applications, we find an efficient algorithm that computes graph polynomials for cographs. We also give explicit formulas to compute the number of Hamiltonian paths and cycles in complete multipartite graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MacMahon introduced partition analysis in his book ``Combinatory Analysis'' as a computational technique for solving problems related to systems of linear Diophantine equations and inequalities. This paper aims to develop a fundamental computational method for MacMahon's partition analysis. As applications, we present simplified computations for ``Han's formula'', the ``$k$-gon partitions problem'', and the ``two-dimensional problem''. Moreover, we apply our method to solve a challenging problem.</description>

      <title>A complete dichotomy theorem on the sparse $t$-Uniform Hypergraphicality Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a complete dichotomy theorem for the parameterized sparse $t$-uniform hypergraphical degree sequence problem, $\mathrm{sparse}\text{-}t\text{-}\mathrm{uni}\text{-}\mathrm{HDS}_{\alpha',\alpha}$. For any fixed $t \ge 3$, given parameters $0 \le \alpha' \le \alpha &lt; t-1$, the input consists of degree sequences $D$ of length $n$ with degrees between $n^{\alpha'}$ and $6n^{\alpha}$. We show that the problem is NP-complete whenever $\alpha' \le \frac{t(\alpha - 1) + 1}{t - 1}$, and solvable in linear time when $\alpha' &gt; \frac{t(\alpha - 1) + 1}{t - 1}$. This establishes a sharp computational phase transition separating intractable and tractable regimes, fully characterizing the complexity of sparse $t$-uniform hypergraphicality across all degree exponents. The result extends the earlier NP-completeness of dense hypergraphicality to a unified framework covering both sparse and dense regimes, revealing that even extremely sparse instances (with maximum degree $o(n)$ but $\Omega(n^{\frac{t-1}{t}})$) remain NP-complete. On the other hand, the $t$-uniform hypergraphicality solvable in linear time when the maximum degree is $o(n^{\frac{t-1}{t}})$. This dichotomy provides a comprehensive classification of the complexity landscape for hypergraphical degree sequences.</description>

      <title>Matchings avoiding ordered patterns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A {\it vertex-ordered} graph is a graph equipped with a linear ordering of its vertices.
  A pair of independent edges in an ordered graph can exhibit one of the following three patterns: separated, nested or crossing.
  We say a pair of independent edges is non-separated if it is either crossing or nested.
  Non-nested and non-crossing pairs are defined analogously.
  We are interested in the following Tur\'an-type problems: for each of the aforementioned six patterns, determine the maximum number of edges of an $n$-vertex ordered graph that does not contain a $k$-matching such that every pair of edges exhibit the fixed pattern.
  Exact answers have already been obtained for four of the six cases.
  The main objective of this paper is to investigate the two remaining open cases, namely non-separated and non-nested matchings.
  We determine the exact maximum number of edges of an $n$-vertex ordered graph that does not contain a non-separated $k$-matching, which has the form $\frac{3}{2}(k-1)n+\Theta(k^2)$.
  For the non-nested case, we show the maximum number of edges lies between $(k-1)n$ and $(k-1)n+\binom{k-1}{2}$.
  We also determine the exact maximum number of edges of an $n$-vertex ordered graph that does not contain an alternating path of given length.
  We discuss some related problems and raise several
  conjectures.
  Furthermore, our results and conjectures yield consequences to certain Ramsey-type problems for non-nested matchings and alternating paths.</description>

      <title>Completely Independent Spanning Trees in Split Graphs: Structural Properties and Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study completely independent spanning trees (CIST), \textit{i.e.}, trees that are both edge-disjoint and internally vertex-disjoint, in split graphs. We establish a correspondence between the existence of CIST in a split graph and some types of hypergraph colorings (panchromatic and bipanchromatic colorings) of its associated hypergraph, allowing us to obtain lower and upper bounds on the number of CIST. Using these relations, we prove that the problem of the existence of two CIST in a split graph is NP-complete. Finally, we formulate a conjecture on the bipanchromatic number of a hypergraph related to the results obtained for the number of CIST.</description>

      <title>The dimer model and dynamical incidence geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a geometric counterpart of the dimer model on bipartite graphs. A state of our model consists of a choice of a point for each white vertex and hyperplane for each black vertex. This data is subject to certain conditions determined by the graph; the resulting configurations are called coherent double circuit configurations. We show that our model behaves consistently under standard local moves of the dimer model. On the geometric side, this gives rise to a new class of theorems in linear incidence geometry - dynamical incidence theorems. Examples include results on pentagram maps, pentagram spirals, and Q-nets. We also examine the problem of parametrizing coherent double circuit configurations. In particular, we study whether, once the white-vertex part of the data is fixed, one can recover the black-vertex data from a point on the spectral curve.</description>

      <title>Ramsey problems for graphs in Euclidean spaces and Cartesian powers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15516</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15516v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a graph $H$, let $\chi_H(\mathbb{R}^n)$ be the smallest positive integer $r$ such that there exists an $r$-coloring of $\mathbb{R}^n$ with no monochromatic unit-copy of $H$, that is a set of $|V(H)|$ vertices of the same color such that any two vertices corresponding to an edge of $H$ are at distance one.
  This Ramsey-type function extends the famous Hadwiger--Nelson problem on the chromatic number $\chi(\mathbb{R}^n)=\chi_{K_2}(\mathbb{R}^n)$ of the space from a complete graph $K_2$ on two vertices to an arbitrary graph $H$. It also extends the classical Euclidean Ramsey problem for congruent monochromatic subsets to the family of those defined by a specific subset of unit distances.
  Among others, we show that $\chi_H(\mathbb{R}^n)=\chi(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for any even cycle $H$ of length $8$ or at least $12$ as well as for any forest and that $\chi_H(\mathbb{R}^n)=\lceil\chi(\mathbb{R}^n)/2\rceil$ for any sufficiently long odd cycle. Our main tools and results, which are of independent interest, establish that Cartesian powers enjoy Ramsey-type properties for graphs with favorable Tur\'an-type characteristics, such as zero hypercube Tur\'an density.
  In addition, we prove induced variants of these results, find bounds on $\chi_H(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for growing dimensions $n$, and prove a canonical-type result. We conclude with many open problems. One of these is to determine $\chi_{C_4}(\mathbb{R}^2)$, for a cycle $C_4$ on four vertices.</description>

      <title>Universal families of rayless graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the existence and cardinality of universal families for classes of rayless graphs. It is known, by a result of Diestel, Halin, and Vogler, that the class of countable rayless graphs does not admit a countable universal family, leaving open the precise complexity of this class. We prove that for every infinite cardinal $\kappa$, the class of rayless graphs of cardinality at most $\kappa$ admits a strongly universal family of size exactly $\kappa^+$, and that no smaller family can exist. This settles the problem for the countable case and extends uniformly to higher cardinalities.
  We further investigate subclasses defined by forbidding subgraphs. When finitely many finite graphs are forbidden, the strong complexity remains $\kappa^+$, except in degenerate cases where it collapses to countable. In contrast, the class of countable rayless graphs when forbidding certain infinite graphs has a complexity that reaches its maximum possible value, the continuum.
  Finally, we establish that natural subclasses -- including rayless trees, bipartite rayless graphs, graphs without even cycles, and graphs without infinite trails -- retain the minimal strong complexity $\kappa^+$. These results provide a comprehensive characterization of universality in rayless graphs and highlight both its stability under restrictions and its sensitivity to specific obstructions.</description>

      <title>Graph-theoretical search for integrable multistate Landau-Zener models</title>

Abstract: The search for exactly solvable models is an evergreen topic in theoretical physics. In the context of multistate Landau-Zener models -- $N$-state quantum systems with linearly time-dependent Hamiltonians -- the theory of integrability provides a framework for identifying new solvable cases. In particular, it was proved that the integrability of a specific class known as the multitime Landau-Zener (MTLZ) models guarantees their exact solvability. A key finding was that an $N$-state MTLZ model can be represented by data defined on an $N$-vertex graph. While known host graphs for MTLZ models include hypercubes, fans, and their Cartesian products, no other families have been discovered, leading to the conjecture that these are the only possibilities. In this work, we conduct a systematic graph-theoretical search for integrable models within the MTLZ class. By first identifying minimal structures that a graph must contain to host an MTLZ model, we formulate an efficient algorithm to systematically search for candidate graphs for MTLZ models. Implementing this algorithm using computational software, we enumerate all candidate graphs with up to $N = 13$ vertices and perform an in-depth analysis of those with $N \le 11$. Our results corroborate the aforementioned conjecture for graphs up to $11$ vertices. For even larger graphs, we propose a specific family, termed descendants of ``$(0,2)$-graphs'', as promising candidates that may violate the conjecture above. Our work can serve as a guideline to identify new exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models in the future.</description>

      <title>Uniform spectral gaps, non-abelian Littlewood-Offord and anti-concentration for random walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that random walks on semisimple algebraic groups do not concentrate on proper algebraic subvarieties with uniform exponential rate of anti-concentration. This is achieved by proving a uniform spectral gap for quasi-regular representations of countable linear groups. The method makes key use of Diophantine heights and the Height Gap theorem. We also deduce a non-abelian version of the Littlewood--Offord inequalities and prove logarithmic bounds for escape from subvarieties. In a sequel to this paper, we will show how to transform this uniform gap into uniform expansion for Cayley graphs of finite simple groups of bounded rank $G(p)$ over almost all primes $p$.</description>

      <title>Regions surrounded by cylinders of circles of fixed radii and exposition of their shapes by natural graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate regions formed by cylinders of circles of fixed radii. We investigate graphs obtained by collapsing each level set of the functions represented by the natural projections of them to the $1$-dimensional line. Some specific trees obtained in simple ways from so-called balanced trees are shown to be realized as such graphs. Related studies on regions in the Euclidean plane surrounded by real algebraic curves are presented by several researchers. One of pioneering studies is presented by Bodin, Popescu-Pampu and Sorea in 2022--3 as an elementary and surprisingly new study. The author has been interested in related studies and also in constructing natural and explicit real algebraic maps onto such regions, generalizing the canonical projections of the unit spheres. Such studies in real algebraic geometry, different from theory of existence in the last century, mainly studied by Nash and Tognoli, are remarked.</description>

      <title>Arithmetic sensitivity of cumulant growth in lacunary sums: transcendental versus algebraic ratio limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15501v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic behavior of cumulants of lacunary trigonometric sums $S_n(\omega) := \sum_{k=1}^n \cos (2 \pi a_k \omega)$, $\omega\in[0,1]$, and show that cumulant growth is highly sensitive to the arithmetic structure of the sequence $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ of positive integers. In particular, if $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_{k+1}/a_k = \eta &gt; 1$ for some transcendental number $\eta$, we prove that for every $m\in \mathbb N$ the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ is asymptotically equivalent to the $m$-th cumulant of the ``independent model'' $\widetilde{S}_n := \sum_{k=1}^n \cos (2 \pi a_k U_k)$, where $U_1, U_2, \dots$ are independent random variables having uniform distribution on $[0,1]$. In particular, the order of growth of the cumulants as $n \to \infty$ is linear in this case. We also show that the transcendence condition for $\lim_{k \to \infty} a_{k+1}/a_k$ is in general necessary: when the ratio limit $\eta$ is algebraic, the cumulants of $S_n$ may have a different asymptotic order from those of $\widetilde{S}_n$. For instance, for $a_k = 2^k+1$ (with $\eta = 2$), the sixth cumulant of $S_n$ grows quadratically in $n$. In contrast, for $a_k = 2^k$ (again $\eta = 2$) or when $(a_k)_{k \geq 1}$ is the Fibonacci sequence (with $\eta = (1+\sqrt 5)/2$), the $m$-th cumulant of $S_n$ grows linearly as $n\to\infty$, but with a growth rate that differs from the one of the independent model $\widetilde{S}_n$. Overall, our results show that the asymptotic behavior of the cumulants of lacunary trigonometric sums depends on arithmetic effects in a very delicate way. This is particularly remarkable since many other probabilistic limit theorems, such as the Central Limit Theorem, hold for lacunary trigonometric sums in a universal way without any such sensitivity towards arithmetic effects.</description>

Abstract: We show that there exists only one duality pair for ordered graphs. We will also define a corresponding definition of $\chi^&lt;$-boundedness for ordered graphs and show that all ordered graphs are $\chi^&lt;$-bounded and prove an analogy of Gy\'arf\'as-Sumner conjecture for ordered graphs. We also prove an analogy of Sparse Incomparability Lemma for ordered graphs. We then use this result to show classes of ordered graphs that form a dense order under ordered homomorphisms. We also show that compared to graphs, ordered graphs have more gaps, defined by consecutive monotone matchings and by even more generic pairs of ordered graphs differing by one isolated edge.</description>

Abstract: The permutation matrices form a subgroup of $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$ that is isomorphic to the symmetric group $S_n$. Let $r_{\mu\lambda}$ denote the multiplicity of the irreducible representation $V_\mu$ of $S_n$, corresponding to a partition $\mu$ of $n$, in the restriction of an irreducible polynomial representation $W_\lambda(\mathbb{C})$ of $\text{GL}_n(\mathbb{C})$, corresponding to a partition $\lambda$ with at most $n$ parts. Finding a combinatorial interpretation for $r_{\mu\lambda}$ remains an open problem in algebraic combinatorics, called the \emph{restriction problem}.
  We derive a new nonrecursive expression for a character polynomial called the \emph{Specht polynomial} and use it to find a combinatorial interpretation of $r_{\mu\lambda}$ when $\lambda$ is a hook-shaped partition.</description>

      <title>Semi-Degree Condition for Arbitrary $H$-Linked Oriented Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $ H $ be a multi-digraph on $ h $ vertices with $ q $ arcs. An \textbf{$H$-subdivision} in a digraph $D$ is a subdigraph obtained by replacing every arc $uv$ of $H$ with a path from $u$ to $v$ in $D$ such that these paths are pairwise internally vertex-disjoint. A digraph $ D $ is \textbf{arbitrary $ H $-linked} if, for every injection $ f: V(H) \to V(D) $, there exists an $ H $-subdivision in $ D $ such that each vertex $ v \in V(H) $ is mapped to $ f(v) \in V(D) $, and the length of every subdivision path can be arbitrarily specified as {an integer \(l \geq 4\)}. An oriented graph is a digraph without 2-cycles. Keevash, K\"{u}hn, and Osthus proved that every sufficiently large oriented graph $ D $ of order $ n $ with $\delta^0(D) \geq \frac{3n-4}{8}$ contains a Hamilton cycle (i.e., a $\overset{\leftrightarrow}{K_2}$-subdivision). Subsequently, Kelly, K\"{u}hn, and Osthus showed that such oriented graphs {are also arbitrary $ H $-linked, where $H$ is a loop}. Motivated by these results, we establish a minimum semi-degree condition for arbitrary $ H $-linked oriented graphs: there exists $ n_0 = n_0(h,q) $ such that every oriented graph $ D $ of order $ n \geq n_0 $ with $\delta^0(D) \geq \frac{3n + 3h + 3q - 5}{8}$ is arbitrary $ H $-linked; specifically, if $H$ is a loop, this holds under the weaker condition $\delta^0(D) \geq \frac{3n - 4}{8}$. The result provides an oriented graph analogue of Wang's conjecture on cycle-factors in graphs [J. Korean Math. Soc. 51 (2014) 919--940] and determines the tight semi-degree bounds for both strongly Hamiltonian-connected and arbitrary $q$-linked oriented graphs.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a Borel graph all of whose finite subgraphs embed into the $d$-dimensional grid with diagonals. We show that then $G$ itself admits a Borel embedding into the Schreier graph of a free Borel action of $\mathbb Z^{O(d)}$. This strengthens an earlier result of the authors, in which $O(d)$ is replaced by $O(\rho \log \rho)$, where $\rho$ is the polynomial growth rate of $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.19908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A theorem of Shearer states that every $n$-vertex triangle-free graph of maximum degree $d \geq 2$ contains an independent set of size at least $(d\log d - d + 1)/(d - 1)^2 \cdot n$. Ajtai, Koml\'{o}s, Pintz, Spencer and Szemer\'{e}di proved that every $(r + 1)$-uniform $n$-vertex ``uncrowded'' hypergraph of maximum degree $d \geq 1$ has an independent set of size at least $c_r(\log d)^{1/r}/d^{1/r} \cdot n$ for some $c_r &gt; 0$ depending only on $r$. Shearer asked whether his method for triangle-free graphs could be extended to uniform hypergraphs. In this paper, we answer this in the affirmative, thereby giving a short proof of the theorem of Ajtai, Koml\'{o}s, Pintz, Spencer and Szemer\'{e}di for a wider class of ``locally sparse'' hypergraphs.</description>

      <title>Degree Realization by Bipartite Multigraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15515v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The problem of realizing a given degree sequence by a multigraph can be thought of as a relaxation of the classical degree realization problem (where the realizing graph is simple). This paper concerns the case where the realizing multigraph is required to be bipartite.
  The problem of characterizing sequences that can be realized by a bipartite graph has two variants. In the simpler one, termed BDR$^P$, the partition of the sequence into two sides is given as part of the input. A complete characterization for realizability in this variant was given by Gale and Ryser over sixty years ago. However, the variant where the partition is not given, termed BDR, is still open.
  For bipartite multigraph realizations, there are also two variants. For BDR$^P$, where the partition is given as part of the input, a characterization was known for determining whether there is a multigraph realization whose underlying graph is bipartite, such that the maximum number of copies of an edge is at most $r$. We present a characterization for determining if there is a bipartite multigraph realization such that the total number of excess edges is at most $t$. We show that optimizing these two measures may lead to different realizations, and that optimizing by one measure may increase the other substantially. As for the variant BDR, where the partition is not given, we show that determining whether a given (single) sequence admits a bipartite multigraph realization is NP-hard. Moreover, we show that this hardness result extends to any graph family which is a sub-family of bipartite graphs and a super-family of paths. On the positive side, we provide an algorithm that computes optimal realizations for the case where the number of balanced partitions is polynomial, and present sufficient conditions for the existence of bipartite multigraph realizations that depend only on the largest degree of the sequence.</description>

      <title>A construction that preserves the configuration of a matroid, with applications to lattice path matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06109v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The configuration of a matroid $M$ is the abstract lattice of cyclic flats (flats that are unions of circuits) where we record the size and rank of each cyclic flat, but not the set. One can compute the Tutte polynomial of $M$, and stronger invariants (notably, the $\mathcal{G}$-invariant), from the configuration. Given a matroid $M$ in which certain pairs of cyclic flats are non-modular, we show how to produce a matroid that is not isomorphic to $M$ but has the same configuration as $M$. We show that this construction applies to a lattice path matroid if and only if it is not a fundamental transversal matroid, and we enumerate the connected lattice path matroids on $[n]$ that are fundamental; these results imply that, asymptotically, almost no lattice path matroids are Tutte unique. We give a sufficient condition for a matroid to be determined, up to isomorphism, by its configuration. We treat constructions that yield matroids with different configurations where each matroid is determined by its configuration and all have the same $\mathcal{G}$-invariant. We also show that for any lattice $L$ other than a chain, there are non-isomorphic transversal matroids that have the same configuration and where the lattices of cyclic flats are isomorphic to $L$.</description>

Abstract: We consider simultaneous $(s,s+t,s+2t,\dots,s+pt)$-core partitions in the large-$p$ limit, or (when $s&lt;t$), partitions in which no hook may be of length $s \pmod{t}$. We study generating functions, containment properties, and congruences when $s$ is not coprime to $t$. As a boundary case of the general study made by Cho, Huh and Sohn, we provide enumerations when $s$ is coprime to $t$, and answer positively a conjecture of Fayers on the polynomial behavior of the size of the set of simultaneous $(s,s+t,s+2t,\dots,s+pt)$-core partitions when $p$ grows arbitrarily large. Of particular interest throughout is the comparison to the behavior of simultaneous $(s,t)$-cores.</description>

Abstract: Counting lattice points and triangulating polytopes is a prominent subject in discrete geometry, yet proving Ehrhart positivity or existence of unimodular triangulations remain of utmost difficulty in general, even for ``easy'' simplices. We study these questions for classes of s-lecture hall simplices. Inspired by a question of Olsen, we present a new natural class of sequences s for which the s-lecture hall simplices are not Ehrhart positive, by explicitly estimating a negative coefficient. Meanwhile, motivated by a conjecture of Hibi, Olsen and Tsuchiya, we extend the previously known classes of sequences s for which the s-lecture hall simplex admits a flag, regular and unimodular triangulation. The triangulations we construct are explicit.</description>

      <title>A Maximum Linear Arrangement Problem on Directed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12277</link>
      <description>arXiv:1810.12277v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new arrangement problem on directed graphs, Maximum Directed Linear Arrangement (MaxDLA). This is a directed variant of a similar problem for undirected graphs, in which however one seeks maximum and not minimum; this problem known as the Minimum Linear Arrangement Problem (MinLA) has been much studied in the literature. We establish a number of theorems illustrating the behavior and complexity of MaxDLA. First, we relate MaxDLA to Maximum Directed Cut (MaxDiCut) by proving that every simple digraph $D$ on $n$ vertices satisfies $\frac{n}{2}$$maxDiCut(D) \leq MaxDLA(D) \leq (n-1)MaxDiCut(D)$. Next, we prove that MaxDiCut is NP-Hard for planar digraphs (even with the added restriction of maximum degree 15); it follows from the above bounds that MaxDLA is also NP-Hard for planar digraphs. In contrast, Hadlock (1975) and Dorfman and Orlova (1972) showed that the undirected Maximum Cut problem is solvable in polynomial time on planar graphs.
  On the positive side, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for solving MaxDLA on orientations of trees with degree bounded by a constant, which translates to a polynomial-time algorithm for solving MinLA on the complements of those trees. This pairs with results by Goldberg and Klipker (1976), Shiloach (1979) and Chung (1984) solving MinLA in polynomial time on trees. Finally, analogues of Harper's famous isoperimetric inequality for the hypercube, in the setting of MaxDLA, are shown for tournaments, orientations of graphs with degree at most two, and transitive acyclic digraphs.</description>

      <title>Monotonicity, Topology, and Convexity of Recurrence in Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04108v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider non-homogeneous random walks on the two-dimensional positive quadrant $\mathbb{N}^2$ and the one-dimensional slab $\{0,1,\dots,k\}\times\mathbb{N}$. In the 1960's the following question was asked for $\mathbb{N}^2$: is it true if such a random walk $X$ is recurrent and $Y$ is another random walk that at every point is more likely to go down and more likely to go left than $Y$, then $Y$ is also recurrent?
  We provide an example showing that the answer is negative. We also show, via a coupling argument, that if either the random walk $X$ or $Y$ is sufficiently homogeneous then the answer is in fact positive. In addition, we show using the Rayleigh monotonicity principle that the analogous question for random walks on trees is positive.
  These results show that the subset of parameter space that yields recurrent random walks possesses some geometric properties, in this case the structure of an order ideal. Motivated by this perspective, we consider the more symmetric setting of homogeneous random walks on finitely generated abelian groups, and ask when this subset possesses other geometric properties, namely various topological properties and convexity. We answer some of these questions: in particular, we show that this subset is closed, and under a symmetric support condition, show it is path-connected and additionally show it is convex if and only if its effective dimension is at most 2. We also show its complement is in some sense typically path-connected but not convex. We finally propose some related open problems.</description>

      <title>On irrationals with Lagrange value exactly 3</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.01867v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For $c&gt;0$, let $X_c$ denote the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|&lt;\frac{1}{cq^2}$ has only finitely many rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$. It is a classical fact, known since the 1950s, that $X_c$ is uncountable for $c&gt;3$ and countable for $c&lt;3$. However, the cardinality of $X_3$ does not appear to be present in the literature. We prove that $X_3$ is uncountable.
  More generally, we show that for any $n\in\mathbb{N}\cup\{\infty\}$, the set of $x\in\mathbb{R}\backslash\mathbb{Q}$ with Lagrange value exactly $3$ and such that $\left| x-\frac{p}{q} \right|&lt;\frac{1}{3q^2}$ has exactly $n$ rational solutions $\frac{p}{q}$ is also uncountable.</description>

      <title>The local homological structure of generalized splines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.07789v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generalized splines are a simultaneous generalization of GKM theory -- which studies equivariant cohomology -- and classical splines, which provide piecewise approximations of functions. Generalized splines can also be understood via schemes, with the interpolation constraints -- or so-called GKM-condition -- encoded by gluing along certain closed subschemes. This view provides a local-global principle, with the local pictures retaining the generalized spline structure. Consequently, the behavior of generalized splines over local rings controls certain global phenomena, such as projectivity and often freeness.
  We introduce an interface between the homological study of local rings and the combinatorial study of generalized splines. We identify precisely how the generalized spline structure coordinates with the existing homological local ring machinery. This is accomplished by two exact sequences that provide a regulatory structure on the local cohomology of a generalized spline module. As an application, we use this to prove that for any edge-labeled graph $G$ with principal ideal labels, and any Cohen-Macaulay ring $R$ of Krull dimension 2 at each maximal ideal, the module of splines $R_G$ is free, provided it has finite projective dimension. As a special case, this implies every generalized spline module over $k[x,y]$ with principal edge labels is free.</description>
