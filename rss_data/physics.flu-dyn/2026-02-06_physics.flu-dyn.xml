      <title>Heavy Kolmogorov-size spheres suppress the inertial cascade in homogeneous and isotropic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effect of Kolmogorov-size spherical particles on homogeneous and isotropic turbulence is investigated using particle-resolved direct numerical simulations at a Taylor-scale Reynolds number of $150$. Four monodisperse suspensions of particles with identical diameter and volume fraction $10^{-3}$ are considered, while the particle-to-fluid density ratio varies between $100$ and $1500$ and the mass fraction between $0.1$ and $0.6$. As particle inertia increases, the energy spectrum departs from the canonical Kolmogorov $\kappa^{-5/3}$ scaling and approaches a peculiar regime with $\kappa^{-1}$. In this limit, the nonlinear energy transfer is strongly suppressed and the kinetic energy balance is dominated by the fluid-solid interaction and the viscous dissipation. Consistently, the second-order structure function shows logarithmic scaling at separations larger than the particle diameter, indicating velocity decorrelation. Increasing particle inertia promotes axial strain and vortex compression in the vicinity of the particles and enhances the particle-fluid relative velocity. Particle clustering weakens as the density ratio and the Stokes number increase, with the volume and the population of the clusters decreasing when inertia is enhanced. Nevertheless, when clustering occurs, particles preferentially sample regions of high strain and low vorticity, for all the values of the density ratio and the mass fraction considered here.</description>

      <title>Covariant Helmholtz-Hodge Decomposition: Resolving Spurious Vorticity via Acoustic Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The separation of acoustic and vortical fluctuations in compressible turbulence becomes ambiguous in thermodynamically inhomogeneous media, where refraction by entropy gradients and shocks can be misclassified as solenoidal content by Euclidean post-processing. We introduce a covariant Helmholtz--Hodge decomposition (CHHD) with respect to an effective acoustic metric, which identifies the irrotational (potential) component with the exact part of the metric-dual velocity one-form. Thermal refraction and shock-induced bending are absorbed into the induced curvature, ensuring that such geometric variations are not misidentified as physical vorticity. For canonical entropy-spot refraction and normal-shock discontinuities, Euclidean Helmholtz--Hodge and momentum-potential post-processing produce significant leakage in the refracting/discontinuous region, whereas the covariant splitting remains at the numerical noise floor (typically $\lesssim 10^{-12}$) throughout the domain, demonstrating robustness even at the sonic horizon, where the Euclidean metric singularity typically causes catastrophic error amplification. This geometric framework for velocity fields resolves the ambiguity of irrotational motion in inhomogeneous media and establishes a necessary foundation for future generalizations to full thermodynamic state vectors.</description>

      <title>A term-by-term variational multiscale method with dynamic subscales for incompressible turbulent aerodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational multiscale (VMS) methods offer a robust framework for handling under-resolved flow scales without resorting to problem-specific turbulence models. Here, we propose and assess a dynamic, term-by-term VMS stabilized formulation for simulating incompressible flows from laminar to turbulent regimes. The method is embedded in an incremental pressure-correction fractional-step framework and employs a minimal set of stabilization terms, yielding a unified discretization that (i) allows equal-order velocity--pressure interpolation and (ii) provides robust control of convection-dominated dynamics in complex three-dimensional settings. Orthogonal projections are a key ingredient and ensure that the non-residual, term-by-term structure induces dissipation through dynamic subscales suitable for turbulent simulations. The methodology is validated on large-scale external-aerodynamics configurations, including the Ahmed body at Re $ = 7.68\times 10^{5}$ for multiple slant angles, using unstructured tetrahedral meshes ranging from 3 to 40 million elements. Applicability is further demonstrated on a realistic Formula~1 configuration at $U_\infty=56~\mathrm{m/s}$ (201.6~km/h), corresponding to Re $ \approx 10^{6}$. The results show that the proposed stabilized pressure-segregated formulation remains robust at scale and captures key separated-flow features and coherent wake organization. Pointwise velocity and pressure spectra provide an a posteriori consistency indicator, exhibiting finite frequency ranges compatible with inertial-subrange reference slopes in the resolved band and supporting dissipation control in under-resolved regimes within a unified stabilized finite element framework.</description>

      <title>cfdmfFTFoam: A front-tracking solver for multiphase flows on general unstructured grids in OpenFOAM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Front-Tracking Method (FTM) is a promising approach for numerical solution of multiphase flows, considering a trade-off between accuracy and computational cost. The existing open-source open-access software for FTM is scarce, due to complexity of the coding and algorithms, and is limited to structured Cartesian grids or connectivity-free front mesh hybrid FTMs. To provide a pure FTM solver on general unstructured grids, the Ftc3D FTM code has been integrated into the OpenFOAM CFD software by implementing necessary front mesh to Eulerian grid communication and front nodes advection algorithms, applicable to unstructured grids and for both serial and parallel runs. The new FTM package, called cfdmfFTFoam, has been further equipped with a variety of FTM sub-algorithms, including the front volume correction, remeshing, surface tension computation, indicator function construction, etc. Assessments and validations of the new solver are provided against several standard multiphase flow benchmarks. It is anticipated that cfdmfFTFoam would facilitate future research on and algorithm improvement in the field of FTM.</description>

      <title>On the stability of viscous Riemann ellipsoids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present study investigates the linear stability of Riemann ellipsoids in both the inviscid limit and in the presence of weak viscosity. In the inviscid regime, we derive a generalised Poincare equation governing small fluid oscillations and construct a family of polynomial solutions that extends the classical results of Cartan to flows with a uniform strain field. This formulation provides an analytic dispersion relation for three-dimensional ellipsoidal disturbances and remains computationally efficient at arbitrary harmonic degree, in contrast to the virial tensor method or to short-wavelength (WKB) approximations. The viscous effects are incorporated through a boundary-layer analysis based on Prandtls theory, leading to first-order viscous corrections to the inviscid spectrum and allowing a systematic investigation of viscosity-driven instabilities. Stability diagrams are presented over the space of admissible Riemann ellipsoids, illustrating the roles of rotation, internal strain, and diffusion, with implications for rotating shear flows in geophysical and astrophysical contexts.</description>

      <title>On particle dynamics in steady axial rotor flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of rotor velocity induction on the distribution of particles impinging on rotor blades and model the delayed response of a particle to the rotor-induced velocity field. We consider as reference a wind turbine rotor and a small-scale propeller in axial flow conditions. We first show that the classical 2D modeling of the multi-phase flow can generate a systematic error with respect to the 3D solution. We consider two limiting cases: particles in equilibrium with the rotor-induced velocity field, where the carrier phase is computed using the section's aerodynamic velocity vector, and induction-independent particles, where the geometric velocity vector is used. The 3D solution differs from the two limiting cases when particles are in partial equilibrium with the induced velocity. We introduce an induction Stokes number $\mathit{Stk}_\text{ind}$ and identify a transition regime between the two limiting solutions for $0.1 \lesssim \mathit{Stk}_\text{ind} \lesssim 10$. Then, we present a simple 1D delay model to evaluate the induced component of the particle velocity at the rotor disk as a function $\mathit{Stk}_\text{ind}$. We validate the model by showing that it allows capturing the transition regime in 2D simulations. The model only requires knowledge of the aerodynamic and geometric velocity vectors, i.e., of the axial and tangential induction factors.</description>

      <title>Reduced-Order Surrogates for Forced Flexible Mesh Coastal-Ocean Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While POD-based surrogates are widely explored for hydrodynamic applications, the use of Koopman Autoencoders for real-world coastal-ocean modelling remains relatively limited. This paper introduces a flexible Koopman autoencoder formulation that incorporates meteorological forcings and boundary conditions, and systematically compares its performance against POD-based surrogates. The Koopman autoencoder employs a learned linear temporal operator in latent space, enabling eigenvalue regularization to promote temporal stability. This strategy is evaluated alongside temporal unrolling techniques for achieving stable and accurate long-term predictions. The models are assessed on three test cases spanning distinct dynamical regimes, with prediction horizons up to one year at 30-minute temporal resolution. Across all cases, the Koopman autoencoder with temporal unrolling yields the best overall accuracy compared to the POD-based surrogates, achieving relative root-mean-squared-errors of 0.01-0.13 and $R^2$-values of 0.65-0.996. Prediction errors are largest for current velocities, and smallest for water surface elevations. Comparing to in-situ observations, the surrogate yields -0.65% to 12% change in water surface elevation prediction error when compared to prediction errors of the physics-based model. These error levels, corresponding to a few centimeters, are acceptable for many practical applications, while inference speed-ups of 300-1400x enables workflows such as ensemble forecasting and long climate simulations for coastal-ocean modelling.</description>

      <title>Active Soft-Impact Oscillator: Dynamics of a Walking Droplet in a Non-Smooth Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.05913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Walking droplets are millimetric fluid drops that propel themselves across a vibrated liquid bath through interaction with their self-generated waves. They constitute classical active wave-particle entities and exhibit a range of hydrodynamic quantum analogs. We investigate an \emph{active soft-impact oscillator} as a minimal model for a walking droplet moving within a piecewise-smooth external potential, analogous to classical mass-spring soft-impact oscillators and recently explored quantum soft-impact oscillators. Our active soft-impact oscillator model couples a non-smooth soft-impact force to the Lorenz-like dynamics arising from the wave-particle entity. Theoretical and numerical exploration of the full parameter space reveals a wide variety of nonlinear behaviors and bifurcations driven by impact and grazing events. These include grazing-induced and impact-induced transitions between periodic and chaotic motion, as well as grazing-mediated attractor switching and impact-free (invisible) attractor switching. The active soft-impact oscillator thus provides a versatile platform for probing nonlinear impact dynamics in active systems and exploring hydrodynamic quantum analogs in non-smooth potentials.</description>

      <title>A Modified Suspension-Balance Model for Deformable Particle Suspensions: Application to Blood Flows with Cell-Free Layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.18202v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a modified suspension balance model (SBM) for the flow of red blood cells (RBCs) and other deformable particle suspensions in confined geometries. Specifically, the method includes the hydrodynamic lift force generated by deformable particles interacting with walls leading to a cell-free layer. The lift force is added to the SBM to drive RBCs migrating away from the wall. Using the modified SBM (MSBM), we simulate blood flows through microvascular channels and tubes. The method is able to capture the transient development of the cell-free layer (CFL) and the corresponding hematocrit and velocity profiles with the development of the CFL. The CFL thickness and hemorheological hallmarks in microcirculation, such as the Fahraeus Effect and the Fahraeus-Linqvist Effect, are captured in good agreement with existing experimental and direct numerical results of blood flows. This work establishes a novel continuum computational framework that can efficiently capture the microstructural heterogeneity and non-Newtonian flow behavior of concentrated deformable particle suspensions under confinement.</description>

      <title>Monge-Ampere Geometry and Vortices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.11604v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a new approach to Monge-Ampere geometry based on techniques from higher symplectic geometry. Our work is motivated by the application of Monge-Ampere geometry to the Poisson equation for the pressure that arises for incompressible Navier-Stokes flows. Whilst this equation constitutes an elliptic problem for the pressure, it can also be viewed as a non-linear partial differential equation connecting the pressure, the vorticity, and the rate-of-strain. As such, it is a key diagnostic relation in the quest to understand the formation of vortices in turbulent flows. We study this equation via an associated (higher) Lagrangian submanifold in the cotangent bundle to the configuration space of the fluid. Using our definition of a (higher) Monge-Ampere structure, we study an associated metric on the cotangent bundle together with its pull-back to the (higher) Lagrangian submanifold. The signatures of these metrics are dictated by the relationship between vorticity and rate-of-strain, and their scalar curvatures can be interpreted in a physical context in terms of the accumulation of vorticity, strain, and their gradients. We show explicity, in the case of two-dimensional flows, how topological information can be derived from the Monge-Ampere geometry of the Lagrangian submanifold. We also demonstrate how certain solutions to the three-dimensional incompressible Navier-Stokes equations, such as Hill's spherical vortex and an integrable case of Arnol'd-Beltrami-Childress flow, have symmetries that facilitate a formulation of these solutions from the perspective of (higher) symplectic reduction.</description>
