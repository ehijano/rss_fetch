      <title>Stress Accommodation in Nanoscale Dolan Bridges Designed for Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson junctions are the principal circuit element in numerous superconducting quantum information devices and can be readily integrated into large-scale electronics. However, device integration at the wafer scale necessarily depends on having a reliable, high-fidelity, and high-yield fabrication method for creating Josephson junctions. When creating Al/AlOx based superconducting qubits, the standard Josephson junction fabrication method relies on a sub-micron suspended resist bridge, known as a Dolan bridge, which tends to be particularly fragile and can often times fracture during the resist development process, ultimately resulting in device failure. In this work, we demonstrate a unique Josephson junction lithography mask design that incorporates stress-relief channels. Our simulation results show that the addition of stress-relief channels reduces the lateral stress in the Dolan bridge by more than 70% for all the bridge geometries investigated. In practice, our novel mask design significantly increased the survivability of the bridge during device processing, resulting in 100% yield for over 100 Josephson junctions fabricated.</description>

      <title>Anomalous nuclear spin coherence in superconducting Nb$_3$Sn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have investigated the normal and superconducting states of the technologically important compound Nb$_3$Sn using $^{93}$Nb nuclear magnetic resonance. From spin-lattice relaxation we find strong suppression of the zero-temperature superconducting order parameter by magnetic field. We have identified an anomalously large electron-nuclear exchange interaction from spin-spin relaxation measurements, an order of magnitude beyond that of the dipole-dipole interaction, and thereby sensitive to vortex dynamics and vortex pinning.</description>

      <title>Effect of 2$^\text{nd}$ harmonic current--phase relation on a behavior of a Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically investigate the behavior of a Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier assuming a current-phase relation with a second--harmonic contribution. We find that varying the weight of harmonic terms in the Josephson current affects the gain profile. The analysis of gain characteristics, phase-space portraits, Poincar\'e sections, and Fourier spectra demonstrates that the nonsinusoidal contribution influences the operating mode and stability of the device. In particular, we identify the optimal weighting of harmonic contributions that maximizes amplification, achieving gains up to $\sim 13\;\text{dB}$ in a device without dispersion engineering.</description>

      <title>Influence of pressure on properties of multi-gap type-I superconductor BeAu</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on studies of the superconducting and normal state properties of the noncentrosymmetric superconductor BeAu under hydrostatic pressure conditions. The room-temperature equation of state (EOS) reveals the values of the bulk modulus ($B_0$) and its first derivative ($B^\prime_0$) at ambient pressure to be $B_0 \simeq 132$~GPa and $B^\prime_0 \simeq 30$, respectively. Up to the highest pressures studied ($p \simeq 2.2$~GPa), BeAu remains a multi-gap type-I superconductor. The analysis of $B_{\rm c}(T, p)$ data within the self-consistent two-gap approach suggests the presence of two superconducting energy gaps, with the gap-to-$T_{\rm c}$ ratios $\Delta_1/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} \sim 2.3$ and $\Delta_2/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c} \sim 1.1$ for the larger and smaller gaps, respectively [$\Delta = \Delta(0)$ is the zero-temperature value of the gap and $k_{\rm B}$ is the Boltzmann constant]. With increasing pressure, $\Delta_1/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}$ increases while $\Delta_2/k_{\rm B}T_{\rm c}$ decreases, suggesting that pressure enhances (weakens) the coupling strength between the superconducting carriers within the bands where the larger (smaller) superconducting energy gap has opened. The superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$, \textcolor{black}{the zero-temperature values of the superconducting gaps $\Delta_1$ and $\Delta_2$} and the zero-temperature value of the thermodynamic critical field $B_{\rm c}(0)$ decrease with increasing pressure, with the rates of ${\rm d}T_{\rm c}/{\rm d}p \simeq -0.195$~K/GPa, \textcolor{black}{${\rm d}\Delta_1/{\rm d}p \simeq -0.034$~meV/GPa, ${\rm d}\Delta_2/{\rm d}p \simeq -0.029$~meV/GPa,} and ${\rm d}B_{\rm c}(0)/{\rm d}p = -2.65(1)$~mT/GPa, respectively. The measured $B_{\rm c}(0)$ values plotted as a function of $T_{\rm c}$ follow an empirical scaling relation established for conventional type-I superconductors.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity of the hybrid Ruddlesden-Popper La5Ni3O11 single crystals under high pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-temperature superconductivity in La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10 under high pressure indicates that the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase nickelates Rn+1NinO3n+1 (R = rare earth) is a new material family for high-temperature superconductivity. Exploring the superconductivity of other RP or hybrid RP phase nickelates under high pressure has become an urgent and interesting issue. Here, we report a novel hybrid RP nickelate superconductor of La5Ni3O11. The hybrid RP nickelate La5Ni3O11 is formed by alternative stacking of La3Ni2O7 with n=2 and La2NiO4 with n=1 along the c axis. The transport and magnetic torque measurements indicate a density-wave transition at approximately 170 K near ambient pressure, which is highly similar to both La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10. With increasing pressure, high-pressure transport measurements reveal that the density-wave transition temperature (TDW) continuously increases to approximately 210 K with increasing pressure up to 12 GPa before the appearance of pressure-induced superconductivity, and the density-wave transition abruptly fades out in a first-order manner at approximately 12 GPa. The optimal superconductivity with Tconset = 64 K and Tczero = 54 K is achieved at approximately 21 GPa. On the other hand, high-pressure X-ray diffraction experiments reveal a structural phase transition from an orthorhombic structure to a tetragonal structure at approximately 4.5 GPa. In contrast to La3Ni2O7 and La4Ni3O10, the pressure-induced structural transition has no significant effect on either the density-wave transition or the superconductivity, suggesting a minor role of lattice degree of freedom in La5Ni3O11. The present discovery extends the superconducting member in the RP nickelate family and sheds new light on the superconducting mechanism.</description>

      <title>Renormalization-group approach to the Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity: Amplification of the pairing gap from $\ell^4$ to $\ell$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the renormalization group (RG) analysis of the Kohn-Luttinger (KL) mechanism for superconductivity. The KL mechanism leads to superconductivity in a system with a repulsive bare interaction. The key ingredient is the screening effect that renders the induced interaction attractive in channels with nonzero angular momentum $\ell \neq 0$, thereby triggering the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) instability. According to the original argument, the resulting gap is exponentially small, with its exponent scaling as $-\ell^4$. However, the KL mechanism was originally formulated within perturbation theory, where the series is known to converge poorly in certain cases -- most notably, for the p-wave paring gap induced by a repulsive s-wave contact interaction. This poor convergence may be attributed to a divergent integrand in a specific class of diagrams containing both the BCS logarithm and the Kohn anomaly, suggesting that one must resum the Kohn anomaly contributions separately from the BCS logarithm. In this work, we incorporate the Kohn anomaly contribution into the beta function of the RG equation governing the BCS instability near the Fermi surface. Our solution shows that the KL gap exponent is then proportional to $-\ell$, indicating a significant enhancement of the KL mechanism beyond the previously known result. To illustrate this, we study the spin-triplet p-wave pairing gap arising from a repulsive s-wave contact interaction and compare our RG-based results with those obtained from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Damage of bilayer structure in La3Ni2O7-d induced by high pO2 annealing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01501v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity with onset temperature of ~80 K in pressurized bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper La3Ni2O7-d has attracted much attention. Despite intense research, determination of the exact oxygen content and understanding of the relationship between superconductivity and oxygen content remain a big challenge. Here, we report a systematical study on the structure and physical properties of La3Ni2O7-d polycrystalline powders which were prepared using sol-gel method at ambient pressure and then annealed under various oxygen pressure. We found that high pO2 annealing with slow cooling results in a new phase, which can be modeled using the hybrid single-layer-trilayer La3Ni2O7 or the tetragonal bilayer La3Ni2O7. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) measurements revealed significant single layers and trilayers after high oxygen pressure annealing, evidencing damage of the bilayer structure. The superconducting transition under high pressure became weak for high pO2 annealed samples, which is consistent with the damage of the bilayer structure. Our results reveal that the bilayer structure is fragile and post-annealing under near atmosphere pressure of oxygen is suitable to maintain bilayer structure and increase oxygen content at the same time.</description>

      <title>Structural and Electronic Evolution of Bilayer Nickelates Under Biaxial Strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.01624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of high-Tc superconductivity around 80K in bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has expanded the family of high-Tc superconductors above the nitrogen boiling temperature. Recent studies have further shown that ambient pressure superconductivity with a Tc exceeding 40K can be achieved in compressively strained La3Ni2O7 thin films, offering a tunable platform for investigating the pairing mechanism in high-Tc nickelates. A comprehensive understanding of the structural and electronic properties of bilayer nickelate under epitaxial strain is essential to advance this active field. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically explore the entire rare-earth (Re) series of bilayer nickelates Re3Ni2O7 in the realistic orthorhombic Amam phase under various compressive and tensile strain conditions. We highlight the materials properties change when strain is applied, and compare these results with those observed under high pressure. Our findings show that 2.5\% compressive strain increases the apical Ni-O-Ni bond angle toward 180 degree, and causes the Ni $d_{z^2}$ bands to move away from the Fermi level. The tight-binding parameters for the 2.5\% compressively strained La3Ni2O7 are quite similar to those of the unstrained material, except that the on-site energy difference between the Ni $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals increases by about 50 percent. Notably, the absence of the $d_{z^2}$ bands at the Fermi energy under compressive strain contrasts sharply with the electronic structure in the high-pressure {\it Fmmm} phase, suggesting that the presence of $d_{z^2}$ bands at the Fermi energy may not be a requisite for superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Proposal for Spin-Superfluid Quantum Interference Device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00237v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In easy-plane magnets, the spin-superfluid phase was predicted to facilitate coherent spin transport. So far, experimental evidence remains elusive. In this letter, we propose an indirect way to sense this effect via the spin-superfluid quantum interference device (spin SQUID) -- inspired by its superconducting counterpart (rf SQUID). The spin SQUID is constructed as a quasi-one-dimensional (1D) magnetic ring with a single Josephson weak link, functioning as an isolated device with a microwave response. The spin current is controlled by an in-plane electric field through Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. This interaction can be interpreted as a gauge field that couples to the spin supercurrent through the Aharonov-Casher effect. By investigating the static and dynamic properties of the device, we show that the spin current and the harmonic frequencies of the spin superfluid are periodic with respect to the accumulated Aharonov-Casher phase and are, therefore, sensitive to the radial electric flux through the ring in units of the electric flux quantum, suggesting a potential electric-field sensing functionality. For readout, we propose to apply spectroscopic analysis to detect the frequency of the harmonic modes.</description>

      <title>Orbital correlations in bilayer nickelates: roles of doping and interlayer coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the nature of orbital correlations present in the bilayer nickelate within a minimal two-orbital tight binding model to gain insights into their possible role in stabilizing the less-known weakly-insulating state. The latter has been observed experimentally at ambient pressure. In order to achieve this objective, we examine the static orbital susceptibilities within the random-phase approximation. Our study highlights the sensitivity of orbital correlations to various factors including the interlayer coupling, carrier concentration, band-structure details such as the orbital contents, the number of bands contributing at the Fermi level etc. We relate this sensitiveness to the modification of the Fermi surfaces as well as their orbital contents dependent on aforementioned factors.</description>

      <title>Interplay of correlations and Majorana mode from local solution perspective</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the quasiparticle spectrum of a hybrid system, comprising a correlated (Anderson-type) quantum dot coupled to a topological superconducting nanowire hosting the Majorana boundarymodes. From the exact solution of the low-energy effective Hamiltonian, we uncover a subtle interplay between Coulomb repulsion and the Majorana mode. Our analytical expressions show that the spectral weight of the leaking Majorana mode is sensitive to both the quantum dot energy level and the repulsive potential. We compare our results with estimations by L.S. Ricco et al. Phys. Rev. B 99, 155159 (2019) obtained for the same hybrid structure using the Hubbard-type decoupling scheme, and analytically quantify the spectral weight of the zero-energy (topological) mode coexisting with the finite-energy (trivial) states of the quantum dot. We also show that empirical verification of these spectral weights could be feasible through spin-polarized Andreev spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Supercurrent through a single transverse mode in nanowire Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.00146v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor materials are fueling research in mesoscopic physics and quantum technology. Recently demonstrated smooth $\beta$-Sn superconductor shells, due to the increased induced gap, are expanding the available parameter space to new regimes. Fabricated on quasiballistic InSb nanowires, with careful control over the hybrid interface, Sn shells yield measurable switching currents even when nanowire resistance is of order 10kohm. In this regime Cooper pairs travel through a purely 1D quantum wire for at least part of their trajectory. Here, we focus on the evolution of proximity-induced supercurrent in magnetic field parallel to the nanowire. Long decay up to fields of 1T is observed. At the same time, the decay for higher occupied subbands is notably faster in some devices but not in others. We analyze this using a tight-binding numerical model that includes the Zeeman, orbital and spin-orbit effects. When the first subband is spin polarized, we observe a dramatic suppression of supercurrent, which is also confirmed by the model and suggests an absence of significant triplet supercurrent generation.</description>

      <title>Self-consistent study of topological superconductivity in two-dimensional quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.06355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.06355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional $s$-wave topological superconductivity with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and Zeeman field in Penrose and Ammann-Beenker quasicrystals. By solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations self-consistently for not only the superconducting order parameter, but also the spin-dependent Hartree potential, we show the stable occurrence of topological superconductivity with broken time-reversal symmetry in both Penrose and Ammann-Beenker quasicrystals. The topological nature of the quasicrystalline system is signified by the Bott index $B$. Topological phase transitions are found to occur, where $B$ changes between 0 and $\pm 1$, as the chemical potential or Zeeman field is varied. In terms of self-consistent solutions, we demonstrate the existence of a Majorana zero mode per edge or vortex when $B=\pm 1$, consistently with the bulk-edge/defect correspondence for periodic systems.</description>

      <title>Identification of the superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ upon 100 GPa</title>

Abstract: Identification of superconductivity in the Ruddlesden-Popper phases of nickelates under high pressure remains challenging. Here, we report a comprehensive study of the crystal structure, resistance, and Meissner effect in single crystals of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ with hydrostatic pressures up to 104 GPa. X-ray diffraction measurements reveal a structural transition from the orthorhombic to a tetragonal phase above 40 GPa. Zero resistance of the superconductivity was achieved with a maximum onset $T_c^{onset}$ of 83 K at 18.0 GPa. Superconductivity is gradually suppressed until it disappears above 80 GPa, resulting in a right-triangle-like superconducting region. The direct-current magnetic susceptibility technique successfully detected the Meissner effect in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ under pressure; the maximum superconducting volume fraction is estimated to be 62.7% at 22.0 GPa. Thus, we demonstrate the bulk nature of superconductivity in the bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ single crystals under high pressure. The results reveal intimate connections among the superconductivity, oxygen content, and structure in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$.</description>

      <title>Flat-band ratio and quantum metric in the superconductivity of modified Lieb lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12993v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flat bands may offer a route to high critical temperatures of superconductivity. It has been predicted that the quantum geometry of the bands as well as the ratio of the number of flat bands to the number of orbitals determine flat band superconductivity. However, such results have assumed at least one of the following: an isolated flat band, zero temperature, mean-field theory, and/or uniform pairing. Here, we explore flat band superconductivity when these assumptions are relaxed. We consider an attractive Hubbard model for different extensions of the Lieb lattice. The superconducting order parameter, critical temperature, superfluid weight, and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) temperature are calculated within dynamical mean-field theory. We find that for isolated flat bands, the flat-band ratio and quantum geometry are in general good indicators of superconductivity even at finite temperatures. For non-isolated flat bands, a good guideline of the BKT temperature is provided by the zero-temperature superfluid weight and the flat-band ratio.</description>

      <title>Observation of superconducting pair density modulation within lattice unit cell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.16683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In unconventional high-temperature (high-Tc) superconductors, the pair density wave state, an exotic superconducting order showing spatially periodic order parameter modulations with the period of several unit cells and translational symmetry breaking, has attracted broad attention. However, the superconducting pair density modulation within a single unit cell (PDM) has never been carefully investigated before. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, we report the observation of PDM in monolayer high-Tc iron chalcogenide films epitaxially grown on SrTiO3(001). The superconductivity modulations are characterized by the superconducting gap size and the coherence peak sharpness. Further analysis shows that the local maxima and minima in the superconducting gap modulation are centered at the crystallographic locations of the chalcogen atoms, revealing the breaking of the glide-mirror symmetry of the chalcogen atoms in monolayer high-Tc iron chalcogenide films grown on SrTiO3(001). Our findings provide precise microscopic information on superconductivity within the lattice unit cell and may promote the understanding of unconventional high-Tc superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Ternary superhydrides under pressure of Anderson's theorem: Near-record superconductivity in (La,Sc)H$_{12}$</title>

Abstract: Lanthanum-hydrogen system and its derivatives remain among the most promising for achieving room-temperature superconductivity. In this study, we examined the formation of ternary lanthanum-scandium superhydrides at pressures up to 220 GPa. The primary product of the LaSc alloy's reaction with hydrogen is newly discovered cubic (La,Sc)H$_{12}$, demonstrating clear superconducting transition in all six channels of the van der Pauw scheme below 244-248 K. In this compound with an unusually large unit cell volume, virtually no magnetoresistance was observed in fields up to 68 Tesla. Synthesized samples of (La,Sc)H$_{12}$ demonstrate pronounced superconducting diode and SQUID-like effects at a record high temperature of 233 K. Furthermore, our analysis revealed the formation of lower hexagonal polyhydrides (La,Sc)H$_{6-7}$, which could potentially account for the anomaly in electrical resistance observed near 274 K. This anomaly between 265-290 K also appears in the radio-frequency transmission measurements and may be of a superconducting nature.</description>

      <title>Impact of Spin-Orbit Coupling on Superconductivity in Rhombohedral Graphene</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.09906v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) has played an important role in many topological and correlated electron materials. In graphene-based systems, SOC induced by transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) at proximity was shown to drive topological states and strengthen superconductivity. However, in rhombohedral multilayer graphene, a robust platform for electron correlation and topology, superconductivity and the role of SOC remain largely unexplored. Here we report transport measurements of TMD-proximitized rhombohedral trilayer graphene (RTG). We observed a new hole-doped superconducting state SC4 with Tc = 230 mK. On the electron-doped side, we identified a new isospin-symmetry breaking three-quarter-metal (TQM) phase and observed the nearby weak superconducting state SC3 is significantly enhanced. Surprisingly, the original superconducting state SC1 in bare RTG is strongly suppressed in the presence of TMD - opposite to the effect of SOC on all other graphene superconductivities. Our observations form the basis of exploring superconductivity and non-Abelian quasiparticles in rhombohedral graphene devices.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length</title>

Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable nonlocal Josephson effect through magnetic van der Waals bilayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that the proximity effect at superconductor/ferromagnet (S/F) interfaces produces damped oscillatory behavior of the Cooper pair wave function within the ferromagnetic regions, which is analogous to the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconductivity. It is often called the mesoscopic FFLO state and gives rise to $0-\pi$-transitions in S/F/S Josephson junctions. This paper offers an analysis of the proximity effect at interfaces between superconductors and magnetic van der Waals (vdW) bilayers. The specific feature of the proximity effect in the vdW bilayer systems is the presence of non-local Cooper pairs. We predict that the mesoscopic FFLO state formed by such pairs is sensitive to the difference between on-site energies of the monolayers composing the bilayer and, thus, can be controlled by applying a gating potential to one of the monolayers. This opens the possibility of implementing gate-controlled $0-\pi$ transitions in Josephson junctions through the magnetic vdW bilayer weak links.</description>

      <title>Orientation-dependent transport in junctions formed by $d$-wave altermagnets and $d$-wave superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12141v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate de Gennes-Saint-James states and Josephson effect in hybrid junctions based on $d$-wave altermagnet and $d$-wave superconductor. Even though these states are associated to long junctions, we find that the $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-altermagnet in a normal metal/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor junction forms de Gennes-Saint-James states in a short junction due to an enhanced mismatch between electron and hole wave vectors. As a result, the zero-bias conductance peak vanishes and pronounced resonance spikes emerge in the subgap conductance spectra. By contrast, the $d_{xy}$-altermagnet only features de Gennes-Saint-James states in the long junction. Moreover, the well-known features such as V-shape conductance for $d_{x^2-y^2}$ pairings and zero-biased conductance peak for $d_{xy}$ pairings are not affected by the strength of $d_{xy}$-altermagnetism in the short junction. We also study the Josephson current-phase relation $I(\varphi)$ of $d$-wave superconductor/altermagnet/$d$-wave superconductor hybrids, where $\varphi$ is the macroscopic phase difference between two $d$-wave superconductors. In symmetric junctions, we obtain anomalous current phase relation such as a $0$-$\pi$ transition by changing either the orientation or the magnitude of the altermagnetic order parameter and dominant higher Josephson harmonics. Interestingly, we find the first-order Josephson coupling in an asymmetric $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$-superconductor/altermagnet/$d_{xy}$-superconductor junction when the symmetry of altermagnetic order parameter is neither $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$- nor $d_{xy}$-wave. We present the symmetry analysis and conclude that the anomalous orientation-dependent current-phase relations are ascribed to the peculiar feature of the altermagnetic spin-splitting field.</description>

      <title>Josephson microwave photon detector operating at 0.7 K</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.04426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We predict that the threshold detectors based on Al Josephson junctions, with critical currents below 100 nA, exhibiting a phase diffusion regime, can be exploited for the microwave photon detection both at 17 mK and 700 mK. We demonstrate a detection of two- and one-photon energies at 5 GHz with 90% and 15% efficiency and dark count time of about 0.1 s and 0.01 s, respectively. The observed weak temperature dependence of the detector's performance in the sub-kelvin range fully confirms its phase-diffusion mode of operation. On the other hand, these results show that inevitable thermal fluctuations are not the main source of the detector noise. Consequently, there is still a room to optimize the detector's performance. These results are important for axion search experiments in the range of 5-25 GHz (20-100 $\mu$eV).</description>

      <title>Vacuum and Vortices in Inhomogeneous Abelian Higgs Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inhomogeneous abelian Higgs model with a magnetic impurity in the BPS limit is studied for both relativistic and nonrelativistic regimes. Though the symmetry of spatial translation is broken by inhomogeneity, extension to an $\mathcal{N}=1$ supersymmetric theory is admitted. The quartic scalar potential has minimum value depending on strength of the impurity but possesses broken phase at spatial asymptote. The vacuum configuration of broken phase can be neither a constant nor the minimum of the scalar potential, but is found as a nontrivial solution of the Bogomolny equations. While its energy density and magnetic field are given by the function of spatial coordinates, the energy and magnetic flux remain zero. The sign of the magnetic impurity term allows either a BPS sector or anti-BPS sector but not both. Thus the obtained solution is identified as the new inhomogeneous broken vacuum of minimum zero energy. In the presence of rotationally symmetric Gaussian type inhomogeneity, topological vortex solutions are also obtained and the effects of the impurity to the vortex are numerically analyzed.</description>

      <title>High-performance conditional-driving gate for Kerr parametric oscillator qubits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Kerr parametric oscillators (KPOs), two-photon driven Kerr-nonlinear resonators, can stably hold coherent states with opposite-sign amplitudes and are promising devices for quantum computing. Recently, we have theoretically proposed a two-qubit gate $R_{zz}$ for highly detuned KPOs and called it a conditional-driving gate [Chono $\textit{et al}$., Phys. Rev. Res. $\textbf{4}$, 043054 (2022)]. In this study, analyzing its superconducting-circuit model and deriving a corresponding static model, we find that an AC-Zeeman shift due to the flux pulse for the gate operation largely affects the gate performance. This effect becomes a more aggravating factor with shorter gate times, leading to an increase in the error rate. We thus propose a method to cancel this undesirable effect. Furthermore, through the use of shortcuts to adiabaticity and the optimization of flux pulses, we numerically demonstrate a conditional-driving gate with average fidelity exceeding 99.9$\%$ twice faster than that without the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Majorana-metal transition in a disordered superconductor: percolation in a landscape of topological domain walls</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Most superconductors are thermal insulators. A disordered chiral $\textit{p}$-wave superconductor, however, can make a transition to a thermal metal phase. Because heat is then transported by Majorana fermions, this phase is referred to as a Majorana metal. Here we present numerical evidence that the mechanism for the phase transition with increasing electrostatic disorder is the percolation of boundaries separating domains of different Chern number. We construct the network of domain walls using the spectral localizer as a ``topological landscape function'', and obtain the thermal metal--insulator phase diagram from the percolation transition.</description>
