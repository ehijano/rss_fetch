      <title>Fluxoid solitons in superconducting tapered tubes and bottlenecks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A thin-walled tubular superconductor develops a quantized fluxoid in the presence of an axial magnetic field. The fluxoid corresponds to the number of phase windings of the superconducting order parameter and is topological in nature. When the tube has a radius variation along the axial direction, forming a bottleneck structure between sections with different radius, a fluxoid mismatch can appear depending on the applied magnetic field. The bottleneck then becomes a topological boundary and is host to topologically protected solutions for the order parameter, dubbed fluxoid solitons, that are free to move around bottlenecks with cylindrical symmetry. Fluxoid solitons are a new type of vortex with non-quantized flux, loosely related to Pearl vortices in thin superconducting films and fluxons in Corbino Josephson junctions. We characterize their properties as a function of system parameters using the self-consistent quasiclassical theory of diffusive superconductors. We consider both short bottleneck structures and long tapered tubes, where multiple trapped fluxoid solitons adopt elaborate arrangements dictated by their mutual repulsion.</description>

      <title>High Pressure Superconducting transition in Dihydride BiH$_2$ with Bismuth Open-Channel Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal hydrides MHx with low hydrogen content are not expected to show high-Tc superconductivity owing to the low hydrogen-derived electronic density of states at Fermi level and the limited hydrogen contribution to electron-phonon coupling strength. In this work, we report on the successful synthesis of a novel bismuth dihydride superconductor, Cmcm-BiH$_2$, at approximately 150 GPa, and the discovery of superconductivity with Tc about 62 K at 163 GPa, marking the first instance of superconductor among the MH$_2$-type metal dihydrides. Cmcm-BiH$_2$ adopts a unique host-guest type structure, in which the Bi atoms via weak Bi-Bi covalent bonds form a three-dimensional open-channel framework that encapsulates H$_2$-like molecules as guests, thereby broadening the structural diversity of hydrides under high pressures. The occurrence of superconductivity is evidenced by a sharp drop of resistivity to zero and the characteristic downward shift of Tc under applied magnetic fields. Notably, Cmcm-BiH$_2$ remains stable down to at least 97 GPa during decompression, with the calculated lowest pressure for dynamic stability of 10 GPa. In-depth analysis reveals that the covalent bismuth open-channel structure forms metallic conduction channels, dominates the electronic states near the Fermi level, and contributes approximately 51% of the total $lambda$ in Cmcm-BiH$_2$, distinguishing it from known high-pressure hydride superconductors. These findings highlight the critical role of non-hydrogen elements in producing superconductivity and open new avenues for the design and optimization of high-Tc hydride superconductors.</description>

      <title>Strain-induced structural change and nearly-commensurate diffuse scattering in the model high-temperature superconductor HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the strain response of underdoped HgBa$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$ (Hg1201), by synchrotron X-ray diffraction and corresponding simulations of thermal diffuse scattering. The compression in the crystallographic $a$ direction leads to relatively small expansion in the $b$ and $c$ directions, with Poisson ratios $\nu_{ba}$=0.16 and $\nu_{ca}$=0.11, respectively. However, the Cu-O distance in the $c$ direction exhibits a notable 0.9% increase at 1.1% $a$-axis compression. We further find strain-induced diffuse scattering which corresponds to a new type of two-dimensional charge correlation. Interestingly, this signal is insensitive to the onset of superconductivity and instead corresponds to a short-range, nearly commensurate modulation with a wave vector close to (0.5, 0, 0) and a correlation length of approximately four unit cells. It closely resembles the charge order theoretically predicted in the phase diagram of the spin-liquid model with resonating valence bonds on a square lattice.</description>

      <title>Optimal superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ where the Van Hove singularity crosses half-filling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent discovery of unconventional superconductivity has pointed to twisted WSe$_2$ bilayer as a versatile platform for studying the correlated and topological phases of matter. Here we analyze the effect of the displacement field and electron interactions on the formation of a topological paired state in twisted WSe$_2$. Our approach is based on the effective single band $t$-$J$-$U$ model supplemented with intersite Coulomb interaction term and treated within the Gutzwiller approximation. We show that the superconducting phase is stabilized in a small range of displacement fields where the Van Hove singularity crosses half-filling, which is in qualitative agreement with recent experimental data. According to our analysis, such a circumstance comes as a result of a subtle interplay between the large density of states of the Van Hove singularity, in combination with the renormalization effects that appear in the weak-to-moderate correlations regime. The two factors create favorable conditions for the SC pairing only in a small area of the phase diagram.</description>

      <title>ARPES of Bi2212 interpreted via a particle in a system of dynamic scatterers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21568v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, I employ parabolic cylinder functions to quantitatively describe the ARPES spectra of an over-doped Bi2212 across the temperature range 6 - 140K at the antinode k-point. These functions come from the solutions of a particle moving in a system of random scatterers. The parameters, i.e. the overall amplitude (A), the spectral coherence scale (C), and the energy shift (EG), are determined directly by fitting to experimental data. At 140K, the dominated feature of the ARPES spectrum resembles the solution of a particle moving in a one-dimensional random system. According to the present model, the electronic states of the over-doped Bi2212 at the antinode k-point can be viewed as a realization of the theory of a particle moving in dynamic scatterers in 1D with corrections from the ground state solutions at lower temperature.</description>

      <title>Philip Warren Anderson</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.20865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Philip Warren Anderson was a pioneering theoretical physicist whose work fundamentally shaped our understanding of complex systems. Anderson received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1977 for his groundbreaking research on localization and magnetism, yet he did so much more. His work on magnetism included antiferromagnetism, superexchange, the Kondo problem and local magnetic moments in metals. Anderson pointed out the importance of disorder through his work on localization, non-crystalline solids and spin glasses. In superconductivity, he is known for the dirty superconductor theorem, showing the gauge-invariance of the BCS theory, his study of flux creep, and for his collaboration with experimentalists to realize the Josephson effect. Anderson's resonating valence bond theory may yet play an important role in high temperature superconductivity. Anderson was also fascinated by broken symmetry, and he laid the theoretical groundwork for what is now known as the Anderson-Higgs mechanism, showing how gauge bosons can acquire mass - an insight that played a foundational role in the Standard Model of particle physics. In his seminal "More is Different" paper, Anderson argued that the collective emergent phenomena that arise in complex interacting systems cannot be deduced from their fundamental parts. Anderson's legacy endures not only through the lasting impact of his scientific work but also through his influence on generations of physicists who continue to explore the rich landscape of collective behavior in nature.</description>

      <title>Hybrid magnon -- Nambu-Goldstone excitations in topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator thin-film heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00460v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address a previously unexplored type of dynamical proximity effect that occurs in s-wave topological superconductor/ferromagnetic insulator (TS/FI) heterostructures. It is predicted that magnons in the FI and the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) collective superconducting phase mode in the TS are coupled, forming composite magnon-NG excitations. The mechanism of this coupling is associated with the complete spin-momentum locking of electrons in the helical surface state of the TS. The strength of the magnon-NG coupling is strongly anisotropic with respect to the mutual orientation of the magnon wave vector and the equilibrium magnetization of the FI. This effect provides a mechanism for the interconversion of spin signals and the spinless signals carried by collective superconducting excitations, thereby giving new impetus to the development of superconducting spintronics.</description>

      <title>Crossed surface flat bands in three-dimensional superconducting altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Superconducting altermagnets have proven to be a promising ground for emergent phenomena but their study has involved two dimensional systems. In this work, we investigate three-dimensional $d$- and $g$-wave altermagnets with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity and show the formation of crossed surface flat bands due to the underlying symmetries. We find that these crossed flat bands appear at zero energy in the surface along $z$ due to the superconducting nodal lines in the $xy$-plane, while the number of corners is determined by the crystal symmetry of altermagnets. We also show that the superconducting nodal lines give rise to Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces, which then affect the appearance of zero-energy arcs in the surface along $x$. Moreover, we demonstrate that the crossed surface flat bands, surface arcs, and Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces give rise to distinct signals in charge conductance, hence offering a solid way for their detection and paving the way for realizing higher dimensional topological phases using altermagnets.</description>

      <title>Phase Separation in Kitaev Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kitaev chain is a one-dimensional spinless fermion model that has $p$-wave superconducting (SC) states and Majorana zero modes at the edge. Usually this model is analyzed by taking only SC order parameter (OP) into account, but the situation significantly changes when OPs other than the SCOP are included. It turns out that the SC state in the latter case is prone to phase separation for moderate to strong attractiive interactions.</description>

      <title>Cooper pair condensation from entanglement-entropy collapse of many-body states in sheared bilayer graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is known that the sheared graphene bilayers can be tuned to have flat low-energy bands for sufficiently large size of their moir\'e supercell. In this regime, we show by means of a self-consistent Hartree-Fock approximation that the interacting system becomes prone to develop broken-symmetry phases, with valley symmetry breaking as the dominant pattern. We adopt an exact diagonalization approach, on top of the Hartree-Fock approximation, to show how the condensation of Cooper pairs takes place in the strong-coupling limit of a valley-polarized flat band. A key factor of our proposal is the existence of zero entanglement-entropy many-body states, just made of a single Slater determinant, which are immune to the hybridization with the rest of the states under the strong Coulomb interaction. Moreover, we show that single-particle states with reverse sign of valley symmetry breaking have complementary charge distributions in the supercell, leading to a ground state where the Coulomb repulsion is minimized by placing electrons with opposite spin in different valleys. We argue that the collapse of the entanglement entropy causes the formation of many-body ground states with Cooper pairs made of electrons and their respective partners under valley symmetry, unveiling a strong-coupling mechanism of condensation in a flat band with initially no Fermi line.</description>
