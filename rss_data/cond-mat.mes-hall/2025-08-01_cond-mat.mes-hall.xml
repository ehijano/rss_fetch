      <title>Exciton Berryology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In translationally invariant semiconductors that host exciton bound states, one can define an infinite number of possible exciton Berry connections. These correspond to the different ways in which a many-body exciton state, at fixed total momentum, can be decomposed into free electron and hole Bloch states that are entangled by an exciton envelope wave function. Inspired by the modern theory of polarization, we define an exciton projected position operator whose eigenvalues single out two unique choices of exciton Berry phase and associated Berry connection - one for electrons, and one for holes. We clarify the physical meaning of these exciton Berry phases and provide a discrete Wilson loop formulation that allows for their numerical calculation without a smooth gauge. As a corollary, we obtain a gauge-invariant expression for the exciton polarisation at a given total momentum, i.e. the mean separation of the electron and hole within the exciton wave function. In the presence of crystalline inversion symmetry, the electron and hole exciton Berry phases are quantized to the same value and we derive how this value can be expressed in terms of inversion eigenvalues of the many-body exciton state. We then consider crystalline $C_2 \mathcal{T}$ symmetry, for which no symmetry eigenvalues are available as it is anti-unitary, and confirm that the exciton Berry phase remains quantized and still diagnoses topologically distinct exciton bands. Our theory thereby generalizes the notion of shift excitons, whose exciton Wannier states are displaced from those of the non-interacting bands by a quantized amount, beyond symmetry indicators.</description>

      <title>Higher-order Topological States in Chiral Split Magnons of Honeycomb Altermagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We theoretically explore higher-order topological magnons in collinear altermagnets, encompassing a dimensional hierarchy ranging from localized corner modes to propagating hinge excitations. By employing antiferromagnetic interlayer coupling in bosonic Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian, our work reveals anisotropic surface states and spatially distributed hinge modes within AA-type stacking configurations. We track the adiabatic evolution of Wannier centers to identify the bulk-polarization with second-order topological magnon insulator (SOTMI), where various magnon spectra demonstrate symmetry-protected band structure beyond conventional topology. Harnessing the stability and propagative properties of hinge modes, our study offers a potential platform for magnonic quantum information processing in altermagnetic systems that performs energy-efficient logic operation.</description>

      <title>Quantum confinement effect in Sb thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Antimony (Sb), an element with strong spin-orbit coupling, is predicted to undergo a topological phase transition from a topological semimetal to a topological insulator as its dimensionality approaches the two-dimensional limit, driven by the quantum confinement effect. In this study, we investigate this transition in Sb thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy, employing electrical transport measurements and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). Electrical transport measurements revealed signatures of a modified electronic band structure, including a Hall response with multiple carrier types, a decreasing carrier concentration, and a transition in the curvature of the longitudinal resistance from quadratic to linear with decreasing film thickness. Temperature-dependent magnetoresistance further showed weak antilocalization below 16 K, indicating strong spin-orbit coupling and suggesting the presence of non-trivial topological states. Analysis of the WAL characteristics revealed a single coherent conducting channel and a thickness-dependent change in the phase decoherence mechanism. Complementary ARPES measurements confirmed that reducing the film thickness lifts the conduction band at the M-point, consistent with the emergence of a band gap. These findings support theoretical predictions of a thickness-dependent band structure evolution driven by the quantum confinement effect, providing a foundation for further exploration of topological phase transitions in Sb as well as Bi1-xSbx. The realization of an elemental topological material with simplified stoichiometry and semiconductor compatibility presents a promising avenue for next-generation hybrid systems and applications in spintronics and quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Exploring Many-Body Quantum Geometry Beyond the Quantum Metric with Correlation Functions: A Time-Dependent Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor and quantum Fisher information have recently been shown to provide a unified geometric description of the linear response of many-body systems. However, a similar geometric description of higher-order perturbative phenomena including nonlinear response in generic quantum systems is lacking. In this work, we develop a general framework for the time-dependent quantum geometry of many-body systems by treating external perturbing fields as coordinates on the space of density matrices. We use the Bures distance between the initial and time-evolved density matrix to define geometric quantities through a perturbative expansion. To lowest order, we derive a time-dependent generalization of the Bures metric related to the spectral density of linear response functions, unifying previous results for the quantum metric in various limits and providing a geometric interpretation of Fermi's golden rule. At next order in the expansion, we define a time-dependent Bures-Levi-Civita connection for general many-body systems. We show that the connection is the sum of one contribution that is related to a second-order nonlinear response function, and a second contribution that captures the higher geometric structure of first-order perturbation theory. We show that in the quasistatic, zero-temperature limit for noninteracting fermions, this Bures connection reduces to the known expression for band-theoretic Christoffel symbols. Our work provides a systematic framework to explore many-body quantum geometry beyond the quantum metric and highlights how higher-order correlation functions can probe this geometry.</description>

      <title>Model Hamiltonian for Altermagnetic Topological Insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present models of topological insulating Hamiltonians exhibiting intrinsic altermagnetic features, protected by combined three-fold or four-fold rotational symmetries with time-reversal. We demonstrate that the spin Chern number serves as a robust topological invariant in two-dimensional systems, while for three-dimensional structures, the topological nature is characterized by the spin Chern numbers computed on the $k_z$=$0$ and $k_z$=$\pi$ planes. The resulting phases support symmetry-protected boundary modes, including corner, hinges and surface states, whose structure is determined by the magnetic symmetry and the local magnetic moments. Our findings bridge the fields of altermagnetism and topological quantum matter, and establish a theoretical framework for engineering spintronic topological systems without net magnetization.</description>

      <title>Spin-State Engineering of Single Titanium Adsorbates on Ultrathin Magnesium Oxide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23299</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23299v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Single atomic adsorbates on ultrathin insulating films provide a promising route toward bottom-up quantum architectures based on atomically identical yet individually addressable spin qubits on solid surfaces. A key challenge in engineering quantum-coherent spin nanostructures lies in understanding and controlling the spin state of individual adsorbates. In this work, we investigate single titanium (Ti) atoms adsorbed on MgO/Ag(100) surfaces using a combined scanning tunneling microscopy and electron spin resonance. Our measurements reveal two distinct spin states, $S = 1/2$ and $S = 1$, depending on the local adsorption site and the thickness of the MgO film. Density functional theory calculations suggest a Ti$^+$ configuration for the Ti adsorbates with approximately 3 electrons in the 4$s$ and 3$d$ valence shells. Using a multi-orbital atomic multiplet calculations the site dependence of the spin can be rationalized as a charge redistribution between spin-polarizing and depolarizing orbitals. These findings underscore the potential of surface-supported single atoms as spin qubits with tunable spin and charge states, enabling atom-by-atom control in the realization of a versatile quantum platform on surfaces.</description>

      <title>Magnetic order dependent photoluminescence from high energy excitons in hBN protected few-layer CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection and manipulation of the spin configurations in layered magnetic semiconductors hold significant interest for developing spintronic devices in two-dimensional limit. In this letter, we report a systematical study on the photoluminescence (PL) from the high energy excitons in few-layer CrSBr and its application on detecting the spin configurations. Besides the broad excitonic emission peak (Xl) at around 1.34 eV, we also observed another strong excitonic emission peak (Xh) at around 1.37 eV in hBN encapsulated 2L sample, which splits into two peaks in 3L and 4L samples. With help of the first principles calculations, we conclude that the Xh peak is associated with the transition between the top valence band and the second lowest conduction band, which is forbidden by the inversion symmetry in 1L CrSBr. Furthermore, the position and intensity of the Xh peak are strongly dependent on the interlayer magnetic order of the CrSBr samples, which provides an efficient way to probe their spin configurations. In addition, when the magnetic field is applied at the easy axis direction, we resolve an intermediate magnetic state besides the antiferromagnetic and ferromagnetic states in 3L and 4L samples. Our results reveal few-layer CrSBr as an ideal platform to study the interaction between the excitons and magnetism.</description>

      <title>Graphene-based quantum heterospin graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23360v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate from first principles a variety of low-dimensional open quantum spin systems based on magnetic nanographene structures that contain spin-1/2 and spin-1 triangulenes and/or olympicenes. These graphene nanostructures behave as localized spins and can be effectively described by a quantum bilinear-biquadratic Heisenberg Hamiltonian, for which we will compute the energy spectrum and the quantum numbers associated with the low-energy eigenstates. We propose the experimental realization of antiferromagnetic alternating spin chains using these graphene nanostructures, which result in ferrimagnetic systems whose ground state spin and degeneracy depend on the length of the chain. We also identify a double degeneracy in the total spin quantum number $S$ in the first excited state for three-leg spin graphs (3-LSGs). This degeneracy depends on both the number of sites and the spin species that compose the 3-LSG. We identify the double degeneracy of the first excited state as a consequence of swapping transformation symmetry of the Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>Multilayer Cryogenic Powder Filters with Low Parasitic Capacitance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the development of a cryogenic powder filter that simultaneously offers high attenuation of radio-frequency (RF) signals in the gigahertz (GHz) range and minimized parasitic capacitance to ground. Conventional powder filters, which consist of a signal line passing through a metal powder-filled housing, attenuate high-frequency signals via the skin effect. However, these designs often suffer from significant parasitic capacitance between the signal line and the grounded chassis, which can compromise the performance of sensitive measurement setups by limiting their frequency bandwidth. In this work, we demonstrate that a multilayer powder filter design effectively achieves both high RF attenuation and reduced parasitic capacitance. This solution suppresses sample heating due to the unintentional intrusion of RF signals through the wiring, without degrading the performance of the measurement setup.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Magnetoelectric Edelstein Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The linear Edelstein effect is a cornerstone phenomenon in spintronics that describes the generation of spin magnetization in response to an applied electric field. Recent theoretical advances have reignited interest in its nonlinear counterpart, the nonlinear Edelstein effect, in which spin magnetization is induced by a second-order electric field. However, the intrinsic contribution to both effects is generally forbidden in systems preserving time-reversal symmetry ($\mathcal{T}$) or composite symmetries such as $\mathcal{T}\tau_{1/2}$, where $\tau_{1/2}$ denotes a half-lattice translation. In such systems, spin magnetization typically emerges either from extrinsic mechanisms but limited to metals due to their Fermi-surface property, or from dynamical electric fields with a terahertz driving frequency. Here, we propose a new mechanism for spin magnetization, arising from the interplay of magnetic and electric fields, termed the nonlinear magnetoelectric Edelstein effect. Remarkably, its intrinsic component, determined purely by the material's band structure, can appear even in $\mathcal{T}$-invariant materials, but lacking inversion symmetry ($\mathcal{P}$), including insulators. On the other hand, we illustrate that its extrinsic component can serve as a sensitive indicator of the N\'eel vector reversal in $\mathcal{P}\mathcal{T}$-symmetric antiferromagnetic materials, offering a novel route for antiferromagnetic order detection. To validate our theory, we perform explicit calculations using a two-band Dirac model and a tight-binding model on a honeycomb lattice, finding that both effects yield sizable spin magnetization. Our findings establish the nonlinear magnetoelectric Edelstein effect as a versatile platform for both exploring nonlinear spin physics and enabling symmetry-based detection of antiferromagnetic order.</description>

      <title>Spintronic temperature nanosensor based on the resonance response of a skyrmion-hosting magnetic tunnel junction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23430v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasing need for efficient thermal management in nanoelectronics requires innovative thermal sensing solutions, as conventional sensors often exhibit nonlinear responses, low sensitivity, and complex calibration. We predict a temperature dependence in the response of existing skyrmion based spintronic diodes and propose their use as nanoscale thermal sensors. These devices leverage magnetic skyrmions topologically protected spin textures known for their robustness, nanoscale dimensions, and low power dynamics. We demonstrate high thermal sensitivity with a linear temperature response over a wide range. This linearity, observed in both the amplitude and frequency of the skyrmion excitation, ensures redundancy that enables precise and reliable temperature measurement. In addition, the use of multilayer systems enhances the sensitivity and robustness of the device. These results provide a foundation for skyrmion-based caloritronic devices with promising applications in spintronic sensors, thermal management, nanoelectronics, and skyrmion-caloritronics.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Programmable Surface Acoustic Wave Filters: Device Concept and Predictive Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Filtering surface acoustic wave (SAW) signals of specified frequencies depending on the strength of an external magnetic field in a magnetostrictive material has garnered significant interest due to its potential scientific and industrial applications. Here, we propose a device that achieves selective SAW attenuation by instead programming its internal magnetic state. To this end, we perform micromagnetic simulations for the magnetoelastic interaction of the Rayleigh SAW mode with spin waves (SWs) in exchange-decoupled Co/Ni islets on a piezoelectric LiTaO$_3$ substrate. Due to the islets exhibiting perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, the stray-field interaction between them leads to a shift in the SW dispersion depending on the magnetic alignment of neighboring islets. This significantly changes the efficiency of the magnetoelastic interaction at specified frequencies. We predict changes in SAW transmission of 28.9 dB/mm at 3.8 GHz depending on the state of the device. For the efficient simulation of the device, we extend a prior energy conservation argument based on analytical solutions of the SW to finite-difference numerical calculations, enabling the modeling of arbitrary magnetization patterns like the proposed islet-based design.</description>

      <title>Printable Nanocomposites with Superparamagnetic Maghemite ($\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$) Particles for Microinductor-core Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We here present printable and castable magnetic nanocomposites containing superparamagnetic 11$\pm$3 nm $\gamma$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ particles in an insulating poly-vinyl alcohol polymer matrix. The nanocomposites feature well-dispersed particles with volume fractions between 10 and 45 \%, as confirmed by small-angle neutron scattering. The magnetic volume susceptibility is as high as 17, together with negligible hysteresis at low frequency, and constant AC-response up to the high-kHz range. Measured hysteresis curves at 100-900 kHz with up to 110 mT induced $B$-fields in the nanocomposite show that power losses depend on $B$-field squared, and frequency to the power of 1-1.3. The only loss mechanism in the nanocomposite is hysteresis losses at $&gt;$100 kHz frequencies, where the largest particles in the 11$\pm$3 nm distribution transition from the superparamagnetic to blocked regime. To mitigate the resulting hysteresis losses (up 10$^2$-10$^5$ kW/m$^3$) a more narrow particle size distribution could be used for future materials. The presented material is eddy current-free and easily integrated into micro-fabrication protocols, as we demonstrate by fabrication of 3-turn print circuit board based inductors with cast/manual printed nanocomposite inductor cores, on which induction has been measured up to 100 MHz.</description>

      <title>Theory of ultrafast conductance modulation in electrochemical protonic synapses by multiphase polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three-terminal electrochemical ionic synapses (EIoS) have recently attracted interest for in-memory computing applications. These devices utilize electrochemical ion intercalation to modulate the ion concentration in the channel material. The electrical conductance, which is concentration dependent, can be read separately and mapped to a non-volatile memory state. To compete with other random access memory technologies, linear and symmetric conductance modulation is often sought after, properties typically thought to be limited by the slow ion diffusion timescale. A recent study by Onen et al.[1] examining protonic EIoS with a tungsten oxide (WO3) channel revealed that this limiting timescale seemed irrelevant, and linear conductance modulation was achieved over nanosecond timescales, much faster than the bulk ion diffusion. This contrasts with previous studies that have shown similar conductance modulation with pulse timescales of milliseconds to seconds. Understanding the phenomena behind these conductance modulation properties in EIoS systems remains a crucial question gating technological improvements to these devices. Here, we provide a theoretical explanation that demonstrates how linearity and symmetry arise from consistent control over the electrolyte-WO3 interface. Comparing these past works, changes in the WO3 channel crystallinity were identified, affecting material thermodynamics and revealing that the device achieving nanosecond pulse timescales underwent phase separation. Coupling of electric field polarizatino and increased electron conductivity in high-concentration filaments, the reaction environment at the gate electrode can be controlled, resulting in ideal conductance modulation within the diffusion-limited regime. This work highlights the potential for phase-separating systems to overcome the traditional diffusion barriers that limit EIoS performance.</description>

      <title>Implementing Pseudofractal Designs in Graphene-Based Quantum Hall Arrays using Minkowski-Bouligand Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a pseudofractal analysis for optimizing high-resistance graphene-based quantized Hall array resistance standards (QHARS). The development of resistance standard device designs through star-mesh transformations is detailed, aimed at minimizing element count. Building on a recent mathematical framework, the approach presented herein refines QHARS device concepts by considering designs incorporating pseudofractals (which may be expressed as star-mesh transformations). To understand how future QHARS pseudofractal designs enable varying sizes of neighborhoods of available quantized resistance, Minkowski-Bouligand algorithms are used to analyze fractal dimensions of the device design topologies. Three distinct partial recursion cases are explored in addition to the original full recursion design, and expressions for their total element counts are derived. These partial recursions, assessed through their fractal dimensions, offer enhanced flexibility in achieving specific resistance values within a desired neighborhood compared to full recursion methods, albeit with an increased number of required elements. The formalisms presented are material-independent, making them broadly applicable to other quantum Hall systems and artifact standards.</description>

      <title>Milli-Tesla Quantization enabled by Tuneable Coulomb Screening in Large-Angle Twisted Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electronic quality of graphene has improved significantly over the past two decades, revealing novel phenomena. However, even state-of-the-art devices exhibit substantial spatial charge fluctuations originating from charged defects inside the encapsulating crystals, limiting their performance. Here, we overcome this issue by assembling devices in which graphene is encapsulated by other graphene layers while remaining electronically decoupled from them via a large twist angle (~10-30{\deg}). Doping of the encapsulating graphene layer introduces strong Coulomb screening, maximized by the sub-nanometer distance between the layers, and reduces the inhomogeneity in the adjacent layer to just a few carriers per square micrometre. The enhanced quality manifests in Landau quantization emerging at magnetic fields as low as ~5 milli-Tesla and enables resolution of a small energy gap at the Dirac point. Our encapsulation approach can be extended to other two-dimensional systems, enabling further exploration of the electronic properties of ultrapure devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work elaborates on how one may develop high-resistance quantized Hall array resistance standards (QHARS) by using star-mesh transformations for element count minimization. Refinements are made on a recently developed mathematical framework optimizing QHARS device designs based on full, symmetric recursion by reconciling approximate device values with exact effective quantized resistances found by simulation and measurement. Furthermore, this work explores the concept of fractal dimension, clarifying the benefits of both full and partial recursions in QHARS devices. Three distinct partial recursion cases are visited for a near-1 Gigaohm QHARS device. These partial recursions, analyzed in the context of their fractal dimensions, offer increased flexibility in accessing desired resistance values within a specific neighborhood compared to full recursion methods, though at the cost of the number of required devices.</description>

      <title>Current-induced spin-orbit torque on the surface of a transition metal dichalcogenide connected to a two-dimensional ferromagnet CrI$_3$: Effects of twisting and gating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent progress in employing two key classes of two-dimensional materials-topological insulators and transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs)-as spin sources for generating spin-orbit torque (SOT), we investigate current-induced spin polarization and the resulting SOT in bilayers composed of a TMDC (WSe$_2$ or MoSe$_2$) and ferromagnetic chromium iodide (CrI$_3$), beyond the linear response regime. Using the steady-state Boltzmann equation, we find that intra-band transitions yield a strong field-like torque on the CrI$_3$ layer, while inter-band transitions give rise to a comparatively weaker damping-like torque in the WSe$_2$/CrI$_3$ system. Remarkably, the damping-like component is enhanced by up to three orders of magnitude in n-doped MoSe$_2$, reaching a strength comparable to the field-like torque, which itself is an order of magnitude larger than that in the WSe$_2$-based bilayer. Both torque components exhibit strong asymmetry between n-type and p-type doping in WSe$_2$ and MoSe$_2$ systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the twist angle plays a crucial role: depending on the TMDC and chemical potential, twisting can reverse the sign of the SOT and significantly modulate its magnitude. Finally, we show that a transverse gate electric field enables substantial tunability of the SOT, by nearly one order of magnitude, and induces a sign reversal at a twist angle of $10.16^{\circ}$.</description>

      <title>Floquet Non-Bloch Formalism for a Non-Hermitian Ladder: From Theoretical Framework to Topolectrical Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodically driven systems intertwined with non-Hermiticity opens a rich arena for topological phases that transcend conventional Hermitian limits. The physical significance of these phases hinges on obtaining the topological invariants that restore the bulk-boundary correspondence, a task well explored for static non-Hermitian (NH) systems, while it remains elusive for the driven scenario. Here, we address this problem by constructing a generalized Floquet non-Bloch framework that analytically captures the spectral and topological properties of time-periodic NH systems. Em- ploying a high-frequency Magnus expansion, we analytically derive an effective Floquet Hamiltonian and formulate the generalized Brillouin zone for a periodically driven quasi-one-dimensional system, namely, the Creutz ladder with a staggered complex potential. Our study demonstrates that the skin effect remains robust (despite the absence of non-reciprocal hopping) across a broad range of driving parameters, and is notably amplified in the low-frequency regime due to emergent longer- range couplings. We further employ a symmetric time frame approach that generates chiral-partner Hamiltonians, whose invariants, when appropriately combined, account for the full edge-state struc- ture. To substantiate the theoretical framework, we propose a topolectrical circuit (TEC) that serves as a viable experimental setting. Apart from capturing the skin modes, the proposed TEC design faithfully reproduces the presence of distinct Floquet edge states, as revealed through the voltage and impedance profiles, respectively. Thus, our work not only offers a theoretical framework for exploring NH-driven systems, but also provides an experimentally feasible TEC architecture for realizing these phenomena stated above in a laboratory.</description>

      <title>Particle localization on helical nanoribbons: Quantum analog of the Coriolis effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the Schr\"odinger equation for a particle confined to the surface of a normal and a binormal helical nanoribbon, obtain the quantum potentials induced by their respective curved surface geometries, and study the localized states of the particle for each ribbon. When the particle momentum satisfies a certain geometric condition, the particle localizes near the inner edge for a normal ribbon, and on the central helix for a binormal ribbon. This result suggests the presence of a pseudo-force that pushes the particle transversely along the width of the ribbon. We show that this phenomenon can be interpreted as a quantum analog of the Coriolis effect, which causes a transverse deflection of a classical particle moving in a rotating frame. We invoke Ehrenfest's theorem applicable to localized states and identify the quantized angular velocities of the rotating frames for the two ribbons. If the particle is an electron, its localization at a specific width gives rise to a Hall-like voltage difference across the ribbon's width. However, unlike in the Hall effect, its origin is not an applied magnetic field, but the ribbon's curved surface geometry. When a normal helical ribbon is mechanically flipped to a binormal configuration in a periodic fashion, it results in a periodic electron transport from the inner edge to the center, giving rise to a quantum AC voltage. This can be used for designing nanoscale electromechanical devices. Quantum transport on a helical nanoribbon can be controlled by tuning the bends and twists of its surface, suggesting diverse applications in biopolymers and nanotechnology.</description>

      <title>Projected branes as platforms for crystalline, superconducting, and higher-order topological phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Projected branes are constituted by only a small subset of sites of a higher-dimensional crystal, otherwise placed on a hyperplane oriented at an irrational or a rational slope therein, for which the effective Hamiltonian is constructed by systematically integrating out the sites of the parent lattice that fall outside such branes [Commun. Phys. 5, 230 (2022)]. Specifically, when such a brane is constructed from a square lattice, it gives rise to an aperiodic Fibonacci quasi-crystal or its rational approximant in one dimension. In this work, starting from square lattice-based models for topological crystalline insulators, protected by the discrete four-fold rotational ($C_4$) symmetry, we show that the resulting one-dimensional projected topological branes encode all the salient signatures of such phases in terms of robust endpoint zero-energy modes, quantized local topological markers, and mid-gap modes bound to dislocation lattice defects, despite such linear branes being devoid of the $C_4$ symmetry of the original lattice. Furthermore, we show that such branes can also feature all the hallmarks of two-dimensional strong and weak topological superconductors through Majorana zero-energy bound states residing near their endpoints and at the core of dislocation lattice defects, besides possessing suitable quantized local topological markers. Finally, we showcase a successful incarnation of a square lattice-based second-order topological insulator with the characteristic corner-localized zero modes in its geometric descendant one-dimensional quasi-crystalline or crystalline branes that feature a quantized localizer index and endpoint zero-energy modes only when one of its end points passes through a corner of the parent crystal. Possible designer quantum and meta material-based platforms to experimentally harness our theoretically proposed topological branes are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1604.01714v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Angular momentum transport in magnetic multilayered structures plays a central role in spintronic physics and devices. The angular momentum currents or spin currents are carried by either quasi-particles such as electrons and magnons, or by macroscopic order parameters such as local magnetization of ferromagnets. Based on the generic interface exchange interaction, we develop a microscopic theory that describes interfacial spin conductance for various interfaces among non-magnetic metals, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic insulators. Spin conductance and its temperature dependence are obtained for different spin batteries including spin pumping, temperature gradient and spin Hall effect. As an application of our theory, we calculate the spin current in a trilayer made of a ferromagnetic insulator, an antiferromagnetic insulator and a non-magnetic heavy metal. The calculated results on the temperature dependence of spin conductance quantitatively agree with the existing experiments.</description>

      <title>Exceptional Andreev spectrum and supercurrent in p-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum of Andreev bound states and supercurrent in a $p$-wave non-Hermitian Josephson junction (NHJJ) in one dimension. The studied NHJJ is composed of two topological $p$-wave superconductors connected by a non-Hermitian dissipative junction. Starting from the effective non-Hermitian Bogoliubov-de Gennes bulk Hamiltonian, we find that a pair of exceptional points emerge in the complex spectrum of Andreev quasi-bound states. The two exceptional points locate symmetrically with respect to phase difference $\phi=\pi$ at zero real energy. Their separation is tunable by the non-Hermitian dissipation strength. By analyzing the non-Hermitian scattering process at the junction, we explicitly demonstrate the loss of quasiparticles through the decay of scattering amplitude probabilities. Furthermore, we obtain the supercurrent directly by the inelastic Andreev reflection amplitudes, which provides a more intuitive interpretation of transport properties in NHJJs. The supercurrent varies continuously as a function of $\phi$ across the exceptional points. No enhancement of critical current is observed. We also generalize our analysis to mixed $s$-$p$ wave NHJJ.</description>

      <title>Local Inversion Symmetry Breaking and Thermodynamic Evidence for Ferrimagnetism in Fe3GaTe2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The layered compound Fe3GaTe2 is attracting attention due to its high Curie temperature, low dimensionality, and the presence of topological spin textures above room temperature, making Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ a good candidate for applications in spintronics. Here, we show, through transmission electron microscopy (TEM) techniques, that Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ single crystals break local inversion symmetry while maintaining global inversion symmetry according to X-ray diffraction. Coupled to the observation of N\'{e}el skyrmions via Lorentz-TEM, our structural analysis provides a convincing explanation for their presence in centrosymmetric materials. Magnetization measurements as a function of the temperature displays a sharp first-order thermodynamic phase-transition leading to a reduction in the magnetic moment. This implies that the ground state of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ is globally ferrimagnetic and not a glassy magnetic state composed of ferrimagnetic, and ferromagnetic domains as previously claimed. Neutron diffraction studies indicate that the ferromagnetic to ferrimagnetic transition upon reducing the external magnetic field is associated with a change in the magnetic configuration/coupling between Fe1 and Fe2 moments. We observe a clear correlation between the hysteresis observed in both the skyrmion density and the magnetization of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$. This indicates that its topological spin textures are affected by the development of ferrimagnetism upon cooling. Observation, via magnetic force microscopy, of magnetic bubbles at the magnetic phase boundary suggests skyrmions stabilized by the competition among magnetic phases and distinct exchange interactions. Our study provides an explanation for the observation of N\'eel skyrmions in centrosymmetric systems, while exposing a correlation between the distinct magnetic phases of Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ and topological spin textures.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Plasmon dispersion and Optical Conductivity of Holey Graphene: signatures of flat-bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23103</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23103v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holey graphene (HG) is a novel two-dimensional (2D) material that has attracted considerable attention due to its remarkable electrical, thermal, and mechanical properties. The recent discovery of flat bands in HG has garnered significant interest. In this work, we systematically investigate the tunable plasmonic modes and optical conductivity of HG at or near the flat band condition by changing the holes radii and periodic configuration. It is found that HG presents nearly flat plasmonic bands in configurations with larger hole radii. Hyperbolic plasmons are found due to the breaking of the graphene's bipartite sublattice symmetry induced by the holes. Such an effect is also confirmed by looking at the optical conductivity, that also presents a marked anisotropy. The material's marked optical anisotropy leads to hyperbolic plasmons, making it a promising platform for nanophotonic applications.</description>

      <title>Giant odd-parity magnetoresistance from proximity-induced topological states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetoresistance typically exhibits even symmetry with respect to the magnetic field, owing to time reversal symmetry (TRS) as dictated by Onsager reciprocity relations. However, in certain systems where TRS is broken, magnetoresistance may acquire an odd component with respect to the magnetic field, referred to as odd parity magnetoresistance (OMR). To date, reported OMR values have been modest, usually restricted to a few tens of percent even under high magnetic fields. Here, we report the discovery of a giant OMR reaching up to 1,150% under a relatively low field of 1 T in a heterostructure composed of 3 nm thick alpha Sn and a ferromagnetic semiconductor, (In,Fe)Sb. Although alpha Sn in this thickness range is a trivial narrow gap semiconductor, analysis of Shubnikov de Haas oscillations combined with ab initio calculations reveals the emergence of tilted topological surface states, induced via magnetic proximity from the (In,Fe)Sb layer. The observed OMR behavior is well explained by a Boltzmann transport model assuming the presence of oppositely tilted Weyl cones in the alpha Sn band structure. Our findings not only shed new light on the physics of OMR but also suggest promising avenues for its application in electronic and spintronic devices, such as ultrasensitive magnetic sensors.</description>

      <title>Effect of quasiparticles on the parameters of a gap-engineered transmon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We evaluate the quasiparticle contribution to the frequency shift and relaxation rates of a transmon with the Josephson junctions connecting superconductors that have unequal energy gaps. The gap difference substantially affects the transmon characteristics. We investigate their dependence on the density and effective temperature of the quasiparticles, and on the nominal (unperturbed by the quasiparticles) transmon frequency. At temperatures low compared to the qubit frequency, the gap difference can induce an anomalous positive frequency shift, resulting in a non-monotonic temperature dependence of the transmon frequency. The qubit relaxation rate exhibits a resonance when the qubit frequency matches the gap difference; the shape of the resonance is strongly temperature-dependent. We propose to use these effects to access the details of the quasiparticle energy distribution.</description>

      <title>AC/DC spin current in ferromagnet/superconductor/normal metal trilayer systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23262v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin pumping with superconductors has been extensively studied, particularly in double-layer systems. In this study, we investigate spin pumping in a trilayer system comprising a ferromagnetic insulator (FMI), a superconductor (SC), and a normal metal (NM). We derive the AC and DC spin currents in the NM layer induced by spin motion in the FMI under circularly polarized microwave irradiation. If we treat the spin motion as classical, the AC spin current is expressed. On the other hand, if we treat the spin motion as quantum quasiparticles, the DC spin current is derived. After these derivations, while the computational cost of evaluating the spin current is extremely high, we mitigate this using the Quantics Tensor Cross Interpolation (QTCI) method. We present numerical results showing the dependence of the spin current on temperature, microwave frequency, and superconductor layer thickness. Notably, the temperature dependence of AC and DC spin currents exhibits a coherence peak. Furthermore, we have discovered a transition structure in the dependence of the spin current on the thickness of the superconductor layer, where the dependence changes after a particular frequency.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Parameters in Quantum Systems: Revisiting Berry Phase, Curvature and Gauge Connections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a reformulation of quantum adiabatic theory in terms of an emergent electromagnetic framework, emphasizing the physical consequences of geometric structures in parameter space. Contrary to conventional approaches, we demonstrate that a Berry electric field naturally arises in systems with dynamic Hamiltonian, when the full time-dependent wavefunction is used to define the gauge potentials. This surprising result bridges the gap between static and dynamical formulations and leads to a deeper understanding of how gauge structures manifest in quantum systems. Building on this, we construct Berry Maxwell equations by analogy with classical electrodynamics, defining Berry electric and magnetic fields as derivatives of scalar and vector potentials obtained from the full quantum state. We verify these equations explicitly and derive field-theoretic identities such as generalized continuity and vorticity relations. This field-based formulation reveals the topological charges, monopole structures, and gauge currents that underlie parameter space, and clarifies how Berry curvature corrections enter dynamical quantities like expectation values and particle velocities. Our results establish a new regime of emergent electromagnetism in parameter space, unifying time-independent and time-dependent geometric phases within a covariant formalism. The implications extend to quantum transport, polarization, and topological classification of phases, providing a robust and generalizable framework for quantum systems driven by adiabatic or nonadiabatic evolution.</description>

      <title>Wave propagation in an elastic lattice with non-reciprocal stiffness and engineered damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonreciprocal wave propagation allows for directional energy transport. In this work, we systematically investigate wave dynamics in an elastic lattice that combines nonreciprocal stiffness with viscous damping. After establishing how conventional damping counteracts the system's gain, we introduce a non-dissipative form of nonreciprocal damping in the form of gyroscopic damping. We find that the coexistence of nonreciprocal stiffness and nonreciprocal damping results in a decoupled control mechanism. The nonreciprocal stiffness is shown to govern the temporal amplification rate, while the nonreciprocal damper independently tunes the wave's group velocity and oscillation frequency. This decoupling gives rise to phenomena such as the enhancement of net amplification for slower-propagating waves and boundary-induced wave mixing. These findings provide a theoretical framework for designing active metamaterials with more versatile control over their wave propagation characteristics.</description>

      <title>Transport-Induced Decoherence of the Entangled Triplet Exciton Pair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decoherence effects for entangled triplet pairs in organic molecular crystals are analyzed for the case when excitons can hop between inequivalent lattice sites. The fluorescence quantum beats caused by quantum interference upon triplet-triplet recombination into an emissive singlet state are predicted as a function of hopping time and magnetic field based on a Monte Carlo analysis. Depending on exciton hopping rates, it is possible to have complete global decoherence and suppression of fluorescence quantum beats in the limit of zero magnetic field, and to have quantum beats that decay at different rates depending on magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional Disordered Projected Branes: Stability and Quantum Criticality via Dimensional Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The interplay of disorder and dimensionality governs the emergence and stability of electronic phases in quantum materials and quantum phase transitions among them. While three-dimensional (3D) dirty Fermi liquids and Weyl semimetals support robust metallic states, undergoing disorder-driven Anderson localization transitions at strong disorder and the later ones exhibiting additional semimetal-to-metal transition at moderate disorder, conventional two-dimensional (2D) non-interacting systems localize for arbitrarily weak disorder. Here, we show that 2D disordered projected branes, constructed by systematically integrating out degrees of freedom from a 3D cubic lattice via the Schur decomposition, faithfully reproduce the full quantum phase diagram of their 3D parent systems. Using large-scale exact diagonalization and kernel polynomial method, we numerically demonstrate that 2D projected branes host stable metallic and semimetallic phases. Remarkably, the critical exponents governing the semimetal-to-metal and metal-insulator transitions on such 2D projected branes are sufficiently close to those of their 3D counterparts. Our findings thus establish 2D projected branes as genuine quantum holographic images of their higher-dimensional disordered parent crystals, supporting stable semimetallic and metallic phases that are otherwise inaccessible in conventional 2D lattices. Finally, we point to experimentally accessible metamaterial platforms, most notably the photonic lattices with tunable refractive-index disorder, as promising systems to realize and probe these phenomena.</description>

      <title>Skyrmion motion in a synthetic antiferromagnet driven by asymmetric spin wave emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.08338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skyrmions have been proposed as new information carriers in racetrack memory devices. To realise such devices, a small size; high speed of propagation; and minimal skyrmion Hall angle are required. Synthetic antiferromagnets (SAFs) present the ideal materials system to realise these aims. In this work, we use micromagnetic simulations to propose a new method for manipulating them using exclusively global magnetic fields. An out-of-plane microwave field induces oscillations in the skyrmions radius which in turn emits spin waves. When a static in-plane field is added, this breaks the symmetry of the skyrmions and causes asymmetric spin wave emission. This in turn drives motion of the skyrmions, with the fastest velocities observed at the frequency of the intrinsic out-of-phase breathing mode of the pair of skyrmions. This behaviour is investigated over a range of experimentally realistic antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange coupling strengths, and the results compared to previous works studying similar motion driven with an oscillating electric field. Through this the true effect of varying the exchange coupling strength is determined, and greater insight is gained into the mechanism of skyrmion motion. These results will help to inform the design of future novel computing architectures based on the dynamics of skyrmions in synthetic antiferromagnets.</description>

      <title>Theory of off-diagonal disorder in multilayer topological insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20713v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study multilayer topological insulators with random interlayer tunneling, known as off-diagonal disorder. Within the Burkov-Balents model a single Hermitian defect creates a bound state whose energy crosses the middle of the gap in the trivial phase but never in the topological phase; a non-Hermitian defect splits this level yet preserves the same crossing rule, so the effect serves as a local marker of topology. However, the key distinction persists: the bound state crosses zero in the trivial phase but not in the topological phase. Two complementary diagrammatic approaches give matching densities of states for the normal, topological, Weyl and anomalous quantum Hall regimes. Off diagonal disorder inserts bulk states into the gap and can close it: the Weyl phase remains robust under strong disorder, whereas the anomalous quantum Hall phase survives only for weak fluctuations, and the added bulk states shrink the Hall plateau, clarifying experimental deviations. Finally, we analyze edge modes. Uniform disorder shortens their localization length slightly, while Gaussian and Lorentzian disorder enlarge it and in the Gaussian case can even delocalize the edges. Although chirality is maintained, the enhanced overlap permits tunneling between opposite edges and pulls the longitudinal conductance away from its quantized value.</description>

      <title>Interaction robustness of the chiral anomaly in Weyl semimetals and Luttinger liquids from a mixed anomaly approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The chiral anomaly is one of the robust quantum effects in relativistic field theories with a chiral symmetry where charges in chiral sectors appear to be separately conserved. The chiral anomaly, which is often associated with a renormalization-invariant topological term, is a violation of this conservation law due to quantum effects. Such anomalies manifest in Weyl materials as an electromagnetic field-induced transfer of charge between Fermi pockets. However, the emergent nature of the conservation of chiral charge leads to manifestations of the chiral anomaly response that depend on the details of the system such as the strength of interactions. In this paper, we apply an approach where the chiral symmetry in solid materials is replaced by the combination of charge $U(1)$ gauge and spatial translation symmetry. The chiral anomaly in this case is replaced by a mixed anomaly between the two symmetries and the chiral charge can be defined as being proportional to the total momentum. We show that the chiral anomaly associated with this chiral charge is unrenormalized by interactions in contrast to other chiral charges in $(1+1)D$ whose renormalization is regularization dependent. In $(3+1)$D Weyl systems, this chiral anomaly is equivalent to the charge transferred between Fermi surfaces which can be measured through changes in Fermi-surface-enclosed volume. We propose a pump-probe technique to measure this.</description>

Abstract: Finding a quantum battery model that displays a genuine quantum advantage, while being prone to experimental fabrication, is an extremely challenging task. In this Letter we propose a deceptively simple quantum battery model that displays a genuine quantum advantage, saturating the quantum speed limit. It consists of two harmonic oscillators (the charger and the battery), coupled during the non-equilibrium charging dynamics by a non-linear interaction. We first present the model, then certify the genuine quantum advantage, and finally briefly discuss how the battery can be fabricated through the use of superconducting circuits.</description>

      <title>Vectorial Symmetry Decoding with Single-Particle Precision via Room-Temperature Lanthanide Luminescence Polarimetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07199v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Determining the local symmetry of luminescent centers in crystals is critical for understanding and controlling their optical transitions, yet current methods are limited by stringent experimental requirements and ambiguous symmetry assignments. Here, we develop a robust computational electromagnetics framework that directly connect the local symmetry and chirality of rare-earth-doped single crystals to the polarization states of their emitted light. This framework is experimentally validated through the precise determination of point and space group symmetries using high-resolution, polarization-resolved micro-photoluminescence ({\mu}-PL) spectra. Unlike conventional approaches that usually rely on analyzing multiple transitions at cryogenic temperatures, our technique operates at room temperature, requires only a single optical transition, and enables accurate orientation of symmetry axes. This enables deterministic polarization control of nano-emitters by tailoring symmetry groups and selecting appropriate transition dipoles, eliminating the need for bulky or complex photonic structures. Additionally, we demonstrate the function of bio-sensing, via determining single particle orientations in complex cellular environments using minimal polarization measurements. These results pave the way for advances in energy transfer systems, ultra-bright rare-earth nanocrystals, nanophotonic materials, and real-time single-particle tracking in biological contexts.</description>

      <title>Dominant end-tunneling effect in two distinct Luttinger liquids coexisting in one quantum wire</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13549v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Luttinger liquids occupy a special place in physics as the most understood case of essentially quantum many-body systems. The experimental mission of measuring its main prediction, power laws in observable quantities, has already produced a body of exponents in different semiconductor and metallic structures. Here, we combine tunneling spectroscopy with density-dependent transport measurements in the same quantum wires over more than two orders of magnitude in temperature to very low electron temperatures down to $\sim$40 mK. This reveals that, when the second 1D subband becomes populated, the temperature dependence splits into two ranges with different exponents in the power-law dependence of the conductance, both dominated by the finite-size effect of the end-tunneling process. This result demonstrates the importance of measuring the Luttinger parameters as well as the number of modes independently through spectroscopy in addition to the transport exponent in the characterization of Luttinger liquids. This opens a new pathway to unambiguous interpretation of the exponents observed in quantum wires.</description>

Abstract: We theoretically predict the in-plane magnetic field-induced orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) superconducting states in twisted WSe$_2$ homobilayers (tWSe$_2$), focusing on its dependence on layer polarization and Fermi surface geometry. For unpolarized layers, finite-momentum pairing emerges only at low temperatures and above a critical field $B_{c1,\parallel}$. When layer symmetry is broken, finite-momentum pairing is stabilized at any nonzero field, with a critical temperature higher than that of the zero-momentum state. Notably, we identify a phase transition, which separates two distinct FFLO phases, when there are two separate Fermi pockets residing in the two moir\'e mini-valleys associated with opposite layers. We further discuss the effects of twist angles and applied field directions. Our findings establish tWSe$_2$ as a promising platform for realizing and manipulating FFLO states via twist angle, displacement field, and filling factor.</description>

      <title>Strain Engineering of Magnetoresistance and Magnetic Anisotropy in CrSBr</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tailoring magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy in van der Waals magnetic materials is essential for advancing their integration into technological applications. In this regard, strain engineering has emerged as a powerful and versatile strategy to control magnetism at the two-dimensional (2D) limit. Here, we demonstrate that compressive biaxial strain significantly enhances the magnetoresistance and magnetic anisotropy of few-layer CrSBr flakes. Strain is efficiently transferred to the flakes from the thermal compression of a polymeric substrate upon cooling, as confirmed by temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy. This strain induces a remarkable increase in the magnetoresistance ratio and in the saturation fields required to align the magnetization of CrSBr along each of its three crystalographic directions, reaching a twofold enhancement along the magnetic easy axis. This enhancement is accompanied by a subtle reduction of the N\'eel temperature by ~10K. Our experimental results are fully supported by first-principles calculations, which link the observed effects to a strain-driven modification in interlayer exchange coupling and magnetic anisotropy energy. These findings establish strain engineering as a key tool for fine-tuning magnetotransport properties in 2D magnetic semiconductors, paving the way for implementation in spintronics and information storage devices.</description>

Abstract: Dual-band plasmonic nanoantennas, exhibiting two widely separated user-defined resonances, are fundamental building blocks for the investigation and optimization of plasmon-enhanced optical phenomena, including photoluminescence, Raman scattering, and various nonlinear effects such as harmonic generation or sum-frequency generation, parametric down-conversion, etc. The nanoparticle-on-slit (NPoS) or nanoparticle-in-groove (NPiG) is a recently proposed dual-band antenna with independently tunable resonances at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths. It was used to enhance the corresponding sum- and difference-frequency generation processes from optimally located molecules by an estimated $10^{13}$-fold. However, the theoretical understanding of such structures and their eigenmodes remains poor, hindering further optimization and limiting broader applications. Here, we explore a diverse range of nanocavity-like quasi-normal modes (QNMs) supported by NPoS structures, examining the contributions of both their near-field (i.e., giant photonic density of states) and far-field (i.e., spatial radiation patterns) characteristics to frequency upconversion. We identify methods for independently tuning the visible and mid-infrared resonances while conserving a good mode overlap in the near field, which is essential for efficient nonlinear processes. Moreover, through mode analysis, we unveil an experimentally unexplored fundamental resonance with greater field enhancement and much-improved mode overlap with the mid-infrared field, which could, in principle, further boost the mid-infrared upconversion efficiency by 5-fold compared to existing results. This work helps to rationalize and optimize the enhancement of nonlinear effects across a wide spectral range using a flexible and experimentally attractive nanoplasmonic platform.</description>
