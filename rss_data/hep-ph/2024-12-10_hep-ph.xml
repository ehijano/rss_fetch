      <title>Learning Symmetry-Independent Jet Representations via Jet-Based Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high energy physics, self-supervised learning (SSL) methods have the potential to aid in the creation of machine learning models without the need for labeled datasets for a variety of tasks, including those related to jets -- narrow sprays of particles produced by quarks and gluons in high energy particle collisions. This study introduces an approach to learning jet representations without hand-crafted augmentations using a jet-based joint embedding predictive architecture (J-JEPA), which aims to predict various physical targets from an informative context. As our method does not require hand-crafted augmentation like other common SSL techniques, J-JEPA avoids introducing biases that could harm downstream tasks. Since different tasks generally require invariance under different augmentations, this training without hand-crafted augmentation enables versatile applications, offering a pathway toward a cross-task foundation model. We finetune the representations learned by J-JEPA for jet tagging and benchmark them against task-specific representations.</description>

      <title>T violation at a future neutrino factory (Contribution to the 25th International Workshop on Neutrinos from Accelerators)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the possibility of measuring T (time reversal) violation in a future long baseline neutrino oscillation experiment. By assuming a neutrino factory as a staging scenario of a muon collider at the J-PARC site, we find that the $\nu_e \to \nu_\mu$ oscillation probabilities can be measured with good accuracy at the Hyper-Kamiokande detector. By comparing with the probability of the time-reversal process, $\nu_\mu \to \nu_e$, measured at the T2K/T2HK, one can determine the CP phase $\delta$ in the neutrino mixing matrix if $|\sin(\delta)|$ is large enough. The determination of $\delta$ can be made with poor knowledge of the matter density of the earth as T violation is almost insensitive to the matter effects. The comparison of CP and T-violation measurements, {\it \`a la} the CPT theorem, provides us with a non-trivial check of the three neutrino paradigm based on the quantum field theory. This proceeding is based on JHEP 12 (2024), 014 [arXiv:hep-ph/2407.05807].</description>

      <title>$q_T$-slicing with multiple jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern collider phenomenology requires unprecedented precision for the theoretical predictions, for which slicing techniques provide an essential tool at next-to-next-to-leading order in the strong coupling. The most popular slicing variable is based on the transverse momentum $q_T$ of a color-singlet final state, but its generalization to final states with jets is known to be very difficult. Here we propose two generalizations of $q_T$ that can be used for jet processes, providing proof of concept with an NLO slicing for $pp \to 2$ jets and presenting factorization formulae that pave the way for extending our approach to NNLO. One of these extensions only applies to planar Born processes, such as $pp \to 2$ jets, but offers a dramatic simplification of the soft function. We also discuss how our approach can directly be extended to obtain predictions for the fragmentation of hadrons. This presents a promising path for high-precision QCD calculations with multi-jet final states.</description>

      <title>Accidental Symmetries, Hilbert Series, and Friends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accidental symmetries in effective field theories can be established by computing and comparing Hilbert series. This invites us to study them with the tools of invariant theory. Applying this technology, we spotlight three classes of accidental symmetries that hold to all orders for non-derivative interactions. They are broken by derivative interactions and become ordinary finite-order accidental symmetries. To systematically understand the origin and the patterns of accidental symmetries, we introduce a novel mathematical construct - a (non-transitive) binary relation between subgroups that we call $friendship$. Equipped with this, we derive new criteria for all-order accidental symmetries in terms of $friends$, and criteria for finite-order accidental symmetries in terms of $friends\ ma\ non\ troppo$. They allow us to verify and identify accidental symmetries more efficiently without computing the Hilbert series. We demonstrate the success of our new criteria by applying them to a variety of sample accidental symmetries, including the custodial symmetry in the Higgs sector of the Standard Model effective field theory.</description>

      <title>Non-Invertible Peccei-Quinn Symmetry, Natural 2HDM Alignment, and the Visible Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify $m_{12}^2$ as a spurion of non-invertible Peccei-Quinn symmetry in the type II 2HDM with gauged quark flavor. Thus a UV theory which introduces quark color-flavor monopoles can naturally realize alignment without decoupling and can furthermore revive the Weinberg-Wilczek axion. As an example we consider the $SU(9)$ theory of color-flavor unification, which needs no new fermions. This is the first model-building use of non-invertible symmetry to find a Dirac natural explanation for a small $\textit{relevant}$ parameter.</description>

      <title>QCD Chemistry: Remarks on Diquarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05440v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In connection with recent discoveries of heavy-quark containing exotic states publications discussing $Qq$ diquarks ($Q,q$ stand for a heavy and light quarks, respectively) proliferated in the literature. After a brief summary of the diquark concept I review various general reasons why the $Qq$ diquark (with sufficinetly heavy $Q$) does not exist. Then I argue (this is the focus of my talk) that the most direct way to confirm non-existence of the $Qq$ diquarks is the study of pre-asymptotic corrections in the inclusive decays of $Qqq$ baryons, e.g. $\Lambda_b$. Since the $c$ quarks are much lighter than $b$, namely, $m_b^2/m_c^2\sim 11$, traces of the $cq$ attraction in the color anti-triplet spin-0 state may or may not be present in the $cqq$ baryons.</description>

      <title>Recursion for Differential Cross-Section from the Optical Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel framework for computing differential cross-sections in quantum field theory using the optical theorem and loop amplitudes, circumventing the traditional method of squaring scattering amplitudes. This approach addresses two major computational challenges in high-multiplicity processes: complexity from amplitude squaring and the extensive summations over color and helicity. Our method employs quantum off-shell recursion, a loop-level generalization of Berends--Giele recursion, combined with Veltman's largest time equation (LTE) through a doubling prescription of fields. By deriving Dyson--Schwinger equations within this doubled framework and constructing quantum perturbiner expansions, we develop recursive relations for generating LTEs. We validate our method by successfully reproducing the differential cross-section for tree-level $2 \to 2$ and $2 \to 4$ scalar scattering for $\phi^{4}$ theory through one-loop and three-loop amplitude calculation respectively. This framework offers an efficient alternative to conventional methods and can be broadly applied to theories with color charges, such as QCD and the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Populating dark sectors with relativistic bubble walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this talk, we present a mechanism of Dark Matter production during first order phase transitions and happening via the collision of the bubble wall and plasma quanta. We will first study the possibility that the dark matter is produced via a renormalisable operator. We will observe that in this context the DM can be much heavier than the scale of the phase transition and has a large initial velocity, leading to the possibility of the DM to be warm today. We will then turn to more realistic scenarios where the Dark Matter sector is secluded and its interaction with the visible sector (including the Standard Model) originates from dimension-five and dimension-six operators. In this regime, we also find that such DM is typically heavy and warm today. We study separately the cases of weakly and strongly coupled dark sectors, where, in the latter case, we focus on glueball DM, which turns out to have very distinct phenomenological properties. For completeness, we also systematically compute the Freeze-In production of the dark sector and compare it with the bubble-plasma DM abundances. All the analytical results are collected in a table presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>On the quarkonium-in-jet collinear fragmentation at moderate-to-large transverse momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report progress on the Heavy-Flavor Non-Relativistic Evolution (HF-NRevo) setup, a novel methodology to address quarkonium formation within the fragmentation approximation. Our study sheds light on the moderate to large transverse-momentum sector, where the leading-twist collinear fragmentation of a single parton prevails over the higher-twist fragmentation from a constituent heavy-quark pair produced in the hard scattering. As for the initial energy-scale inputs, we rely on nonrelativistic next-to-leading calculations for all the parton-to-quarkonia fragmentation channels. Preliminary sets of variable-flavor number-scheme (VFNS) fragmentation functions, named NRFF1.0, are built via an evolution-threshold enhanced DGLAP scheme. Taking NRFF1.0 as a starting point, we use HF-NRevo to address the collinear fragmentation of quarkonia inside jets.</description>

      <title>An effective field theory for muon conversion and muon decay-in-orbit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Muon conversion is one of the best probes of charged lepton flavor violation. The experimental limit is soon expected to improve by four orders of magnitude, thus calling for precise predictions on the theory side. Equally important are precise predictions for muon decay-in-orbit, the main background for muon conversion. While the calculation of electromagnetic corrections to the two processes above the nuclear scale does not involve significant challenges, it becomes substantially more complex below that scale due to multiple scales, bound-state effects and experimental setup. Here, we present a systematic framework that addresses these challenges by resorting to a series of effective field theories. Combining Heavy Quark Effective Theory (HQET), Non-Relativistic QED (NRQED), potential NRQED, Soft-Collinear Effective Theory I and II, and boosted HQET, we derive a factorization theorem and present the renormalization group equations. Our framework allows for the proper calculation of precise predictions for the rates of the two processes, with crucial implications for the upcoming muon conversion searches. We also provide the most accurate prediction of the signal shape for those searches.</description>

      <title>Oscillatory properties of strange quark stars described by the vector MIT bag model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05752v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigated the radial and non-radial fundamental ($f$) mode oscillations of self-bound (quark) stars obtained after employing the Vector MIT (vMIT) bag model. Within this model, we computed the equation of state for strange quark matter satisfying thermodynamic consistency. This allowed us to obtain the corresponding behavior of the speed of sound, mass-radius relation, and gravitational redshift. In particular, our choice of $G_V$ = 0.30 fm$^2$ produces masses and radii in agreement with recent astronomical data (e.g. from NICER and HESS J1731). In fact, we tested that variations of the remaining vMIT parameters slightly modify this conclusion. Then, we proceeded to compute the radial oscillation frequencies of the $f$-mode, which is tightly connected to the dynamical stability of these compact stars. We found that increments of the $G_V$ parameter have a stabilizing property around the maximal-mass stars for a given stellar family. We also calculated the gravitational-wave frequencies of the non-radial $f$-mode. Our results show that they are restricted to be in the range (1.6 - 1.8) kHz for high-mass stars and to (1.5 - 1.6) kHz for low-mass stars. Finally, we propose a universal relation between these frequencies and the square root of the average density. All these last results are important in distinguishing strange stars from ordinary neutron stars in future gravitational-wave detections coming from compact sources with activated non-radial modes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Absolute values of the neutrino mass are not known still now although their upper bounds are constrained through several experiments and observations. Recent analyses of cosmological observations present severe constraint on the sum of neutrino masses. It might suggest an interesting possibility for the absolute values of neutrino mass and their ordering. In this paper, taking it as a useful hint, we study possible neutrino models with a zero mass eigenvalue from a view point of neutrino oscillation data and baryon number asymmetry in the Universe. We focus our study on the seesaw type mass generation by making a certain assumption for origin of right-handed neutrino mass.</description>

      <title>The Sivers asymmetry of vector meson production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transverse single-spin asymmetry for $\rho^0$ production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering was recently reported by the COMPASS Collaboration. Using the Sivers functions extracted from pion and kaon productions, we perform a calculation of the Sivers asymmetry within the transverse momentum dependent factorization. Our results are consistent with the COMPASS data, confirming the universality of the Sivers functions within current experimental uncertainties. While various global analyses of Sivers functions can equally well describe the current data, we obtain very different predictions on the Sivers asymmetry of $\rho$ and $K^*$ productions at electron-ion colliders, which therefore are expected to provide further constraints.</description>

      <title>Research of Extra Charged Gauge Boson $W^{\prime}$ in Alternative Left-Right Model at Future Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of extra charged gauge boson beyond the Standard Model has always been of great interest. Future muon colliders will have a significant advantage in discovering exotic particles. In this paper, by studying the $\mu^+ \mu^- \to W^{\prime +} W^{\prime -} \to e^+ e^- n_e \bar{n}_e$ process, we explore the properties of $W^\prime$ in the alternative left-right model. The cross section and angular distribution of the final electron are investigated in the scenario of different $W^\prime$ mass and right-handed coupling constant. The forward-backward asymmetry is also an important observable to reflect the properties of $W^\prime$. We provide a method to effectively suppress the background processes. With specific kinematic cuts, the significance can reach $5.17\sigma$ for 4.8 TeV $W^\prime$ at the collision energy of 10 TeV.</description>

      <title>Investigation of Mass and Decay Characteristics of the Light-Strange Tetraquark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05874v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent developments in tetraquark studies, we investigate the mass spectra and decay properties of light-strange tetraquarks ($sq\bar{s}\bar{q},ss\bar{q}\bar{q}$) in diquark-antidiquark formalism. By considering different internal quark structures and internal color structures, mass spectra are generated in semi-relativistic and non-relativistic frameworks. For decay widths, the annihilation model and spectator model have been incorporated. Several resonances have been explored as potential candidates for these tetraquarks. Concurrently, mass spectra and several decay channels of kaons ($s\bar{q},q\bar{s}$) are also investigated. This study is carried out in the hope of helping improve the understanding of tetraquarks in the light-light sector.</description>

Abstract: In this letter we realize the factorization of soft and hard dynamics in the transversal plane of an exclusive QCD process by introducing the intrinsic transversal momentum distributions (iTMDs). We ingeniously study the $\pi$ and $K$ electromagnetic form factors by matching the next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD calculation to the precise measurements or data-driven result from the modular dispersion relation, obtain the transversal-size parameter $\beta_\pi^2 = 0.51 \pm 0.04$ GeV$^{-1}$ and $\beta_K^2 = 0.30 \pm 0.05$ GeV$^2$ for the lowest Fock states. With this result, we extract the chiral mass of pion meson as $m_0^\pi(1 \, {\rm GeV}) = 1.84 \pm 0.07$ GeV %which shows a good consistence to the chiral perturbative theory, and explain the precise measurements of kaon form factor in the perturbative timelike region. As a byproduct, impressively, the introduce of iTMDs improves the perturbative QCD prediction down to a few GeV for the electromagnetic form factors, confronting to the available experiment measurements and the lattice QCD evaluations.</description>

      <title>Axion-photon-mixing dark matter conversion mediated by torsion mass constrained by the Barbero-Immirzi parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Standard Model\,(SM) of particle physics, photon-torsion mixing is extended to include the Einstein-Cartan portal to dark-photon-axion-torsion mixing beyond the Standard Model\,(BSM), mediated by torsion. The Barbero-Immirzi(BI) parameter, of the order of $10^{-31}$, is more stringent than those obtained by Aliberti and Lambiase using matter-antimatter asymmetry. This paper presents the coupling of the SM with dark matter\,(DM) axions, both mediated by torsion. We discuss tordions, the quanta of torsion, and the damping of propagating torsion. It is shown that with both kinds of vectorial torsion masses, equations from Einstein-Cartan-Holst gravity can be derived, which reduce to axionic photon equations where torsion appears only through its mass spectrum. Photon-axion conversions and axion mixing are found to depend on the BI parameter. This study demonstrates that when the spin-0 torsion mass is finite and Proca electrodynamics is not ghost-free, dark axion masses align with spin-0 torsion masses via axion-driven torsion and photon-torsion mixing. Our results provide innovative insights into Proca gravity models and the role of torsion in photon-axion conversion and dark matter dynamics, thereby offering a solid foundation for future research and new theoretical frameworks in quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>$V_{cb}$ puzzle in semi-leptonic $B\to D^*$ decays revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the newly reported $B\to D^*(\to D\pi)\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell$ differential decay rates by the Belle and Belle II Collaborations, we revisit the $V_{cb}$ puzzle in semi-leptonic $B\to D^*$ decays, considering the latest lattice QCD simulations and light-cone sum rule results. We examine the commonly used Caprini-Lellouch-Neubert (CLN), Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL), and heavy quark effective theory (HQET) parameterizations. We show that these three parameterizations lead to consistent results and reconfirm the $V_{cb}$ puzzle. Then, we use a state-of-the-art Bayesian method to estimate the impact of higher-order terms beyond the present HQET expansion on the uncertainty of $V_{cb}$. We show that higher-order effects cannot eliminate the deviation between the exclusive and inclusive determinations of $V_{cb}$. Finally, utilizing the best-fit results obtained in the HQET parameterization as inputs, we predict the relevant observables, i.e., $R_{D^*}$, $F_L^{D^*}$, and $P_\tau^{D^*}$, sensitive to new physics in the $B\to D^*\ell\bar{\nu}_\ell$ decays. We conclude that lepton-universality violations still exist in the $b\to c\tau\nu$ transitions.</description>

      <title>Exploring Anomalous Flavor-Changing Neutral tqh Transitions at Future Muon Colliders: Insights from $\mu^{+}\mu^{-}\rightarrow t\bar{q}h$ Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06017v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flavour-changing neutral current (FCNC) interactions between the Higgs boson and the top quark are subject to significant suppression within the Standard Model (SM). Consequently, these interactions can only attain an observable level through the influence of Beyond the Standard Model (BSM) physics effects. It is therefore of great importance to investigate these rare interactions, both to test the limits of the Standard Model and to reveal new physical signatures.In this context, the present study analyses the signal of the process $\mu^+\mu^- \to t\bar{q}h$ and the background processes $t\bar{t}$, $tW\bar{b}$, $WWh$ and $WW$ at both in $\sqrt{s} = 1$ TeV and $\sqrt{s} = 3$ TeV energy levels. Analyses at the $1 TeV$ energy level reveal the observability of FCNC interactions even at low energy conditions and achieve the limit $\text{Br}(t \to qH) = 1.96 \times 10^{-4}$. This result corresponds to an improvement of approximately 1.5 times compared to the current limits of the ATLAS experiment, which are $3.0 \times 10^{-4}$. On the other hand, at the 3 TeV energy level, the most stringent limit was calculated under the luminosity $\mathcal{L} = 20 ab^{-1}$ , yielding a value of $\text{Br}(t \to qH) = 1.1 \times 10^{-4}$. This result coincides an improvement of approximately 3 times with respect to the current ATLAS experimental limits. The findings of the study underscore the potential of muon colliders in the search for new physics and the pivotal role they can play in the study of rare processes such as Higgs-top quark interactions. Consequently, the results are expected to provide a crucial foundation for both experimental and theoretical studies and to make a significant contribution to the search for BSM physics.</description>

      <title>Quasiparticle second-order dissipative hydrodynamics at finite chemical potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06024v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the derivation of second-order relativistic viscous hydrodynamics to incorporate the effects of baryon current, a non-vanishing chemical potential, and a realistic equation of state. Starting from a microscopic quantum theory, we employ a quasiparticle approximation to describe the evolution of hydrodynamic degrees of freedom and establish its connection to the Wigner formalism. Using methods from relativistic kinetic theory, we perform a second-order expansion to derive a closed set of equations for the components of the stress-energy tensor and the baryon current. The resulting transport coefficients, which depend on the equation of state, are obtained through a unified prescription that ensures thermodynamic consistency.</description>

      <title>Mapping spatial distributions within pseudoscalar mesons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06025v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Several aspects of the internal structure of pseudoscalar mesons, accessible through generalized parton distributions in their zero-skewness limit, are examined. These include electromagnetic and gravitational form factors related to charge and mass densities; and distributions in the impact parameter space. To this end, we employ an algebraically viable framework that is based upon the valence-quark generalized parton distribution expressed explicitly in terms of the associated distribution function and a profile function that governs the off-forward dynamics. The predominantly analytical nature of this scheme yields several algebraic results and relations while also facilitating the exploration of insightful limiting cases. With a suitable input distribution function, guided either by experiment or theory, and with an appropriate choice of the profile function, it is possible to provide testable predictions for spatial distributions of valence quarks inside pseudoscalar mesons. When comparison is possible, these predictions align well with existing experimental data as well as the findings of reliable theoretical approaches and lattice QCD.</description>

Abstract: We study the discovery potential for a light Higgs boson via $gg \to H_{\text{SM-like}} \to hh \to b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ process at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Focusing on the 2-Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM) Type-I, which can accommodate light neutral Higgs states, of $\mathcal{O}(100)$ GeV or less in mass, while agreeing with theoretical and up-to-date experimental constraints, we explore the feasibility of a light CP-even Higgs state $h$ via the largely unexplored final state $b\bar{b}\gamma\gamma$ at Run-3 of the LHC. We further propose a few Benchmark Points (BPs) for future searches.</description>

      <title>Ultralight axion or axion-like particle dark matter and 21-cm absorption signals in new physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A hypothetical particle known as the axion holds the potential to resolve both the cosmic dark matter riddle and particle physics' long-standing, strong CP dilemma. An unusually strong 21-cm absorption feature associated with the initial star formation era, i.e., the dark ages, may be due to ultralight axion dark matter ($\sim 10^{-22}$ eV) at this time. The radio wave observation's 21-cm absorption signal can be explained as either anomalous baryon cooling or anomalous cosmic microwave background photon heating. Shortly after the axions or axion-like particles (ALPs) thermalize among themselves and form a Bose-Einstein condensate, the cold dark matter ALPs make thermal contact with baryons, cooling them. ALPs are thought to be the source of some new evidence for dark matter, as the baryon temperature at cosmic dawn was lower than predicted based on presumptions. The detection of baryon acoustic oscillations is found to be consistent with baryon cooling by dark matter ALPs. Simultaneously, under the influence of the primordial black hole and/or intergalactic magnetic fields, the dark radiation composed of ALPs can resonantly transform into photons, significantly heating up the radiation in the frequency range relevant to the 21-cm tests. When examining the 21-cm cosmology at redshifts $z$ between 200 and 20, we see that, when taking into account both heating and cooling options at the same time, heating eliminated the theoretical excess number of neutrino species, $\Delta N_{eff}$, from the cooling effect.</description>

      <title>Dark photons and axion-like particles at the Electron-Ion Collider in China</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Electron-Ion Collider in China (EicC), a proposed high-luminosity facility with advanced charged particle and photon detection capabilities, provides unique opportunities to uncover new physics beyond the Standard Model. We analyze its sensitivity to dark photons produced through electron bremsstrahlung in coherent scattering. Thanks to its beam energy settings, it has the potential to comprehensively probe the previously unexplored parameter space between the constraints from meson decays and beam dumps below $\mathcal{O}(1)$ GeV with displaced-vertex search. Additionally, the EicC has the potential to probe axion-like particles (ALPs) in the mass range $ 0.1 \, \text{GeV} \lesssim m_a \lesssim 5 \, \text{GeV} $, with a coupling reach of $ \Lambda \lesssim 10^6 \, \text{GeV} $ , by combining the prompt-decay and displaced-vertex searches. The projected sensitivities to ALPs exceed the current bounds.</description>

      <title>Triple $Z'$ signatures at $Z$ factories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss triple $Z'$ boson signatures via the decay chain of $Z \to Z' \phi \to Z' Z' Z'$, with a new light scalar $\phi$, at future Z factories such as CEPC and FCC-ee. These new bosons $\phi$ and $Z'$ naturally appear in models with a new $U(1)$ gauge symmetry which is spontaneously broken and introduced in various new physics scenarios. The branching ratio of $Z \to Z' \phi \to Z' Z' Z'$ can be larger than $10^{-12}$, which gives $O(1)$ events at Tera-Z experiments, when a product of $g_X^{}$ (new gauge coupling) and $\zeta$ ($Z$-$Z'$ mixing) is larger than around $10^{-6}$. We find that the search for $Z \to Z'Z'Z'$ can significantly improve the current bound on a kinetic mixing parameter $\epsilon$ in the dark photon case, where $\epsilon \gtrsim 10^{-6}$ with $g_X^{}={\cal O}(1)$ can be explored at Tera-Z experiments. We also show that a sufficiently large number of events with multi-lepton plus hadronic jets can be obtained in benchmark points, which cannot be realized by the usual decay of Z in the standard model.</description>

      <title>Chiral phase transition and spin alignment of vector mesons with chiral imbalance in a rotating QCD medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the two-flavor NJL model under the rotation and chiral chemical potential $\mu_{5}$. Firstly, the influence of chiral imbalance on the chiral phase transition in the $T_{pc}-\omega$ plane is investigated. Research manifests that as $\mu_{5}$ increases, the critical point (CEP) of the $T_{pc}-\omega$ plane chiral phase transition will move closer to the $T$ axis. This means that the chiral chemical potential $\mu_{5}$ can significantly affect the $T_{pc}-\omega$ phase diagram and phase transition behavior. While discussing the $T_{pc}-\omega$ phase diagram, we also study the spin alignment of the $\rho$ vector meson under rotation. In the study of the spin alignment of the vector meson $\rho$, $\rho_{00}$ is the $00$ element of the spin density matrix of vector mesons. At high temperatures, $\rho_{00}$ is close to $1/3$, it indicates that the spin alignment of the vector meson $\rho$ is isotropic. It is found that increasing the chiral chemical potential $\mu_{5}$ significantly enhances $\rho_{00}$, and makes $\rho_{00}$ approaching to $1/3$ around the phase transition temperature. When rotational angular velocity is zero, $\rho_{00}$ is close to $1/3$, but as $\omega$ increases, $\rho_{00}$ significantly decreases, and deviates $1/3$, indicating that rotation can significantly cause polarization characteristics. The $\rho_{00}-r$ relationship near the phase transition temperature is studied. It is found that the farther away from the center of rotation, the lower the degree of spin polarization of the system. It is also found that the influence of chiral imbalance on the $\rho_{00}-r$ relationship is also significant.</description>

      <title>Discovery potential of charmonium $2P$ states through the $e^+e^- \to \gamma D\bar{D}$ processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06400v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the production of charmonium $2P$ states via the $e^+e^-\to \gamma D\bar{D}$ process at $\sqrt{s} = 4.23$ GeV. Using the measured cross-section data for $e^+e^-\to \gamma X(3872)$ as a reference, we calculate the cross sections for $e^+e^-\to \gamma \chi_{c0}(2P)$ and $e^+e^-\to \gamma \chi_{c2}(2P)$. Since the $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ and $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ states predominantly decay into $D\bar{D}$ final states, we also predict the corresponding $D\bar{D}$ invariant mass spectrum for the $e^+e^-\to \gamma D\bar{D}$ process. Our results indicate that $e^+e^-\to \gamma D\bar{D}$ is an ideal process for identifying the $\chi_{c0}(2P)$ and $\chi_{c2}(2P)$ states, analogous to the $\gamma\gamma\to D\bar{D}$ and $B^+\to D^+D^-K^+$ processes. This study highlights the discovery potential of charmonium $2P$ states at BESIII and Belle II.</description>

      <title>Dark-matter induced neutron-antineutron oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06434v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If dark matter carries a baryon number of two, neutron-antineutron oscillations could require its presence to manifest themselves. If it is in addition very light, in the micro-eV range or up to a few orders of magnitude below, these oscillations could even exhibit a Rabi resonance. Though the magnetic tuning required to convert a macroscopic number of neutrons into antineutrons is not realistic, sizeable enhancements remain possible. Building on this observation, axionic realizations for this scenario are systematically analyzed. For true QCD axion models, we find that the Goldstone boson nature of the axion imposes the presence of axionless n-nbar mixing effects, either in vacuum or in decays, which are sufficiently constrained experimentally to leave no room for axion-induced oscillations. Thus, a generic scalar or axion-like dark matter background would have to exist to induce resonant n-nbar oscillations. Yet, if Nature has taken that path to relate dark matter and baryon number violation, the experimental signature would be striking and certainly worth pursuing.</description>

      <title>Scalar resonance contributions in the $D_{s1}(2460)^{+} \rightarrow D_{s}^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the newly observed $T_{c\bar{s}}$ state in the $D_{s1}(2460)^{+} \rightarrow D_{s}^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ reaction by the LHCb Collaboration, we investigate the amplitude in this decay to explore the origin and properties of this open-charm tetraquark state based on the final state interaction. The invariant mass distributions of $D_{s}^{+}\pi^{+}$ and $\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ are well reproduced by the $S$-wave scattering amplitudes of the coupled channel systems $D_{s}\pi$ and $\pi\pi$. However, either only the tree-level contribution nor both the tree-level and $\pi\pi$ coupled channel scattering contributions can not to describe the experimental data well, which indicates that the $D_{s}\pi$ coupled channel scattering is required. We find the $T_{c\bar{s}}$ and $f_{0}(500)$ resonances are dynamically generated from the pseudoscalar-pseudoscalar meson interaction within the chiral unitary approach. In addition, we find the corresponding poles and also calculate the $S$-wave scattering length for the $DK$ channel, which is on the same scale as the result extracted from the experiment. It is reliable that the $T_{c\bar{s}}$ and $f_{0}(500)$ resonances in the $D_{s1}(2460)^{+} \rightarrow D_{s}^{+}\pi^{+}\pi^{-}$ reaction are molecular type particles.</description>

Abstract: Accessing a full picture of the internal structure of hadrons would be a key topic of hadron physics, with the main motivation to study the strong interaction binding the visible matter. Furthermore, the underlying structure of known exotic states remains an unresolved fundamental issue in hadron physics, which is currently being addressed by hadron physics community. It is well known that electromagnetic characteristics can serve as a distinguishing feature for states whose internal structures are complex and not yet fully understood. The aim of this study is to determine the magnetic moments of vector hidden-charm tetraquark states by making use of QCD light-cone sum rules. In order to achieve this objective, the states mentioned above are considered in terms of the diquark-antidiquark structure. Subsequently, a comprehensive examination is conducted, with four distinct interpolating currents being given particular consideration, as these have the potential to couple with the aforementioned states. It has been observed that there are considerable discrepancies between the magnetic moment results extracted employing different diquark-antidiquark structures. Such a prediction may be interpreted as the possibility of more than one tetraquark with the identical quantum numbers and similar quark constituents, but with different magnetic moments. The numerical predictions yielded have led to the conclusion that the magnetic moments of the vector hidden-charm tetraquark states are capable of projecting the inner structure of these states, which may then be used to determine their quark-gluon structure and quantum numbers. In order to provide a comprehensive analysis, the individual quark contributions to the magnetic moments are also examined.</description>

      <title>Jet momentum reconstruction in the QGP background with machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply a Dense Neural Network (DNN) approach to reconstruct jet momentum within a quark-gluon plasma (QGP) background, using simulated data from PYTHIA and Linear Boltzmann Transport (LBT) Models for comparative analysis. We find that medium response particles from the LBT simulation, scattered out of the QGP background but belonging to medium-modified jets, can inevitably lead to oversubtraction of the background if the DNN model is trained on vacuum jets from PYTHIA simulation. By training the DNN model on quenched jets generated using the LBT model, we significantly reduce this prediction bias and achieve more accurate background subtraction compared to conventional Area-based and Constituent Subtraction methods widely adopted in experimental measurements. Additionally, we develop a matching procedure to pair reconstructed jets inside a background to their counterparts reconstructed without the background, further improving the reliability of ML models in background subtraction, and therefore enabling an accurate capture of the jet quenching effect and a precise estimation of the nuclear modification factor of jets in high-energy nuclear collisions.</description>

      <title>Verification of the Tenth-Order QED Contribution to the Anomalous Magnetic Moment of the Electron from Diagrams without Fermion Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A discrepancy of approximately 5$\sigma$ exists between the two known results for the tenth-order QED contribution to the anomalous magnetic moment of the electron, calculated from Feynman vertex diagrams without fermion loops. To investigate this, we decomposed this contribution into 389 parts based on a self-energy diagram representation, enabling a diagram-by-diagram numerical comparison of the two calculations. No significant discrepancies were found for individual diagrams. However, the numerical differences of the 98 diagrams sharing a common structure were not randomly distributed. The accumulation of these differences resulted in the 5$\sigma$ discrepancy. A recalculation with increased statistics in the Monte Carlo integration was performed for these 98 diagrams, resolving the discrepancy.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06504v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the implementation of a new interface in VBFNLO 3.0 supporting all di-boson and tri-boson processes with fully leptonic final states, enabling NLO+PS matched calculations. To demonstrate its capabilities, we study parton shower effects in the tri-boson production process $p p \rightarrow e^{+} \nu_e \mu^{-} \bar{\nu}_{\mu} \gamma + X$ using Herwig 7.3 with NLO QCD amplitudes from VBFNLO 3.0. We estimate uncertainties from scale variations and analyze the impact of generation-level cuts on parton shower events. This study showcases the new interface's potential and provides insights into the interplay between fixed-order calculations and parton shower effects in multi-boson production processes, crucial for precision measurements and BSM searches at the LHC and future colliders.</description>

      <title>Top observables as precise probes of the ALP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measurements of the top quark by the ATLAS and CMS experiments go beyond testing the Standard Model (SM) with high precision. Axion-like particles (ALPs), a potential SM extension involving new pseudoscalar particles, exhibit strong interactions with heavy SM fermions. Consequently, they can significantly affect the kinematic distributions of top quarks in top-antitop pair production. Moreover, such strong interactions can induce other ALP couplings at low energies, leading to a rich phenomenology. We summarize recent developments in probing the ALP-top coupling and use LHC data from run 2 to constrain the ALP parameter space.</description>

      <title>Transition form factors of the $\Lambda_b \rightarrow \Lambda(1520)$ in QCD light-cone sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the transition form factors for $\Lambda_b\rightarrow{\Lambda(1520)}$ within the framework of light-cone sum rules (LCSR), using the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs) of the $\Lambda_b$-baryon. In the hadronic representation of the correlation function, we carefully select the appropriate Lorentz structures and isolate the contributions from both the $\Lambda(1520)(J^P=(3/2)^-)$ and the $\Lambda(1890)(J^P=(3/2)^+)$, ensuring that the form factors for $\Lambda_b\rightarrow{\Lambda(1520)}$ can be calculated unambiguously. We also provide predictions for various physical observables in the decay $\Lambda_b\rightarrow{\Lambda(1520)}l^+l^-$, including the differential branching fraction, the lepton-side forward-backward asymmetry, the longitudinal polarization fraction, and the CP-averaged normalized angular observable. Our prediction for the differential branching fraction of $\Lambda_b\rightarrow{\Lambda(1520)}\mu^+\mu^-$ is in good agreement with the LHCb measurement within the uncertainties.</description>

      <title>Full-colour double-virtual amplitudes for associated production of a Higgs boson with a bottom-quark pair at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the double-virtual amplitudes contributing to the production of a Higgs boson in association with a $b\bar{b}$ pair at the Large Hadron Collider. We perform the computation within the five-flavour scheme, which employs massless bottom quarks and finite bottom-Yukawa coupling, taking into account all the colour structures. We derive the analytic form of the helicity amplitudes through finite-field reconstruction techniques. The analytic expressions have been implemented in a public C++ library, and we demonstrate that evaluations are sufficiently stable and efficient for use in phenomenological studies.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06580v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This contribution lists challenges of Monte Carlo event generators for future lepton, especially linear colliders. A lot of the recent development benefits from the achievements at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), but several aspects are unique for lepton colliders like beam simulation, polarization, electroweak higher order corrections and resummed QED corrections. We will describe the status of multi-purpose event generators and specialized codes and outline the challenges for these tools until such a collider starts data taking.</description>

      <title>Event-by-event investigation of the kaon pair-source function with EPOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In high-energy collisions, we can obtain information about the source function by measuring the two-particle Bose-Einstein correlation function and considering its relationship with the phase-space density of the particle-emitting source. While a Gaussian shape is commonly assumed, measurements and anomalous diffusion suggest L\'evy-stable distributions, as observed in the PHENIX experiment for kaon-kaon pair-source functions. Event generators like EPOS allow direct investigation of freeze-out coordinates, facilitating the analysis of the source function. EPOS, a Monte Carlo-based model, simulates high-energy nuclear and particle collisions, integrating Parton-Based Gribov-Regge theory for initial evolution, subsequent hydrodynamic evolution, and hadronization. In this paper, we present an event-by-event analysis of the kaon source function in $\sqrt{s_\text{NN}}$ = 200 GeV Au+Au collisions using the EPOS model.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Freeze-In during Warm Inflation and the Seesaw Mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06778v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A compelling way to address the inflationary period is via the warm inflation scenario, where the interaction of the inflaton field with other degrees of freedom affects its dynamics in such a way that slow-roll inflation is maintained by dissipative effects in a thermal bath. In this context, if a dark matter particle is coupled to the bath due to non-renormalizable interactions, the observed dark matter abundance may be produced during warm inflation via ultra-violet freeze-in. In this work, we propose applying this scenario in the framework of a $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model of Particle Physics, where we also employ the seesaw mechanism for generating neutrino masses.</description>

      <title>Clear skies ahead: characterizing atmospheric gravity gradient noise for vertical atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05379v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial long-baseline atom interferometer experiments are emerging as powerful tools for probing new fundamental physics, including searches for dark matter and gravitational waves. In the frequency range relevant to these signals, gravity gradient noise (GGN) poses a significant challenge. While previous studies for vertical instruments have focused on GGN induced by seismic waves, atmospheric fluctuations in pressure and temperature also lead to variations in local gravity. In this work, we advance the understanding of atmospheric GGN in vertical atom interferometers, formulating a robust characterization of its impact. We evaluate the effectiveness of underground placement of atom interferometers as a passive noise mitigation strategy. Additionally, we empirically derive global high- and low-noise models for atmospheric pressure GGN and estimate an analogous range for atmospheric temperature GGN. To highlight the variability of temperature-induced noise, we compare data from two prospective experimental sites. Our findings establish atmospheric GGN as comparable to seismic noise in its impact and underscore the importance of including these effects in site selection and active noise monitoring for future experiments.</description>

      <title>The Status of Neutrino Cosmology: Standard $\Lambda$CDM, Extensions, and Tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the performance of the six-parameter $\Lambda$CDM model and its extensions in light of recent cosmological observations, with particular focus on neutrino properties inferred from cosmology. Using a broad suite of nine combinations of datasets, with three separate analyses of the Planck Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data, and three separate supernovae (SNe) survey data, plus the recent DESI baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale results, we derive constraints on the sum of neutrino masses ($\Sigma m_\nu$). Our results show upper limits in the range of $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 76.9\,\mathrm{meV}$ to $\Sigma m_\nu &lt; 108\,\mathrm{meV}$ (95\% CL). The variation in the limits on $\Sigma m_\nu$ arises from the separate analyses of the Planck CMB data and the separate supernovae datasets, as they relate to the inferred matter density and its relation to the sensitivity of the BAO scale and CMB lensing to $\Sigma m_\nu$. In the context of hierarchical mass models in $\Lambda$CDM, we find a $1.47\sigma$ preference for normal ordering (NO) over inverted ordering (IO), with similar values of preference across all datasets. Despite the strong constraints, an inclination towards massless neutrinos over NO remains weak at $1.36\sigma$. We find that a ``negative'' neutrino mass, inferred from the shape of the likelihood in the physical regime, $\Sigma m_\nu &gt; 0$, is only present at less than $2\sigma$. We confirm that models allowing extra relativistic degrees of freedom, with $N_{\rm eff} \approx 3.5$, alleviate the Hubble tension. Significantly, we find a $3.3\sigma$ preference for a 0.1 eV partially thermalized sterile neutrino when the SH0ES $H_0$ measurement is included, a scale of interest in short-baseline oscillation experiment results.

      <description>arXiv:2412.05458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider SU(2) gauge theory with a scalar field in the fundamental representation. The model is known to contain electric field solutions sourced by the scalar field that are distinct from embedded Maxwell electric fields. We examine the perturbative stability of the solution and identify a region of parameter space where the solution is stable. In the regime where the scalar field has a negative mass squared, the solution has two branches and we identify an instability in one of the branches.</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian formalism for Bose excitations in a plasma with a non-Abelian interaction II: plasmon - hard particle scattering and energy loss</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is shown that the Hamiltonian formalism proposed previously in [1] to describe the nonlinear dynamics of only {\it soft} fermionic and bosonic excitations contains much more information than initially assumed. In this paper, we have demonstrated in detail that it also proved to be very appropriate and powerful in describing a wide range of other physical phenomena, including the scattering of colorless plasmons off {\it hard} thermal (or external) color-charged particles moving in hot quark-gluon plasma. A generalization of the Poisson superbracket including both anticommuting variables for hard modes and normal variables of the soft Bose field, is presented for the case of a continuous medium. The corresponding Hamilton equations are defined, and the most general form of the third- and fourth-order interaction Hamiltonians is written out in terms of the normal boson field variables and hard momentum modes of the quark-gluon plasma. The canonical transformations involving both bosonic and hard mode degrees of freedom of the system under consideration, are discussed. The canonicity conditions for these transformations based on the Poisson superbracket, are derived. The most general structure of canonical transformations in the form of integro-power series up to sixth order in a new normal field variable and a new hard mode variable, is presented. For the hard momentum mode of quark-gluon plasma excitations, an ansatz separating the color and momentum degrees of freedom, is proposed. The question of approximation of the total effective scattering amplitude when the momenta of hard excitations are much larger than those of soft excitations of the plasma, is considered. An application of the developed Hamilton theory to the problem of calculating energy loss of an energetic color particle propagating through a hot QCD-medium, is considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $\psi(3770)$ and $\Upsilon(4S)$ states predominantly decay into open-flavor meson pairs, while the decays of $\psi(3770) \to non-D\bar{D}$ and $\Upsilon(4S) \to non-B\bar{B}$ are rare but crucial for elucidating the inner structure and decay dynamics of heavy quarkonium states. To achieve precise branching fraction measurements for the $\psi(3770) \to non-D\bar{D}$ and $\Upsilon(4S) \to non-B\bar{B}$ decays at the high luminosity $e^+e^-$ annihilation experiments, we employed Monte Carlo simulations and Fisher information to evaluate various data taking scenarios, ultimately determining the optimal scheme. The consistent results of both methodologies indicate that the optimal energy points for $\psi(3770) \to non-D\bar{D}$ decays are 3.769 GeV and 3.781 GeV, while those for $\Upsilon(4S) \to non-B\bar{B}$ decays are 10.574 GeV and 10.585 GeV. In addition, we provide an analysis of the relationship between the integrated luminosity and the precision in branching fraction measurements derived from these data samples, with the branching fraction spanning several orders of magnitude.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the longitudinal spin polarization of a relativistic fluid of massive spin-1/2 particles undergoing a boost-invariant expansion in the longitudinal direction and rotating in the transverse plane. We express the polarization vector in terms of spin moments and derive closed equations of motion for the latter using spin kinetic theory with a nonlocal relaxation time approximation. These equations of motion are valid at any time of the evolution, from the free-streaming regime to the hydrodynamic regime. At late time, the polarization features contributions from gradients of the fluid velocity and of the temperature, that emerge from the nonlocal part of the collision term. Our results can be used to explore polarization phenomena in the context of heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Testing for isospin symmetry breaking with extensive calculations of isotope shift factors in potassium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05932v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise evaluation of the isotope shift (IS) factors for seven low-lying potassium (K) states is achieved using relativistic coupled-cluster (RCC) theory. The energies of these states are assessed and compared with experimental data to confirm the accuracy of the wave functions calculated at varying RCC theory approximations and highlight the significance of many-body and relativistic effects in determining the energies and IS factors of K. Various methods are used to compute the IS factors, with the finite-field (FF) approach yielding results that align with observed and semi-empirical data. This consistency is attributed to orbital relaxation effects that are naturally present in the FF method but emerge only through complex interactions in other techniques. Using the IS factors derived from FF, we review the mean square radius difference between $^{38m}$K and $^{39}$K. From this difference and muonic atom x-ray spectroscopy, we deduce the absolute radius of $^{38m}$K using an updated calculation of the nuclear polarizability effect. Finally, we evaluate the isospin symmetry breaking (ISB) in this isotriplet by integrating the radius of $^{38m}$K with an updated radius of $^{38}$Ca, concluding that the ISB is compatible with zero. This finding offers a stringent benchmark for nuclear model calculations of ISB corrections in nuclear beta decay, which play a key role in determining the $V_{ud}$ matrix element.</description>

      <title>Identifying weak critical fluctuations of intermittency in heavy-ion collisions with topological machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06151v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large density fluctuations of conserved charges have been proposed as a promising signature for exploring the QCD critical point in heavy-ion collisions. These fluctuations are expected to exhibit a fractal or scale-invariant behavior, which can be probed by intermittency analysis. Recent high-energy experimental studies reveal that the signal of critical fluctuations related to intermittency is very weak and thus could be easily obscured by the overwhelming background particles in the data sample. Employing a point cloud neural network with topological machine learning, we can successfully classify weak signal events from background noise by the extracted distinct topological features, and accurately determine the intermittency index for weak signal event samples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.06297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent results from the ATLAS and CMS experiments in searches for prompt signatures of feebly interacting particles are presented. All presented results are based on the 2015-2018 data set of $13\,\mathrm{TeV}$ proton-proton collisions, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of about $140\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$. The discussed models include dark mesons, heavy neutral leptons, dark matter, and dark photons. The obtained exclusion limits significantly extend the probed parameter space and, in some cases, provide the first collider-based constraints for the considered models.</description>

      <title>Aspects of supersymmetry breaking driven inflation in orbifold models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider gravitationally induced corrections to inflaton potentials driven by supersymmetry breaking in a five-dimensional supergravity, compactified on a $ S_1/Z_2 $ orbifold. The supersymmetry breaking takes place on the hidden brane and is transmitted to the visible brane through finite one loop graphs giving rise to an inflaton potential which includes gravitationally induced terms. These corrections are significant for inflationary cosmology and have the potential to modify the predictions of widely studied supergravity models if the latter are embedded in this framework. To explore these effects we examine two classes of models those inspired by no-scale supergravity models and $\alpha$-attractors. Both models are compatible with current cosmological observations but face chalenges in reconciling enhanced values for the scalar power spectrum $ P_\zeta$ with cosmological data, particularly regarding the tensor to scalar ratio $r$. In fact $ P_\zeta \gtrsim 10^{-2}$ results to $ r &gt; \mathcal{O} (0.1) $, outside the limits put by current data.</description>

      <title>Revise the Dark Matter-Phantom Scalar Field Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06501v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cosmological history and evolution are examined for gravitational models with interaction in the dark sector of the universe. In particular, we consider the dark energy to be described by a phantom scalar field and the dark matter $\rho _{m}$ as a pressureless ideal gas. We introduce the interacting function $Q=\beta \left( t\right) \rho_{m}$, where the function $% \beta \left( t\right) $ is considered to be proportional to $\dot{\phi}, \dot{\phi}^{2}H^{-1},~H$, or a constant parameter with dimensions of $\left[H_{0}\right] $. For the four interacting models, we study in details the phase space by calculating the stationary points. The latter are applied to reconstruct the cosmological evolution. Compactified variables are essential to understand the complete picture of the phase space and to conclude about the cosmological viability of these interacting models. The detailed analysis is performed for the exponential potential $V\left( \phi \right) =V_{0}e^{\lambda \phi }$. The effects of other scalar field potential functions on the cosmological dynamics are examined.</description>

      <title>Prediction of an $I(J^{P})=0(1^{-})$ $\bar{b}\bar{b}ud$ Tetraquark Resonance Close to the $B^\ast B^\ast$ Threshold Using Lattice QCD Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use antistatic-antistatic potentials computed with lattice QCD and a coupled-channel Born-Oppenheimer approach to explore the existence of a $\bar{b} \bar{b} u d$ tetraquark resonance with quantum numbers $I(J^P) = 0(1^-)$. A pole in the $\mbox{T}$ matrix signals a resonance with mass $m = 2 m_B + 94.0^{+1.3}_{-5.4} \, \text{MeV}$ and decay width $\Gamma = 140^{+86}_{-66} \, \text{MeV}$, i.e. very close to the $B^\ast B^\ast$ threshold. We also compute branching ratios, which clearly indicate that this resonance is mainly composed of a $B^\ast B^\ast$ meson pair with a significantly smaller $B B$ contribution. By varying the potential matrix responsible for the coupling of the $B B$ and the $B^\ast B^\ast$ channel as well as the $b$ quark mass, we provide additional insights and understanding concerning the formation and existence of the resonance. We also comment on the importance of our findings and the main takeaways for a possible future full lattice QCD investigation of this $I(J^P) = 0(1^-)$ $\bar{b} \bar{b} u d$ tetraquark resonance.</description>

      <title>How Well Do We Know the Scalar-Induced Gravitational Waves?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06764v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gravitational waves sourced by amplified scalar perturbations are a common prediction across a wide range of cosmological models. These scalar curvature fluctuations are inherently nonlinear and typically non-Gaussian. We argue that the effects of non-Gaussianity may not always be adequately captured by an expansion around a Gaussian field, expressed through nonlinear parameters such as $f_{\rm{NL}}$. As a consequence, the resulting amplitude of the stochastic gravitational wave background may differ significantly from predictions based on the standard quadratic source model routinely used in the literature.</description>

      <title>Probing Electroweak Phase Transition in Extended Singlet Scalar Model with Resonant $HH$ production in $bbZZ$ Channel using Parameterized Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.04191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a collider signature of a heavy Higgs boson at $14$ TeV HL-LHC is studied, where the heavy Higgs boson decays into a pair of standard model Higgs boson, which further decays to $bbZZ$ state and subsequently to $bb\ell^{+} \ell^{-}\nu_{\ell} \nu_{\ell}$ final state. To study this, we consider singlet scalar extension of the standard model and select the parameter space and mass of the heavy Higgs boson such that it prefers a strong first-order electroweak phase transition. The study is done following the $bbZZ$ analysis of CMS Collaboration and further using parameterized machine learning for final discrimination which simplifies the training process along with an improved discrimination between signal and background over the range of benchmark points. Despite the lower branching fraction, this channel can be a potential probe of the electroweak phase transition with the data sets collected by the CMS and ATLAS experiments at the $14$ TeV HL-LHC with $3$ $\rm{ab}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity and a production of resonant di-Higgs signal can be potentially discovered up to 490 GeV of resonance mass.</description>

      <title>On the Relations between Fermion Masses and Isospin Couplings in the Microscopic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.04680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.04680v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quark and lepton masses and mixings are considered in the framework of the microscopic model. The most general ansatz for the interactions among tetrons leads to a Hamiltonian $H_T$ involving Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM), Heisenberg and torsional isospin forces. Diagonalization of the Hamiltonian provides for 24 eigenvalues which are identified as the quark and lepton masses. While the masses of the third and second family arise from DM and Heisenberg type of isospin interactions, light family masses are related to torsional interactions among tetrons. Neutrino masses turn out to be special in that they are given in terms of tiny isospin non-conserving DM, Heisenberg and torsional couplings. The approach not only leads to masses, but also allows to calculate the quark and lepton eigenstates, an issue, which is important for the determination of the CKM and PMNS mixing matrices. Compact expressions for the eigenfunctions of $H_T$ are given. The almost exact isospin conservation of the system dictates the form of the lepton states and makes them independent of all the couplings in $H_T$. Much in contrast, there is a strong dependence of the quark states on the coupling strengths, and a promising hierarchy between the quark families shows up.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter production during Warm Inflation via Freeze-In</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.17371v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel perspective on the role of inflation in the production of Dark Matter (DM). Specifically, we explore the DM production during Warm Inflation via ultraviolet Freeze-In (WIFI). We demonstrate that in a Warm Inflation (WI) setting the persistent thermal bath, sustained by the dissipative interactions with the inflaton field, can source a sizable DM abundance via the non-renormalizable interactions that connect the DM with the bath. Compared to the (conventional) radiation-dominated (RD) UV freeze-in scenario for the same reheat temperature (after inflation), the resulting DM yield in WIFI is always enhanced showing a strongly positive dependence on the mass dimension of the non-renormalizable operator. Of particular interest, for a sufficiently large mass dimension of the operator, the entirety of the DM abundance of the Universe can be created during the inflationary phase. For the specific models we study, we find that the enhancement in DM yield, relative to RD UV freeze-in, is at least an order of magnitude for an operator of mass dimension 5, and as large as 18 order of magnitudes for an operator of mass dimension 10. Our findings also suggest a broader applicability for producing other cosmological relics, which may have a substantial impact on the evolution of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Gauged U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ Models via $Z-Z'$ Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that the model based on U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ gauge symmetry can explain not only the discrepancy between the measured value of muon $g-2$ and the theoretical prediction, but also the structure of the neutrino mass and mixings. We revisit the analysis of the mass matrix structure in the minimal U(1)$_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ models based on the latest experimental result, where the minimal stands for the symmetry breaking caused only by a single scalar field. We find that the model called type ${\bf 2}_{+1}$, where an SU(2)$_L$ doublet scalar $\Phi_{+1}$ with the U(1)$_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ charge $+1$ and the hypercharge $+1/2$, predicts the $\bf B_3$ texture and is marginally acceptable under the current neutrino oscillation data and cosmological observation. When the U(1)$_{L_\mu - L_\tau}$ gauge symmetry is broken by the vacuum expectation value of the standard model non-singlet representation such as $\Phi_{+1}$, there are additional contributions to the flavor-changing meson decay process and atomic parity violation via the $Z-Z'$ mixing. We newly evaluate the model-dependent constraints on the model and conclude that the type ${\bf 2}_{+1}$ model is robustly ruled out. The model is extended to have an additional vacuum expectation value of a standard model singlet scalar in order to avoid the stringent constraint from the flavor-changing meson decay. Finally, we find the allowed range of the ratio of these vacuum expectation values.</description>

Abstract: This study investigates the production of open-charm pentaquark molecular states, specifically $N\bar{D}^*$ and $\bar{N}\bar{D}^*$, within the $B^0 \rightarrow \bar{D}^0 p \bar{p}$ decay. We examine the invariant mass spectra of $p\bar{D}^0$ and $\bar{p}\bar{D}^0$, incorporating the rescattering process through a quasipotential Bethe-Salpeter equation approach. Our findings suggest the possible identification of the isoscalar $\bar{N}\bar{D}^*$ molecule with $3/2^+$ as the antiparticle partner of $\Lambda_c(2940)$ in the $\bar{p}\bar{D}^0$ mass spectrum. Although a molecular state near the $\bar{N}\bar{D}$ threshold with $1/2^-$ exists, its signal is weak, indicating that the $B^0 \rightarrow \bar{D}^0 p \bar{p}$ decay may not be ideal for its detection. A distinct signal of the isovector $N\bar{D}^*$ molecule with $1/2^-$ may appear in the $p\bar{D}^0$ invariant mass spectrum, while the signal for the $3/2^-$ state remains very weak. We emphasize the importance of the three-body decay of the bottom meson as a valuable method for studying open-charm molecules and advocate for increased attention and more precise experimental measurements of the $B^0 \rightarrow \bar{D}^0 p \bar{p}$ decay.</description>

      <title>Axi-Majoron : One-shot solution to most of the big puzzles of particle cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08675v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The details of the minimal cosmological standard model (MCSM) proposed in [arXiv:2403.05390.] are discussed. The model is based on the scale-symmetry and the global Peccei-Quinn(PQ) symmetry with a key assumption that the latter is broken only in the gravity sector in a scale-invariant manner. We show that the model provides a quite simple unified framework for the unknown history of the Universe from inflation to the epoch of big-bang nucleosynthesis, simultaneously addressing key puzzles of high energy theory and cosmology: (i) the origin of scales, (ii) primordial inflation, (iii) matter-antimatter asymmetry, (iv) tiny neutrino masses, (v) dark matter, and (vi) the strong \textit{CP}-problem. Scale symmetry can be exact, and the Planck scale is dynamically generated. The presence of Gauss-Bonnet term may safely retain dangerous nonperturbative symmetry-breaking effects negligible, allowing a large-field trans-Planckian inflation along the PQ-field. Isocurvature perturbations of axi-Majorons are suppressed. A sizable amount of PQ-number asymmetry is generated at the end of inflation, and conserved afterwards. Domain wall problem is absent due to the nonrestoration of the symmetry and the nonzero PQ-number asymmetry. Baryogenesis can be realized by either the transfer of the PQ-number asymmetry through the seesaw sector, or by resonant leptogenesis. Dark matter is purely cold axi-Majorons from the mis-alignment contribution with the symmetry-breaking scale of $\mathcal{O}(10^{12}) {\rm GeV}$. Hot axi-Majorons from the decay of the inflaton become a natural source for a sizable amount of dark radiation. Inflationary gravitational waves have information about the mass parameters of the lightest left-handed and right-handed neutrinos, thanks to the presence of an early matter-domination era driven by the long-lived lightest right-handed neutrino species.</description>

      <title>Fast flavor conversions at the edge of instability in a two-beam model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A dense neutrino gas exhibiting angular crossings in the electron lepton number is unstable and develops fast flavor conversions. Instead of assuming an unstable configuration from the onset, we imagine that the system is externally driven toward instability. We use the simplest model of two neutrino beams initially of different flavor that either suddenly appear or one or both slowly build up. Flavor conversions commence well before the putative unstable state is fully attained, and the final outcome depends on how the system is driven. The system generally sticks to the closest state that is linearly stable, a conclusion that we prove for the first time using quasilinear theory. Our results suggest that in an astrophysical setting, one should focus less on flavor instabilities in the neutrino radiation field and more on the external dynamics that leads to the formation of the unstable state.</description>

Abstract: We revisited the computation of the cross section for the $\mu^+\mu^+\to \ell^+\ell^{+}$ $(\ell^+=\tau^+,\, e^+)$ transitions in the presence of new heavy Majorana neutrinos. We focus on scenarios where the masses of the new states are around some few TeV, the so-called low-scale seesaw models. Our analysis is set in a simple model with only two new heavy Majorana neutrinos considering the current limits on the heavy-light mixings. Our results illustrate the difference between the genuine effects of two nondegenerate heavy Majorana states and the degenerate case where they form a Dirac singlet field.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive analysis of the minimal eclectic flavor group $Q_{8}\rtimes S_3$ which is isomorphic to $GL(2,3)$, and all its irreducible representations are induced from the irreducible representations of $Q_{8}$ and $S_{3}$. The consistency conditions between EFG and generalized CP (gCP) symmetry are revisited, and we find the gCP symmetry compatible with the minimal EFG $Q_{8}\rtimes S_3$. The most general forms of K\"ahler potential and superpotential based on $Q_{8}\rtimes S_3$ are discussed, and the corresponding fermion mass matrices are presented. A concrete lepton model invariant under $Q_{8}\rtimes S_3$ and gCP is constructed, in which the experimental data of all six lepton masses and six mixing parameters can be successfully described through seven real input parameters. The model predicts a vanishing effective mass $m_{\beta\beta}$ in neutrinoless double beta decay.</description>

Abstract: In this study, the transverse momentum spectra of $k ^{\pm }$, $\pi ^{\pm }$ and $p(\bar{p})$ particles in mid-rapidity ($\left | y \right | &lt; 0.1$) for nine centrality classes are investigated in $^{238} U$+$^{238} U$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$=193 GeV within the cascade and soft momentum-dependent equation of state (SM-EoS) mode of the UrQMD model. Other extracted observable from $p_{T}$ spectrum includes average transverse momentum ($\left \langle p_{T} \right \rangle$), the yield ($dN/dy$) as well as the ratio of particle type are also shown in function of collision centrality. It is found that the U+U collision process is segmented. Before the collision centrality is $50-60\%$, the experimental data are described well using cascade mode when the $p_{T} &lt; 1.2 GeV/c$. The results are in good agreement with the experimental data using the SM-EoS mode at $p_{T} &gt; 1.2 GeV/c$. For the case of $60-80\%$ centrality, the SM-EoS mode describes the data better. At RHIC energy, pair production is the dominant production mechanism for particles, with the anti-ion to ion yield ratio suggesting.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the parameters of the neutrino extension of the Standard Model</title>

Abstract: Heavy neutral leptons (HNLs) are hypothetical particles proposed as a potential explanation for neutrino oscillations and the generation of the baryon asymmetry in the Universe. This paper focuses on HNLs with masses significantly above the electroweak scale. It is challenging to test for the presence of such particles directly. However, they leave behind effective interactions of Standard Model particles, leading in particular to charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV) processes. Non-observation of cLFV processes puts therefore constraints on the parameters of the HNLs. In this paper, we find the relations between the effective operators in the realistic case when neutrino masses are non-zero and the HNLs are non-degenerate. This allows us to strengthen the existing cLFV constraints. We also link the baryon asymmetry of the Universe to the same higher-dimensional effective operators, providing complementary bounds on these parameters.</description>

Abstract: Constituent quarks in a nucleon are the essential elements in the standard ``quark model" associated with the electric charge, spin, mass, and baryon number of a nucleon. Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) describes nucleon as a composite object containing current quarks (valence quarks and sea (anti-)quarks) and gluons. These subatomic elements and their interactions are known to contribute in complex ways to the overall nucleon spin and mass. In the early development of QCD theory in the 1970s, an alternative hypothesis postulated that the baryon number might manifest itself through a non-perturbative configuration of gluon fields forming a Y-shaped topology known as the gluon junction. In this work, we propose to test such hypothesis by measuring (i) the Regge intercept of the net-baryon distributions for $e$+($p$)Au collisions, (ii) baryon and charge transport in the isobaric ratio between $e$+Ru and $e$+Zr collisions, and (iii) target flavor dependence of proton and antiproton yields at large rapidity, transported from the hydrogen and deuterium targets in $e+p$(d) collisions. Our study indicates that these measurements at the EIC can help determine what carries the baryon number.</description>

      <title>How to unravel the nature of the $\Sigma^*(1430) (1/2^-)$ state from correlation functions</title>

Abstract: We calculate the correlation functions for the $\bar K^0 p, \pi^+ \Sigma^0, \pi^0 \Sigma^+, \pi^+ \Lambda$, and $\eta \Sigma^+$ states, which in the chiral unitary approach predict an excited $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ state at the $\bar K N$ threshold, recently observed by the Belle Collaboration. Once this is done, we tackle the inverse problem of seeing how much information one can obtain from these correlation functions. With the resampling method, one can determine the scattering parameters of all the channels with relative precision by means of the analysis in a general framework, and find a clear cusplike structure corresponding to the $\Sigma^*(1/2^-)$ in the different amplitudes at the $\bar{K}N$ threshold.</description>

      <title>Interplay and Correlations Between Quark and Lepton Observables in Modular Symmetry Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a predictive modular invariant theory of flavour there should exist correlations between the quark and lepton observables. So far these observables have been analyzed separately, making it impossible to investigate their interconnections. We perform for the first time a joint analysis of quark and lepton observables (22 altogether) in a modular flavour model. The model is based on $2O$ flavour symmetry and, within its class, it is characterized by the minimal number of free parameters (14 real constants). The joint analysis shows that the model is in good agreement with the experimental data for normal neutrino mass ordering, while predicting the leptonic Dirac CP-violating (CPV) phase ($\delta_{CP}$), the two Majorana CPV phases ($\eta_1$, $\eta_2$), the lightest neutrino mass ($m_1$) and the effective neutrino masses probed by beta and neutrinoless double beta decay ($m_\beta$ and $m_{\beta\beta}$). A detailed comparison of the separate (lepton-only and quark-only) and combined (lepton and quark) fit results shows differences in best-fit values and jointly allowed regions, that reflect a nontrivial interplay between quark and lepton observables in the model. Most importantly, our analysis highlights the existence of significant correlations between various pairs of such observables. For instance, the ratio of the strange and bottom quark masses, $r_{sb}$, is strongly negatively correlated with each of the three lepton mixing angles and with $\delta_{CP}$, $m_1$, $m_\beta$ and $m_{\beta\beta}$, while being positively correlated with $\eta_1$ and $\eta_2$. These findings, that are missed in separate analyses of quark and lepton flavour sectors, fall within ranges that can be tested by current and future experiments.</description>

      <title>Looping Around Neutrino Charge Radius at Ultra-Near Reactor Experiments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.00107v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We scrutinize the potential of upcoming ultra-near reactor neutrino experiments to detect radiative corrections in the elastic neutrino-electron scattering channel, focusing on the JUNO-TAO and CLOUD detectors, which employ advanced scintillator detection technologies. Previous reactor experiments have already constrained the electron neutrino charge radius, which is a neutrino property associated with a certain subset of the total radiative corrections, and have achieved limits that are only about an order of magnitude away from the Standard Model prediction. Our study demonstrates that JUNO-TAO and CLOUD could discover the neutrino charge radius in the near future, considering the established treatment of the charge radius. However, we show that it is necessary to go beyond this standard treatment. By including the complete set of one-loop level radiative corrections, we find a partial cancellation with the charge radius effect, reducing the experimental sensitivity to this quantity. Nevertheless, JUNO-TAO and CLOUD still have the potential to achieve a $5\sigma$ discovery but over longer timescales within a reasonable operational timeframe.</description>

      <title>Imprints of Early Universe Cosmology on Gravitational Waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09757v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential of gravitational waves (GWs) to probe the pre-BBN era of the early universe, focusing on the effects of energy injection. Specifically, we examine a hidden sector alongside the Standard Model that undergoes a strong first-order phase transition (FOPT), producing a GW signal. Once the phase transition has completed, energy injection initiates reheating in the hidden sector, which positions the hidden sector field so that additional phase transitions can occur. This can result in a total of three distinct phase transitions with a unique three-peak GW spectrum. Among these transitions, the first and third are of the standard type, while the intermediate second transition is inverted, moving from a broken to an unbroken phase. Using polynomial potentials as a framework, we derive analytical relations among the phase transition parameters and the resulting GW spectrum. Our results indicate that the second and third transitions generate GWs with higher amplitudes than the first, with a peak frequency ratio differing by up to an order of magnitude. This three-peak GW spectrum is detectable by upcoming facilities such as LISA, BBO, and UDECIGO. Notably, the phenomenon is robust across various potentials and model parameters, suggesting that hidden sector GWs provide a powerful tool for exploring new physics scenarios in the pre-BBN era.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Dark Matter Production in Supergravity $\alpha$-Attractor Inflation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15030v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider gravitational particle production (GPP) of dark matter (DM) under a supergravity framework, where the $\alpha$-attractor inflation model is used. The particle spectrum is computed numerically and the DM number density is obtained. We show how the DM mass, gravitino mass and inflation model parameters modify the results, and find the reheating temperature which leads to sufficient DM production. In our setup, supergravity corrections suppress the efficiency of GPP, and make the isocurvature constraint much weaker compared with the normal case. With tensor-to-scalar ratio ranging from $10^{-3}-10^{-4}$ and DM mass from $10^{-2} m_\phi - m_\phi$, the required reheating temperature should be around $10^3 \textrm{GeV} - 10^7 \textrm{GeV}$.</description>

Abstract: Interesting data on Gamma Ray Burts (GRBs) and Cosmic Rays (CRs) have recently been made public. GRB221009A has a record ``peak energy". The CR electron spectrum has been measured to unprecedented high energies and exhibits a ``knee" akin to the ones in all-particle or individual-element CR nuclei. IceCube has not seen high-energy neutrinos associated with GRBs. AMS has published a CR positron spectrum conducive to much speculation. We examine these data in the light of the ``CannonBall Model" of GRBs and CRs, in which they are intimately related and which they do strongly validate.</description>

      <title>Correlating $A\to \gamma\gamma$ with EDMs in the 2HDM in light of the diphoton excesses at 95 GeV and 152 GeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00523</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00523v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine the correlations between new scalar boson decays to photons and electric dipole moments (EDMs) in the CP-violating flavor-aligned two-Higgs-doublet model (2HDM). It is convenient to work in the Higgs basis $\{{H}_1, {H}_2\}$ where only the first Higgs doublet field ${H}_1$ acquires a vacuum expectation value. In light of the LHC Higgs data, which agree well with Standard Model (SM) predictions, it follows that the parameters of the 2HDM are consistent with the Higgs alignment limit. In this parameter regime, the observed SM-like Higgs boson resides almost entirely in ${H}_1$, and the other two physical neutral scalars, which reside almost entirely in ${H}_2$, are approximate eigenstates of CP (denoted by the CP-even $H$ and the CP-odd $A$). In the Higgs basis, the scalar potential term $\bar{Z}_7 {H}_1^\dagger {H}_2 {H}_2^\dagger {H}_2+{\rm h.c.}$ governs the charged-Higgs loop contributions to the decay of $H$ and $A$ to photons. If $ \text{Re } \bar{Z}_7 \, \text{Im } \bar{Z}_7 \neq 0$, then CP-violating effects are present and allow for an $H^+ H^- A$ coupling, which can yield a sizable branching ratio for $A\to\gamma\gamma$. These CP-violating effects also generate non-zero EDMs for the electron, the neutron and the proton. We examine these correlations for the cases of $m_{A}=95$ GeV and $m_{A}=152$ GeV where interesting excesses in the diphoton spectrum have been observed at the LHC. These excesses can be explained via the decay of $A$ while being consistent with the experimental bound for the electron EDM in regions of parameter space that can be tested with future neutron and proton EDM measurements. This allows for the interesting possibility where the 95 GeV diphoton excess can be identified with $A$, while $m_H\simeq 98$ GeV can account for the best fit to the LEP excess in $e^+e^-\to ZH$ with $H\to b\bar b$.</description>

      <title>On the Square Speed of Sound in High-Energy Collisions: Range of Values and How to Understand It</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.01467v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: After reviewing the sound speeds in various forms and conditions of matter, we investigate the sound speed of hadronic matter that has decoupled from the hot and dense system formed during high-energy collisions. We comprehensively consider factors such as energy loss of the incident beam, rapidity shift of leading nucleons, and the Landau hydrodynamic model for hadron production. The sound speed is related to the width or standard deviation of the Gaussian rapidity distribution of hadrons. The extracted square speed of sound lies within a range from 0 to 1/3 in most cases. For scenarios exceeding this limit, we also provide an explanation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03403v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The data behavior of the pion-photon transition form factor (TFF) is discussed using a nonlinear mathematical model with two parameters $B$ and $C$. We show for the Belle data that the inherent inhibition of this model inevitably yields asymptotically to the saturation of the transition form factor in agreement with perturbative QCD. We find that the half-saturated TFF and the asymptotic limit of this model are interrelated and use this property in conjunction with the $1\sigma$ $(B,C)$ confidence ellipse to improve the quality of the fit of the Belle data. We show that the observed asymptotic saturation of the model is analogous to a mechanical system driven by a feedback-loop mechanism. The study of another parametrization without inhibition reveals that in this case asymptotic stability is not possible so that the uninhibited TFF continues to grow. In order to compare the key features of these two fit models, a conformity protocol in terms of QCD-based criteria is proposed.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Transformers for Jet Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms, particularly attention-based transformer models, have become indispensable for analyzing the vast data generated by particle physics experiments like ATLAS and CMS at the CERN LHC. Particle Transformer (ParT), a state-of-the-art model, leverages particle-level attention to improve jet-tagging tasks, which are critical for identifying particles resulting from proton collisions. This study focuses on interpreting ParT by analyzing attention heat maps and particle-pair correlations on the $\eta$-$\phi$ plane, revealing a binary attention pattern where each particle attends to at most one other particle. At the same time, we observe that ParT shows varying focus on important particles and subjets depending on decay, indicating that the model learns traditional jet substructure observables. These insights enhance our understanding of the model's internal workings and learning process, offering potential avenues for improving the efficiency of transformer architectures in future high-energy physics applications.</description>

Abstract: The Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism is applied within the $\mathrm{SU(3)_c \otimes SU(3)_L \otimes U(1)_X}$ model with B-L symmetry. The structures in the PQ charges
  of all fermions and scalar fields in the model are investigated by applying the invariant condition under
  the symmetry group on all Yukawa interaction terms. All defined PQ charges just depend on PQ charge of the only complex singlet scalar in the model. The mixing and mass hierachy in the scalar sector of the model are studied in detail. As the result, the physical state of axion is a linear combination
  of all imaginary parts of scalar multiplets as general form. Explicit expressions for axion and light Standard Model like Higgs boson are shown. Mass of the axion and its coupling to photon are derived.</description>

      <title>Chiral QCD phase in equilibrium with Hadron Gas and the location of the critical point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.07006</link>
      <description>arXiv:1812.07006v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a description of the equation of state of QCD matter with restored chiral symmetry, which is in thermal and chemical equilibrium with the hadronic phase. The hadron gas is described with thermodynamically consistent volume corrections. The chiral phase is composed of a set of few quark condensates, each of which corresponds to a family of hadrons with specific quark content. On the boundary between the two phases we apply the requirement of conservation of particle numbers per family. We use lattice calculations for temperatures below the transition curve to determine hadronic volumes. We find that the pion system plays decisive role in the shift of the transition from higher order (crossover) to first order. For four volume models we calculate the location of the critical point as function of critical temperature $T_c$ at vanishing baryon density. Particularly, if we additionally impose the equality between the densities of quarks contained in mesons and baryons, we find a critical point residing in the interval of baryon chemical potential $\mu_B \simeq$ 233-267 MeV and of temperature $T \simeq$ 153-158 MeV.</description>

      <title>Strong-field magnetohydrodynamics for neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2207.01636v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a formulation of magnetohydrodynamics which can be used to describe the evolution of strong magnetic fields in neutron star interiors. Our approach is based on viewing magnetohydrodynamics as a theory with a one-form global symmetry and developing an effective field theory for the hydrodynamic modes associated with this symmetry. In the regime where the local velocity and temperature variations can be neglected, we derive the most general constitutive relation consistent with symmetry constraints for the electric field in the presence of a strong magnetic field. This constitutive relation not only reproduces the phenomena of Ohmic decay, ambipolar diffusion, and Hall drift derived in a phenomenological model by Goldreich and Reisenegger, but also reveals new terms in the evolution of the magnetic field which cannot easily be seen from such microscopic models. This formulation gives predictions for novel diffusion behaviors of small perturbations around a constant background magnetic field, and for the two-point correlation functions among various components of the electric and magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>A realistic coalescence model for deuteron production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.12696v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A microscopic understanding of (anti)deuteron production in hadron-hadron collisions is the subject of many experimental and theoretical efforts in nuclear physics. This topic is also very relevant for astrophysics, since the rare production of antinuclei in our Universe could be a doorway to discover new physics. In this work, we describe a new coalescence afterburner for event generators based on the Wigner function formalism and we apply it to the (anti)deuteron case, taking into account a realistic particle emitting source. The model performance is validated using the EPOS and PYTHIA event generators applied to proton-proton collisions at the centre-of-mass energy $\sqrt{s}=$ 13 TeV, triggered for high multiplicity events, and the experimental data measured by ALICE in the same collision system. The model relies on the direct measurement of the particle emitting source carried out by means of nucleon-nucleon femtoscopic correlations in the same collision system and energy. The resulting model is used to predict deuteron differential spectra assuming different deuteron wavefunctions within the Wigner function formalism. The predicted deuteron spectra show a clear sensitivity to the choice of the deuteron wavefunction. The Argonne $v_{18}$ wavefunction provides the best description of the experimental data. This model can now be used to study the production of (anti)deuterons over a wide range of collision energies and be extended to heavier nuclei.</description>

      <title>Dynamical induced quark spin polarization by magnetic field at the early stage of heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive analysis of the dynamic process of quark spin polarization induced by magnetic fields at the pre-thermal stage in heavy-ion collisions by using the recently developed theoretical tool of chiral kinetic theory. Our findings demonstrate that the spin polarization of quarks is highly sensitive to the interactions between quarks. These interactions can delay the decay of early spin polarization vector while accelerating the decay of later spin polarization vector. Specifically, our simulations show the detailed process of how magnetic fields polarize quarks within the fireball and reveal that quark interactions lead to an acceleration effect on the average spin. Notably, the fireball of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in its early stages exhibits an incomplete electromagnetic response effect, which differs from the response predicted by Lenz's law. This discrepancy arises from quantum corrections involving the interactions between quark spin and electromagnetic fields.</description>

      <title>PROSPECT: A profile likelihood code for frequentist cosmological parameter inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.02972v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological parameter inference has been dominated by the Bayesian approach for the past two decades, primarily due to its computational efficiency. However, the Bayesian approach involves integration of the posterior probability and therefore depends on both the choice of model parametrisation and the choice of prior on the model parameter space. In some cases, this can lead to conclusions which are driven by choice of parametrisation and priors rather than by data. The profile likelihood method provides a complementary frequentist tool which can be used to investigate this effect.
  In this paper, we present the code PROSPECT for computing profile likelihoods in cosmology. We showcase the code using a phenomenological model for converting dark matter into dark radiation that suffers from large volume effects and prior dependence. PROSPECT is compatible with both cobaya and MontePython, and is publicly available at https://github.com/AarhusCosmology/prospect_public.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05936v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on a recently proposed reinterpretation of gravitational wave memory that builds up on the definition of gravitational waves pioneered by Isaacson, we provide a unifying framework to derive both ordinary and null memory from a single well-defined equation at leading order in the asymptotic expansion. This allows us to formulate a memory equation that is valid for any unbound asymptotic energy-flux that preserves local Lorentz invariance. Using Horndeski gravity as a concrete example metric theory with an additional potentially massive scalar degree of freedom in the gravitational sector, the general memory formula is put into practice by presenting the first account of the memory correction sourced by the emission of massive field waves. Throughout the work, physical degrees of freedom are identified by constructing manifestly gauge invariant perturbation variables within an SVT decomposition on top of the asymptotic Minkowski background, which will in particular prove useful in future studies of gravitational wave memory within vector tensor theories.</description>

      <title>An alternative method for searching for dimuon displaced vertices in the short-range region with ATLAS and CMS</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Search for BSM phenomena is one of the fundamental goals of the LHC experiments. Many BSM models foresee long-lived particles which decay far from the production vertex and a big effort has been done both by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations to detect these long-lived particles. A specific, widely studied, example for such searches is made through the measurement of displaced vertices produced by a narrow resonance decaying to a muon pair. This paper will first analyze what has been done so far and will try to evaluate if there are improvements which may allow enhancing the discovery potential at LHC for such particles. The outcome of this work is that while long-lived particles decaying more than 1 cm from the primary vertex have been carefully studied by ATLAS and CMS, the region within a few millimeters from the primary vertex may have been partially neglected. A new approach for searching such resonances, fully based on data, will then be proposed which allows minimizing systematic uncertainties while keeping at a maximum the discovery potentiality for long-lived neutral resonances which decay a few millimeters from the primary vertex.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the relation between the emergence of a dilaton in gapped (confining) field theories, and the presence of either complex fixed points or instabilities in the strongly coupled dynamics in two classes of bottom-up holographic models. We demonstrate that in one of the two classes there is a critical line of first-order phase transitions (at zero temperature) that terminates at a critical point. We calculate the mass spectrum of fluctuations of the associated regular gravity backgrounds, which we interpret as bound states in the dual field theories. In proximity to the second-order phase transition, we find a parametrically light scalar state, and its composition leads us to identify it as a dilaton.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10129v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationship between initial spatial anisotropy and final state momentum anisotropy in heavy ion collisions through the analysis of elliptic flow ($v_2$) as a function of transverse momentum ($p_T$). Building upon previous studies on thermalization in heavy ion collisions using transverse momentum distributions, we extend the analysis to the $p_T$ dependence of $v_2$ in Pb-Pb and Xe-Xe collisions. By employing a two-component model to extract the thermal and hard scattering contributions to the elliptic flow, we aim to gain further insights into the role of quantum entanglement in the rapid thermalization and collective behavior of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14225v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tachyons have fascinated generations of physicists due to their peculiar behavior, but they did not solve any real physical problem. This may have changed with the recent works of Dragan et al., who have shown that superluminal observers may be related to the foundations of quantum mechanics (QM) because they require introducing non-determinism and wave-like behavior at the fundamental level. Unfortunately, we show that the tachyon quantum field theory proposed as a part of this program is not quantum since the tachyon field commutes at all points and the canonical commutations relations of a quantum scalar field are not satisfied. We also discuss other authors' theories, e.g., we show that the Dhar-Sudarshan's formula for the Feynman propagator violates unitarity, and we apply the LSZ formalism to tachyons for the first time, where we find that one cannot prove the LSZ asymptotic condition just by replacing plane waves with wavepackets.</description>

      <title>Self-interacting axion clouds around rotating black holes in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Superradiant instability can form clouds around rotating black holes (BHs) composed of ultralight bosonic fields, such as axions. A BH with such a cloud in a binary system exhibits rich phenomena, and gravitational waves (GWs) from the BH merger provide a means to probe axions. For the first time, we study the evolution of axion clouds in a binary system during the inspiral phase, including axion self-interaction effects. When the self-interaction is significant, unlike in the negligible case, two types of clouds coexist through mode coupling. We examine the evolution of the system considering the effects of dissipation caused by both self-interaction and tidal interaction. For tidal interaction, in addition to the processes of emission to infinity and absorption by the BH, indirect emission via transitions (both resonant and off-resonant) is also considered as a second-order perturbation. Our results demonstrate that the signatures of axion self-interaction are imprinted in the modification of the GW phase. Furthermore, we find the possibility of a dynamical instability called bosenova during the binary inspiral phase.</description>

      <title>Implications of cosmologically coupled black holes for pulsar timing arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It has been argued that realistic models of (singularity-free) black holes (BHs) embedded within an expanding Universe are coupled to the large-scale cosmological dynamics, with striking consequences, including pure cosmological growth of BH masses. In this pilot study, we examine the consequences of this growth for the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by inspiraling supermassive cosmologically coupled BHs. We show that the predicted SGWB amplitude is enhanced relative to the standard uncoupled case, while maintaining the $\Omega_{\text{gw}} \propto f^{2/3}$ frequency scaling of the spectral energy density. For the case where BH masses grow with scale factor as $M_{\text{bh}} \propto a^3$, thus contributing as a dark energy component to the cosmological dynamics, $\Omega_{\text{gw}}$ can be enhanced by more than an order of magnitude. This has important consequences for the SGWB signal detected by pulsar timing arrays, whose measured amplitude is slightly larger than most theoretical predictions for the spectrum from inspiraling binary BHs, a discrepancy which can be alleviated by the cosmological mass growth mechanism.</description>

      <title>The Axion is Going Dark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.02180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we explore the effect of a non-Abelian dark sector gauge group that couples to the axion field. In particular, we analyze effects that arise if the dark sector gauge group mixes topologically with the Standard Model. This is achieved by gauging a subgroup of the global center 1-form symmetries which embeds non-trivially in both the visible as well as the dark sector gauge groups. Leaving the local dynamics unchanged, this effect modifies the quantization conditions for the topological couplings of the axion, which enter the estimate of a lower bound on the axion-photon coupling. In the presence of a dark sector this lower bound can be reduced significantly, which might open up interesting new parameter regions for axion physics. We further determine the allowed exotic matter representations in the presence of topological mixing with a dark sector, explore the generalized categorical symmetries of such axion theories, and comment on other model-independent phenomenological consequences.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Anisotropy Scaling Functions for Identified Particle and Anti-Particle Species across Beam Energies: Insights into Baryon Junction Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the beam energy dependence of azimuthal anisotropy scaling functions for mesons and baryons in Pb+Pb and Au+Au collisions across \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 7.7\) GeV to 5.02 TeV. Species-dependent \(v_2(p_T, \text{cent})\) measurements are used to derive scaling functions that unify anisotropy data across particle species, revealing the interplay between radial flow, hadronic re-scattering, and baryon junction effects. Results show that baryon junctions significantly enhance baryon \(v_n\) at low \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\), where the baryon chemical potential (\(\mu_B\)) is high, driving a pronounced baryon--anti-baryon anisotropy difference. This difference diminishes with increasing \(\sqrt{s_{NN}}\), reflecting the reduced influence of baryon junctions at higher energies. The non-monotonic behavior of the specific shear viscosity (\(\eta/s\)) and radial flow parameters for anti-baryons suggests a transition in expansion dynamics near \(\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 39\) GeV, potentially linked to the QCD critical point. These findings provide new constraints on baryon transport mechanisms, baryon junction contributions, and the equation of state (EOS) and transport coefficients for baryon-rich matter.</description>

      <title>Lattice calculation of the $\eta_c\eta_c$ and $J/\psi J/\psi$ s-wave scattering length</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11533v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the s-wave scattering length in the $0^+$ sector of $\eta_c\eta_c$ and the $2^+$ sector of $J/\psi J/\psi$ using three $N_f=2$ twisted mass gauge ensembles with the lattice spacing $a=0.0667,0.085,0.098$ fm, respectively. The scattering lengths are extracted using the conventional L{\"u}scher finite size method. We observe sizable discretization effects and the results after a continuum extrapolation are $a^{0^+}_{\eta_c\eta_c}=-0.104(09)$ fm and $a^{2^+}_{J/\psi J/\psi}=-0.165(16)$ fm. Our results indicate that the interaction between the two respective charmonia are repulsive in nature in both cases.</description>
