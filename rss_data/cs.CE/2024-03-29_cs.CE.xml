      <title>Numerical evaluation of code live-load models for estimating the forces caused by actual vehicles that act on bridge substructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18825</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18825v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The present paper assesses the efficacy of code live-load models in accurately estimating the vehicular loads transferred to bridge substructures, such as abutments, piers, and foundations. Realistic traffic vehicle data are represented using four Weigh-in-Motion databases, which provide an authentic representation of vehicle information, thus providing a realistic basis for the examination of the bridges studied. The evaluation includes various bridge models, such as single-span girder bridges and two-, three-, and four-span continuous pinned-support girder bridges. By analyzing exceedance rates, the study compares the extreme force values obtained for vehicles in the databases with those predicted by selected code live-load models. These exceedance rates are presented in spectra format, as a function of the span length. The significant variations observed in the exceedance rates highlight the need for improving existing code live-load models to achieve more accurate estimations of the forces transferred to bridge substructures. Such improvements would lead to more uniform reliability levels for any limit state, such as resistance, fatigue, serviceability, and cracking.</description>

      <title>Sliced Online Model Checking for Optimizing the Beam Scheduling Problem in Robotic Radiation Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In robotic radiation therapy, high-energy photon beams from different directions are directed at a target within the patient. Target motion can be tracked by robotic ultrasound and then compensated by synchronous beam motion. However, moving the beams may result in beams passing through the ultrasound transducer or the robot carrying it. While this can be avoided by pausing the beam delivery, the treatment time would increase. Typically, the beams are delivered in an order which minimizes the robot motion and thereby the overall treatment time. However, this order can be changed, i.e., instead of pausing beams, other feasible beam could be delivered.
  We address this problem of dynamically ordering the beams by applying a model checking paradigm to select feasible beams. Since breathing patterns are complex and change rapidly, any offline model would be too imprecise. Thus, model checking must be conducted online, predicting the patient's current breathing pattern for a short amount of time and checking which beams can be delivered safely. Monitoring the treatment delivery online provides the option to reschedule beams dynamically in order to avoid pausing and hence to reduce treatment time.
  While human breathing patterns are complex and may change rapidly, we need a model which can be verified quickly and use approximation by a superposition of sine curves. Further, we simplify the 3D breathing motion into separate 1D models. We compensate the simplification by adding noise inside the model itself. In turn, we synchronize between the multiple models representing the different spatial directions, the treatment simulation, and corresponding verification queries.
  Our preliminary results show a 16.02 % to 37.21 % mean improvement on the idle time compared to a static beam schedule, depending on an additional safety margin. Note that an additional safety margin around the ultrasound robot can decrease idle times but also compromises plan quality by limiting the range of available beam directions. In contrast, the approach using online model checking maintains the plan quality. Further, we compare to a naive machine learning approach that does not achieve its goals while being harder to reason about.</description>

      <title>Tessellation and interactive visualization of four-dimensional spacetime geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses two problems needed to support four-dimensional ($3d + t$) spacetime numerical simulations. The first contribution is a general algorithm for producing conforming spacetime meshes of moving geometries. Here, the surface points of the geometry are embedded in a four-dimensional space as the geometry moves in time. The geometry is first tessellated at prescribed time steps and then these tessellations are connected in the parameter space of each geometry entity to form tetrahedra. In contrast to previous work, this approach allows the resolution of the geometry to be controlled at each time step. The only restriction on the algorithm is the requirement that no topological changes to the geometry are made (i.e. the hierarchical relations between all geometry entities are maintained) as the geometry moves in time. The validity of the final mesh topology is verified by ensuring the tetrahedralizations represent a closed 3-manifold. For some analytic problems, the $4d$ volume of the tetrahedralization is also verified. The second problem addressed in this paper is the design of a system to interactively visualize four-dimensional meshes, including tetrahedra (embedded in $4d$) and pentatopes. Algorithms that either include or exclude a geometry shader are described, and the efficiency of each approach is then compared. Overall, the results suggest that visualizing tetrahedra (either those bounding the domain, or extracted from a pentatopal mesh) using a geometry shader achieves the highest frame rate, in the range of $20-30$ frames per second for meshes with about $50$ million tetrahedra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study explores the optimization of evolutionary solver parameters for minimizing total tardiness in single machine scheduling, an NP-hard problem with zero ready times included. It investigates various parameter combinations, including population sizes, mutation rates, and a constant convergence rate, both above and below default values.

      <title>Cell Electropermeabilization Modeling via Multiple Traces Formulation and Time Semi-Implicit Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We simulate the electrical response of multiple disjoint biological 3D cells in the electropermeabilization process. Instead of solving the boundary value problem in the volume, we reduce it to a system of boundary integrals equations with nonlinear dynamics on the cell membranes via a coupling the local Multiple Traces Formulation with a time semi-implicit scheme. Spatially, boundary unknowns are approximated by spherical harmonics, thereby allowing for spectral convergence rates for suitable time steps. Numerical results are provided to validate our claims.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence-based Analysis of Change in Public Finance between US and International Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public finances are one of the fundamental mechanisms of economic governance that refer to the financial activities and decisions made by government entities to fund public services, projects, and operations through assets. In today's globalized landscape, even subtle shifts in one nation's public debt landscape can have significant impacts on that of international finances, necessitating a nuanced understanding of the correlations between international and national markets to help investors make informed investment decisions. Therefore, by leveraging the capabilities of artificial intelligence, this study utilizes neural networks to depict the correlations between US and International Public Finances and predict the changes in international public finances based on the changes in US public finances. With the neural network model achieving a commendable Mean Squared Error (MSE) value of 2.79, it is able to affirm a discernible correlation and also plot the effect of US market volatility on international markets. To further test the accuracy and significance of the model, an economic analysis was conducted that aimed to correlate the changes seen by the results of the model with historical stock market changes. This model demonstrates significant potential for investors to predict changes in international public finances based on signals from US markets, marking a significant stride in comprehending the intricacies of global public finances and the role of artificial intelligence in decoding its multifaceted patterns for practical forecasting.</description>

      <title>The role of chemo-mechanical modelling in the development of battery technology -- a perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19244v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the race to reduce global CO2 emissions and achieve net-zero, chemomechanics must play a critical role in the technological development of current and next-generation batteries to improve their energy storage capabilities and their lifetime. Many degradation processes arise through mechanics via the development of diffusion-induced stress and volumetric strains within the various constituent materials in a battery. From particle cracking in lithium-ion batteries to lithium dendrite-based fracture of solid electrolytes in solid-state batteries, it is clear that significant barriers exist in the development of these energy storage systems, where chemomechanics plays a central part. To accelerate technological and scientific advances in this area, multi-scale and highly coupled multiphysics modelling must be carried out that includes mechanics-based phenomena. In this perspective article, we provide an introduction to chemomechanical modelling, the various physical problems that it addresses, and the issues that need to be resolved in order to expand its use within the field of battery technology.</description>

      <title>Tabular Learning: Encoding for Entity and Context Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19405v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Examining the effect of different encoding techniques on entity and context embeddings, the goal of this work is to challenge commonly used Ordinal encoding for tabular learning. Applying different preprocessing methods and network architectures over several datasets resulted in a benchmark on how the encoders influence the learning outcome of the networks. By keeping the test, validation and training data consistent, results have shown that ordinal encoding is not the most suited encoder for categorical data in terms of preprocessing the data and thereafter, classifying the target variable correctly. A better outcome was achieved, encoding the features based on string similarities by computing a similarity matrix as input for the network. This is the case for both, entity and context embeddings, where the transformer architecture showed improved performance for Ordinal and Similarity encoding with regard to multi-label classification tasks.</description>

      <title>Accurate, scalable, and efficient Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design with derivative-informed neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14810v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider optimal experimental design (OED) problems in selecting the most informative observation sensors to estimate model parameters in a Bayesian framework. Such problems are computationally prohibitive when the parameter-to-observable (PtO) map is expensive to evaluate, the parameters are high-dimensional, and the optimization for sensor selection is combinatorial and high-dimensional. To address these challenges, we develop an accurate, scalable, and efficient computational framework based on derivative-informed neural operators (DINOs). The derivative of the PtO map is essential for accurate evaluation of the optimality criteria of OED in our consideration. We take the key advantage of DINOs, a class of neural operators trained with derivative information, to achieve high approximate accuracy of not only the PtO map but also, more importantly, its derivative. Moreover, we develop scalable and efficient computation of the optimality criteria based on DINOs and propose a modified swapping greedy algorithm for its optimization. We demonstrate that the proposed method is scalable to preserve the accuracy for increasing parameter dimensions and achieves high computational efficiency, with an over 1000x speedup accounting for both offline construction and online evaluation costs, compared to high-fidelity Bayesian OED solutions for a three-dimensional nonlinear convection-diffusion-reaction example with tens of thousands of parameters.</description>
