      <title>Dyadic Regression with Sample Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.17787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.17787v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the sample selection problem in panel dyadic regression analysis. Dyadic data often include many zeros in the main outcomes due to the underlying network formation process. This not only contaminates popular estimators used in practice but also complicates the inference due to the dyadic dependence structure. We extend Kyriazidou (1997)'s approach to dyadic data and characterize the asymptotic distribution of our proposed estimator. The convergence rates are $\sqrt{n}$ or $\sqrt{n^{2}h_{n}}$, depending on the degeneracy of the H\'{a}jek projection part of the estimator, where $n$ is the number of nodes and $h_{n}$ is a bandwidth. We propose a bias-corrected confidence interval and a variance estimator that adapts to the degeneracy. A Monte Carlo simulation shows the good finite performance of our estimator and highlights the importance of bias correction in both asymptotic regimes when the fraction of zeros in outcomes varies. We illustrate our procedure using data from Moretti and Wilson (2017)'s paper on migration.</description>

      <title>Semi-nonparametric models of multidimensional matching: an optimal transport approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes empirically tractable multidimensional matching models, focusing on worker-job matching. We generalize the parametric model proposed by Lindenlaub (2017), which relies on the assumption of joint normality of observed characteristics of workers and jobs. In our paper, we allow unrestricted distributions of characteristics and show identification of the production technology, and equilibrium wage and matching functions using tools from optimal transport theory. Given identification, we propose efficient, consistent, asymptotically normal sieve estimators. We revisit Lindenlaub's empirical application and show that, between 1990 and 2010, the U.S. economy experienced much larger technological progress favoring cognitive abilities than the original findings suggest. Furthermore, our flexible model specifications provide a significantly better fit for patterns in the evolution of wage inequality.</description>

      <title>Empirical Likelihood Covariate Adjustment for Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.09263v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper proposes a versatile covariate adjustment method that directly incorporates covariate balance in regression discontinuity (RD) designs. The new empirical entropy balancing method reweights the standard local polynomial RD estimator by using the entropy balancing weights that minimize the Kullback--Leibler divergence from the uniform weights while satisfying the covariate balance constraints. Our estimator can be formulated as an empirical likelihood estimator that efficiently incorporates the information from the covariate balance condition as correctly specified over-identifying moment restrictions, and thus has an asymptotic variance no larger than that of the standard estimator without covariates. We demystify the asymptotic efficiency gain of Calonico, Cattaneo, Farrell, and Titiunik (2019)'s regression-based covariate-adjusted estimator, as their estimator has the same asymptotic variance as ours. Further efficiency improvement from balancing over sieve spaces is possible if our entropy balancing weights are computed using stronger covariate balance constraints that are imposed on functions of covariates. We then show that our method enjoys favorable second-order properties from empirical likelihood estimation and inference: the estimator has a small (bounded) nonlinearity bias, and the likelihood ratio based confidence set admits a simple analytical correction that can be used to improve coverage accuracy. The coverage accuracy of our confidence set is robust against slight perturbation to the covariate balance condition, which may happen in cases such as data contamination and misspecified "unaffected" outcomes used as covariates. The proposed entropy balancing approach for covariate adjustment is applicable to other RD-related settings.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric uncertainty : Nowcasting using skewness in real-time data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.02601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.02601v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a new way to account for downside and upside risks when producing density nowcasts of GDP growth. The approach relies on modelling location, scale and shape common factors in real-time macroeconomic data. While movements in the location generate shifts in the central part of the predictive density, the scale controls its dispersion (akin to general uncertainty) and the shape its asymmetry, or skewness (akin to downside and upside risks). The empirical application is centred on US GDP growth and the real-time data come from Fred-MD. The results show that there is more to real-time data than their levels or means: their dispersion and asymmetry provide valuable information for nowcasting economic activity. Scale and shape common factors (i) yield more reliable measures of uncertainty and (ii) improve precision when macroeconomic uncertainty is at its peak.</description>

      <title>On Robust Inference in Time Series Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.04080v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Least squares regression with heteroskedasticity consistent standard errors ("OLS-HC regression") has proved very useful in cross section environments. However, several major difficulties, which are generally overlooked, must be confronted when transferring the HC technology to time series environments via heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation consistent standard errors ("OLS-HAC regression"). First, in plausible time-series environments, OLS parameter estimates can be inconsistent, so that OLS-HAC inference fails even asymptotically. Second, most economic time series have autocorrelation, which renders OLS parameter estimates inefficient. Third, autocorrelation similarly renders conditional predictions based on OLS parameter estimates inefficient. Finally, the structure of popular HAC covariance matrix estimators is ill-suited for capturing the autoregressive autocorrelation typically present in economic time series, which produces large size distortions and reduced power in HAC-based hypothesis testing, in all but the largest samples. We show that all four problems are largely avoided by the use of a simple and easily-implemented dynamic regression procedure, which we call DURBIN. We demonstrate the advantages of DURBIN with detailed simulations covering a range of practical issues.</description>

      <title>Sharp and Robust Estimation of Partially Identified Discrete Response Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02414v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semiparametric discrete choice models are widely used in a variety of practical applications. While these models are point identified in the presence of continuous covariates, they can become partially identified when covariates are discrete. In this paper we find that classical estimators, including the maximum score estimator, (Manski (1975)), loose their attractive statistical properties without point identification. First of all, they are not sharp with the estimator converging to an outer region of the identified set, (Komarova (2013)), and in many discrete designs it weakly converges to a random set. Second, they are not robust, with their distribution limit discontinuously changing with respect to the parameters of the model. We propose a novel class of estimators based on the concept of a quantile of a random set, which we show to be both sharp and robust. We demonstrate that our approach extends from cross-sectional settings to classical static and dynamic discrete panel data models.</description>

      <title>The learning effects of subsidies to bundled goods: a semiparametric approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.01217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.01217v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can temporary subsidies to bundles induce long-run changes in demand due to learning about the quality of one of the constituent goods? This paper provides theoretical support and empirical evidence on this mechanism. Theoretically, we introduce a model where an agent learns about the quality of an innovation through repeated consumption. We then assess the predictions of our theory in a randomised experiment in a ridesharing platform. The experiment subsidised car trips integrating with a train or metro station, which we interpret as a bundle. Given the heavy-tailed nature of our data, we propose a semiparametric specification for treatment effects that enables the construction of more efficient estimators. We then introduce an efficient estimator for our specification by relying on L-moments. Our results indicate that a ten-weekday 50\% discount on integrated trips leads to a large contemporaneous increase in the demand for integration, and, consistent with our model, persistent changes in the mean and dispersion of nonintegrated app rides. These effects last for over four months. A calibration of our theoretical model suggests that around 40\% of the contemporaneous increase in integrated rides may be attributable to increased incentives to learning. Our results have nontrivial policy implications for the design of public transit systems.</description>

      <title>Mixing it up: Inflation at risk</title>

Abstract: Assessing the contribution of various risk factors to future inflation risks was crucial for guiding monetary policy during the recent high inflation period. However, existing methodologies often provide limited insights by focusing solely on specific percentiles of the forecast distribution. In contrast, this paper introduces a comprehensive framework that examines how economic indicators impact the entire forecast distribution of macroeconomic variables, facilitating the decomposition of the overall risk outlook into its underlying drivers. Additionally, the framework allows for the construction of risk measures that align with central bank preferences, serving as valuable summary statistics. Applied to the recent inflation surge, the framework reveals that U.S. inflation risk was primarily influenced by the recovery of the U.S. business cycle and surging commodity prices, partially mitigated by adjustments in monetary policy and credit spreads.</description>
