      <title>Nonadiabatic force matching for alchemical free-energy estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14179v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a method to compute free energies from nonadiabatic alchemical transformations using diffusion-denoising generative models. The method, nonadiabatic force matching, hinges on estimating -- rather than minimizing -- the dissipation along an alchemical transition as the functional of a nonadiabatic potential, which plays the role of a diffusion-denoising protocol. Applying the algorithm to compute alchemical free energies of simple atomistic models shows it can significantly cut the simulation cost of a free-energy estimate at no loss of accuracy compared with thermodynamic integration.</description>

      <title>Numerically "exact" charge transport dynamics in a dissipative electron-phonon model rationalizing the success of the transient localization scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical conductivity in molecular semiconductors is suppressed in the terahertz region, featuring the displaced Drude peak that reflects carriers' transient localization (TL) by slow intermolecular vibrations. Meanwhile, recent computations in minimal models evidence optical-conductivity enhancements below the characteristic vibrational frequency, which cannot be captured by the TL phenomenology. These models assume undamped vibrations, whereas atomistic simulations show that the vibrations most strongly modulating carrier's hopping amplitude are damped. Here, we use the dissipaton equations of motion (DEOM) method to compute finite-temperature real-time current autocorrelation function in a one-dimensional model with Brownian-oscillator spectral density of nonlocal carrier-phonon interaction. We exploit the dissipaton algebra to handle the phonon-assisted current, reduce the method's computational requirements by working in momentum space, and confirm that numerically stable transport dynamics are virtually independent of a specific DEOM closing scheme. With increasing damping, we find that DEOM optical-conductivity profiles become increasingly qualitatively similar to TL predictions. For parameters representative of room-temperature hole transport in single-crystal rubrene, we conclude that the TL phenomenology is established already in the underdamped-oscillator regime. Reasonable variations in the damping constant weakly affect the carrier mobility, which remains within experimental bounds. Overall, our results strongly suggest that optical-conductivity enhancements at very low frequencies are artifacts of undamped vibrations, and rationalize the success of the TL phenomenology in describing experimental data.</description>

      <title>A Simple and Scalable Kernel Density Approach for Reliable Uncertainty Quantification in Atomistic Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning models are increasingly used to predict material properties and accelerate atomistic simulations, but the reliability of their predictions depends on the representativeness of the training data. We present a scalable, GPU-accelerated uncertainty quantification framework based on $k$-nearest-neighbor kernel density estimation (KDE) in a PCA-reduced descriptor space. This method efficiently detects sparsely sampled regions in large, high-dimensional datasets and provides a transferable, model-agnostic uncertainty metric without requiring retraining costly model ensembles. The framework is validated across diverse case studies varying in: i) chemistry, ii) prediction models (including foundational neural network), iii) descriptors used for KDE estimation, and iv) properties whose uncertainty is sought. In all cases, the KDE-based score reliably flags extrapolative configurations, correlates well with conventional ensemble-based uncertainties, and highlights regions of reduced prediction trustworthiness. The approach offers a practical route for improving the interpretability, robustness, and deployment readiness of ML models in materials science.</description>

      <title>Fundamental measure theory for predicting many-body correlation functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study many-body correlation functions within various Fundamental Measure Theory (FMT) formulations and compare their predictions to Monte Carlo simulations of hard-sphere fluids. FMT accurately captures key features of three- and four-body structure, particularly at low and intermediate wavevectors. We show that the dominant contributions to the four-point structure factor arise from direct triplet correlations, allowing evaluation of four-point correlations to be greatly simplified. In glass-forming liquids at high volume fractions, FMT correctly reproduces deviations from the convolution approximation, highlighting FMT's ability to capture growing structural multipoint correlations upon supercooling.</description>

      <title>On the electronic normal modes of the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss representation of non-adiabatic dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient simulation of non-adiabatic dynamics is highly desirable for understanding charge and energy transfer in complex systems. A key criterion for obtaining an accurate method is conservation of the Quantum Boltzmann Distribution (QBD). For a single surface, Matsubara dynamics is known to conserve the QBD, as a consequence of truncating the dynamics in the higher normal modes of the imaginary-time path integral. Recently, a Non-Adiabatic Matsubara (NA-Mats) dynamics has been proposed (J. Chem. Phys., 2021, 154, 124124) which truncates in the normal modes of the nuclear variables but not in the electronic variables, which are described with the Meyer-Miller-Stock-Thoss (MMST) representation. Surprisingly, this NA-Mats method does not appear to conserve the QBD for a general system. This poses the question of the effect of truncating the higher normal modes of the electronic variables in the MMST representation. In this article, we present what we believe is the first study of electronic normal modes of the MMST representation. We find that observables are not usually a function of a finite number of normal modes and that the higher normal modes are not constrained by the distribution, unlike in conventional nuclear normal modes. While for an ensemble of trajectories, truncation in MMST normal modes appears to numerically conserve the QBD, this is not the case for a single trajectory. When considering a correlation function, all MMST normal modes are required to obtain reasonable dynamics. Overall, this suggests that MMST variables are not optimal for obtaining an accurate, QBD conserving nonadiabatic dynamics method.</description>

      <title>Ground and low-lying excited state potential energy surfaces of diiodomethane in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a set of adiabatic potential energy surfaces (PESs) for diiodomethane, including the ground electronic state and all excited states accessible via single-photon absorption near 260 nm. Although constrained to four dimensions, these PESs capture the essential photochemical processes following photoexcitation--namely, bond breaking and rearrangement among the methyl radical and the two iodine atoms. Constructed using an accurate and efficient spline interpolation algorithm, the PESs reproduce local features with high fidelity and exhibit overall smooth first-order derivatives, making them suitable for molecular dynamics simulations, including non-adiabatic dynamics. We identify key stationary points on the ground-state PES and on three excited-state PESs, and map reaction pathways leading to $\text{CH}_2\text{I}+\text{I}$ dissociation via the intermediate formation of a $\text{CH}_2\text{I}$-$\text{I}$ isomer. A second photoisomerization pathway is also confirmed, in which the molecule is initially photoexcited and then undergoes a nonadiabatic transition to the ground state to form the isomer. These PESs provide a valuable resource for molecular dynamics studies, enabling detailed exploration of photochemistry in diiodomethane.</description>

      <title>Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Independent Tanimoto Kernel Gaussian Processes for Diverse Pareto Front Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14072v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present GP-MOBO, a novel multi-objective Bayesian Optimization algorithm that advances the state-of-the-art in molecular optimization. Our approach integrates a fast minimal package for Exact Gaussian Processes (GPs) capable of efficiently handling the full dimensionality of sparse molecular fingerprints without the need for extensive computational resources. GP-MOBO consistently outperforms traditional methods like GP-BO by fully leveraging fingerprint dimensionality, leading to the identification of higher-quality and valid SMILES. Moreover, our model achieves a broader exploration of the chemical search space, as demonstrated by its superior proximity to the Pareto front in all tested scenarios. Empirical results from the DockSTRING dataset reveal that GP-MOBO yields higher geometric mean values across 20 Bayesian optimization iterations, underscoring its effectiveness and efficiency in addressing complex multi-objective optimization challenges with minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Production of ultracold asymmetric tops from Sr atoms and SrOH molecules</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.14543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the comprehensive theoretical investigation of the Sr-SrOH system identifying it as a promising route to production of ultracold asymmetric top molecules. Combining high-level ab initio electronic structure calculations with rigorous quantum scattering simulations, we determine strongly anisotropic, non-reactive interaction potential and an exceptionally dense spectrum of near-threshold resonances. Presented excited states, transition dipole moments, and results of the one-dimensional STIRAP model suggest the possibility of coherently transferring weakly bound complexes to the rovibrational ground state.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the attractive electrosolvation force between colloidal particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct measurement of the pair interaction potential between electrically like-charged particles in solution reveals a strong and long-ranged attractive force. This counterintuitive attraction has been suggested to arise from the orientation of solvent molecules at the interface between the object and the electrolyte. Here we report measurements of pair interaction potentials between charged microspheres with a range of surface chemistries. We demonstrate that the range of the electrosolvation attraction is substantially longer than previously held and that the range of the interaction depends on particle properties. The observations highlight significant departures from current thinking and the need for a model of interparticle interactions that accounts for the molecular nature of the solvent, its interfacial behaviour, and spatial correlations.</description>

      <title>Elastic Metastability: Thermally Activated Snap-through Transitions in Nanostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The morphological snap-through transition of a bistable elastic structure typically requires external loading, unless it is miniaturized to the nanoscale, where thermal fluctuations play a significant role. We propose that metastability can emerge in microscopic elastic systems when coupled to a thermal environment, giving rise to thermally activated transitions between metastable configurations. Using atomistic simulations combined with rare event methods, we demonstrate that snap-through events can occur as well-defined thermally activated transitions in a geometrically constrained graphene nanoribbon. Well-tempered metadynamics is employed to determine the transition energetics and pathways. Notably, the temperature dependence of the transition rate constant is accurately described by generalized transition state theory in terms of the Landau free energy. This study introduces a theoretical framework for understanding elastic metastability, extends reaction rate theory to nanomechanical systems, and suggests strategies for designing temperature-responsive nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Equipartition and the temperature of maximum density of TIP4/2005 water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.14800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.14800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We simulate TIP4P/2005 water in the temperature range of 257 K to 318 K with time steps of $\delta =$ 0.25, 0.50, and 2.0 fs. Within the computed statistical uncertainties, the density-temperature behavior obtained using 0.25 fs and 0.50 fs are in excellent agreement with each other but differ from those obtained using $\delta t = 2.0$ fs, a choice that leads to a breakdown of equipartition. The temperature of maximum density (TMD) is 277.15 K with $\delta t = $0.25 fs or 0.50 fs, but is shifted to 273.15 K for simulations with $\delta t = 2.0$ fs. This shift is comparable in magnitude to the shift in TMD due to nuclear quantum effects, emphasizing the care required in the parameterization and classical statistical mechanical simulation of a fluid that displays nontrivial nuclear quantum effects under ambient conditions. Enhancing the water-water dispersion interaction, as has been recommended for modeling disordered solvated proteins, degrades the description of the liquid-vapor phase envelope.</description>

      <title>Slimmer Geminals For Accurate F12 Electronic Structure Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Slater-type F12 geminal lengthscales originally tuned for the second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset F12 method are too large for higher-order F12 methods formulated using the SP (diagonal fixed-coefficient spin-adapted) F12 ansatz. The new geminal parameters reported herein reduce the basis set incompleteness errors (BSIE) of absolute coupled-cluster singles and doubles F12 correlation energies by a significant - and increasing with the cardinal number of the basis - margin. The effect of geminal reoptimization is especially pronounced for the cc-pVXZ-F12 basis sets (specifically designed for use with F12 methods) relative to their conventional aug-cc-pVXZ counterparts. The BSIEs of relative energies are less affected but substantial reductions can be obtained, especially for atomization energies and ionization potentials with the cc-pVXZ-F12 basis sets. The new geminal parameters are therefore recommended for all applications of high-order F12 methods, such as the coupled-cluster F12 methods and the transcorrelated F12 methods.</description>

      <title>Bridging classical and quantum interpretation of chemical state analysis by XPS/HAXPES to resolve short-range order in amorphous alumina films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08255v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing the local structure and chemistry of wide-bandgap amorphous oxide thin films remains challenging due to the limitations of lab-based spectroscopy. This work integrates X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES), molecular dynamics simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials, density-functional theory (DFT) calculations, and classical electrostatic modeling of final-state core-ionization effects in Al atoms to uncover the structure and chemistry of amorphous alumina polymorphs made with atomic layer deposition (ALD). DFT calculations using the Delta Kohn-Sham method supported the interpretation of final-state effects and validated electrostatic model assumptions. Shifts in the measured Auger parameter were interpreted as extra-atomic relaxation energies, revealing sensitivity to the local coordination environment. Structural disorder and thermal fluctuations were found to govern the distribution of extra-atomic relaxation energies, suggesting that cryo-XPS can isolate and reveal intrinsic structural building blocks of amorphous oxides. Simulated heating and annealing demonstrated that Auger parameter shifts can serve as indicators of phase decomposition in H-supersaturated ALD amorphous alumina. These findings provide a pathway for comprehensive interpretation and predictive modeling of XPS spectra in amorphous wide-bandgap oxides.</description>
