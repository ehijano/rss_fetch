      <title>Ranking and Combining Latent Structured Predictive Scores without Labeled Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Combining multiple predictors obtained from distributed data sources to an accurate meta-learner is promising to achieve enhanced performance in lots of prediction problems. As the accuracy of each predictor is usually unknown, integrating the predictors to achieve better performance is challenging. Conventional ensemble learning methods assess the accuracy of predictors based on extensive labeled data. In practical applications, however, the acquisition of such labeled data can prove to be an arduous task. Furthermore, the predictors under consideration may exhibit high degrees of correlation, particularly when similar data sources or machine learning algorithms were employed during their model training. In response to these challenges, this paper introduces a novel structured unsupervised ensemble learning model (SUEL) to exploit the dependency between a set of predictors with continuous predictive scores, rank the predictors without labeled data and combine them to an ensembled score with weights. Two novel correlation-based decomposition algorithms are further proposed to estimate the SUEL model, constrained quadratic optimization (SUEL.CQO) and matrix-factorization-based (SUEL.MF) approaches. The efficacy of the proposed methods is rigorously assessed through both simulation studies and real-world application of risk genes discovery. The results compellingly demonstrate that the proposed methods can efficiently integrate the dependent predictors to an ensemble model without the need of ground truth data.</description>

      <title>Local Causal Discovery with Background Knowledge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Causality plays a pivotal role in various fields of study. Based on the framework of causal graphical models, previous works have proposed identifying whether a variable is a cause or non-cause of a target in every Markov equivalent graph solely by learning a local structure. However, the presence of prior knowledge, often represented as a partially known causal graph, is common in many causal modeling applications. Leveraging this prior knowledge allows for the further identification of causal relationships. In this paper, we first propose a method for learning the local structure using all types of causal background knowledge, including direct causal information, non-ancestral information and ancestral information. Then we introduce criteria for identifying causal relationships based solely on the local structure in the presence of prior knowledge. We also apply out method to fair machine learning, and experiments involving local structure learning, causal relationship identification, and fair machine learning demonstrate that our method is both effective and efficient.</description>

      <title>Robust Offline Active Learning on Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the problem of active learning on graphs, which has crucial applications in many real-world networks where labeling node responses is expensive. In this paper, we propose an offline active learning method that selects nodes to query by explicitly incorporating information from both the network structure and node covariates. Building on graph signal recovery theories and the random spectral sparsification technique, the proposed method adopts a two-stage biased sampling strategy that takes both informativeness and representativeness into consideration for node querying. Informativeness refers to the complexity of graph signals that are learnable from the responses of queried nodes, while representativeness refers to the capacity of queried nodes to control generalization errors given noisy node-level information. We establish a theoretical relationship between generalization error and the number of nodes selected by the proposed method. Our theoretical results demonstrate the trade-off between informativeness and representativeness in active learning. Extensive numerical experiments show that the proposed method is competitive with existing graph-based active learning methods, especially when node covariates and responses contain noises. Additionally, the proposed method is applicable to both regression and classification tasks on graphs.</description>

      <title>BINDy -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics with reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model parsimony is an important \emph{cognitive bias} in data-driven modelling that aids interpretability and helps to prevent over-fitting. Sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) methods are able to learn sparse representations of complex dynamics directly from data, given a basis of library functions. In this work, a novel Bayesian treatment of dictionary learning system identification, as an alternative to SINDy, is envisaged. The proposed method -- Bayesian identification of nonlinear dynamics (BINDy) -- is distinct from previous approaches in that it targets the full joint posterior distribution over both the terms in the library and their parameterisation in the model. This formulation confers the advantage that an arbitrary prior may be placed over the model structure to produce models that are sparse in the model space rather than in parameter space. Because this posterior is defined over parameter vectors that can change in dimension, the inference cannot be performed by standard techniques. Instead, a Gibbs sampler based on reversible-jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo is proposed. BINDy is shown to compare favourably to ensemble SINDy in three benchmark case-studies. In particular, it is seen that the proposed method is better able to assign high probability to correct model terms.</description>

      <title>A Bayesian Classification Trees Approach to Treatment Effect Variation with Noncompliance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07765v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating varying treatment effects in randomized trials with noncompliance is inherently challenging since variation comes from two separate sources: variation in the impact itself and variation in the compliance rate. In this setting, existing frequentist and flexible machine learning methods are highly sensitive to the weak instruments problem, in which the compliance rate is (locally) close to zero. Bayesian approaches, on the other hand, can naturally account for noncompliance via imputation. We propose a Bayesian machine learning approach that combines the best features of both approaches. Our main methodological contribution is to present a Bayesian Causal Forest model for binary response variables in scenarios with noncompliance by repeatedly imputing individuals' compliance types, allowing us to flexibly estimate varying treatment effects among compliers. Simulation studies demonstrate the usefulness of our approach when compliance and treatment effects are heterogeneous. We apply the method to detect and analyze heterogeneity in the treatment effects in the Illinois Workplace Wellness Study, which not only features heterogeneous and one-sided compliance but also several binary outcomes of interest. We demonstrate the methodology on three outcomes one year after intervention. We confirm a null effect on the presence of a chronic condition, discover meaningful heterogeneity in a "bad health" outcome that cancels out to null in classical partial effect estimates, and find substantial heterogeneity in individuals' perception of management prioritization of health and safety.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Learning with Human Feedback</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07772v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) learning often relies heavily on statistical approaches or predefined assumptions about OOD data distributions, hindering their efficacy in addressing multifaceted challenges of OOD generalization and OOD detection in real-world deployment environments. This paper presents a novel framework for OOD learning with human feedback, which can provide invaluable insights into the nature of OOD shifts and guide effective model adaptation. Our framework capitalizes on the freely available unlabeled data in the wild that captures the environmental test-time OOD distributions under both covariate and semantic shifts. To harness such data, our key idea is to selectively provide human feedback and label a small number of informative samples from the wild data distribution, which are then used to train a multi-class classifier and an OOD detector. By exploiting human feedback, we enhance the robustness and reliability of machine learning models, equipping them with the capability to handle OOD scenarios with greater precision. We provide theoretical insights on the generalization error bounds to justify our algorithm. Extensive experiments show the superiority of our method, outperforming the current state-of-the-art by a significant margin.</description>

      <title>Differentiating Policies for Non-Myopic Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07812v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) methods choose sample points by optimizing an acquisition function derived from a statistical model of the objective. These acquisition functions are chosen to balance sampling regions with predicted good objective values against exploring regions where the objective is uncertain. Standard acquisition functions are myopic, considering only the impact of the next sample, but non-myopic acquisition functions may be more effective. In principle, one could model the sampling by a Markov decision process, and optimally choose the next sample by maximizing an expected reward computed by dynamic programming; however, this is infeasibly expensive. More practical approaches, such as rollout, consider a parametric family of sampling policies. In this paper, we show how to efficiently estimate rollout acquisition functions and their gradients, enabling stochastic gradient-based optimization of sampling policies.</description>

      <title>Incremental Structure Discovery of Classification via Sequential Monte Carlo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaussian Processes (GPs) provide a powerful framework for making predictions and understanding uncertainty for classification with kernels and Bayesian non-parametric learning. Building such models typically requires strong prior knowledge to define preselect kernels, which could be ineffective for online applications of classification that sequentially process data because features of data may shift during the process. To alleviate the requirement of prior knowledge used in GPs and learn new features from data that arrive successively, this paper presents a novel method to automatically discover models of classification on complex data with little prior knowledge. Our method adapts a recently proposed technique for GP-based time-series structure discovery, which integrates GPs and Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC). We extend the technique to handle extra latent variables in GP classification, such that our method can effectively and adaptively learn a-priori unknown structures of classification from continuous input. In addition, our method adapts new batch of data with updated structures of models. Our experiments show that our method is able to automatically incorporate various features of kernels on synthesized data and real-world data for classification. In the experiments of real-world data, our method outperforms various classification methods on both online and offline setting achieving a 10\% accuracy improvement on one benchmark.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a reinforcement learning (RL) platform that enhances end-to-end user journeys in healthcare digital tools through personalization. We explore a case study with SwipeRx, the most popular all-in-one app for pharmacists in Southeast Asia, demonstrating how the platform can be used to personalize and adapt user experiences. Our RL framework is tested through a series of experiments with product recommendations tailored to each pharmacy based on real-time information on their purchasing history and in-app engagement, showing a significant increase in basket size. By integrating adaptive interventions into existing mobile health solutions and enriching user journeys, our platform offers a scalable solution to improve pharmaceutical supply chain management, health worker capacity building, and clinical decision and patient care, ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes.</description>

      <title>The Clever Hans Effect in Unsupervised Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.08041v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Unsupervised learning has become an essential building block of AI systems. The representations it produces, e.g. in foundation models, are critical to a wide variety of downstream applications. It is therefore important to carefully examine unsupervised models to ensure not only that they produce accurate predictions, but also that these predictions are not "right for the wrong reasons", the so-called Clever Hans (CH) effect. Using specially developed Explainable AI techniques, we show for the first time that CH effects are widespread in unsupervised learning. Our empirical findings are enriched by theoretical insights, which interestingly point to inductive biases in the unsupervised learning machine as a primary source of CH effects. Overall, our work sheds light on unexplored risks associated with practical applications of unsupervised learning and suggests ways to make unsupervised learning more robust.</description>

      <title>Extracting Sentence Embeddings from Pretrained Transformer Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08073v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background/introduction: Pre-trained transformer models shine in many natural language processing tasks and therefore are expected to bear the representation of the input sentence or text meaning. These sentence-level embeddings are also important in retrieval-augmented generation. But do commonly used plain averaging or prompt templates surface it enough?
  Methods: Given 110M parameters BERT's hidden representations from multiple layers and multiple tokens we tried various ways to extract optimal sentence representations. We tested various token aggregation and representation post-processing techniques. We also tested multiple ways of using a general Wikitext dataset to complement BERTs sentence representations. All methods were tested on 8 Semantic Textual Similarity (STS), 6 short text clustering, and 12 classification tasks. We also evaluated our representation-shaping techniques on other static models, including random token representations.
  Results: Proposed representation extraction methods improved the performance on STS and clustering tasks for all models considered. Very high improvements for static token-based models, especially random embeddings for STS tasks almost reach the performance of BERT-derived representations.
  Conclusions: Our work shows that for multiple tasks simple baselines with representation shaping techniques reach or even outperform more complex BERT-based models or are able to contribute to their performance.</description>

      <title>Localized Sparse Principal Component Analysis of Multivariate Time Series in Frequency Domain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis has been a main tool in multivariate analysis for estimating a low dimensional linear subspace that explains most of the variability in the data. However, in high-dimensional regimes, naive estimates of the principal loadings are not consistent and difficult to interpret. In the context of time series, principal component analysis of spectral density matrices can provide valuable, parsimonious information about the behavior of the underlying process, particularly if the principal components are interpretable in that they are sparse in coordinates and localized in frequency bands. In this paper, we introduce a formulation and consistent estimation procedure for interpretable principal component analysis for high-dimensional time series in the frequency domain. An efficient frequency-sequential algorithm is developed to compute sparse-localized estimates of the low-dimensional principal subspaces of the signal process. The method is motivated by and used to understand neurological mechanisms from high-density resting-state EEG in a study of first episode psychosis.</description>

      <title>Derivative-Free Guidance in Continuous and Discrete Diffusion Models with Soft Value-Based Decoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at capturing the natural design spaces of images, molecules, DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. However, rather than merely generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing methods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and DNA/RNA sequence generation.

      <title>Aliasing and Label-Independent Decomposition of Risk: Beyond the bias-variance trade-off</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central problem in data science is to use potentially noisy samples of an unknown function to predict function values for unseen inputs. In classical statistics, the predictive error is understood as a trade-off between the bias and the variance that balances model simplicity with its ability to fit complex functions. However, over-parameterized models exhibit counter-intuitive behaviors, such as "double descent" in which models of increasing complexity exhibit decreasing generalization error. We introduce an alternative paradigm called the generalized aliasing decomposition. We explain the asymptotically small error of complex models as a systematic "de-aliasing" that occurs in the over-parameterized regime. In the limit of large models, the contribution due to aliasing vanishes, leaving an expression for the asymptotic total error we call the invertibility failure of very large models on few training points. Because the generalized aliasing decomposition can be explicitly calculated from the relationship between model class and samples without seeing any data labels, it can answer questions related to experimental design and model selection before collecting data or performing experiments. We demonstrate this approach using several examples, including classical regression problems and a cluster expansion model used in materials science.</description>

      <title>Inferring Effect Ordering Without Causal Effect Estimation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.12532v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Predictive models are often employed to guide interventions across various domains, such as advertising, customer retention, and personalized medicine. These models often do not estimate the actual effects of interventions but serve as proxies, suggesting potential effectiveness based on predicted outcomes. Our paper addresses the critical question of when and how these predictive models can be interpreted causally, specifically focusing on using the models for inferring effect ordering rather than precise effect sizes. We formalize two assumptions, full latent mediation and latent monotonicity, that are jointly sufficient for inferring effect ordering without direct causal effect estimation. We explore the utility of these assumptions in assessing the feasibility of proxies for inferring effect ordering in scenarios where there is no data on how individuals behave when intervened or no data on the primary outcome of interest. Additionally, we provide practical guidelines for practitioners to make their own assessments about proxies. Our findings reveal not only when it is possible to reasonably infer effect ordering from proxies, but also conditions under which modeling these proxies can outperform direct effect estimation. This study underscores the importance of broadening causal inference to encompass alternative causal interpretations beyond effect estimation, offering a foundation for future research to enhance decision-making processes when direct effect estimation is not feasible.</description>

Abstract: Despite remarkable performance on a variety of tasks, many properties of deep neural networks are not yet theoretically understood. One such mystery is the depth degeneracy phenomenon: the deeper you make your network, the closer your network is to a constant function on initialization. In this paper, we examine the evolution of the angle between two inputs to a ReLU neural network as a function of the number of layers. By using combinatorial expansions, we find precise formulas for how fast this angle goes to zero as depth increases. These formulas capture microscopic fluctuations that are not visible in the popular framework of infinite width limits, and leads to qualitatively different predictions. We validate our theoretical results with Monte Carlo experiments and show that our results accurately approximate finite network behaviour. \review{We also empirically investigate how the depth degeneracy phenomenon can negatively impact training of real networks.} The formulas are given in terms of the mixed moments of correlated Gaussians passed through the ReLU function. We also find a surprising combinatorial connection between these mixed moments and the Bessel numbers that allows us to explicitly evaluate these moments.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Load Forecasting Based on Adaptive Online Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.14721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.14721v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Load forecasting is crucial for multiple energy management tasks such as scheduling generation capacity, planning supply and demand, and minimizing energy trade costs. Such relevance has increased even more in recent years due to the integration of renewable energies, electric cars, and microgrids. Conventional load forecasting techniques obtain single-value load forecasts by exploiting consumption patterns of past load demand. However, such techniques cannot assess intrinsic uncertainties in load demand, and cannot capture dynamic changes in consumption patterns. To address these problems, this paper presents a method for probabilistic load forecasting based on the adaptive online learning of hidden Markov models. We propose learning and forecasting techniques with theoretical guarantees, and experimentally assess their performance in multiple scenarios. In particular, we develop adaptive online learning techniques that update model parameters recursively, and sequential prediction techniques that obtain probabilistic forecasts using the most recent parameters. The performance of the method is evaluated using multiple datasets corresponding with regions that have different sizes and display assorted time-varying consumption patterns. The results show that the proposed method can significantly improve the performance of existing techniques for a wide range of scenarios.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Quantile Factor Analysis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.10301v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper extends quantile factor analysis to a probabilistic variant that incorporates regularization and computationally efficient variational approximations. We establish through synthetic and real data experiments that the proposed estimator can, in many cases, achieve better accuracy than a recently proposed loss-based estimator. We contribute to the factor analysis literature by extracting new indexes of \emph{low}, \emph{medium}, and \emph{high} economic policy uncertainty, as well as \emph{loose}, \emph{median}, and \emph{tight} financial conditions. We show that the high uncertainty and tight financial conditions indexes have superior predictive ability for various measures of economic activity. In a high-dimensional exercise involving about 1000 daily financial series, we find that quantile factors also provide superior out-of-sample information compared to mean or median factors.</description>

      <title>On Model Compression for Neural Networks: Framework, Algorithm, and Convergence Guarantee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06815v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model compression is a crucial part of deploying neural networks (NNs), especially when the memory and storage of computing devices are limited in many applications. This paper focuses on two model compression techniques: low-rank approximation and weight pruning in neural networks, which are very popular nowadays. However, training NN with low-rank approximation and weight pruning always suffers significant accuracy loss and convergence issues. In this paper, a holistic framework is proposed for model compression from a novel perspective of nonconvex optimization by designing an appropriate objective function. Then, we introduce NN-BCD, a block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to solve the nonconvex optimization. One advantage of our algorithm is that an efficient iteration scheme can be derived with closed-form, which is gradient-free. Therefore, our algorithm will not suffer from vanishing/exploding gradient problems. Furthermore, with the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz (K{\L}) property of our objective function, we show that our algorithm globally converges to a critical point at the rate of O(1/k), where k denotes the number of iterations. Lastly, extensive experiments with tensor train decomposition and weight pruning demonstrate the efficiency and superior performance of the proposed framework. Our code implementation is available at https://github.com/ChenyangLi-97/NN-BCD</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Gaussianization and Efficient Variational Bayes for Robust Bayesian Synthetic Likelihood</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.14746</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.14746v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Bayesian Synthetic Likelihood (BSL) method is a widely-used tool for likelihood-free Bayesian inference. This method assumes that some summary statistics are normally distributed, which can be incorrect in many applications. We propose a transformation, called the Wasserstein Gaussianization transformation, that uses a Wasserstein gradient flow to approximately transform the distribution of the summary statistics into a Gaussian distribution. BSL also implicitly requires compatibility between simulated summary statistics under the working model and the observed summary statistics. A robust BSL variant which achieves this has been developed in the recent literature. We combine the Wasserstein Gaussianization transformation with robust BSL, and an efficient Variational Bayes procedure for posterior approximation, to develop a highly efficient and reliable approximate Bayesian inference method for likelihood-free problems.</description>

      <title>Bottleneck Structure in Learned Features: Low-Dimension vs Regularity Tradeoff</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.19008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Previous work has shown that DNNs with large depth $L$ and $L_{2}$-regularization are biased towards learning low-dimensional representations of the inputs, which can be interpreted as minimizing a notion of rank $R^{(0)}(f)$ of the learned function $f$, conjectured to be the Bottleneck rank. We compute finite depth corrections to this result, revealing a measure $R^{(1)}$ of regularity which bounds the pseudo-determinant of the Jacobian $\left|Jf(x)\right|_{+}$ and is subadditive under composition and addition. This formalizes a balance between learning low-dimensional representations and minimizing complexity/irregularity in the feature maps, allowing the network to learn the `right' inner dimension. Finally, we prove the conjectured bottleneck structure in the learned features as $L\to\infty$: for large depths, almost all hidden representations are approximately $R^{(0)}(f)$-dimensional, and almost all weight matrices $W_{\ell}$ have $R^{(0)}(f)$ singular values close to 1 while the others are $O(L^{-\frac{1}{2}})$. Interestingly, the use of large learning rates is required to guarantee an order $O(L)$ NTK which in turns guarantees infinite depth convergence of the representations of almost all layers.</description>

      <title>Inverting estimating equations for causal inference on quantiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00987v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The causal inference literature frequently focuses on estimating the mean of the potential outcome, whereas quantiles of the potential outcome may carry important additional information. We propose a unified approach, based on the inverse estimating equations, to generalize a class of causal inference solutions from estimating the mean of the potential outcome to its quantiles. We assume that a moment function is available to identify the mean of the threshold-transformed potential outcome, based on which a convenient construction of the estimating equation of quantiles of potential outcome is proposed. In addition, we give a general construction of the efficient influence functions of the mean and quantiles of potential outcomes, and explicate their connection. We motivate estimators for the quantile estimands with the efficient influence function, and develop their asymptotic properties when either parametric models or data-adaptive machine learners are used to estimate the nuisance functions. A broad implication of our results is that one can rework the existing result for mean causal estimands to facilitate causal inference on quantiles. Our general results are illustrated by several analytical and numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Scalable Learning of Item Response Theory Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00680v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Item Response Theory (IRT) models aim to assess latent abilities of $n$ examinees along with latent difficulty characteristics of $m$ test items from categorical data that indicates the quality of their corresponding answers. Classical psychometric assessments are based on a relatively small number of examinees and items, say a class of $200$ students solving an exam comprising $10$ problems. More recent global large scale assessments such as PISA, or internet studies, may lead to significantly increased numbers of participants. Additionally, in the context of Machine Learning where algorithms take the role of examinees and data analysis problems take the role of items, both $n$ and $m$ may become very large, challenging the efficiency and scalability of computations. To learn the latent variables in IRT models from large data, we leverage the similarity of these models to logistic regression, which can be approximated accurately using small weighted subsets called coresets. We develop coresets for their use in alternating IRT training algorithms, facilitating scalable learning from large data.</description>

      <title>Training-free Graph Neural Networks and the Power of Labels as Features</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.19288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose training-free graph neural networks (TFGNNs), which can be used without training and can also be improved with optional training, for transductive node classification. We first advocate labels as features (LaF), which is an admissible but not explored technique. We show that LaF provably enhances the expressive power of graph neural networks. We design TFGNNs based on this analysis. In the experiments, we confirm that TFGNNs outperform existing GNNs in the training-free setting and converge with much fewer training iterations than traditional GNNs.</description>

      <title>Two Completely Parameter-Free Alternating Gradient Projection Algorithms for Nonconvex-(strongly) Concave Minimax Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to their importance in various emerging applications, efficient algorithms for solving minimax problems have recently received increasing attention. However, many existing algorithms require prior knowledge of the problem parameters in order to achieve optimal iteration complexity. In this paper, we propose two completely parameter-free alternating gradient projection algorithms, i.e., the PF-AGP-NSC algorithm and the PF-AGP-NC algorithm, to solve the smooth nonconvex-strongly concave and nonconvex-concave minimax problems respectively using a backtracking strategy, which does not require prior knowledge of parameters such as the Lipschtiz constant $L$ or the strongly concave constant $\mu$. Moreover, we show that the total number of gradient calls of the PF-AGP-NSC algorithm and the PF-AGP-NC algorithm to obtain an $\varepsilon$-stationary point is upper bounded by $\mathcal{O}\left( L\kappa^3\varepsilon^{-2} \right)$ and $\mathcal{O}\left( L^4\varepsilon^{-4} \right)$ respectively, where $\kappa$ is the condition number. As far as we know, the PF-AGP-NSC algorithm and the PF-AGP-NC algorithm are the first completely parameter-free algorithms for solving nonconvex-strongly concave minimax problems and nonconvex-concave minimax problems respectively. Numerical results validate the efficiency of the proposed PF-AGP algorithm.</description>

      <title>Peer-induced Fairness: A Causal Approach to Reveal Algorithmic Unfairness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework, "peer-induced fairness", to scientifically audit algorithmic fairness. It addresses a critical but often overlooked issue: distinguishing between adverse outcomes due to algorithmic discrimination and those resulting from individuals' insufficient capabilities. By utilizing counterfactual fairness and advanced causal inference techniques, such as the Single World Intervention Graph, this model-agnostic approach evaluates fairness at the individual level through peer comparisons and hypothesis testing. It also tackles challenges like data scarcity and imbalance, offering a flexible, plug-and-play self-audit tool for stakeholders and an external audit tool for regulators, while providing explainable feedback for those affected by unfavorable decisions.</description>
