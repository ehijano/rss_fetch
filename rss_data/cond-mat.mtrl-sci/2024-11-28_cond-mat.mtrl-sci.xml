      <title>Learning Mean First Passage Time: Chemical Short-Range Order and Kinetics of Diffusive Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long-timescale processes pose significant challenges in atomistic simulations, particularly for phenomena such as diffusion and phase transitions. We present a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based computational framework, combined with a temporal difference (TD) learning method, to simulate long-timescale atomic processes of diffusive relaxation. We apply it to study the emergence of chemical short-range order (SRO) in medium- and high-entropy alloys (MEAs/HEAs), which plays a crucial role in unlocking unique material properties, and find that the proposed method effectively maps the relationship between time, temperature, and SRO change. By accelerating both the sampling of lower-energy states and the simulation of transition kinetics, we identify the thermodynamic limit and the role of kinetic trapping in the SRO. Furthermore, learning the mean first passage time to a given, target SRO relaxation allows capturing realistic timescales in diffusive atomistic rearrangements. This method offers valuable guidelines for optimizing material processing and extends atomistic simulations to previously inaccessible timescales, facilitating the study of slow, thermally activated processes essential for understanding and engineering material properties.</description>

      <title>Compositional and Interface Engineering of Hybrid Metal Halide Perovskite Thin Films for Solar Cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are the fastest-growing photovoltaic (PV) technology in the solar cell community and have reached an efficiency close to that of commercial silicon (Si) solar cells. The organic-inorganic halide perovskite solar cell is an emerging PV technology and grabbed much attention due to its low cost, high efficiency, and ease of fabrication at lower temperatures 100-200 C by solution-processed spin coating or thermal evaporation techniques. Further, we introduce a self-assembled monolayer (SAM) based hole transport layer (HTL) in the p-i-n device architecture PSC. In this work, we used the mixing engineering strategy of SAM with a conjugated polyelectrolyte. We dealt with the hydrophobicity and tailored the work function of the mixed SAM based HTL. Therefore, the HTL/perovskite interface is engineered, and associated device physics is discussed. In addition, we observed the lowest dark current for specific mixed (9:1) HTL, which is a prerequisite in photodetector applications. Therefore, a detailed photodetection analysis is discussed to study the scalable photodetector device. This thesis thoroughly studies perovskite compositional and interface engineering via various optoelectronic measurements. An in-depth device physics is discussed to study the interfacial defects between the charge transport and the perovskite layers. This thesis will be helpful in exploring a new class of perovskite materials and interface modification engineering for fabricating reproducible, stable, and highly efficient hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskite solar cells.</description>

      <title>A Size-Dependent Ideal Solution Model for Liquid-Solid Phase Equilibria Prediction in Aqueous Organic Solutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Predictive synthesis of aqueous organic solutions with desired liquid-solid phase equilibria could drive progress in industrial chemistry, cryopreservation, and beyond, but is limited by the predictive power of current solution thermodynamics models. In particular, few analytical models enable accurate liquidus and eutectic prediction based only on bulk thermodynamic properties of the pure components, requiring instead either direct measurement or costly simulation of solution properties. In this work, we demonstrate that a simple modification to the canonical ideal solution theory accounting for the entopic effects of dissimilar molecule sizes can transform its predictive power, while offering new insight into the thermodynamic nature of aqueous organic solutions. Incorporating a Flory-style entropy of mixing term that includes both the mole and volume fractions of each component, we derive size-dependent equations for the ideal chemical potential and liquidus temperature, and use them to predict the binary phase diagrams of water and 10 organic solutes of varying sizes. We show that size-dependent prediction outperforms the ideal model in all cases, reducing average error in the predicted liquidus temperature by 59\%, eutectic temperature by 45\%, and eutectic composition by 43\%, as compared to experimental data. Furthermore, by retaining the ideal assumption that the enthalpy of mixing is zero, we demonstrate that for aqueous organic solutions, much of the deviation from ideality that is typically attributed to molecular interactions may in fact be explained by simple entropic size effects. These results suggest an underappreciated dominance of mixing entropy in these solutions, and provide a simple approach to predicting their phase equilibria.</description>

      <title>PyMatterSim: a Python Data Analysis Library for Computer Simulations of Materials Science, Physics, Chemistry, and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computer simulation has become one of the most important tools in scientific research in many disciplines. Benefiting from the dynamical trajectories regulated by versatile interatomic interactions, various material properties can be quantitatively characterized at the atomic scale. This greatly deepens our understanding of Nature and provides incredible insights supplementing experimental observations. Hitherto, a plethora of literature discusses the computational discoveries in studying glasses in which positional disorder is inherent in their configurations. Motivated by active research and knowledge sharing, we developed a data analysis library in Python for computational materials science research. We hope to help promote scientific progress and narrow some technical gaps for the wide communities. The toolkit mainly focuses on physical analyses of glassy properties from the open-source simulator LAMMPS. Nevertheless, the code design renders high flexibility, with functionalities extendable to other computational tools. The library provides data-driven insights for different subjects and can be incorporated into advanced machine-learning workflows. The scope of the data analysis methodologies applies not only to materials science but also to physics, chemistry, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Pressure Dependence of Ultrafast Carrier Dynamics in Excitonic Insulator Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An excitonic insulator (EI) phase is a consequence of collective many-body effects where an optical band gap is formed by the condensation of electron-hole pairs or excitons. We report pressure-dependent optical pump optical probe spectroscopy of EI Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ in an on-site in situ geometry. The fast relaxation process depicts the transition across P$_{C_1}$ $\sim$1 GPa from EI phase to a semiconductor and P$_{C_2}$ $\sim$3 GPa from a semiconductor to a semimetallic phase. The instability of the EI phase beyond P$_{C_1}$ is captured by the Rothwarf-Taylor model by incorporating the decrease of the bandgap under pressure. The pressure coefficient of the bandgap decreases, 65 meV/GPa closely agrees with the first principle calculations.</description>

      <title>Selective synthesis of large-area monolayer tin sulfide from simple substances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both tin monosulfide (SnS) and tin disulfide (SnS2) are thermodynamically stable layered materials with potential for spin-valleytronic devices and photodetectors. Notably, monolayer SnS, owing to its low symmetry, exhibits interesting properties such as ferroelectricity, shift-current, and a persistent spin helix state in the monolayer limit. However, creating atomic-thickness crystals of SnS is challenging owing to the enhanced interlayer interactions caused by lone pair electrons, unlike to SnS2. Here, we demonstrate that p-type SnS can be selectively grown by simply varying the sulfur vapor concentration relative to tin using single-element precursors. We show that monolayer SnS crystals, up to several tens of micrometers in lateral scale, can be easily and safely obtained by high-temperature etching of bulk SnS in a pure nitrogen gas atmosphere. These findings pave the way for device applications based on high-quality tin sulfide.</description>

      <title>Open-shell TADF: Quartet-derived luminescence with dark radicals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-spin states in organic molecules offer promising tuneability for quantum technologies. Photogenerated quartet excitons are an extensively studied platform, but their applications are limited by the absence of optical read-out via luminescence. Here we demonstrate a new class of synthetically accessible molecules with quartet-derived luminescence, formed by appending a non-luminescent TEMPO radical to Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) chromophores previously used in OLEDs. The low singlet-triplet energy gap of the chromophore opens a luminescence channel from radical-triplet coupled states. We establish a set of design rules by tuning the energetics in a series of compounds based on a naphthalimide (NAI) core. We observe generation of quartet states and measure the strength of radical-triplet exchange (0.7 GHz). In DMAC-TEMPO, up to 72% of detected photons emerge after reverse intersystem crossing from the quartet state repopulates the state with singlet character. This design strategy does not rely on a luminescent radical to provide an emission pathway from the high-spin state. The large library of TADF chromophores promises a greater pallet of achievable emission colours.</description>

      <title>Half-metallic to ferromagnetic phase transition in CrSH monolayer using DFT+U and BO-MD calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive investigation of the structural, electronic, magnetic, and vibrational properties of CrSH monolayers in the 1T and 2H phases using density functional theory (DFT)+U calculations with a converged Hubbard U value of 5.54 eV and Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics (BO-MD) simulations. The ferromagnetic (FM) 1T-CrSH phase is found to be dynamically and thermodynamically stable, exhibiting semiconducting behavior with a band gap of 1.1 eV and a magnetic moment of 3.0 $\mu$B per Cr atom. On the other hand, the 2H-CrSH phase is a half-metallic (HM) phase. We found that it is a metastable phase and undergoes a rapid phase transition to the 1T phase under finite temperature at 300 K. Phonon calculations, performed using the finite displacement method and corrected for rotational invariance corrections with Huang and Born-Huang sum rules, resolve spurious imaginary frequencies in the flexural ZA phonon mode near the $\Gamma$-point, ensuring physical accuracy. These findings establish CrSH monolayers as promising candidates for spintronic and valleytronic applications, with tunable electronic properties enabled by phase engineering.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of the spin waves of a synthetic antiferromagnet grown on a piezoelectric substrate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18202v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient coupling between magnons and phonons requires material platforms that contain magnetic multilayers with versatile high-frequency properties grown on piezoelectric substrates with large electromechanical coupling coefficients. One of these systems is the CoFeB/Ru/CoFeB Synthetic antiferromagnet grown on Lithium Niobate substrate. We investigate its microwave magnetic properties using a combination of ferromagnetic resonance and propagating spin wave spectroscopy, from which we extract the dispersion relation of the acoustic branch of spin waves. The frequency and the linewidth of this spin wave resonance, its field dependence and its dispersion relation indicate that the magnetic properties are as good as when grown on standard non-piezoelectric substrates, as well as being in line with theory. This new material platform opens opportunities to extend microwave acousto-magnonics beyond the use of single layer magnets.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable Exchange Bias and Voltage-controlled Magnetization Switching in a van der Waals Ferromagnet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of van der Waals magnets has established a new domain in the field of magnetism, opening novel pathways for the electrical control of magnetic properties. In this context, Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) emerges as an exemplary candidate owing to its intrinsic metallic properties, which facilitate the interplay of both charge and spin degrees of freedom. Here, the bidirectional voltage control of exchange bias (EB) effect in a perpendicularly magnetized all-van der Waals FGT/O-FGT/hBN heterostructure is demonstrated. The antiferromagnetic O-FGT layer is formed by naturally oxidizing the FGT surface. The observed EB magnitude reaches 1.4 kOe with a blocking temperature (150 K) reaching close to the Curie temperature of FGT. Both the exchange field and the blocking temperature values are among the highest in the context of layered materials. The EB modulation exhibits a linear dependence on the gate voltage and its polarity, observable in both positive and negative field cooling (FC) experiments. Additionally, gate voltage-controlled magnetization switching, highlighting the potential of FGT-based heterostructures is demonstrated in advanced spintronic devices. These findings display a methodology to modulate the magnetism of van der Waals magnets offering new avenues for the development of high-performance magnetic devices.</description>

      <title>Stability and Dynamics of Skyrmion and Skyrmion Bags Explored under the Influence of Out-of-Plane Strain and Its Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skyrmions as well as skyrmion bags in magnetic thin films are promising candidates for future high-density memory devices. The observation of skyrmion bags in liquid crystals and their predicted existence in ferromagnetic films has sparked theoretical studies on current induced dynamics of these topological charges. Here using micromagnetism, we study the impact of out of plane strain on the stability of skyrmion and skyrmion bags in ferromagnetic thin film. We further studied the current induced dynamics in the presence of out of plane strain gradient. We demonstrate that out of plane strain gradient direction with respect to the electron flow can be an efficient way to control the dynamics of topological charges. Specifically, the deflection of skyrmion bags correlates with their topological degree, and an appropriate strain gradient can counteract skyrmion Hall effects, enabling straight-line movement. Our micromagnetic simulations align well with theoretical predictions from the Thiele equation.</description>

Abstract: Spin noise spectroscopy is a technique to measure magnetization fluctuations, a subject of increasing relevance in ultrafast spintronics. We investigate numerically the equilibrium spin noise of ferro- and antiferromagnets within an atomistic spin model. The aim is to predict the possible outcomes of ultrafast spin-noise spectroscopy measurements and demonstrate what relevant information can be extracted. Specifically, we show how this method can be used to determine phase transitions, frequencies of magnon modes and correlation times.</description>

      <title>Accurate electron correlation-energy functional: Expansion in an interaction renormalized by the random-phase approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an accurate local density-functional for electronic-structure calculations within the density functional theory (DFT). The functional is derived by analyzing the structure of the standard perturbative expansion of the correlation energy of the interacting uniform electron gas. Then, the expansion is partially re-summed and reorganized as a self-consistent series in powers of a renormalized electron-electron interaction vertex based on the screened frequency-momentum dependent dielectric matrix given by the well-known random-phase approximation. First, we demonstrate that the range of $r_s$, where this reorganized and renormalized series converges, contains and is significantly larger than the average range realized in real crystalline materials. Using a combination of analytical, numerical, and stochastic integration techniques we are able to calculate all the diagrams which have contribution up to the same leading order. We benchmarked the functional using the Quantum ESPRESSO implementation of the DFT applied to the same list of materials, selected previously by other authors, in its entirety without any modification of the list. We find that for ground-state properties in general, such as, equilibrium atomic distances and bulk moduli, the functional presented here is more accurate than the currently available most popular one.</description>

      <title>The thermodynamics of CaSiO3 in Earth's lower mantle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18489</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18489v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The lower mantle of Earth, characterized by pressures of 24-127 GPa and temperatures of 1900-2600 K, is still inaccessible to direct observations. In this work, we investigate by first principles the stability, phase diagram, elastic properties, and thermal conductivity of CaSiO3, that constitutes a significant component of Earth's lower mantle. Notably, our simulations capture in full the anharmonic ionic fluctuations arising from the extreme temperatures and pressures of the lower mantle, thanks to the use of stochastic self-consistant harmonic approximation (SSCHA). We show that the cubic phase of CaSiO3 is the stable state at the lower mantle's thermodynamic conditions. The phase boundary between the cubic and tetragonal phases is of first-order and increases linearly from 300 K to 1000 K between 12 GPa and 100 GPa. Accounting for temperature-renormalized phonon dispersions, we evaluate the speed of sound as a function of depth. Our results downplay the role of octahedral rotations on the transverse sound velocity of cubic CaSiO3, advocated in the past to explain discrepancies between theory and experiments. The lattice thermal conductivity, assessed thanks to the recently introduced Wigner formalism, shows a predominance of particle-like transport, thus justifying the use of the standard Boltzmann transport equation even in a system with such strong ionic anharmonicity.</description>

      <title>Interstitial Solute Segregation at Triple Junctions: Implications for the Hydrogen Storage Properties of Nanomaterials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18537v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At very fine grain sizes, grain boundary segregation can deviate from conventional behavior due to triple junction effects. While this issue has been addressed in prior work for substitutional alloys, here we develop a framework that accounts for interstitial sites in the grains, grain boundaries, and triple junctions of model Pd(H) polycrystals. This approach allows computation of interstitial segregation spectra separately at both defect types, which permits an understanding of segregation at all grain sizes via a size-scaling spectral isotherm. The size dependencies of dilute Pd(H) are found to be influenced not only by the triple junction content, but also by grain size-dependent lattice strains; the latter effect is evidenced by size dependencies of individual grain boundary and junction subspectra. The framework proposed here is applicable to interstitial alloys in general, and may serve as a basis for interfacial engineering in interstitial nanocrystalline alloys. As an example, we show using the dilute limit isotherm that hydrogen density can triple in nanocrystalline vis-\`a-vis microcrystalline Pd due to hydrogen adsorption at intergranular defect sites.</description>

      <title>Absolute intensity normalisation of powder neutron scattering data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important property of neutron scattering data is that they can be normalised in absolute intensity units. In practice, however, such normalisation is often not performed, since it can be time-consuming and subject to systematic uncertainties. Here, a straightforward approach is presented for absolute intensity normalisation of neutron scattering data from polycrystalline samples. This approach uses the intensity scale factor obtained from a Rietveld refinement to normalise the data to the nuclear Bragg profile of the sample. Factors to convert the Rietveld scale factor into an absolute normalisation factor are tabulated for constant-wavelength and time-of-flight data refined using the popular programs Fullprof and GSAS-II. An example of the application of this method to experimental data is presented. Advantages, disadvantages, and extensions of this approach to spectroscopic data are discussed.</description>

      <title>Preserving SOC for enhancement of spin-to-charge conversion efficiency via Cu intercalation in MoS$_2$/CoFeB heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18582v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a novel type of quantum materials that could be used in spintronics, optoelectronics, valleytronics and opto-valleytronics. The phenomena of spinto-charge conversion at the interface between sputtered magnetic materials and transition metal dichalcogenides have gained attention for designing fast and ultra-low power consumption devices that are applicable for spintronic-based applications. Here, we report a remarkable enhancement of spin-to-charge conversion efficiency in MoS$_2$/CoFeB heterostructures via Cu intercalation. In this context, magneto-optic Kerr effect-based microscopy reveals the absence of substantial domain modification due to Cu which indicates that Cu successfully detaches MoS2 from CoFeB. This shows that Cu interlayer is protecting the spin orbit coupling (SOC) of MoS$_2$ from exchange interaction with CoFeB, since the proximity with local magnetization can alter the electronic structure and hence the SOC. Further, via first-principles calculations, it is found that notable improvements in spin Berry curvature and spin Hall conductivity occur via the Cu intercalation which in turn increases the spin Hall angle. We have shown here that one can modify interfaces of ferromagnet and transition metal dichalcogenides-based heterostructures to achieve higher efficiencies of spin-tocharge conversion across them for extended functionalities and its relevance in spin orbit torquebased applications.</description>

      <title>Magnetic-field dependence of spin-phonon relaxation and dephasing due to g-factor fluctuations from first principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin relaxation of electrons in materials involve both reversible dephasing and irreversible decoherence processes. Their interplay leads to a complex dependence of spin relaxation times on the direction and magnitude of magnetic fields, relevant for spintronics and quantum information applications. Here, we use real-time first-principles density matrix dynamics simulations to directly simulate Hahn echo measurements, disentangle dephasing from decoherence, and predict T1, T2 and T2* spin lifetimes. We show that g-factor fluctuations lead to non-trivial magnetic field dependence of each of these lifetimes in inversion-symmetric crystals of CsPbBr3 and silicon, even when only intrinsic spin-phonon scattering is present. Most importantly, fluctuations in the off-diagonal components of the g-tensor lead to a strong magnetic field dependence of even the T1 lifetime in silicon. Our calculations elucidate the detailed role of anisotropic g-factors in determining the spin dynamics even in simple, low spin-orbit coupling materials such as silicon.</description>

      <title>Deciphering Acoustic Emission with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Acoustic emission signals have been shown to accompany avalanche-like events in materials, such as dislocation avalanches in crystalline solids, collapse of voids in porous matter or domain wall movement in ferroics. The data provided by acoustic emission measurements is tremendously rich, but it is rather challenging to precisely connect it to the characteristics of the triggering avalanche. In our work we propose a machine learning based method with which one can infer microscopic details of dislocation avalanches in micropillar compression tests from merely acoustic emission data. As it is demonstrated in the paper, this approach is suitable for the prediction of the force-time response as it can provide outstanding prediction for the temporal location of avalanches and can also predict the magnitude of individual deformation events. Various descriptors (including frequency dependent and independent ones) are utilised in our machine learning approach and their importance in the prediction is analysed. The transferability of the method to other specimen sizes is also demonstrated and the possible application in more generic settings is discussed.</description>

      <title>Localized obstructed pairs with zero superfluid stiffness from doping an antiferromagnetic insulator</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17815v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic interactions play an important role in the pairing mechanism of strongly correlated superconductors, many of which share the layered oxide structure characteristic of the cuprate, nickelate, osmate, cobaltate, ruthenate, iridate family of high-temperature superconductors. We explore the consequences of strong magnetic interactions in a lattice model of strongly-interacting d-electrons separated by weakly-interacting p-electrons. In contrast with conventional t-J models where magnetic exchange emerges in the strong-coupling expansion of Hubbard-type models, in this framework Coulomb blockade emerges in the strong-coupling limit of spin-spin interactions. This results in an insulator at fractional filling without Hubbard interactions. Doping this correlated insulator creates localized Cooper pairs that live on the edges of a square lattice, with a d-wave form-factor. They realize the flat-band eigenfunction of the checkerboard lattice Hamiltonian, and have zero kinetic energy. We present a mean-field theory of superconductivity interpolating between this interaction-localized strong-pairing limit with d-wave Bose-Einstein condensation and a weak-pairing limit with a nodal Fermi surface gap, where the superfluid stiffness scale is controlled by the electron hopping integrals and the density, as usual. The pair wavefunction connects d-wave and s-wave molecular orbitals, so that the intra-band gap on the Fermi surface is parametrically smaller than the off-shell inter-band gap. We provide experimental predictions for this scenario of local pairing on link-orbitals, and strong incentive for ab-initio calculation of the relevant local energy scales in the strongly correlated materials tied together by the structural motif of ligands on links.</description>

      <title>Merging high localization and TE-TM polarization degeneracy of guided waves in dielectric metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The polarization degree of freedom is an inherent feature of plane waves propagating in an isotropic homogeneous medium. The miniaturization of optical systems leads to the high localization of electromagnetic waves, but also to the loss of polarization control, namely, breaking TE-TM polarization degeneracy. In this work, we discover the near-field polarization degree of freedom for highly localized guided waves propagating along a dielectric metasurface. We demonstrate the opportunity to create a metasurface with the degenerate TE-TM polarization spectrum for the required operating wavelength and different constitutive materials. In particular, we analyze several possible implementations including silicon nitride and ceramic metasurfaces consisting of disk-shaped resonators, and evaluate the impact of substrate. Finally, we experimentally implement one of the metasurface designs and verify its broadband degenerate TE-TM polarization spectrum. The obtained results form a fundamentally new platform for the planar polarization devices utilizing the polarization degree of freedom of localized light.</description>

      <title>SPARC-X-API: Versatile Python Interface for Real-space Density Functional Theory Calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18024v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is the de facto workhorse for large-scale electronic structure calculations in chemistry and materials science. While plane-wave DFT implementations remain the most widely used, real-space DFT provides advantages in handling complex boundary conditions and scaling to very large systems by allowing for the efficient use of large-scale supercomputers and linear-scaling methods that circumvent the cubic scaling bottleneck. The SPARC-X project (https://github.com/SPARC-X) provides highly efficient and portable real-space DFT codes for a wide range of first principle applications, available in both Matlab (M-SPARC) and C/C++ (SPARC). The rapid growth of SPARC's feature set has created the need for a fully functional interface to drive SPARC in high-throughput calculations. Here we introduce SPARC-X-API, a Python package designed to bridge the SPARC-X project with broader computational frameworks. Built on the atomic simulation environment (ASE) standard, the SPARC-X-API allows users to handle SPARC file formats and run SPARC calculations through the same interface as with other ASE-compatible DFT packages. Beyond standard ASE capabilities, SPARC-X-API provides additional features including 1) support of SPARC-specific setups, including complex boundary conditions and unit conversion, 2) a JSON schema parsed from SPARC's documentation for parameter validation and compatibility checks, and 3) a comprehensive socket communication layer derived from the i-PI protocol facilitating message passing between low-level C code and the Python interface. The goal of the SPARC-X-API is to provide an easy-to-use interface for users with diverse needs and levels of expertise, allowing for minimal effort in adapting SPARC to existing computational workflows, while also supporting developers of advanced real-space methods.</description>

      <title>Structural and magnetic characterization of CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with two-dimensional pseudospin-1/2 triangular lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Triangular lattice antiferromagnets are prototypes for frustrated magnetism and may potentially realize novel quantum magnetic states such as a quantum spin liquid ground state. A recent work suggests NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with rare-earth triangular lattice is a quantum spin liquid candidate and highlights the large family of rare-earth heptatantalates as a framework for quantum magnetism investigation. In this paper, we report the structural and magnetic characterization of CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$. Both compounds are isostructural to NdTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with no detectable structural disorder. For CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$, the crystal field energy levels and parameters are determined by inelastic neutron scattering measurements. Based on the crystal field result, the magnetic susceptibility data could be well fitted and explained, which reveals that CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ is a highly anisotropic Ising triangular-lattice antiferromagnet ($g_z$/$g_{xy}$$\sim$3) with very weak exchange interaction (J$\sim$0.22~K). For YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$, millimeter sized single crystals could be grown. The anisotropic magnetization and electron spin resonance data show that YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$ has a contrasting in-plane magnetic anisotropy with $g_z$/$g_{xy}$$\sim$0.67 similar as that of YbMgGaO$_4$. The above results indicate that CeTa$_7$O$_{19}$ and YbTa$_7$O$_{19}$ with pseudospin-1/2 ground states might either be quantum spin liquid candidate materials or find applications in adiabatic demagnetization refrigeration due to the weak exchange interaction.</description>

      <title>Realization of a one-dimensional topological insulator in ultrathin germanene nanoribbons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Realizing a one-dimensional (1D) topological insulator and identifying the lower dimensional limit of two-dimensional (2D) behavior are crucial steps toward developing high-density quantum state networks, advancing topological quantum computing, and exploring dimensionality effects in topological materials. Although 2D topological insulators have been experimentally realized, their lower dimensional limit and 1D counterparts remain elusive. Here, we fabricated and characterized arrays of zigzag-terminated germanene nanoribbons, a 2D topological insulator with a large topological bulk gap. The electronic properties of these nanoribbons strongly depend on their width, with topological edge states persisting down to a critical width (approx. 2 nm), defining the limit of 2D topology. Below this threshold, contrary to the tenfold way classification, we observe zero-dimensional (0D) states localized at the ends of the ultrathin nanoribbons. These end states, topologically protected by time-reversal and mirror symmetries, mark the first realization of a 1D topological insulator with strong spin-orbit coupling. Our findings establish germanene nanoribbons as a platform for investigating 1D topology and dimensionality effects in topological materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum annealing, which involves quantum tunnelling among possible solutions, has state-of-the-art applications not only in quickly finding the lowest-energy configuration of a complex system, but also in quantum computing. Here we report a single-crystal study of the frustrated magnet $\alpha$-CoV$_2$O$_6$, consisting of a triangular arrangement of ferromagnetic Ising spin chains without evident structural disorder. We observe quantum annealing phenomena resulting from time-reversal symmetry breaking in a tiny transverse field. Below $\sim$ 1 K, the system exhibits no indication of approaching the lowest-energy state for at least 15 hours in zero transverse field, but quickly converges towards that configuration with a nearly temperature-independent relaxation time of $\sim$ 10 seconds in a transverse field of $\sim$ 3.5 mK. Our many-body simulations show qualitative agreement with the experimental results, and suggest that a tiny transverse field can profoundly enhance quantum spin fluctuations, triggering rapid quantum annealing process from topological metastable Kosterlitz-Thouless phases, at low temperatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18175v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inhomogeneity-governed carrier localization has been investigated in three sets of InGaN/GaN multi-quantum-disk light-emitting diode (LED) structures grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) under different process conditions. A temperature-dependent study of the luminescence peak positions reveals that samples prepared under certain process conditions exhibit a thermal distribution of carriers from the localized states that show the typical S-shaped dependence in luminescence characteristics. The absence of an S-shaped nature in the other sample prepared with relatively higher In-flux infers a superior homogeneity in alloy composition. Further investigation manifested superior optical properties for the samples where the S-shape nature is found to be absent.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The numerical study of high-dimensional frustrated quantum magnets remains a challenging problem. Here we present an extension of the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group to spin-1/2 XXZ type Hamiltonians with field or magnetization along spin-Z direction at finite temperature. We consider a $U(1)$ symmetry-adapted fermionic spin representation and derive the diagrammatic framework and its renormalization group flow equations. We discuss benchmark results and application to two anti-ferromagnetic triangular lattice materials recently studied in experiments with applied magnetic fields: First, we numerically reproduce the magnetization data measured for CeMgAl$_{11}$O$_{19}$ confirming model parameters previously estimated from inelastic neutron spectrum in high fields. Second, we showcase the accuracy of our method by studying the thermal phase transition into the spin solid up-up-down phase of Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ in good agreement with experiment.</description>

      <title>Nature of metallic and insulating domains in the CDW system 1T-TaSe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18205v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the electronic structure of bulk 1T-TaSe$_2$ in the charge density wave phase at low temperature. Our spatially and angle resolved photoemission (ARPES) data show insulating areas coexisting with metallic regions characterized by a chiral Fermi surface and moderately correlated quasiparticle bands. Additionally, high-resolution laser ARPES reveals variations in the metallic regions, with series of low-energy states, whose energy, number and dispersion can be explained by the formation of quantum well states of different thicknesses. Dynamical mean field theory calculations show that the observed rich behaviour can be rationalized by assuming occasional stacking faults of the charge density wave. Our results indicate that the diverse electronic phenomena reported previously in 1T-TaSe$_2$ are dictated by the stacking arrangement and the resulting quantum size effects while correlation effects play a secondary role.</description>

      <title>Highly-stable, eco-friendly and selective Cs2AgBiBr6 perovskite-based ozone sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18228v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lead halide perovskites have attracted considerable attention as potential gas sensing elements due to their unique ability to detect and respond to an external stimulus with measurable electrical or optical signals. The distinctive characteristics of these materials lie in their ability to operate upon gas exposure at room temperature. However, the presence of lead (Pb) poses a serious challenge for their widespread application and commercialization, owing to its toxicity. To address this issue, lead-free Cs2AgBiBr6 double perovskite is explored as a promising alternative sensing element for room temperature gas detection. This sensor can be regarded as eco-friendly for the following reasons: it does not contain Pb; it is synthesized at room temperature without using strong organic solvents; and it operates and recovers at room temperature without heating or UV irradiation and with a very low input voltage (0.1V), thus reducing overall energy consumption. The influence of the perovskite morphology on the ozone (O3) sensing performance is investigated, as well as the sensing stability under varying conditions of time, humidity, and temperature. Notably, the sensors' exceptional selectivity for O3 over other gases and the interaction between the gases and the perovskite surface is confirmed through experimental and first-principles calculations.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic, multiband, and strong-coupling superconductivity of the Pb0.64Bi0.36 alloy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents theoretical and experimental studies on the superconductivity of Pb${_{0.64}}$Bi$_{0.36}$ alloy, which is a prototype of strongly coupled superconductors and exhibits the strongest coupling under ambient pressure among the materials studied so far. The critical temperature, the specific heat in the superconducting state, and the magnetic critical fields are experimentally determined. Deviations from the single-gap s-wave BCS-like behavior are observed. The electronic structure, phonons and electron-phonon interactions are analyzed in relation to the metallic Pb, explaining why the Pb-Bi alloy exhibits such a large value of the electron-phonon coupling parameter $\lambda \simeq 2$. Superconductivity is studied using the isotropic Eliashberg formalism as well as the anisotropic density functional theory for superconductors. We find that while Pb is a two-gap superconductor with well-defined separate superconducting gaps, in the Pb-Bi alloy an overlapped three-gap-like structure is formed with a strong anisotropy. Furthermore, the chemical disorder, inherent to this alloy, leads to strong electron scattering, which is found to reduce the critical temperature.</description>

Abstract: By single crystal diffraction we characterize the chemo-structural disorder introduced by Zn-Cu site mixing in the kagom\'e spin $S$-1/2 systems herbertsmithite ZnCu$_3$(OH)$_6$Cl$_2$ and YCu$_3$(OH)$_{6}$Br$_{2}$[Br$_x$(OH)$_{1-x}$]. For an untwinned single crystal of herbertsmithite of composition Zn$_{0.95(1)}$Cu$_{2.99(3)}$O$_{5.9(1)}$H$_{5.8(1)}$Cl$_2$ we find substitution by Cu of the Zn atoms in the layers separating the kagom\'e layers as well as substantial Zn substitution for Cu in the kagom\'e layers. In YCu$_3$(OH)$_{6}$Br$_{2}$[Br$_x$(OH)$_{1-x}$] site mixing disorder is present for intermediate $x$. Analogous to the Cl homologous system in crystals with $x = 1/3$ disorder is absent and a low-temperature structural transition emerges driven by strong magneto-phonon coupling as a release of frustration. Apart from this structural anomaly we find the physical properties of these crystals unchanged compared to intermediate $x$ and closely resembling the Cl homologue where long-range magnetic order was observed.</description>

      <title>Scaling Up Purcell-Enhanced Self-Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18477v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scintillators, which convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons, play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films due to the localized nature of this effect. In this study, we present a method to extend nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-size plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) fold for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling further predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.63 $\pm$ 0.79) and (5.62 $\pm$ 1.71) fold for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. These findings provide a viable pathway for using nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.18515v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the experimental identification of magnetic compounds consisting of zigzag chains, we analyze the band structure topology of magnons in ferromagnets on a zigzag lattice. We account for the general lattice geometry by including spatially anisotropic Heisenberg exchange interactions and by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on inversion asymmetric bonds. Within the linear spin-wave theory, we find two magnon branches, whose band structure topology (i.e., Chern numbers) we map out in a comprehensive phase diagram. Notably, besides topologically trivial and gapless phases, we identify topologically nontrivial phases that support chiral edge magnons. We show that these edge states are robust against elastic defect scattering.</description>

Abstract: Energy materials with disorder in site occupation are challenging for computational studies due to an exponential scaling of the configuration space. We herein present a grand-canonical optimization method that enables the use of quantum annealing (QA) for sampling the ionic ground state. The method relies on a Legendre transformation of the Coulomb energy cost function that strongly reduces the effective coupling strengths of the fully connected problem, which is essential for effectiveness of QA. The approach is expected to be applicable to a variety of materials optimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00915v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite the ubiquity of ice, a molecular-resolution image of ice crystallized from liquid water or the resulting defect structure has never been obtained. Here, we report the stabilization and angstrom-resolution electron imaging of ice Ih crystallized from liquid water by developing cryogenic liquid-cell transmission electron microscopy (CRYOLIC-TEM). We combine lattice mapping with molecular dynamics simulations to reveal that ice formation is highly tolerant to nanoscale defects such as misoriented subdomains and trapped gas bubbles, which are stabilized by molecular-scale structural motifs. Importantly, bubble surfaces adopt low-energy nanofacets and create negligible strain fields in the surrounding crystal. These bubbles can dynamically nucleate, grow, migrate, dissolve, and coalesce under electron irradiation and be monitored in situ near a steady state. This work opens the door to understanding water crystallization behaviors at an unprecedented spatial resolution.</description>

      <title>GPU-Accelerated Solution of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation for Large and Heterogeneous Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a massively parallel, GPU-accelerated implementation of the Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) for the calculation of the vertical excitation energies (VEEs) and optical absorption spectra of condensed and molecular systems, starting from single-particle eigenvalues and eigenvectors obtained with density functional theory. The algorithms adopted here circumvent the slowly converging sums over empty and occupied states and the inversion of large dielectric matrices, through a density matrix perturbation theory approach and a low-rank decomposition of the screened Coulomb interaction, respectively. Further computational savings are achieved by exploiting the nearsightedness of the density matrix of semiconductors and insulators to reduce the number of screened Coulomb integrals. We scale our calculations to thousands of GPUs with a hierarchical loop and data distribution strategy. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated by computing the VEEs of several spin defects in wide-band-gap materials, showing that supercells with up to 1000 atoms are necessary to obtain converged results. We discuss the validity of the common approximation that solves the BSE with truncated sums over empty and occupied states. We then apply our GW-BSE implementation to a diamond lattice with 1727 atoms to study the symmetry breaking of triplet states caused by the interaction of a point defect with an extended line defect.</description>

      <title>Unconventional and Powerful Ion Sources for Solid-State Ion Exchange, Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4: Exemplified by Synthesis of Metastable \beta-CuGaO2 from Stable \beta-LiGaO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study introduces a new method for synthesizing Cu+-containing metastable phases through ion exchange. Traditionally, CuCl has been used as a Cu+ ion source for solid-state ion exchanges; however, its thermodynamic driving force is often insufficient for complete ion exchange with Li+-containing precursors. First-principles calculations have identified Cu2SO4 and Cu3PO4 as more powerful alternatives, providing a higher driving force than CuCl. It has been experimentally demon-strated that these ion sources can open up new reaction pathways through experimental ion exchanges, such as from \beta-LiGaO2 to \beta-CuGaO2, which were previously unattainable. An important perspective provided by this study is that the poten-tial of such basic compounds to act as powerful ion sources has been overlooked, and that they were identified through straightforward first-principles calculations. This work presents the initial strategic design of an ion exchange reaction by exploring suitable ion sources, thereby expanding the potential for synthesizing metastable materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of advanced materials is the cornerstone of human technological development and progress. The structures of materials and their corresponding properties are essentially the result of a complex interplay of multiple degrees of freedom such as lattice, charge, spin, symmetry, and topology. This poses significant challenges for the inverse design methods of materials. Humans have long explored new materials through a large number of experiments and proposed corresponding theoretical systems to predict new material properties and structures. With the improvement of computational power, researchers have gradually developed various electronic structure calculation methods, such as the density functional theory and high-throughput computational methods. Recently, the rapid development of artificial intelligence technology in the field of computer science has enabled the effective characterization of the implicit association between material properties and structures, thus opening up an efficient paradigm for the inverse design of functional materials. A significant progress has been made in inverse design of materials based on generative and discriminative models, attracting widespread attention from researchers. Considering this rapid technological progress, in this survey, we look back on the latest advancements in AI-driven inverse design of materials by introducing the background, key findings, and mainstream technological development routes. In addition, we summarize the remaining issues for future directions. This survey provides the latest overview of AI-driven inverse design of materials, which can serve as a useful resource for researchers.</description>

Abstract: The miniaturization of integrated circuits is facing an obstruction due to the escalating electrical resistivity of conventional copper interconnects. The underlying reason for this problem was unveiled by Fuchs and Sondheimer, who showed that thinner wires are more resistive because current-carrying electrons encounter the rough surfaces of the wire more frequently therein. Here, we present a generalization of the Fuchs-Sondheimer theory to Dirac and Weyl materials, which are candidates for next-generation interconnects. We predict a nonlinear longitudinal electric current originating from the combined action of the Berry curvature and non-specular surface-scattering.</description>

      <title>Revelation of new magnetic domain wall category and spin-density-wave boundary state in itinerant magnet</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15999v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional magnetic domain walls are typically characterized by the reorientation of local moments. However, what occurs at the boundary of itinerant magnets is largely unknown. Here using spin-sensitive scanning tunneling microscopy, we investigated the microscopic boundaries of spin-density-wave (SDW) state in a prototypical itinerant antiferromagnet - chromium (Cr). At the boundary of two incommensurate SDW domains, we observed that the spins undergo finite-scale decay rather than reorientation, which generated a double-Q SDW state accompanied by a second-order charge modulation. In the commensurate SDW domains, a clear SDW energy gap is observed. The screw dislocations induced "half" vortex and anti-vortex of SDW, paired by antiphase domain wall. We find the spin density vanished at such antiphase domain walls; while for the first time, we observed intriguing SDW in-gap states at the boundary, resembling the Andreev bound states in superconductors. These unique SDW boundary structures can be viewed as consequences of local interference of two SDWs, either with different Q or reversed phases. Our findings thus reveal a new category of magnetic domain wall - the "interference wall", with a mechanism rooted in itinerant nature of the system.</description>

      <title>Unusually high-density 2D electron gases in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures with GaN/AlN superlattice back barriers grown on sapphire substrates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12570v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We reported on the observation of extremely high-density ($&gt;10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$) 2D electron gas in N-polar AlGaN/GaN heterostructures grown on sapphire substrates. Due to introducing the GaN/AlN superlattice (SL) back barrier between the GaN buffer layer and AlGaN barrier layer, we observed a giant enhancement of the 2D electron gas density at the GaN/AlGaN interface from $3\times10^{13}$cm$^{-2}$ (without SL) to $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ (with SL back barrier) that is only one order of magnitude below the intrinsic crystal limit of $\approx10^{15}$cm$^{-2}$. We found that the changes of 2D electron gas density with SL correlated well with the changes of the wafer warp parameter which suggests that the strains are responsible for the 2D electron gas density enhancement (reduction of the piezoelectric polarization in the GaN channel). Nevertheless, this finding is probably insufficient to fully explain the observed high 2D electron gas density. Simultaneously, the room temperature electron mobility was 169 cm$^2$/Vs, which with the electron density of $1.4\times10^{14}$cm$^{-2}$ gives a low sheet resistance of 264 $\Omega$/sq (one of the lowest reported so far for the N-polar 2D electron gas channel). Finally, the possibility of application of such high-density 2D electron gas with low sheet resistance to transistors, emitters and detectors was discussed.</description>

Abstract: Photophysical aggregates are ubiquitous in many solid-state microstructures adopted by conjugated polymers, in which $\pi$ electrons interact with those in other polymer chains or those in other chromophores along the chain. These interactions fundamentally define the electronic and optical properties of the polymer film. While valuable insight can be gained from linear excitation and photoluminescence spectra, nonlinear coherent excitation spectral lineshapes provide intricate understanding on the electronic couplings that define the aggregate and their fluctuations. Here, we discuss the coherent two-dimensional excitation lineshape of a model hairy-rod conjugated polymer. At zero population waiting time, we find a $\pi/2$ phase shift between the 0-0 and 0-1 vibronic peaks in the real and imaginary components of the complex coherent spectrum, as well as a dynamic phase rotation with population waiting time over timescales that are longer than the optical dephasing time. We conjecture that these are markers of relaxation of the photophysical aggregate down the tight manifold of the exciton band. These results highlight the potential for coherent spectroscopy via analysis of the complex spectral lineshape to become a key tool to develop structure-property relationships in complex functional materials.</description>
