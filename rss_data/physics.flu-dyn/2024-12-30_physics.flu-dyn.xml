      <title>Computational Assessment of Turbulent Eddy Impact on Hydrodynamic Mixing in a Stirred Tank Bioreactor with Vent based Impellers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Homogeneity and efficient oxygen transfer are crucial for aerobic cultures, which is popularly performed in Stirred Tank Bioreactors, through internal mechanical agitation of the impellers.Although there are a number of impeller designs for achieving this purpose, there are still concerns about the ability of the impellers to yield homogeneity and mitigate or eliminate stagnant zones.In this study, a novel impeller design, with auxiliary agitators in form of vents, was introduced and evaluated for small lab-scale bioreactors. For the evaluation, 3D models of a single and double impeller configurations, placed in two different bioreactors were developed. Computational fluid dynamics was employed to carry out the hydrodynamic simulation using k-epsilon standard model in the bioreactors.Computational variables such as the flow velocity, streamlines, pressure and wall shear stress on the shaft and impellers, eddy viscosity, turbulence eddy dissipation and turbulence kinetic energy were obtained and compared in both bioreactors to evaluate the performances at speeds of 50, 100, and 150 revolutions per minute.A comparison of the results with traditional segment-segment and segment-Rushton impellers shows that our double impeller configuration performs more desirably at speeds ranging from 100 to 150 RPM. Homogeneity was also achieved in both bioreactors, and there was significant reduction of stagnant zone less than 99 percentage in the double impeller configuration and significant mitigation in the single impeller agitation.</description>

      <title>Implicit factorized transformer approach to fast prediction of turbulent channel flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transformer neural operators have recently become an effective approach for surrogate modeling of nonlinear systems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). In this paper, we introduce a modified implicit factorized transformer (IFactFormer-m) model which replaces the original chained factorized attention with parallel factorized attention. The IFactFormer-m model successfully performs long-term predictions for turbulent channel flow, whereas the original IFactFormer (IFactFormer-o), Fourier neural operator (FNO), and implicit Fourier neural operator (IFNO) exhibit a poor performance. Turbulent channel flows are simulated by direct numerical simulation using fine grids at friction Reynolds numbers $\text{Re}_{\tau}\approx 180,395,590$, and filtered to coarse grids for training neural operator. The neural operator takes the current flow field as input and predicts the flow field at the next time step, and long-term prediction is achieved in the posterior through an autoregressive approach. The prediction results show that IFactFormer-m, compared to other neural operators and the traditional large eddy simulation (LES) methods including dynamic Smagorinsky model (DSM) and the wall-adapted local eddy-viscosity (WALE) model, reduces prediction errors in the short term, and achieves stable and accurate long-term prediction of various statistical properties and flow structures, including the energy spectrum, mean streamwise velocity, root mean square (rms) values of fluctuating velocities, Reynolds shear stress, and spatial structures of instantaneous velocity. Moreover, the trained IFactFormer-m is much faster than traditional LES methods.</description>

      <title>Amplifying vortex shedding for energy harvesting with active flow control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy harvesting from vortex-induced vibrations is a promising technology that relies on the vibrations of bluff bodies due to vortex shedding. Increasing the vibration amplitude at a given free stream kinetic energy is therefore equivalent to enhancing the efficiency of the harvesting device. In this study, we assess the potential of alternate slot blowing to amplify force fluctuations. Pressurized air is ejected alternatingly from the top and bottom parts of the cylinder. Through experimentation in a low-speed wind tunnel ($Re=8,000$), we show that the magnitude of lift fluctuations can be enhanced by up to a factor of three compared to the unforced flow when the actuation is aligned with the natural vortex shedding frequency. Velocity field measurements indicate that this is caused by strong streamline bending whereas, at a higher forcing frequency, vortex shedding is suppressed. The results presented in this article suggest that a significant increase in the dynamic load acting on a cylinder can be achieved with carefully chosen active flow control parameters, thereby promoting future energy harvesting applications.</description>

      <title>Diffraction of walking drops by a standing Faraday wave</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18936</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Kapitza-Dirac effect is the diffraction of quantum particles by a standing wave of light. We here report an analogous phenomenon in pilot-wave hydrodynamics, wherein droplets walking across the surface of a vibrating liquid bath are deflected by a standing Faraday wave. We show that, in certain parameter regimes, the statistical distribution of the droplet deflection angles reveals a diffraction pattern reminiscent of that observed in the Kapitza-Dirac effect. Through experiments and simulations, we show that the diffraction pattern results from the complex interactions of the droplets with the standing wave. Our study highlights non-resonant effects associated with the detuning of the droplet bouncing and the bath vibration, which are shown to lead to drop speed variations and droplet sorting according to the droplet's phase of impact. We discuss the similarities and differences between our hydrodynamic system and the discrete and continuum interpretations of the Kapitza-Dirac effect, and introduce the notion of ponderomotive effects in pilot-wave hydrodynamics.</description>

      <title>Resolvent-based estimation and control of a laminar airfoil wake</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop an optimal resolvent-based estimator and controller to predict and attenuate unsteady vortex shedding fluctuations in the laminar wake of a NACA 0012 airfoil at an angle of attack of 6.5 degrees, chord-based Reynolds number of 5000, and Mach number of 0.3. The resolvent-based estimation and control framework offers several advantages over standard methods. Under equivalent assumptions, the resolvent-based estimator and controller reproduce the Kalman filter and LQG controller, respectively, but at substantially lower computational cost using either an operator-based or data-driven implementation. Unlike these methods, the resolvent-based approach can naturally accommodate forcing terms (nonlinear terms from Navier-Stokes) with colored-in-time statistics, significantly improving estimation accuracy and control efficacy. Causality is optimally enforced using a Wiener-Hopf formalism. We integrate these tools into a high-performance-computing-ready compressible flow solver and demonstrate their effectiveness for estimating and controlling velocity fluctuations in the wake of the airfoil immersed in clean and noisy freestreams, the latter of which prevents the flow from falling into a periodic limit cycle. Using four shear-stress sensors on the surface of the airfoil, the resolvent-based estimator predicts a series of downstream targets with approximately 3% and 30% error for the clean and noisy freestream conditions, respectively. For the latter case, using four actuators on the airfoil surface, the resolvent-based controller reduces the turbulent kinetic energy in the wake by 98%.</description>

      <title>Effects of Reynolds number and spatial resolution on the pressure source terms in turbulent boundary layers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increase in wall-pressure fluctuations with increasing friction Reynolds number ($Re_{\tau}$) of a turbulent boundary layer (TBL) is well known in the literature. However, very few studies have investigated the $Re_{\tau}$-variation of the source terms of the pressure fluctuations, which are solely a function of the spatial velocity gradients within the TBL. This study quantifies the pressure source terms in a zero-pressure gradient TBL by utilizing a published direct numerical simulation (DNS; Sillero et al. 2013, Phys. Fluids) database across 1000 $\lesssim$ $Re_{\tau}$ $\lesssim$ 2000. It is found that the magnitude of all source terms increases with $Re_{\tau}$ across the entire TBL thickness, with the turbulence-turbulence (non-linear) interaction terms growing faster than the mean-shear (linear) source terms. Further, we use the simulation database to mimic the scenario of particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiments that are typically spatially under-resolved compared to DNS data. It is used to quantify the effect of spatial resolution on the accuracy of pressure source terms, which are estimated here for two common PIV scenarios: (i) planar PIV in the streamwise-wall-normal plane, and (ii) stereo-PIV in the spanwise-wall-normal plane of a ZPG TBL. This exercise reveals significant attenuation of all pressure source terms compared to those estimated from the original DNS, highlighting the challenges of accurately estimating these source terms in a high $Re_{\tau}$ PIV experiment.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18751v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To express the capillary stress in the diffuse interface method, there are two different formulations in the literature: one formulation is proportional to the density and the other is to the density gradient. In the present study, we theoretically show that only the latter represents the capillary stress in one-component fluids and the former represents the stress related to the osmotic pressure.</description>

      <title>Optimal control for a class of linear transport-dominated systems via the shifted proper orthogonal decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving optimal control problems for transport-dominated partial differential equations (PDEs) can become computationally expensive, especially when dealing with high-dimensional systems. To overcome this challenge, we focus on developing and deriving reduced-order models that can replace the full PDE system in solving the optimal control problem. Specifically, we explore the use of the shifted proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) as a reduced-order model, which is particularly effective for capturing high-fidelity, low-dimensional representations of transport-dominated phenomena. Furthermore, we propose two distinct frameworks for addressing these problems: one where the reduced-order model is constructed first, followed by optimization of the reduced system, and another where the original PDE system is optimized first, with the reduced-order model subsequently applied to the optimality system. We consider a 1D linear advection equation problem and compare the computational performance of the shifted POD method against the conventional methods like the standard POD when the reduced-order models are used as surrogates within a backtracking line search.</description>

      <title>An efficient cell-centered nodal integral method for multi-dimensional Burgers equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An efficient coarse-mesh nodal integral method (NIM), based on cell-centered variables and referred to as cell-centered NIM (CCNIM), is developed and applied for solving multi-dimensional, time-dependent, Burgers equations. Unlike traditional NIM, which utilizes surface-averaged variables as discrete unknowns, this innovative approach formulates the final expression of the numerical scheme using discrete unknowns represented by cell-centered or node-averaged variables. By relying on these cell centroids, the proposed CCNIM approach presents several advantages compared to traditional NIM. These include a simplified implementation process in terms of local coordinate systems, enhanced flexibility regarding the higher order of accuracy in time, straightforward formulation for higher-degree temporal derivatives, and offering a viable option for coupling with other physics. The multidimensional time-dependent Burgers' problems with known analytical solutions are solved in order to validate the developed scheme. Furthermore, a detailed comparison between the proposed CCNIM approach and other traditional NIM schemes is conducted to showcase its effectiveness. The simplicity and robustness of the approach provide a strong foundation for its seamless extension to more complex fluid flow problems.</description>

      <title>Topology optimization for particle flow problems using Eulerian-Eulerian model with a finite difference method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle flow processing is widely employed across various industrial applications and technologies. Due to the complex interactions between particles and fluids, designing effective devices for particle flow processing is challenging. In this study, we propose a topology optimization method to design flow fields that effectively enhance the resistance encountered by particles. Particle flow is simulated using an Eulerian-Eulerian model based on a finite difference method. Automatic differentiation is implemented to compute sensitivities using a checkpointing algorithm. We formulate the optimization problem as maximizing the variation of drag force on particles while reducing fluid power dissipation. Initially, we validate the finite difference flow solver through numerical examples of particle flow problems and confirm that the corresponding topology optimization produces a result comparable to the benchmark problem. Furthermore, we investigate the effects of Reynolds and Stokes numbers on the optimized flow field. The numerical results indicate that serpentine flow fields can effectively enhance the variation in particle drag force.</description>

      <title>The semi-analytic theory and computation of finite-depth standing water waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a Stokes expansion ansatz for finite-depth standing water waves in two dimensions and devise a recursive algorithm to compute the expansion coefficients. We implement the algorithm on a supercomputer using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. The Stokes expansion introduces hyperbolic terms that require exponentiation of power series, which we handle efficiently using Bell polynomials. Although exact resonances occur at a countable dense set of fluid depths, we prove that for almost every depth, the divisors that arise in the recurrence are bounded away from zero by a slowly decaying function of the wave number. A direct connection between small divisors and imperfect bifurcations is observed. They are found to activate secondary standing waves that oscillate non-uniformly in space and time on top of the primary wave, with different amplitudes and phases on each bifurcation branch. We compute new families of standing waves using a shooting method and find that Pad\'e approximants of the Stokes expansion continue to converge to the shooting method solutions at large amplitudes as new small divisors enter the recurrence. Closely spaced poles and zeros of the Pad\'e approximants are observed that suggest that the bifurcation branches are separated by branch cuts.</description>

      <title>Mapping Driven Oscillations in the Size of a Bubble to the Dynamics of a Newtonian Particle in a Potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The non-linear dynamics of driven oscillations in the size of a spherical bubble are mapped to the dynamics of a Newtonian particle in a potential within the incompressible liquid regime. The compressible liquid regime, which is important during the bubble's sonic collapse, is approached adiabatically. This new framework naturally distinguishes between the two time scales involved in the non-linear oscillations of a bubble. It also explains the experimentally observed sharp rebound of the bubble upon collapse. Guided by this new vantage point, we develop analytical approximations for several key aspects of bubble motion. First, we formulate a tensile strength law that integrates the bubble's ideal gas behavior with a general polytropic index. Next, we establish a straightforward physical criterion for Bjerknes force reversal, governed by the driving pressure, ambient pressure and tensile strength. Finally, we derive an acoustic energy dissipation formula for the bubble's sonic collapse, dependent solely on the bubble's collapse radii and velocity.</description>

      <title>Boundary layer stability and transition analysis using the nonlinear One-Way Navier-Stokes approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17274v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the One-Way Navier Stokes (OWNS) approach to support nonlinear interactions between waves of different frequencies, which will enable nonlinear analysis of instability and transition. In OWNS, the linearized Navier-Stokes equations are parabolized and solved in the frequency domain as a spatial initial-value (marching) problem. OWNS yields a reduced computational cost compared to global solvers, while also conferring numerous advantages over the parabolized stability equations (PSE), despite its higher computational cost relative to PSE, that we seek to extend to nonlinear analysis. We validate the nonlinear OWNS (NOWNS) method by examining nonlinear evolution of two- and three-dimensional disturbances in a low-speed Blasius boundary layer compared to nonlinear PSE (NPSE) and direct numerical simulation (DNS) results from the literature. We demonstrate that NOWNS can be used to simulate flows involve blowing/suction strips, is more robust to numerical noise, and converges for stronger nonlinearities, as compared to NPSE.</description>

      <title>Bubble dynamics in a cavitating venturi</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05471v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cryogenic fluids have extensive applications as fuel for launch vehicles in space applications and research. The physics of cryogenic flows are highly complex due to the sensitive nature of phase transformation from liquid to bubbly liquid and vapor, eventually resulting in cavitating flows at the ambient temperature owing to the very low boiling point of cryogenic fluids, which asserts us to classify such flows under multi-phase flow physics regime. This work elucidates the modeling of bubbly flow for cryogenic fluids such as liquid nitrogen in a converging-diverging venturi-like flow device known as cavitating venturi, a passive flow control metering device. The numerical works in literature are usually limited to modeling iso-thermal bubbly flows such as water devoid of involving energy equations because there is no occurrence of interface heat transfer as latent heat of vaporization of water is higher, unlike cryogenic fluids which are sensitive to phase change at ambient conditions. So, to realize an appropriate model for modeling cryogenic bubbly flows such as liquid nitrogen flow, the effect of heat transfer at the interface and convective heat transfer from the surrounding liquid to the traversing bubble needs to be included. Numerical modeling using an in-house code involving a finite-difference method The numerical results showed the importance of including the heat transport equation due to convection and at the interface of bubble-fluid as a significant source term for the bubble dynamics. The work is supported by computational simulation using a commercial CFD package for 2-dimensional simulations to predict a characterizing parameter, namely cavitation length. A limited flow visualization experiment using a high-speed camera is performed to study the cavitating zone length.</description>

Abstract: Nonlinear surface waves are excited via a parametric oscillation of a surfactant-covered interface. Increasing the relative magnitude of the surfactant-induced Marangoni stresses results in a pattern transition from squares (observed for surfactant-free interfaces) to asymmetric squares, weakly wavy stripes, and ridges and hills. These hills are a consequence of the bi-directional Marangoni stresses at the neck of the ridges. The mechanisms underlying the pattern transitions and the formation of exotic ridges and hills are discussed in this Letter.</description>
