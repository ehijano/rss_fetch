      <title>Geometric Combinatorics of Polynomials II: Polynomials and Cell Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03047</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03047v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article introduces a finite piecewise Euclidean cell complex homeomorphic to the space of monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$ whose critical values lie in a fixed closed rectangular region. We call this the branched rectangle complex since its points are indexed by marked $d$-sheeted planar branched covers of the fixed rectangle. The vertices of the cell structure are indexed by the combinatorial "basketballs" studied by Martin, Savitt and Singer. Structurally, the branched rectangle complex is a full subcomplex of a direct product of two copies of the order complex of the noncrossing partition lattice. Topologically, it is homeomorphic to the closed $2n$-dimensional ball where $n=d-1$. Metrically, the simplices in each factor are orthoschemes. It can also be viewed as a compactification of the space of all monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$.
  We also introduce a finite piecewise Euclidean cell complex homeomorphic to the space of monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$ whose critical values lie in a fixed closed annular region. We call this the branched annulus complex since its points are indexed by marked $d$-sheeted planar branched covers of the fixed annulus.It can be constructed from the branched rectangle complex as a cellular quotient by isometric face identifications. And it can be viewed as a compactification of the space of all monic centered complex polynomials of degree $d$ with distinct roots.
  Finally, the branched annulus complex deformation retracts to the branched circle complex, which we identify with the dual braid complex. Our explicit embedding of the dual braid complex as a spine for the space of polynomials with distinct roots provides a direct proof that these two classifying spaces for the braid group are homotopy equivalent.</description>

      <title>Classification of Horikawa surfaces with T-singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We classify all projective surfaces with only T-singularities, $K^2=2p_g-4$, and ample canonical class. In this way, we identify all surfaces, smoothable or not, with only T-singularities in the Koll\'ar--Shepherd-Barron--Alexeev (KSBA) moduli space of Horikawa surfaces. We also prove that they are not smoothable when $p_g \geq 10$, except for the Lee-Park (Fintushel-Stern) examples, which we show to have only one deformation type unless $p_g=6$ (in which case they have two). This demonstrates that the challenging Horikawa problem cannot be addressed through complex T-degenerations, and we propose new questions regarding diffeomorphism types based on our classification. Furthermore, the techniques developed in this paper enable us to classify all KSBA surfaces with only T-singularities and $K^2=2p_g-3$, e.g. quintic surfaces and I-surfaces.</description>

      <title>An analytic invariant of G_2 manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02734</link>
      <description>arXiv:1505.02734v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the moduli space of holonomy G_2-metrics on a closed 7-manifold is in general disconnected by presenting a number of explicit examples.
  We detect different connected components of the G_2-moduli space by defining an integer-valued analytic refinement of the nu-invariant, a Z/48-valued defect invariant of G_2-structures on a closed 7-manifold introduced by the first and third authors. The refined invariant is defined using eta invariants and Mathai-Quillen currents on the 7-manifold and we compute it for twisted connected sums \`a la Kovalev, Corti-Haskins-Nordstr\"om-Pacini and extra-twisted connected sums as constructed by the second and third authors. In particular, we find examples of G_2-holonomy metrics in different components of the moduli space where the associated G_2-structures are homotopic and other examples where they are not.</description>

      <title>Koebe conjecture and the Weyl problem for convex surfaces in hyperbolic 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08001</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.08001v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that the Koebe circle domain conjecture is equivalent to the Weyl type problem that every complete hyperbolic surface of genus zero is isometric to the boundary of the hyperbolic convex hull of the complement of a circle domain. It provides a new way to approach the Koebe's conjecture using convex geometry. Combining our result with the work of He-Schramm on the Koebe conjecture, one establishes that every simply connected non-compact polyhedral surface is discrete conformal to the complex plane or the open unit disk. The main tool we use is Schramm's transboundary extremal lengths.</description>

      <title>Endperiodic maps, splitting sequences, and branched surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.14481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.14481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We strengthen the unpublished theorem of Gabai and Mosher that every depth one sutured manifold contains a very full dynamic branched surface by showing that the branched surface can be chosen to satisfy an additional property we call veering. To this end we prove that every endperiodic map admits a periodic splitting sequence of train tracks carrying its positive Handel-Miller lamination. This completes step one of Gabai-Mosher's unpublished two-step proof that every taut finite depth foliation of a compact, oriented, atoroidal 3-manifold is almost transverse to a pseudo-Anosov flow. Further, a veering branched surface in a sutured manifold is a generalization of a veering triangulation, and we extend some of the theory of veering triangulations to this setting. In particular we show that the branched surfaces we construct are unique up to a natural equivalence relation, and give an algorithmic way to compute the foliation cones of Cantwell-Conlon.</description>

      <title>Planar decomposition of the HOMFLY polynomial for bipartite knots and links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of the Kauffman bracket, which describes the Jones polynomial as a sum over closed circles formed by the planar resolution of vertices in a knot diagram, can be straightforwardly lifted from sl(2) to sl(N) at arbitrary N -- but for a special class of bipartite diagrams made entirely from the anitparallel lock tangle. Many amusing and important knots and links can be described in this way, from twist and double braid knots to the celebrated Kanenobu knots for even parameters -- and for all of them the entire HOMFLY polynomials possess planar decomposition. This provides an approach to evaluation of HOMFLY polynomials, which is complementary to the arborescent calculus, and this opens a new direction to homological techniques, parallel to Khovanov-Rozansky generalisations of the Kauffman calculus. Moreover, this planar calculus is also applicable to other symmetric representations beyond the fundamental one, and to links which are not fully bipartite what is illustrated by examples of Kanenobu-like links.</description>

      <title>The moduli space of twisted Laplacians and random matrix theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10778v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rudnick recently proved that the spectral number variance for the Laplacian of a large compact hyperbolic surface converges, in a certain scaling limit and when averaged with respect to the Weil-Petersson measure on moduli space, to the number variance of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble of random matrix theory. In this article we extend Rudnick's approach to show convergence to the Gaussian Unitary Ensemble for twisted Laplacians which break time-reversal symmetry, and to the Gaussian Symplectic Ensemble for Dirac operators. This addresses a question of Naud, who obtained analogous results for twisted Laplacians on high degree random covers of a fixed compact surface.</description>
