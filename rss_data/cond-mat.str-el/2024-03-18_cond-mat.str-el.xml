      <title>A Classical Chiral Spin-Liquid from Chiral Interactions on the Pyrochlore Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10601v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical spin-liquids are paramagnetic phases which feature nontrivial patterns of spin correlations within their ground-state manifold whose degeneracy scales with system size. Often they harbor fractionalized excitations, and their low-energy fluctuations are described by emergent gauge theories. In this work, we discuss a model composed of chiral three-body spin interactions on the pyrochlore lattice that realizes a novel classical chiral spin-liquid. Employing both analytical and numerical techniques, we show that the ground-state manifold of this spin-liquid is given by a subset of the so-called color-ice states. We demonstrate that the ground states are captured by an effective gauge theory which possesses a divergence-free condition and an additional chiral term that constrains the total flux of the fields through a single tetrahedron. The divergence-free condition results in two-fold pinch points in the spin structure factor and the identification of bionic charges as the elementary excitations of the system. We discuss how the mobility of these elementary charges is restricted by the additional chiral term, which in turn suggests that these charges are fractons.</description>

      <title>Emergent $D_8^{(1)}$ spectrum and topological soliton excitation in CoNb$_2$O$_6$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum integrability emerging near a quantum critical point (QCP) is manifested by exotic excitation spectrum that is organized by the associated algebraic structure. A well known example is the emergent $E_8$ integrability near the QCP of a transverse field Ising chain (TFIC), which was long predicted theoretically and initially proposed to be realized in the quasi-one-dimensional (q1D) quantum magnet CoNb$_2$O$_6$. However, later measurements on the spin excitation spectrum of this material revealed a series of satellite peaks that cannot be described by the $E_8$ Lie algebra. Motivated by these experimental progresses, we hereby revisit the spin excitations of CoNb$_2$O$_6$ by combining numerical calculation and analytical analysis. We show that, as effects of strong interchain fluctuations, the spectrum of the system near the 1D QCP is characterized by the $D_{8}^{(1)}$ Lie algebra with robust topological soliton excitation. We further show that the $D_{8}^{(1)}$ spectrum can be realized in a broad class of interacting quantum systems. Our results advance the exploration of integrability and manipulation of topological excitations in quantum critical systems.</description>

      <title>Giant exchange splitting in the electronic structure of A-type 2D antiferromagnet CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the field of 2D magnetic semiconductors, CrSBr has been the focus of research due to its intriguing magnetic, transport and optical properties that have potential to underpin novel devices. Here we present the evolution of the electronic structure of CrSBr from its antiferromagnetic ground state to the paramagnetic phase. The ground state photoemission data, obtained using a novel method to overcome sample charging issues, is very well reproduced by $\mathbf{QSG\hat{W}}$ calculations, a self-consistent many-body perturbative approach that computes electronic eigenfunctions in presence of excitonic correlations. The electronic structure is complex at $\mathbf{\Gamma}$, but simplifies at the X points of the Brillouin zone where the non-symmorphic lattice symmetry enforces band degeneracies. In the vicinity of these X points, in the deeper-lying valence bands one can identify pairs of states with mainly Br- and S- character. The energy splitting between them is understood as an exchange splitting within the individual layers in which the spins all align, despite the absence of a net magnetic moment in the so-called A-type antiferromagnetic arrangement. By tracing band positions as a function of temperature, we identify that this exchange splitting disappears above $T_N$, alongside a significant increase in the spectral broadening in all states.</description>

      <title>Merons and magnetoelectric switching in centrosymmetric spiral magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spiral multiferroics exhibit a strong coupling between magnetic and ferroelectric orders, allowing cross-control. Since the seminal work of Kimura et al. in 2003, these materials have attracted great interest galvanized by the prospect of new high-efficiency memory devices, where magnetic (electric) bits are switched via an external electric (magnetic) field. Nevertheless, the mechanism underlying such a switching process - the electric field-driven dynamics of domain walls (DWs) - is still poorly understood. We address this problem for meron DWs, which represent one of the main DW types in spiral multiferroics and consist of an array of meron (half-skyrmion) strings. Minimum energy walls feature merons with alternating topological charges and move as relativistic massive particles, with the limiting velocity set by magnon speed. Low-energy defects in this alternating charge sequence, which appear during domain nucleation, can lead to DWs with net topological charge. This induces a peculiar non-local dynamics where all the spins in the system rotate, merons translate within the wall, and the DW mobility is suppressed. The topological charge of the wall and the meron helicity can be easily modified via an external magnetic and electric field, respectively, offering fine control over DW dynamics. Defects within the meron strings, analogous to Bloch points, have hedgehog-like spin texture and are strongly pinned to the lattice. The fascinating interplay between domain wall motion, translation of merons within the wall, and precession of spins in the entire domains opens a new playground for the electric manipulation of topological spin textures.</description>

      <title>Non-Fermi liquid behavior of scattering rate in three-orbital Emery model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11218</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the recent findings on the $T$-linear electronic scattering rate in the two-dimensional Hubbard model, we have investigated the three-orbital Emery model and its temperature-dependent electronic and quasiparticle scattering rates by adopting dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. By focusing on two characteristic site energies $\epsilon_p$ of O-2$p$ orbital relevant to cuprates and nickelates separately, our exploration discovered that, for $\epsilon_p=3.24$ relevant to cuprates, the scattering rate can exhibit a linear-$T$ dependence at low temperature for a range of intermediate densities. In contrast, for larger $\epsilon_p=6.0$ presumably relevant to nickelates, a wide range of densities support a downturn of the scattering rate below the temperature scale $T\sim0.1$ with possibly two consecutive nearly linear-$T$ regimes connected via a smooth crossover around $T\sim0.1$. Furthermore, the temperature dependent quasiparticle scattering rate generically departs from the unity slope as predicted by the Planckian dissipation theory. Our presented work provides valuable insights on the extensively studied three-orbital Emery model, particularly on the quantitative examination of non-Fermi liquid features of scattering rates.</description>

      <title>An exact formula for the optical conductivity of the two dimensional Hubbard model and its application to the cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the origin of electron incoherence is believed to be the first step toward the resolution of the mysteries of the high-T$_{c}$ cuprate superconductors. Such electron incoherence manifests itself most evidently in the non-Drude form of the optical absorption spectrum of the system. The spectral weight transfer related to such dissipative response, which is absent in conventional Fermi liquid metal, has direct consequence on the dc transport property of the system. However, a theoretical study of the optical conductivity of a strongly correlated model is a formidable task. Here we present an exact formula for the optical conductivity of the 2D Hubbard model from the low energy effective theory perspective. We show that the optical conductivity in Matsubara frequency of the 2D Hubbard model can be represented as the ensemble average of the optical conductivity of non-interacting systems in the background of fluctuating local moment. We find that such an ensemble average can be done exactly with a sign-problem-free Monte Carlo simulation if we assume the widely adopted Millis-Monien-Pines spin susceptibility for the fluctuating local moment. For thermal fluctuation of the local moment, our formula can be used to calculate directly the optical conductivity in real frequency which can be compared with the result of optical measurements in the cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Observation of unconventional charge order during the transition from Mott-insulator to charge-transfer-insulator in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11232v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The magnetic nature of the Kitaev candidate material $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has been widely studied but its charge properties are less known. In the present work, we systematically investigate the scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) on few-layer $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in proximity to graphite. While a single-layer $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has a large Mott gap of order 2 eV in spite of charge transferring to the heterointerface from graphite, surface of 2-monolayers (MLs) and 3-MLs samples have a reduced charge gap of order of 200 meV. Furthermore, clear signals of lattice and charge incommensurate super-modulations are observed in 2-MLs $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with negative sample biases outside the charge gap. The dI/dV spectra indicates that 2-MLs and 3-MLs $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ are turned from Mott insulator into charge transfer insulator, while the charge super-modulation suggests the existence of charge density wave induced by incommensurate dipole order.</description>

      <title>Exclusive interplay between topological quasiparticles and strongly correlated fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11382v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The low-energy excitations of topological quantum matter have been increasingly comprehended. However, the impact of these excitations on strongly correlated fermions remains rarely explored. Here, we report the discovery of an incompatible dynamic of 4$f$ quasiparticle and topological quasiparticle. The former forms through screening processes, while the latter suppresses the screening channel. By employing ab initio many-body perturbation theory combined with dynamical mean field theory, we show that this effect prompts two types of topological semimetals. The type-I semimetal PrPtBi exhibits a topological quasiparticle away from the Fermi level due to the formation of a 4$f$ quasiparticle. The type-II semimetals HoPtBi and PrAlGe feature a robust topological quasiparticle at the Fermi level, which pushes the 4$f$ quasiparticle away. Our work provides an avenue to harness semimetals' anomalous quantum effects from topological quasiparticle to heavy-fermion behavior by the incorporation of 4$f$ quasiparticles.</description>

      <title>First-Principles Calculation of Hubbard U for Terbium Metal under High Pressure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using density functional theory (DFT) and linear response approaches, we compute the on-site Hubbard interaction $U$ of elemental Terbium (Tb) metal in the pressure range $\sim 0-65$ GPa. The resulting first-principles $U$ values with experimental crystal structures enable us to examine the magnetic properties of Tb using a self-consistent DFT+U method. The lowest-energy magnetic states in our calculations for different high-pressure Tb phases -- including hcp, $\alpha$-Sm, and dhcp -- are found to be compatible with the corresponding magnetic ordering vectors reported in experiments. The result shows that the inclusion of Hubbard $U$ substantially improves the accuracy and efficiency in modeling correlated rare-earth materials. Our study also provides the necessary $U$ information for other quantum many-body techniques to study Tb under extreme pressure conditions.</description>

      <title>Moore-Read state in Half-filled Moir\'e Chern band from three-body Pseudo-potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11478</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11478v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The moir\'e system provides a tunable platform for exploring exotic phases of materials. This article shows the possible realization of a non-Abelian state characterized by the Moore-Read wavefunction in a half-filled moir\'e Chern band, exemplified by twisted $\rm MoTe_2$. This is achieved by introducing short-range repulsive three-body interaction. Exact diagonalization is employed to examine the spectrum in finite size. The incompressibility of the system, the degeneracy of the ground states, and the number of low-energy states provide compelling evidence to identify the ground state as the Moore-Read state. We further interpolate between the three-body interaction and Coulomb interaction to show a phase transition between the composite Fermi-liquid and the Moore-Read state. Finally, we consider the effect of band mixing and derive the three-body interaction using perturbation theory. By exploring the conditions under which band mixing effects mimic short-range repulsive three-body interaction we provide insights towards realizing non-Abelian phases of matter in the moir\'e system.</description>

      <title>The effect of Coulomb assisted hopping on STM signal: extended two site Hubbard model analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we study STM signal in the presence of Coulomb assisted hopping. We perform an extended two site Hubbard model analysis between the atom on the tip and the atom in the sample nearest to each other. We show that in the presence of Coulomb assisted hopping the STM signal depends on several spectral functions thereby complicating its interpretation. Furthermore in the broadband tip limit there are now three different competing rates for the total current (instead of one for the usual two site Hubbard model analysis). We find an exact (within the Fermi golden rule - that is in the limit of weak coupling between tip and sample) an expression for the current as a function of the bias voltage. As an example we apply our calculations to the case of free fermions with a uniform density of states. Even in this simple case there are non-trivial corrections where the dI/dV (the rate of change of the current with respect to bias voltage) is not uniform as a two site (non-extended) Hubbard model analysis would predict.</description>

      <title>Numerical observation of $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Nagaoka ferromagnetism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide numerical evidence of the Nagaoka's theorem in the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$ Fermi-Hubbard model on various cluster geometries, such as the square, the honeycomb and the triangular lattices. In particular, by diagonalizing several finite-size clusters, we show that for one hole away from filling $1/N$, the itinerant ferromagnetism arises for $U$ (the positive on-site interaction) larger than $U_c$ (the value at the transition), which strongly depends on the coordination number $z$ and on $N$, the number of degenerate orbitals, that we vary from $N=2$ to $N=6$ in our simulations. We prove that $U_c$ is a non decreasing function of $N$. In addition, we find that the lattice dependency is rooted in the kinetic energy of the hole. We find that large coordination numbers $z$ lower the value of $U_c$. Complementary, we explore the effect of long-range hopping on the appearance of itinerant ferromagnetism and demonstrate that it acts as an increased coordination number, protecting the ferromagnetic phase at small $U$. Finally, both the effects of the presence of some additional holes and of the finite size of the clusters are briefly discussed.</description>

      <title>SU(3) gauge field of magnons in antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11655</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11655v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasiparticle excitations in material solids often experience a fictitious gauge field, which can be a potential source of intriguing transport phenomena. Here, we show that low-energy excitations in insulating antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals on the triangular lattice are effectively described by magnons with an SU(3) gauge field. The three-sublattice structure in the antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals is inherited as three internal degrees of freedom for the magnons, which are coupled with their kinetic motion via the SU(3) gauge field that arises from the topologically nontrivial spin texture in real space. We also demonstrate that the non-commutativity of the SU(3) gauge field breaks an effective time-reversal symmetry and contributes to a magnon thermal Hall effect.</description>

      <title>Spin-Orbital Ordering in Alkali Superoxides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Akali superoxides AO2 (A=Na, K, Rb, Cs), due to an open p shell of the oxygen ion O2^- with degenerate pi orbitals, have spin and orbital degrees of freedom. The complex magnetic, orbital, and structural phase transitions observed experimentally in this family of materials are only partially understood. Based on density functional theory, we derive a strong-coupling effective model for the isostructural compounds AO2 (A=K, Rb, Cs) from a two-orbital Hubbard model. We find that CsO2 has highly frustrated exchange interactions in the a-b plane, while the frustration is weaker for smaller alkali ions. We solve the resulting Kugel-Khomskii model in the mean-field approximation. We show that CsO2 exhibits an antiferro-orbital (AFO) order with the ordering vector q=(1,0,0) and a stripe antiferromagnetic order with q=(1/2,0,0), which is consistent with recent neutron scattering experiments. We discuss the role of the pi-orbital degrees of freedom for the experimentally observed magnetic transitions and interpret the as-yet-unidentified T_s2=70K transition in CsO2 as an orbital ordering transition.</description>

      <title>Coarsening of chiral domains in itinerant electron magnets: A machine learning force field approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Frustrated itinerant magnets often exhibit complex noncollinear or noncoplanar magnetic orders which support topological electronic structures. A canonical example is the anomalous quantum Hall state with a chiral spin order stabilized by electron-spin interactions on a triangular lattice. While a long-range magnetic order cannot survive thermal fluctuations in two dimensions, the chiral order which results from the breaking of a discrete Ising symmetry persists even at finite temperatures. We present a scalable machine learning (ML) framework to model the complex electron-mediated spin-spin interactions that stabilize the chiral magnetic domains in a triangular lattice. Large-scale dynamical simulations, enabled by the ML force-field models, are performed to investigate the coarsening of chiral domains after a thermal quench. While the chiral phase is described by a broken $Z_2$ Ising-type symmetry, we find that the characteristic size of chiral domains increases linearly with time, in stark contrast to the expected Allen-Cahn domain growth law for a non-conserved Ising order parameter field. The linear growth of the chiral domains is attributed to the orientational anisotropy of domain boundaries. Our work also demonstrates the promising potential of ML models for large-scale spin dynamics of itinerant magnets.</description>

      <title>Topological edge modes and phase transition in the critical fermionic chain with long-range interaction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11880v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The long-range interaction can fundamentally alter properties in gapped topological phases such as emergent massive edge modes. However, recent research has shifted attention to topological nontrivial critical points or phases, and it is natural to explore how long-range interaction influences them. In this work, we investigate the topological behavior and phase transition of extended Kitaev chains with long-range interactions, which can be derived from the critical Ising model via the Jordan-Wigner transformation in the short-range limit. Specifically, we analytically find the critical edge modes at the critical point remain stable against long-range interaction. More importantly, we observe these critical edge modes remain massless even when long-range interactions become substantially strong. As a byproduct, we numerically find that the critical behavior of the long-range model belongs to the free Majorana fermion universality class, which is entirely different from the long-range universality class in usual long-range spin models. Our work could shed new light on the interplay between long-range interactions (frustrated) and the gapless topological phases of matter.</description>

      <title>Thermal Tensor Network Approach for Spin-Lattice Relaxation in Quantum Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-dimensional quantum magnets, particularly those with strong spin frustration, are characterized by their notable spin fluctuations. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) serves as a sensitive probe of low-energy fluctuations that offers valuable insight into rich magnetic phases and emergent phenomena in quantum magnets. Although experimentally accessible, the numerical simulation of NMR relaxation rates, specifically the spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$, remains a significant challenge. Analytical continuation based on Monte Carlo calculations are hampered by the notorious negative sign for frustrated systems, and the real-time simulations incur significant costs to capture low-energy fluctuations. Here we propose computing the relaxation rate using thermal tensor networks (TTNs), which provides a streamlined approach by calculating its imaginary-time proxy. We showcase the accuracy and versatility of our methodology by applying it to one-dimensional spin chains and two-dimensional lattices, where we find that the critical exponents $\eta$ and $z\nu$ can be extracted from the low-temperature scalings of the simulated $1/T_1$ near quantum critical points. Our results also provide insights into the low-dimensional and frustrated magnetic materials, elucidating universal scaling behaviors in the Ising chain compound CoNb$_2$O$_6$ and revealing the renormalized classical behaviors in the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Ba$_8$CoNb$_6$O$_{24}$. We apply the approach to effective model of the family of frustrated magnets AYbCh$_2$ (A = Na, K, Cs, and Ch = O, S, Se), and find dramatic changes from spin ordered to the proposed quantum spin liquid phase. Overall, with high reliability and accuracy, the TTN methodology offers a systematic strategy for studying the intricate dynamics observed across a broad spectrum of quantum magnets and related fields.</description>

      <title>Comparative Raman Scattering Study of Crystal Field Excitations in Co-based Quantum Magnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Co-based materials have recently been explored due to potential to realise complex bond-dependent anisotropic magnetism. Prominent examples include Na$_2$Co$_2$TeO$_6$, BaCo$_2$(AsO$_4$)$_2$, Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$, and CoX$_2$ (X = Cl, Br, I). In order to provide insight into the magnetic interactions in these compounds, we make a comparative analysis of their local crystal electric field excitations spectra via Raman scattering measurements. Combining these measurements with theoretical analysis confirms the validity of $j_{\rm eff} = 1/2$ single-ion ground states for all compounds, and provides accurate experimental estimates of the local crystal distortions, which play a prominent role in the magnetic couplings between spin-orbital coupled Co moments.</description>

      <title>Effective time-dependent temperature for fermionic master equations beyond the Markov and the secular approximations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.10591v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a quantum system coupled to environment at a fixed temperature and describe the reduced evolution of the system by means of a Redfield equation with effective time-dependent contact temperature obeying a universal law. At early times, after the system and environment start in a product state, the effective contact temperature appears to be much higher, yet eventually it settles down towards the true environment value. In this way, we obtain a method which includes non-Markovian effects and can be further applied to various types of GKSL equations, beyond the secular approximation and time-averaging methods. We derive the theory from first principles and discuss its application using a simple example of a single quantum dot.</description>

      <title>Surface region band enhancement in noble gas adsorption assisted ARPES on kagome superconductor RbV3Sb5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic states near surface regions can be distinct from bulk states, which are paramount in understanding various physical phenomena occurring at surfaces and in applications in semiconductors, energy, and catalysis. Here, we report an abnormal surface region band enhancement effect in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on kagome superconductor RbV3Sb5, by depositing noble gases with fine control. In contrast to conventional surface contamination, the intensity of surface region Sb band can be enhanced more than three times with noble gas adsorption. In the meantime, a hole-dope effect is observed for the enhanced surface region band, with other bands hardly changing. The doping effect is more pronounced with heavier noble gases. We propose that noble gas atoms selectively fill into alkali metal vacancy sites on the surface, which improves the surface condition, boosts surface region bands, and effectively dopes it with the Pauli repulsion mechanism. Our results provide a novel and reversible way to improve surface conditions and tune surface region bands by controlled surface noble gas deposition.</description>

      <title>Optical manipulation of the topological phase in ZrTe5 revealed by time- and angle-resolved photoemission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution time- and angle-resolved photoemission measurements were conducted on the topological insulator ZrTe5. With strong femtosecond photoexcitation, a possible ultrafast phase transition from a weak to a strong topological insulating phase was experimentally realized by recovering the energy gap inversion in a time scale that was shorter than 0.15 ps. This photoinduced transient strong topological phase can last longer than 2 ps at the highest excitation fluence studied, and it cannot be attributed to the photoinduced heating of electrons or modification of the conduction band filling. Additionally, the measured unoccupied electronic states are consistent with the first-principles calculation based on experimental crystal lattice constants, which favor a strong topological insulating phase. These findings provide new insights into the longstanding controversy about the strong and weak topological properties in ZrTe5, and they suggest that many-body effects including electron-electron interactions must be taken into account to understand the equilibrium weak topological insulating phase in ZrTe5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11618v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spin torque nano-oscillators realized by magnetization dynamics trapped in a current-induced potential are reported. We fabricated Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$/Pt nanostructures and measured current-induced microwave emission from the structures. The result shows an increase in the magnitude and spectral narrowing of the microwave emission. We demonstrate that the current-induced magnetic field suppresses magnon radiation loss and significantly reduces the linewidth and the threshold current required for the spin torque oscillation.</description>

      <title>Terahertz Metamaterial Renormalization of Superconducting Josephson Plasmons in La$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$CuO$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate light-matter coupling in the cuprate superconductor La$_{1.85}$Sr$_{0.15}$Cu0$_4$ (LSCO), accomplished by adhering metamaterial resonator arrays (MRAs) to a c-axis oriented single crystal. The resonators couple to the Josephson Plasma Mode (JPM) which manifests as a plasma edge in the terahertz reflectivity in the superconducting state. Terahertz reflectivity measurements at 10K reveal a renormalization of the JPM frequency, $\omega_{jpm}$, from 1.7 THz for the bare crystal to $\sim$1 THz with the MRAs. With increasing temperature, the modified $\omega_{jpm}$ redshifts as expected for decreasing superfluid density, vanishing above T$_{c}$. The modification of the electrodynamic response arises from resonator induced screening of the longitudinal polariton response, reminiscent of plasmon-phonon coupling in doped semiconductors. Modeling reveals that the electrodynamic response is fully interpretable using classical electromagnetism. Future studies will have to contend with the large effects we observe which could obscure subtle changes that may indicate cavity-based manipulation of superconductivity. Finally, we note that our MRA/LSCO structure is a tunable epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) metamaterial that exhibits a nonlinear response arising from the c-axis Josephson tunneling coupled with the local fields of the resonators.</description>

Abstract: Half-metallic ferromagnetic transition metal dichalcogenides have emerged as important building blocks for scalable magnonics and memory applications. Downscaling such systems to the ultra-thin limit is critical to integrate them into technology. Here, we achieved layer-by-layer control over the transition metal dichalcogenide Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$ by using pulsed laser deposition, and we uncovered the minimum critical thickness above which room temperature magnetic order is maintained. The electronic and magnetic structure is explored experimentally and theoretically and it is shown that the films exhibit strong in-plane magnetic anisotropy as a consequence of large spin-orbit effects. Our study establishes Cr$_{1.6}$Te$_{2}$ as a platform material, viable for ferromagnetic nanoscale devices and magnetic-memory architectures.</description>

      <title>Existence of a weak-disorder non-Fermi liquid fixed point in the hydrodynamic regime of two-dimensional nematic quantum criticality</title>

      <description>arXiv:1905.08442v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Role of quenched randomness in metallic quantum criticality is one of the long standing problems in condensed matter physics. An aspect of the fundamental difficulties lies in the fact that such nonmagnetic disorders lead effective interactions between abundant soft modes near the Fermi surface to be drastically enhanced particularly in the diffusive regime, where the perturbative framework does not work. Here, we revisit the problem of dirty quantum critical metals in a different angle, focusing on the hydrodynamic regime instead of the diffusive regime near the non-Fermi liquid quantum critical point. More concretely, we study effects of mutual correlations between quantum critical nematic fluctuations and weak localization corrections, and show the existence of a weak-disorder non-Fermi liquid fixed point, based on the renormalization group (RG) analysis up to the two-loop order. The two-loop order RG analysis suggests that the absence of quantum coherence in two-particle composite excitations weakens the role of weak localization corrections and allows a weakly disordered non-Fermi liquid metallic state in the hydrodynamic regime of the nematic quantum critical point. Although this dirty non-Fermi liquid metallic state may not be the true infrared stable fixed point at zero temperature, expected to be characterized by the diffusive Ohmic regime, we argue that this weak-disorder non-Fermi liquid metallic fixed point would govern the region of an intermediate energy scale, described by effective hydrodynamics of nematic quantum criticality. In this respect we believe that this research would be an important step in understanding the $T-$linear electrical resistivity as a characteristic feature of non-Fermi liquids and the origin of unconventional superconductivity from effective hydrodynamics of quantum criticality.</description>

      <title>Fractional matter coupled to the emergent gauge field in a quantum spin ice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.05452v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic spins can form long-range entangled phases of condensed matter named quantum spin liquids. Their existence is conceptualized in models of two- or three-dimensional frustrated magnets that evade symmetry-breaking order down to zero temperature. Quantum spin ice (QSI) is a theoretically well-established example described by an emergent quantum electrodynamics, with excitations behaving like photon and matter quasiparticles. The latter are fractionally charged and equivalent to the `spinons' emerging from coherent phases of singlets in one dimension, where clear experimental proofs of fractionalization exist. However, in frustrated magnets it remains difficult to establish consensual evidence for quantum spin liquid ground states and their fractional excitations. Here, we use backscattering neutron spectroscopy to achieve extremely high resolution of the time-dependent magnetic response of the candidate QSI material Ce$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$. We find a gapped spectrum featuring a threshold and peaks that match theories for pair production and propagation of fractional matter excitations (spinons) strongly coupled to a background gauge field. The multiple peaks are a specific signature of the $\pi$-flux phase of QSI, providing spectroscopic evidence for fractionalization in a three-dimensional quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.07380v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years a consensus has gradually been reached that the previously proposed deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) for spin-1/2 systems, an archetypal example of quantum phase transition beyond the classic Landau's paradigm, actually does not correspond to a true unitary conformal field theory (CFT). In this work we carefully investigate another type of quantum phase transition supposedly beyond the similar classic paradigm, the so called ``symmetric mass generation" (SMG) transition proposed in recent years. We employ the sharp diagnosis including the scaling of disorder operator and R\'enyi entanglement entropy in large-scale lattice model quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Our results strongly suggest that the SMG transition is indeed an unconventional quantum phase transition and it should correspond to a true $(2+1)d$ unitary CFT.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.08116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the fate of the Kitaev spin liquid (KSL) under the influence of an external magnetic field $h$ in the [001] direction and upon tuning bond anisotropy of the Kitaev coupling $K_z$ keeping $K_x = K_y = K$. Guided by density matrix renormalization group, exact diagonalization, and with insights from parton mean field theory, we uncover a field-induced gapless-to-gapless Lifshitz transition from the nodal KSL to an intermediate gapless phase. The intermediate phase sandwiched between $h_{c1}$ and $h_{c2}$, which persists for a wide range of anisotropy $K_z/K &gt; 0$, is composed of weakly coupled one-dimensional quantum critical chains. This intermediate phase is a dimensional crossover which asymptotically leads to the one-dimensional quantum Ising criticality characterized by the (1+1)D conformal field theory as the field reaches the phase transition at $h_{c2}$. Beyond $h_{c2}$ the system enters a partially polarized phase describable as effectively decoupled bosonic chains in which spin waves propagate along the one-dimensional zigzag direction. Our findings provide a comprehensive phase diagram and offer insights into the unusual physics of dimensional reduction generated by a uniform magnetic field in an otherwise two-dimensional quantum spin liquid.</description>

      <title>Non-centrosymmetric, transverse structural modulation in SrAl4, and elucidation of its origin in the BaAl4 family of compounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08959v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: At ambient conditions SrAl4 adopts the BaAl4 structure type with space group I4/mmm. It undergoes a charge-density-wave (CDW) transition at TCDW = 243 K, followed by a structural transition at TS = 87 K. Temperature-dependent single-crystal X-ray diffraction (SXRD) leads to the observation of incommensurate superlattice reflections at q = \sigma c* with \sigma = 0.1116 at 200 K. The CDW has orthorhombic symmetry with the acentric superspace group F222(00sigma)00s, where F222 is a subgroup of Fmmm as well as of I4/mmm. Atomic displacements mainly represent a transverse wave, with displacements that are 90 deg out of phase between the two diagonal directions of the I-centered unit cell, resulting in a helical wave. Small longitudinal displacements are provided by the second harmonic modulation. The orthorhombic phase realized in SrAl4 is similar to that found in EuAl4. Electronic structure calculations and phonon calculations by density functional theory (DFT) have failed to reveal the mechanism of CDW formation. However, DFT reveals that Al atoms dominate the density of states near the Fermi level, thus, corroborating the SXRD measurements. SrAl4 remains incommensurately modulated at the structural transition, where the symmetry lowers from orthorhombic to b-unique monoclinic. We have identified a simple criterion, that correlates the presence of a phase transition with the interatomic distances. Only those compounds XAl4-xGax(X = Ba, Eu, Sr, Ca; 0 &lt; x &lt;4) undergo phase transitions, for which the ratio c/a falls within the narrow range 2.51 &lt; c/a &lt; 2.54.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit excitons in a correlated metal: Raman scattering study of Sr2RhO4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15299v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using Raman spectroscopy to study the correlated 4$d$-electron metal Sr$_2$RhO$_4$, we observe pronounced excitations at 220 meV and 240 meV with $A_\mathrm{1g}$ and $B_\mathrm{1g}$ symmetries, respectively. We identify them as transitions between the spin-orbit multiplets of the Rh ions, in close analogy to the spin-orbit excitons in the Mott insulators Sr$_2$IrO$_4$ and $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. This observation provides direct evidence for the unquenched spin-orbit coupling in Sr$_2$RhO$_4$. A quantitative analysis of the data reveals that the tetragonal crystal field $\Delta$ in Sr$_2$RhO$_4$ has a sign opposite to that in insulating Sr$_2$IrO$_4$, which enhances the planar $xy$ orbital character of the effective $J=1/2$ wave function. This supports a metallic ground state, and suggests that $c$-axis compression of Sr$_2$RhO$_4$ may transform it into a quasi-two-dimensional antiferromagnetic insulator.</description>

      <title>Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the star lattice -- from chiral Majoranas to chiral triplons</title>

Abstract: The interplay of frustrated interactions and lattice geometry can lead to a variety of exotic quantum phases. Here we unearth a particularly rich phase diagram of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model on the star lattice, a triangle decorated honeycomb lattice breaking sublattice symmetry. In the antiferromagnetic regime, the interplay of Heisenberg coupling and geometric frustration leads to the formation of valence bond solid (VBS) phases -- a singlet VBS and a bond selective triplet VBS stabilized by the Kitaev exchange. We show that the ratio of the Kitaev versus Heisenberg exchange tunes between these VBS phases and chiral quantum spin liquid regimes. Remarkably, the VBS phases host a whole variety of chiral triplon excitations with high Chern numbers in the presence of a weak magnetic field. We discuss our results in light of a recently synthesized star lattice material and other decorated lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Microscopy: Tomography and Entanglement Measures via Quantum Monte Carlo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.14916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a protocol, dubbed entanglement microscopy, to obtain the full reduced density matrix associated with subregions in quantum Monte Carlo simulations for bosonic and fermionic manybody systems. Our microscopy allows to perform quantum state tomography, and thus gives access to true entanglement measures, such as the logarithmic negativity (LN). We exemplify our method by studying the phase diagram near quantum critical points (QCP) in 2 spatial dimensions: the transverse field Ising model and a Gross-Neveu-Yukawa transition of Dirac fermions. Our main results are: i) the Ising QCP exhibits short-range entanglement with a finite sudden death of the LN both in space and temperature; ii) the Gross-Neveu QCP has a power-law decaying fermionic LN consistent with conformal field theory (CFT) exponents; iii) going beyond bipartite entanglement, we find no detectable 3-party entanglement in a large parameter window near the Ising QCP in 2d, in contrast to 1d. We also analytically obtain the large-temperature power law scaling of the fermionic LN for general interacting systems. Our approach allows one to perform quantum state tomography locally in a way that is analogous to atomic-scale imaging with a scanning tunneling microscope. Controlled entanglement microscopy opens a new window into quantum matter, with countless systems waiting to be explored.</description>

Abstract: Many-body localized phases retain memory of their initial conditions in disordered interacting systems with unitary dynamics. The stability of the localized phase due to the breakdown of unitarity is of relevance to experiment in the presence of dissipation. Here we investigate the impact of non-Hermitian perturbations on many-body localization. We focus on the interacting Hatano-Nelson model which breaks unitarity via asymmetric hopping. We explore the phase diagram for the mid-spectrum eigenstates as a function of the interaction strength and the non-Hermiticity. In contrast to the non-interacting case, our findings are consistent with a two-step approach to the localized regime. We also study the dynamics of the particle imbalance. We show that the distribution of relaxation time scales differs qualitatively between the localized and ergodic phases. Our findings suggest the possibility of an intermediate dynamical regime in disordered open systems.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity emerging from density-wave-like order in a correlated kagome metal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Unconventional superconductivity (USC) in a highly correlated kagome system has been theoretically proposed for years, yet the experimental realization is hard to achieve. The recently discovered vanadium-based kagome materials, which exhibit both superconductivity and charge density wave (CDW) orders, are nonmagnetic and weakly correlated, thus unlikely host USC as theories proposed. Here we report the discovery of a chromium-based kagome metal, CsCr$_3$Sb$_5$, which is contrastingly characterised by strong electron correlations, frustrated magnetism, and characteristic flat bands close to the Fermi level. Under ambient pressure, it undergoes a concurrent structural and magnetic phase transition at 55 K, accompanying with a stripe-like $4a_0$ structural modulation. At high pressure, the phase transition evolves into two transitions, probably associated with CDW and antiferromagnetic spin-density-wave orderings, respectively. These density-wave (DW)-like orders are gradually suppressed with pressure and, remarkably, a superconducting dome emerges at 3.65-8.0 GPa. The maximum of the superconducting transition temperature, $T_\mathrm{c}^{\mathrm{max}}=$ 6.4 K, appears when the DW-like orders are completely suppressed at 4.2 GPa, and the normal state exhibits a non-Fermi-liquid behaviour, reminiscent of USC and quantum criticality in iron-based superconductors. Our work offers an unprecedented platform for investigating possible USC in a correlated kagome system.</description>

      <title>Efficient preparation of the AKLT State with Measurement-based Imaginary Time Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.06031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state preparation plays a crucial role in several areas of quantum information science, in applications such as quantum simulation, quantum metrology and quantum computing. However, typically state preparation requires resources that scale exponentially with the problem size, due to their probabilistic nature or otherwise, making studying such models challenging. In this article, we propose a method to prepare the ground state of the Affleck-Lieb-Kennedy-Tasaki (AKLT) model deterministically using an measurement-based imaginary time evolution (MITE) approach. By taking advantage of the special properties of the AKLT state, we show that it can be prepared efficiently using the MITE approach. Estimates based on the convergence of a sequence of local projections, as well as direct evolution of the MITE algorithm suggest a constant scaling with respect to the number of AKLT sites, which is an exponential improvement over the naive estimate for conveargence. We show that the procedure is compatible with qubit-based simulators, and show that using a variational quantum algorithm for circuit recompilation, the measurement operator required for MITE can be well approximated by a circuit with a much shallower circuit depth compared with the one obtained using the default Qiskit method.</description>

      <title>Anomaly Enforced Gaplessness for Background Flux Anomalies and Symmetry Fractionalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.00093v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anomalous symmetries are known to strongly constrain the possible IR behavior along any renormalization group (RG) flow. Recently, the extension of the notion of symmetry in QFT has provided new types of anomalies with a corresponding new class of constraints on RG flows. In this paper, we derive the constraints imposed on RG flows from anomalies that can only be activated in the presence of specific background fluxes even though they do not necessarily correspond to a symmetry. We show that such anomalies can only be matched by gapped theories that exhibit either spontaneous symmetry breaking or symmetry fractionalization. In addition, we exhibit previously unstudied examples of these flux background anomalies that arise in $4d$ QCD and $4d$ SUSY QCD.</description>

Abstract: We explore the pairing state and gap structure of UTe$_2$ using a six-orbital model which we call the $f$-$d$-$p$ model. Our model accurately reproduces the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces consistent with recent de Haas-van Alphen oscillation measurements and the $(0, \pm \pi, 0)$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations observed by neutron scattering. We incorporate on-site Coulomb repulsion for $f$ electrons and solve the linearized Eliashberg equation within the third-order perturbation theory to investigate the superconducting symmetry in UTe$_2$. The most likely state is found to be an $s$-wave state with a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure that exhibits a point-node-like behavior of the specific heat at low temperatures.</description>

      <title>Enhancing quantum utility: simulating large-scale quantum spin chains on superconducting quantum computers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12427v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the quantum simulation of the frustrated quantum spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin chain with competing nearest-neighbor $(J_1)$ and next-nearest-neighbor $(J_2)$ exchange interactions in the real superconducting quantum computer with qubits ranging up to 100. In particular, we implement, for the first time, the Hamiltonian with the next-nearest neighbor exchange interaction in conjunction with the nearest neighbor interaction on IBM's superconducting quantum computer and carry out the time evolution of the spin chain by employing first-order Trotterization. Furthermore, our novel implementation of second-order Trotterization for the isotropic Heisenberg spin chain, involving only nearest-neighbor exchange interaction, enables precise measurement of the expectation values of staggered magnetization observable across a range of up to 100 qubits. Notably, in both cases, our approach results in a constant circuit depth in each Trotter step, independent of the initial number of qubits. Our demonstration of the accurate measurement of expectation values for the large-scale quantum system using superconducting quantum computers designates the quantum utility of these devices for investigating various properties of many-body quantum systems. This will be a stepping stone to achieving the quantum advantage over classical ones in simulating quantum systems before the fault tolerance quantum era.</description>

      <title>Unraveling the emergence of quantum state designs in systems with symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08949v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum state designs, by enabling an efficient sampling of random quantum states, play a quintessential role in devising and benchmarking various quantum protocols with broad applications ranging from circuit designs to black hole physics. Symmetries, on the other hand, are expected to reduce the randomness of a state. Despite being ubiquitous, the effects of symmetry on quantum state designs remain an outstanding question. The recently introduced projected ensemble framework generates efficient approximate state t-designs by hinging on projective measurements and many-body quantum chaos. In this work, we examine the emergence of state designs from the random generator states exhibiting symmetries. Leveraging on translation symmetry, we analytically establish a sufficient condition for the measurement basis leading to the state t-designs. Then, by making use of the trace distance measure, we numerically investigate the convergence to the designs. Subsequently, we inspect the violation of the sufficient condition to identify bases that fail to converge. We further demonstrate the emergence of state designs in a physical system by studying the dynamics of a chaotic tilted field Ising chain with periodic boundary conditions. We find faster convergence of the trace distance in the initial time, however, it saturates to a finite value deviating from random matrix prediction at a late time, in contrast to the case with open boundary condition. To delineate the general applicability of our results, we extend our analysis to other symmetries. We expect our findings to pave the way for further exploration of deep thermalization and equilibration of closed and open quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Topologically protected emergent Fermi surface in an Abrikosov vortex lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.18627v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that a three-dimensional (3D) fully gapped type-II superconductor can feature emergent in-gap Fermi surfaces of Caroli-de Gennes Matricon (CdGM) quasiparticles in the presence of an Abrikosov vortex lattice. In particular, these CdGM Fermi surfaces manifest in the emergent 3D band structure enabled by the intervortex tunneling physics, and their stability is guaranteed by a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological index. By developing an effective analytical theory, we find that each vortex line carrying a 1D nodal dispersion is a sufficient condition for the vortex lattice to form CdGM Fermi surfaces. Following this prediction, in-gap CdGM Fermi surfaces are numerically confirmed in a microscopic vortex-lattice simulation of a superconducting Dirac semimetal with an $s$-wave spin-singlet pairing, which is directly applicable to a large class of type-II superconductors such as LiFeAs. Remarkably, the CdGM Fermi surfaces persist even when the normal state is deformed to a doped insulator of trivial band topology. Our work establishes the vortex lattice as a new experimentally feasible control knob for emergent topological phenomena in conventional superconductors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07100v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Level spectroscopy stands as a powerful method for identifying the transition point that delineates distinct quantum phases. Since each quantum phase exhibits a characteristic sequence of excited states, the crossing of energy levels between low-lying excited states offers a reliable mean to estimate the phase transition point. While approaches like the Variational Quantum Eigensolver are useful for approximating ground states of interacting systems using quantum computing, capturing low-energy excitations remains challenging. In our study, we introduce an equivariant quantum circuit that preserves the total spin and the translational symmetry to accurately describe singlet and triplet excited states in the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a chain, which are crucial for characterizing its transition point. Additionally, we assess the impact of noise on the variational state, showing that conventional mitigation techniques like Zero Noise Extrapolation reliably restore its physical properties.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning Neural Network Quantum States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07795v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in the design and optimization of Neural-Network Quantum States (NQS) have made them an effective method to investigate ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems. In contrast to the standard approach of training a separate NQS from scratch at every point of the phase diagram, we demonstrate that the optimization of a NQS at a highly expressive point of the phase diagram (i.e., close to a phase transition) yields interpretable features that can be reused to accurately describe a wide region across the transition. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach on different systems in one and two dimensions by initially pretraining a NQS at a given point of the phase diagram, followed by fine-tuning only the output layer for all other points. Notably, the computational cost of the fine-tuning step is very low compared to the pretraining stage. We argue that the reduced cost of this paradigm has significant potential to advance the exploration of condensed matter systems using NQS, mirroring the success of fine-tuning in machine learning and natural language processing.</description>

      <title>Topological Optical Spin Injection Beyond Regular Weyl semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09235v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Photoinduced effects are now reckoned to be important tools to reveal a rich gamut of entrancing physics in topological materials, which are normally inaccessible via conventional probes. Here we investigate one of these intriguing effects, namely, {\it optical spin injection} (OSI) beyond the regular Weyl semimetal (WSM), specifically in multi- and higher-order WSMs. Remarkably, we demonstrate that OSI in multi-WSMs can emerge as a frequency-independent quantized response engendered by band linearity and topological charge associated with the node. Interestingly, the frequency independence can be destroyed by going beyond the first-order topological phase where we explicitly show the OSI response is accompanied by peaks for the first-order Weyl nodes while dips for the second-order Weyl nodes. In addition, we elucidate the behavior of OSI in type-II Weyl phases. The predicted signatures of OSI beyond the regular WSM, i.e., multi- and higher-order WSM, could be experimentally exploited, leading us to effectively access as well as distinguish different-order nontrivial Weyl topology.</description>
