      <title>A Bistatic ISAC Framework for LEO Satellite Systems: A Rate-Splitting Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aiming to achieve ubiquitous global connectivity and target detection on the same platform with improved spectral/energy efficiency and reduced onboard hardware cost, low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems capable of simultaneously performing communications and radar have attracted significant attention. Designing such a joint system should address not only the challenges of integrating two functions but also the unique propagation characteristics of the satellites. To overcome severe echo signal path loss due to the high altitude of the satellite, we put forth a bistatic integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) framework with a radar receiver separated from the satellite. For robust and effective interference management, we employ rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA), which splits and encodes users messages into private and common streams. We optimize the dual-functional precoders to maximize the minimum rate among all users while satisfying the Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) constraints. Given the challenge of acquiring instantaneous channel state information (iCSI) for LEO satellites, we exploit the geometrical and statistical characteristics of the satellite channel. To develop an efficient optimization algorithm, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), sequential rank-1 constraint relaxation (SROCR), and successive convex approximation (SCA) are utilized. Numerical results show that the proposed framework efficiently performs both communication and radar, demonstrating superior interference control capabilities. Furthermore, it is validated that the common stream plays three vital roles: i) beamforming towards the radar target, ii) interference management between communications and radar, and iii) interference management among communication users.</description>

      <title>Two Classes of Optimal Multi-Input Structures for Node Computations in Message Passing Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we delve into the computations performed at a node within a message-passing algorithm. We investigate low complexity/latency multi-input structures that can be adopted by the node for computing outgoing messages y = (y1, y2, . . . , yn) from incoming messages x = (x1, x2, . . . , xn), where each yj , j = 1, 2, . . . , n is computed via a multi-way tree with leaves x excluding xj . Specifically, we propose two classes of structures for different scenarios. For the scenario where complexity has a higher priority than latency, the star-tree-based structures are proposed. The complexity-optimal ones (as well as their lowest latency) of such structures are obtained, which have the near-lowest (and sometimes the lowest) complexity among all structures. For the scenario where latency has a higher priority than complexity, the isomorphic-directed-rooted-tree-based structures are proposed. The latency-optimal ones (as well as their lowest complexity) of such structures are obtained, which are proved to have the lowest latency among all structures.</description>

      <title>Asynchronous Online Adaptation via Modular Drift Detection for Deep Receivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09134v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning is envisioned to facilitate the operation of wireless receivers, with emerging architectures integrating deep neural networks (DNNs) with traditional modular receiver processing. While deep receivers were shown to operate reliably in complex settings for which they were trained, the dynamic nature of wireless communications gives rise to the need to repeatedly adapt deep receivers to channel variations. However, frequent re-training is costly and ineffective, while in practice, not every channel variation necessitates adaptation of the entire DNN. In this paper, we study concept drift detection for identifying when does a deep receiver no longer match the channel, enabling asynchronous adaptation, i.e., re-training only when necessary. We identify existing drift detection schemes from the machine learning literature that can be adapted for deep receivers in dynamic channels, and propose a novel soft-output detection mechanism tailored to the communication domain. Moreover, for deep receivers that preserve conventional modular receiver processing, we design modular drift detection mechanisms, that simultaneously identify when and which sub-module to re-train. The provided numerical studies show that even in a rapidly time-varying scenarios, asynchronous adaptation via modular drift detection dramatically reduces the number of trained parameters and re-training times, with little compromise on performance.</description>

      <title>6G: The Intelligent Network of Everything -- A Comprehensive Vision, Survey, and Tutorial</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global 6G vision has taken its shape after years of international research and development efforts. This work culminated in ITU-R's Recommendation on "IMT-2030 Framework". While the definition phase of technological requirements is currently ongoing, 3GPP's standardization process on 6G networks is expected to start in 2025 and worldwide commercialization around 2030. This article serves as a comprehensive guide to 6G by providing an overall vision, a contemporary survey of the main literature, and an informative tutorial-type presentation style. In our vision, 6G will be based on three fundamental elements: wireless, artificial intelligence (AI), and the Internet of Everything (IoE). Consequently, 6G can ultimately become the Intelligent Network of Everything while serving as an enabling platform for the next major disruption in mobile communication, called mobile intelligence. The potential of mobile intelligence is that anything can be made connected, intelligent, and aware of its environment. This will revolutionize the way how devices, systems, and applications are designed; how they operate and interact with humans and each other; and how they can be used for the benefit of people, society, and the world in general. After high-level visioning, the main details of 6G are discussed, including fundamental elements, disruptive applications, key use cases, main performance requirements, potential technologies, and defining features. A special focus is given to a comprehensive set of potential 6G technologies, each of which is introduced in a tutorial manner. Finally, we speculate on what comes after 6G and sketch the first high-level vision of 7G. All in all, the objective of this article is to provide a thorough guide to 6G in order to serve as a source of knowledge and inspiration for further research and development work in academia, industry, and standardization bodies.</description>

      <title>Perturbation-based Sequence Selection for Probabilistic Amplitude Shaping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09006v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a practical sign-dependent sequence selection metric for probabilistic amplitude shaping and propose a simple method to predict the gains in signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for sequence selection. The proposed metric provides a $0.5$ dB SNR gain for single-polarized 256-QAM transmission over a long-haul fiber link.</description>

      <title>Provable Privacy Advantages of Decentralized Federated Learning via Distributed Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) emerged as a paradigm designed to improve data privacy by enabling data to reside at its source, thus embedding privacy as a core consideration in FL architectures, whether centralized or decentralized. Contrasting with recent findings by Pasquini et al., which suggest that decentralized FL does not empirically offer any additional privacy or security benefits over centralized models, our study provides compelling evidence to the contrary. We demonstrate that decentralized FL, when deploying distributed optimization, provides enhanced privacy protection - both theoretically and empirically - compared to centralized approaches. The challenge of quantifying privacy loss through iterative processes has traditionally constrained the theoretical exploration of FL protocols. We overcome this by conducting a pioneering in-depth information-theoretical privacy analysis for both frameworks. Our analysis, considering both eavesdropping and passive adversary models, successfully establishes bounds on privacy leakage. We show information theoretically that the privacy loss in decentralized FL is upper bounded by the loss in centralized FL. Compared to the centralized case where local gradients of individual participants are directly revealed, a key distinction of optimization-based decentralized FL is that the relevant information includes differences of local gradients over successive iterations and the aggregated sum of different nodes' gradients over the network. This information complicates the adversary's attempt to infer private data. To bridge our theoretical insights with practical applications, we present detailed case studies involving logistic regression and deep neural networks. These examples demonstrate that while privacy leakage remains comparable in simpler models, complex models like deep neural networks exhibit lower privacy risks under decentralized FL.</description>

      <title>Negative Shaping Order K in Set Shaping Theory: A Comprehensive Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores an innovative aspect of the Set Shaping Theory, the use of a negative shaping order K. Traditionally, the theory utilizes a positive K to extend the length of data strings, enhancing their testability and compressibility. We propose a paradigm shift by employing a negative K, which shortens data strings and potentially improves compression efficiency. However, this approach sacrifices the local testability of the data, a cornerstone in traditional Set Shaping Theory. We examine the theoretical implications, practical benefits, and challenges of this new methodology.</description>

      <title>Finite Blocklength Performance of Capacity-achieving Codes in the Light of Complexity Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07773v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the work of Polyanskiy, Poor and Verd\'u on the finite blocklength performance of capacity-achieving codes for discrete memoryless channels, many papers have attempted to find further results for more practically relevant channels. However, it seems that the complexity of computing capacity-achieving codes has not been investigated until now. We study this question for the simplest non-trivial Gaussian channels, i.e., the additive colored Gaussian noise channel. To assess the computational complexity, we consider the classes $\mathrm{FP}_1$ and $\#\mathrm{P}_1$. $\mathrm{FP}_1$ includes functions computable by a deterministic Turing machine in polynomial time, whereas $\#\mathrm{P}_1$ encompasses functions that count the number of solutions verifiable in polynomial time. It is widely assumed that $\mathrm{FP}_1\neq\#\mathrm{P}_1$. It is of interest to determine the conditions under which, for a given $M \in \mathbb{N}$, where $M$ describes the precision of the deviation of $C(P,N)$, for a certain blocklength $n_M$ and a decoding error $\epsilon &gt; 0$ with $\epsilon\in\mathbb{Q}$, the following holds: $R_{n_M}(\epsilon)&gt;C(P,N)-\frac{1}{2^M}$. It is shown that there is a polynomial-time computable $N_*$ such that for sufficiently large $P_*\in\mathbb{Q}$, the sequences $\{R_{n_M}(\epsilon)\}_{{n_M}\in\mathbb{N}}$, where each $R_{n_M}(\epsilon)$ satisfies the previous condition, cannot be computed in polynomial time if $\mathrm{FP}_1\neq\#\mathrm{P}_1$. Hence, the complexity of computing the sequence $\{R_{n_M}(\epsilon)\}_{n_M\in\mathbb{N}}$ grows faster than any polynomial as $M$ increases. Consequently, it is shown that either the sequence of achievable rates $\{R_{n_M}(\epsilon)\}_{n_M\in\mathbb{N}}$ as a function of the blocklength, or the sequence of blocklengths $\{n_M\}_{M\in\mathbb{N}}$ corresponding to the achievable rates, is not a polynomial-time computable sequence.</description>

      <title>Generalized Friis Transmission Formula Using Active Antenna Available Power and Unnamed Power Gain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13775v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use the concept of active antenna available power to derive a generalization of the Friis transmission formula for multiport antenna systems. With beamformer weights chosen such that the array patterns are the same when transmitting and receiving, the active antenna available power at the receiving antenna divided by the input power at the transmitter is symmetric under link direction reversal in the near field as well as the far field. These results generalize the Friis transmission formula to beamformed multiport antenna systems in an arbitrary reciprocal propagation environment.</description>
