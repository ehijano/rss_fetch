      <title>A response matrix determined with a coincidence-based acquisition for correction of charge sharing spectral distortions in energy-resolved photon counting detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05730</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05730v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A model-independent method is proposed to characterize and correct charge sharing spectral distortions in energy-resolved X-ray acquisitions with pixellated photon-counting detectors. The technique is based on the determination of a coincidence-based response matrix (CBRM) through a preliminary calibration with a uniform irradiation and an arbitrary polychromatic spectrum. The calibration requires the collection of the number of coincidences between a reference pixel and its neighbours for different combinations of energy bins, in order to calculate a set of charge sharing probabilities which are independent of the input spectrum. A detector response matrix is determined, which can afterwards be applied to correct other spectra acquired with the same detector and a conventional multi-comparator electronics, without introducing penalties in terms of processing time. The technique was validated with Geant4 simulations of a 1 mm thick CdTe detector and with data collected with a pixel hybrid detector made of a 300 um thick silicon sensor coupled to a Timepix4 ASIC chip. The differences between the reconstructed spectra and reference distributions of an ideal detector or a 3x3 offline clustering algorithm were evaluated in terms of mean absolute percentage errors. It is demonstrated that the response matrix can restore the spectral information with a performance close to standard clustering algorithms and is less affected by noise artifacts than analog charge summing techniques.</description>

      <title>A flexible test facility for liquid xenon detector development</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.05853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As liquid xenon time projection chambers scale to ever-larger sizes, so too do the engineering challenges they pose. We describe a large, flexible, multipurpose test facility capable of supporting the development of a number of key aspects of liquid xenon detector systems. Example applications of this facility include characterization of large-area light and charge sensor arrays, tests of xenon purification techniques and materials compatibility, and investigations into high-voltage phenomena. This facility uses an automated and remotely monitored cryo-cooling system based on immersion of the test chamber in a liquid bath rather than conductive coupling, leading to advantages in temperature and pressure stability, as well as increasing required response times in the case of cooling-power loss. Design advantages, operational procedures, and performance of the facility are described, as well as five examples of liquid xenon test chambers that use the facility.</description>

      <title>Development and performance test of p-type Silicon pad array detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article reports on the development and comprehensive evaluation of p-type silicon detector arrays fabricated at the Semi-Conductor Laboratory (SCL), Mohali, India. The detectors consist of an 8~$\times$~9 array of 1~$\times$~1~cm$^2$ pads fabricated on 6-inch wafers and read out using the High Granularity Calorimeter Readout Chip (HGCROC). Electrical characterization of the detector through current vs. voltage (IV) and capacitance vs. voltage (CV) measurements demonstrated consistent breakdown and full depletion voltages across all pads, in agreement with Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) device simulations. Laboratory measurements with a $^{90}$Sr source and beam tests at PS, CERN with 10 GeV pions, showed a clear Minimum Ionizing Particle (MIP) signal, well separated from the pedestal and uniform response of the pads with an average signal-to-noise (S/N) ratio above 5.5. The measured shower profiles with 2-4 GeV positron beams for various thicknesses of a tungsten absorber placed in front of the detector are found to be in agreement with the corresponding Geant4 simulations. The performance test results for the detector show that it is a promising candidate for the future ALICE upgrade detector named Forward Calorimeter (FoCal). The FoCal will have alternating layers of low and high-granularity silicon pad detectors with absorbers as a part of the electromagnetic segment, and along with its hadronic segment, will study the direct photons, neutral hadrons, vector mesons, and jets production in the low Bjorken-x region.</description>

      <title>Studies on the effect of low-fluence proton and neutron irradiation on n-type LGADs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06282v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presented study investigates the effects of low fluences from $5\times10^{12}$ up to $1\times10^{14}$ particles/cm$^{2}$ of 60MeV proton and neutron irradiation on n-type Low Gain Avalanche Detectors (nLGADs). An nLGAD is a silicon sensor with a highly doped gain layer that enables controlled charge multiplication via impact ionization. In contrast to the well-established p-type LGADs for high-energy physics (HEP) applications, nLGADs are optimized for the detection of low-penetrating particles such as UV photons and soft X-rays. In addition to studying their potential application in environments with radiation backgrounds, these novel devices also enable the exploration of the underlying phenomenology arising from the combination of n-type bulk material with a gain layer, which degradation was previously studied predominantly in the context of p-type LGADs. The irradiation effects were characterized through measurements of the leakage current and capacitance with increasing bias voltage (I-V and C-V), revealing systematic and fluence-dependent behavior related to space charge sign inversion (SCSI) of the n-type bulk material, which especially alters the electric field in the sensor and thus the depletion behavior. Additionally, annealing studies were performed to assess both beneficial and reverse annealing regimes with isothermal and isochronal annealing. The findings are consistent with previous high-energy proton studies and contribute to a deeper understanding of the fundamental behavior of nLGADs under irradiation.</description>

      <title>Vertex reconstruction in the TAO experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Taishan Antineutrino Observatory (TAO) is a tonne-scale gadolinium-doped liquid scintillator satellite experiment of the Jiangmen Underground Neutrino Observatory (JUNO). It is designed to measure the reactor antineutrino energy spectrum with unprecedented energy resolution, better than 2% at 1 MeV. To fully achieve its designed performance, precise vertex reconstruction is crucial. This work reports two distinct vertex reconstruction methods, the charge center algorithm (CCA) and the deep learning algorithm (DLA). We describe the efforts in optimizing and improving these two methods and compare their reconstruction performance. The results show that the CCA and DLA methods can achieve vertex position resolutions better than 20mm (bias&lt;5mm) and 12mm (bias&lt;1.3mm) at 1 MeV, respectively, fully meeting the requirements of the TAO experiment. The reconstruction algorithms developed in this study not only prepare the TAO experiment for its upcoming real data but also hold significant potential for application in other similar experiments.</description>

      <title>Template masks for 4D-STEM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.06371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new analysis method for atomic resolution four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM, in which a diffraction pattern is collected at each point of a raster scan of a focused electron beam across the specimen). In 4D-STEM, each measured intensity has a dual character, forming a pixel in a diffraction pattern and, equally, forming a pixel in a STEM image. Applying a mask to the data to obtain a "virtual" bright field or dark field image is widely used and understood. However, there is a complementary procedure, in which an image (template) is applied to the data to obtain a mask. This mask shows the correlation between the data and the template and, when applied to atomic resolution 4D-STEM data produces an image optimised for the template. This allows, for example, imaging of specific atom columns and is a significant improvement over user-defined masks such as virtual annular bright field imaging. We demonstrate the capability of the approach, separately imaging Li and O atom columns in LiFePO4 and O, Pb and Ti across a domain wall in PbTiO3.These template masks provide a computationally straightforward and general method to probe 4D-STEM data. They are particularly effective for specimens of moderate thickness where multiple scattering produces strong and specific correlations in diffraction patterns.</description>

      <title>Ultra-sensitive radon assay using an electrostatic chamber in a recirculating system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15464v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Rare event searches such as neutrinoless double beta decay and Weakly Interacting Massive Particle detection require ultra-low background detectors. Radon contamination is a significant challenge for these experiments, which employ highly sensitive radon assay techniques to identify and select low-emission materials. This work presents the development of ultra-sensitive electrostatic chamber (ESC) instruments designed to measure radon emanation in a recirculating gas loop, for future lower background experiments. Unlike traditional methods that separate emanation and detection steps, this system allows continuous radon transport and detection. This is made possible with a custom-built recirculation pump. A Python-based analysis framework, PyDAn, was developed to process and fit time-dependent radon decay data. Radon emanation rates are given for various materials measured with this instrument. A radon source of known activity provides an absolute calibration, enabling statistically-limited minimal detectable activities of 20 $\mu$Bq. These devices are powerful tools for screening materials in the development of low-background particle physics experiments.</description>

      <title>Scanning Acoustic Microscopy for Quantifying Bubble Evolution in Alkaline Water Electrolyzers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Improved understanding of gas/liquid transport in electrochemical gas-evolving systems is increasingly demanded for optimizing device performance. However, high-resolution measurement techniques for in-situ imaging remain limited. This work demonstrates the use of volumetric scanning acoustic microscopy (SAM) for quantifying hydrogen bubble evolution in porous nickel electrodes in a customized alkaline water electrolysis cell. By using high-frequency focused ultrasound, SAM enables volumetric imaging with high spatial resolution in the range of tens of micrometers. This allows the distribution of gas bubbles within the complex 3D architecture of porous electrodes to be resolved. Digital image processing methods are used to segment and quantify the gas content in the electrode. Thus, non-destructive SAM imaging is demonstrated to be an accessible and scalable analytical tool for the quantitative investigation of bubble evolution in operando electrochemical environments. Here, a solid foundation is established for future studies aimed at optimizing bubble dynamics and cell design under practically relevant operating conditions, ultimately contributing to higher electrolysis efficiencies.</description>
