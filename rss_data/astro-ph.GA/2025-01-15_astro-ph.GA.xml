      <title>Cosmic quenching and scaling laws for the evolution of supermassive black holes and host galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Observations suggest an SMBH-host coevolution. We consider the mass and energy flow in a bulge suffused by gases of varying temperatures. By assuming the rate of energy flow independent of the distance from the bulge center and the local virial equilibrium for permeated gases, a key parameter $\varepsilon_b$ was identified that quantifies the rate of mass and energy flow in gases and the efficiency of gas cooling and thus regulates the coevolution of SMBHs and hosts. Using Illustris simulations, we found $\varepsilon_b\propto (1+z)^{5/2}$. A higher $\varepsilon_b$ in the early Universe means a more efficient gas cooling that allows initial rapid growth of SMBHs and hosts. This simple theory, characterized by $\varepsilon_b$, provides the dominant mean cosmic evolution of SMBHs and hosts. All other transient phenomena may only contribute to the dispersion around mean evolution. Relevant scaling laws involving $\varepsilon_b$ were identified. For host galaxies, the mass-size relation $M_b\propto \varepsilon_b^{2/3}r_b^{5/3}G^{-1}$, dispersion-size relation $\sigma_b^2\propto(\varepsilon_b r_b)^{2/3}\propto (1+z)$, or the mass-dispersion relation $M_b\propto \varepsilon_b^{-1}G^{-1}\sigma_b^5$ were identified, where size $r_b\propto (1+z)^{-1}$. For SMBHs, three evolution phases were found involving an initial rapid growth stage with a rising luminosity $L_B\propto (\varepsilon_b M_{BH})^{4/5}$, a transition stage with a declining $L_B\propto \varepsilon_b^2 M_{BH} \propto (1+z)^5$, and a dormant stage with $L_B\propto (\varepsilon_b M_{BH})^{4/3}$. Results suggest a rapid initial super-Eddington growth with a new redshift-dependent luminosity limit $L_X\propto\varepsilon_b^{4/5}M_{BH}^{4/5}G^{-1/5}c$, in contrast to the Eddington limit. Analytical solutions are formulated for the BH and AGN mass functions and AGN duty cycle and predict a slope of -1/5 for the faint-end luminosity function.</description>

      <title>Helical Magnetic Field in a Massive Protostellar Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07622v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Highly collimated outflows (jets) are observed across a wide range of astrophysical systems involving the accretion of material onto central objects, from supermassive black holes in active galaxies to proto-brown dwarfs and stellar-mass black holes. Despite the diversity of their driving sources, it is believed that all jets are different manifestations of a single universal phenomenon. However, a unified explanation for their ejection and collimation remains elusive. In this study we present the first rotation measure analysis of the polarized synchrotron emission ever performed in a protostellar radio jet, which allows us to reveal its true 3D magnetic structure. Unlike extragalactic radio jets, which often exhibit faint counterjets, protostellar radio jets allow both the jet and the counterjet to be analyzed. This exceptional circumstance allows us to unveil the magnetic field structure of both components. Our findings provide the first solid evidence for a helical magnetic field within a protostellar jet, supporting the universality of the jet collimation mechanism.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Ancient Globular Cluster Candidates in The Relic, a Quiescent Galaxy at z=2.5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Globular clusters (GCs) are some of the oldest bound structures in the Universe, holding clues to the earliest epochs of star formation and galaxy assembly. However, accurate age measurements of ancient clusters are challenging due to the age-metallicity degeneracy. Here, we report the discovery of 42 compact stellar systems within the 'Relic', a massive, quiescent galaxy at $z=2.53$. The Relic resides in an over-density behind the Abell 2744 cluster, with a prominent tidal tail extending towards two low-mass companions. Using deep data from the UNCOVER/MegaScience JWST Surveys, we find that clusters formed in age intervals ranging from 8 Myr up to $\sim2$ Gyr, suggesting a rich formation history starting at $z\sim10$. While the cluster-based star formation history is broadly consistent with the high past star formation rates derived from the diffuse host galaxy light, one potential discrepancy is a tentative $\sim2-3\times$ higher rate in the cluster population for the past Gyr. Taken together with the spatial distribution and low inferred metallicities of these young-to-intermediate age clusters, we may be seeing direct evidence for the accretion of star clusters in addition to their early in-situ formation. The cluster masses are high, $\sim10^6-10^7~M_{\odot}$, which may explain why we are able to detect them around this likely post-merger galaxy. Overall, the Relic clusters are consistent with being precursors of the most massive present-day GCs. This unique laboratory enables the first connection between long-lived, high-redshift clusters and local stellar populations, offering insights into the early stages of GC evolution and the broader processes of galaxy assembly.</description>

      <title>A novel Bayesian approach for decomposing the radio emission of quasars: II. Link between quasar radio emission and black hole mass</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whether the mass of supermassive black hole ($M_\mathrm{BH}$) is directly linked to the quasar radio luminosity remains a long-debated issue, and understanding the role of $M_\mathrm{BH}$ in the evolution of quasars is pivotal to unveiling the mechanism of AGN feedback. In this work, based on a two-component Bayesian model, we examine how $M_\mathrm{BH}$ affects the radio emission from quasars, separating the contributions from host galaxy star formation (SF) and AGN activity. By modelling the radio flux density distribution of Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) quasars from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey Data Release 2, we find no correlation between $M_\mathrm{BH}$ and SF rate (SFR) at any mass for quasars at a given redshift and bolometric luminosity. The same holds for AGN activity across most $M_\mathrm{BH}$ values; however, quasars with the top 20\% most massive SMBHs are 2 to 3 times more likely to host strong radio jets than those with lower-mass SMBHs at similar redshift and luminosity. We suggest defining radio quasar populations by their AGN and SF contributions instead of radio loudness; our new definition unifies previously divergent observational results on the role of $M_\mathrm{BH}$ in quasar radio emissions. We further demonstrate that this radio enhancement in quasars with the 20\% most massive SMBHs affects only the $\sim5\%$ most radio bright quasars at a given redshift and bolometric luminosity. We discuss possible physical origins of this radio excess in the most massive and radio-bright quasar population, which remains an interest for future study.</description>

      <title>Ultra-Light Dark Matter Simulations and Stellar Dynamics: Tension in Dwarf Galaxies for $m &lt; 5\times10^{-21} $ eV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07631</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07631v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of dark matter and stellar dynamics in Ultra Light Dark Matter halos tailored to mimic dwarf galaxies. For dark matter particle mass $m\approx 1\times 10^{-22}$ eV, dynamical heating causes the half-light radius to over-shoot surface brightness data of the Fornax galaxy. For $m\approx 1\times 10^{-21}$ eV, soliton core formation leads to a velocity dispersion peak incompatible with kinematics data. Extending the analysis to the Carina and Leo II galaxies, the tension persists up to $m\approx 5\times 10^{-21}$ eV. A caveat in our analysis is the omission of stellar self-gravity. This would not change dynamics today, but could affect extrapolation back in time if the stellar body was more compact in the past.</description>

      <title>Inadequate turbulent support in low-metallicity molecular clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dynamic properties of molecular clouds are set by the interplay of their self-gravity, turbulence, external pressure and magnetic fields. Extended surveys of Galactic molecular clouds typically find that their kinetic energy ($E_{\rm k}$) counterbalances their self-gravitational energy ($E_{\rm g}$), setting their virial parameter $\alpha_{\rm vir}=2E_{\rm k}/|E_{\rm g}|\approx1$. However, past studies either have been biased by the use of optically-thick lines or have been limited within the solar neighborhood and the inner Galaxy (Galactocentric radius $R_{\rm gc}&lt;R_{\rm gc,\odot} \approx 8$ kpc). Here we present sensitive mapping observations of optically thin $^{13}$CO lines towards molecular clouds in the low-metallicity Galactic outer disk ($R_{\rm gc}\sim9-24$ kpc). By combining archival data from the inner Galaxy and four nearby metal-poor dwarf galaxies, we reveal a systematic trend of $\alpha_{\rm vir}$, which declines from supervirial dynamic states in metal-rich clouds to extremely subvirial dynamic states in metal-poor clouds. In these metal-poor environments, turbulence alone is insufficient to counterbalance the self-gravity of a cloud. A cloud-volumetric magnetic field may replace turbulence as the dominant cloud-supporting mechanism in low-metallicity conditions, for example, the outermost galactic disks, dwarf galaxies and galaxies in the early Universe, which would then inevitably impact the initial conditions for star formation in such environments.</description>

      <title>3D MC II: X ray echoes reveal a clumpy molecular cloud in the CMZ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray observations collected over the last decades have revealed a strongly variable X-ray signal within the Milky Way's Galactic center, interpreted as X-ray echoes from its supermassive black hole, Sgr A*. These echoes are traced by the strong Fe K$\alpha$ fluorescent line at 6.4 keV of which its intensity is proportional to the density of the illuminated molecular gas. Over time, the echo scans through molecular clouds (MCs) in our Galactic center, revealing their 3D structure and highlighting their densest parts. While previous studies have utilized spectral line doppler shifts along with kinematic models to constrain the geometry of the CMZ or to study the structure of individual clouds, these methods have limitations, particularly in the turbulent region of the CMZ. We use archival Chandra X-ray data to construct one of the first 3D representations of one prominent MC, the Stone Cloud, located at (l = 0.068{\deg}, b = -0.076{\deg}) at a distance of ~20pc from Sgr A* in projection. Using the Chandra X-ray Observatory, we followed the X-ray echo in this cloud from 2008 to 2017. We combine this data with 1.3 mm dust continuum emission observed with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Herschel Space Observatory to re-construct the 3D structure of the cloud and estimate the column densities for each year's observed slice. The analysis of the X-ray echoes along with velocities from SMA molecular line data indicate that the structure of the Stone cloud can be described as a very diffuse background with multiple dense clumps throughout.</description>

      <title>On the accuracy of dark matter halo merger trees and the consequences for semi-analytic models of galaxy formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy formation and evolution models, such as semi-analytic models, are powerful theoretical tools for predicting how galaxies evolve across cosmic time. These models follow the evolution of galaxies based on the halo assembly histories inferred from large $N$-body cosmological simulations. This process requires codes to identify halos ("halo finder") and to track their time evolution ("tree builder"). While these codes generally perform well, they encounter numerical issues when handling dense environments. In this paper, we present how relevant these issues are in state-of-the-art cosmological simulations. We characterize two major numerical artefacts in halo assembly histories: (i) the non-physical swapping of large amounts of mass between subhalos, and (ii) the sudden formation of already massive subhalos at late cosmic times. We quantify these artefacts for different combinations of halo finder (SUBFIND, VELOCIRAPTOR, HBT+HERONS) and tree builder codes (D-TRESS+DHALO, TREEFROG, HBT+HERONS), finding that in general more than $50\%$ ($80\%$) of the more massive subhalos with $&gt;10^{3}$ ($&gt;10^{4}$) particles at $z=0$ inherit them in most cases. However, HBT+HERONS, which explicitly incorporates temporal information, effectively reduces the occurrence of these artefacts to $5\%$ ($10\%$). We then use the semi-analytic models SHARK and GALFORM to explore how these artefacts impact galaxy formation predictions. We demonstrate that the issues above lead to non-physical predictions in galaxies hosted by affected halos, particularly in SHARK where the modelling of baryons relies on subhalo information. Finally, we propose and implement fixes for the numerical artefacts at the semi-analytic model level, and use SHARK to show the improvements, especially at the high-mass end, after applying them.</description>

      <title>3D MC I: X-ray Tomography Begins to Unravel the 3-D Structure of a Molecular Cloud in our Galaxy's Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07717v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Astronomers have used observations of the Galactic gas and dust via infrared, microwave, and radio to study molecular clouds in extreme environments such as the Galactic center. More recently, X- ray telescopes have opened up a new wavelength range in which to study these molecular clouds. Previous flaring events from SgrA* propagate X-rays outwards in all directions, and these X-rays interact with the surrounding molecular gas, illuminating different parts of the clouds over time. We use a combination of X-ray observations from Chandra and molecular gas tracers (line data from Herschel and the Submillimeter Array) to analyze specific features in the Sticks cloud, one of three clouds in the Three Little Pigs system in the Central Molecular Zone (Galactic longitude and latitude of 0.106 and -0.082 degrees respectively). We also present a novel X-ray tomography method we used to create 3-D map of the Sticks cloud. By combining X-ray and molecular tracer observations, we are able to learn more about the environment inside the Sticks cloud.</description>

      <title>The FAST Ursa Major cluster HI survey (FUMaS): catalog and HI mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST), we have performed an Ursa Major cluster HI Survey (FUMaS) covering the entire UMa region centered at RA=11$^h$59$^m$28$^s$.3, DEC=49\degr05\arcmin18\arcsec with a radius of 7.5\degr. We have obtained the most complete catalog of HIsources in the UMa cluster, containing 179 HI sources with velocities in the range 625-1213.4 km~s$^{-1}$ and masses in the range 10$^{6.0}$-10$^{10.1}$ M$_{\odot}$ assuming a distance of 17.4 Mpc. Among them, 55 HI sources were detected for the first time. 32 HI sources do not have optical counterparts with known redshifts, and we found 25 possible counterparts in the multicolor optical image, and another 7 may be HI clouds. We also detected HI distributions in some interacting systems, e.g. the overlapping gas disks between NGC 3992 and its three companion galaxies, filaments around NGC 4026 and NGC 4111, and debris-like gas around NGC 3998. We computed the HIMF of the UMa cluster using the 1/V$_\mathrm{max}$ method and fitting it with the non-linear least squares (NLLS) and modified maximum likelihood (MML) method for the parameters: log$_{10}$($\phi_*$/Mpc$^{-3}$) = -0.86 $\pm$ 0.18, $\alpha$ = -1.10 $\pm$ 0.08 and log$_{10}$($M_*$/$M_{\odot}$) = 9.92 $\pm$ 0.23 for the NLLS method, and log$_{10}$($\phi_*$/Mpc$^{-3}$) = -0.78 $\pm$ 0.11, $\alpha$ = -1.10 $\pm$ 0.05 and log$_{10}$($M_*$/$M_{\odot}$) = 9.88 $\pm$ 0.14 for the MML method. This result is similar to that derived with VLA data, but the slope is steeper at the low-mass end because we detected more low-mass galaxies. The slope is flatter than that of the global HIMF, which is in agreement with the theoretical prediction that galaxies in high-density regions are stripped of gas due to interactions.</description>

      <title>More Local Volume dwarf galaxy candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07912v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of searching for new dwarf galaxies in the Local Volume. We found 40 satellite candidates in the double-virial-radius regions of 20 Milky Way-like and LMC-like galaxies in the southern sky using DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys, 10 of which were known but not clearly associated with the Local Volume previously. Among the 40 satellite candidates, 8 are supposed members of the NGC6744 group and 13 are located in the vicinity of the Sombrero galaxy. Based on seven companions to the giant spiral galaxy NGC\,6744 with measured radial velocities, we estimate that the total mass of the group is $M_T = (1.88\pm0.71)\times 10^{12} M_{\odot}$ and the total mass-to-K-luminosity ratio $M_T/L_K = (16.1\pm6.0) M_{\odot}/L_{\odot}$. We reproduce a distribution of 68 early- and late-type galaxies in the Local Volume situated around the Sombrero, noting their strong morphological segregation and also the presence of a foreground diffuse association of dwarf galaxies at 8 degrees to SE from the Sombrero.</description>

      <title>Mapping reionization bubbles in the JWST era II: inferring the position and characteristic size of individual bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is discovering an increasing number of galaxies well into the early stages of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Many of these galaxies are clustered with strong Lyman alpha (Ly$\alpha$) emission, motivating the presence of surrounding cosmic HII regions that would facilitate Ly$\alpha$ transmission through the intergalactic medium (IGM). Detecting these HII "bubbles" would allow us to connect their growth to the properties of the galaxies inside them. Here we develop a new forward-modeling framework to estimate the local HII region size and location from Ly$\alpha$ spectra of galaxy groups in the early stages of the EoR. Our model takes advantage of the complementary information provided by neighboring sightlines through the IGM. Our forward models sample the main sources of uncertainty, including: (i) the global neutral fraction; (ii) EoR morphology; (iii) emergent Ly$\alpha$ emission; and (iv) NIRSpec instrument noise. Depending on the availability of complementary nebular lines, $\sim$ 0.006 $\unicode{x2013}$ 0.01 galaxies per cMpc$^3$, are required to be $\gtrsim$95\% confident that the HII bubble location and size recovered by our method is accurate to within $\sim$ 1 comoving Mpc. This corresponds roughly to tens of galaxies at $z\sim7\unicode{x2013}8$ in $\sim$2x2 tiled pointing with JWST NIRSpec. Such a sample is achievable with a targeted survey with completeness down to $M_{\rm UV}^{\rm min}\lesssim$ -19 $\unicode{x2013}$ -17, depending on the over-density of the field. We test our method on 3D EoR simulations as well as misspecified equivalent width distributions, in both cases accurately recovering the HII region surrounding targeted galaxy groups.</description>

      <title>Dynamical evolution of the open clusters with different star formation efficiencies and orbital parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open star clusters are dynamic systems whose evolution is critically influenced by initial conditions such as star formation efficiency and orbital parameters. Understanding their dissolution mechanisms provides insight into stellar population dynamical mixing in the Milky Way. We aim to investigate the dynamical evolution and dissolution of initially non-virialised open clusters by examining how different global star formation efficiencies and orbital characteristics impact the cluster longevity and structural changes. We followed the evolution of the clusters up to their dissolution time on the basis of our calculations. We compare our open cluster dynamical evolutionary models with the observed open clusters in our Galaxy's solar vicinity. Using high-order direct N-body simulations, we modelled cluster evolution across different Galactic orbits, systematically varying initial star formation efficiencies to comprehensively explore dissolution mechanisms. Our simulations reveal that open clusters typically survive approximately ten orbital periods, with cluster lifetime being strongly dependent on global star formation efficiency and only marginally influenced by orbital eccentricity. We estimate gas expulsion timescales of 0.9 Myr, with initial supernova explosions efficiently removing gaseous components from the cluster. The expected lifetime of the cluster (in units of orbital periods) strongly depends on the cluster global star-formation efficiency and only slightly on the orbital eccentricities of the cluster. The theoretical models demonstrate a remarkable agreement of the Roche-volobe filling parameter with the recent observed Gaia DR3 cluster catalogues in the solar vicinity. By incorporating a mixed sample of clusters with varying star formation efficiencies, we provide a more nuanced understanding of open cluster evolution in the Galactic disc.</description>

      <title>The effect of environment on the mass assembly history of the Milky Way and M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the mass growth histories of the halos of Milky Way and M31 analogues formed in constrained cosmological simulations of the Local Group. These simulations constitute a fair and representative set of $\Lambda$CDM realisations conditioned on properties of the main Local Group galaxies, such as their masses, relative separation, dynamics and environment. Comparing with isolated analogues extracted from the TNG dark-matter-only simulations, we find that while our M31 halos have a comparable mass growth history to their isolated counterparts, our Milky Ways typically form earlier and their growth is suppressed at late times. Mass growth associated to major and minor mergers is also biased early for the Milky Way in comparison to M31, with most accretion occurring 1 - 4 Gyr after the Big Bang, and a relatively quiescent history at later times. 32% of our Milky Ways experienced a Gaia-Enceladus/Sausage (GES)-like merger, while 13% host an LMC-like object at the present day, with 5% having both. In one case, an SMC- and a Sagittarius-analogue are also present, showing that the most important mergers of the Milky Way in its Local Group environment can be reproduced in $\Lambda$CDM. We find that the material that makes up the Milky Way and M31 halos at the present day first collapsed onto a plane roughly aligned with the Local Sheet and Supergalactic plane; after $z \sim 2$, accretion occurred mostly within this plane, with the tidal effects of the heavier companion, M31, significantly impacting the late growth history of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>Exploring Multiple Stellar Populations in Globular Clusters with Euclid: A Theoretical Overview and Insights from NGC 6397</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the behavior of multiple stellar populations in globular clusters (GCs) using photometric diagrams constructed with Euclid photometry. By employing synthetic spectra and isochrones that incorporate the chemical differences between first-population (1P) stars, resembling field stars, and second-population (2P) stars, enriched in helium and nitrogen but depleted in carbon and oxygen, we identify, from a theoretical perspective, the color-magnitude diagrams and the chromosome maps most effective at distinguishing these populations within GCs. Euclid photometry proves to be a powerful tool for identifying multiple populations among M-dwarfs, as 1P and 2P stars form distinct sequences in well-chosen photometric diagrams, driven by differences in the strength of oxygen-based molecular features, such as water vapor. To validate our theoretical findings, we analyzed Euclid photometry and astrometry of the GC NGC 6397, complemented by photometric and astrometric data from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope, enabling a comprehensive study of its stellar populations across a wide field of view. We find that the 1P constitutes about 30% of the M-dwarfs in NGC 6397, with the fraction of 1P stars remaining consistent across different stellar masses and throughout the entire field of view. 2P stars exhibit an [O/Fe] depletion of about 0.3 dex relative to 1P stars, and both populations display isotropic proper motions. This study represents the first comprehensive analysis of multiple populations among M-dwarfs across a wide field of view, demonstrating that Euclid photometry is a powerful instrument for investigating multiple populations in GCs.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Field Structures In and Around Seyfert Galaxy Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08141v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present radio polarimetric images of 12 Seyfert and Low-Ionization Nuclear Emission-line Region (LINER) galaxies belonging to the Centre for Astrophysics (CfA)+12 micron sample exhibiting kiloparsec-scale radio outflows (KSRs). These observations have been carried out at 10 GHz with Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) in D-array and at 1.4 GHz with the BnA$\rightarrow$A array configurations. We find signatures of organized magnetic (B-) field structures in the cores, jets and lobes of these galaxies. The linear polarization fraction varies from a few per cent in the cores to $47\pm18$ per cent in the lobes. The inferred B-fields are toroidal in the cores of several sources making them consistent with the presence of either a sheath-like or a wind-like component surrounding the jet. The in-band spectral index images typically show the presence of flat/inverted spectrum cores and steep spectrum lobes. Radio cores with flatter spectra are found to have lower Eddington ratios while the steeper ones have higher. A strong correlation is observed between the Seyfert/LINER radio outflow properties and the mass of the supermassive black holes (SMBHs); correlations with Eddington ratios are weaker. We find signatures of jet-medium interaction and both positive and negative AGN feedback in these sources. Overall, our study indicates that radio-quiet (RQ) AGN with KSRs possess radio outflows driven by magnetic fields anchored to their black holes - accretion disks, which significantly impact their environments.</description>

      <title>Messier 90 galactic halo rotation in the microwaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08173v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planck data to study the Virgo Cluster's galaxy M 90 and its surroundings. We find, as in the case of certain galaxies of the Local Group and its vicinity, a substantial temperature asymmetry that probably arises from the rotation of the M 90 halo and extends up to about one degree from its centre. This temperature asymmetry is particularly remarkable as M 90 is a rare blueshifted galaxy of the Virgo Cluster, and it thus has possible implications for the cluster internal dynamics versus the galactic halo's formation and structure. Possible explanations for the observed effect are discussed.</description>

      <title>The VMC Survey : LI. Classifying extragalactic sources using a probabilistic random forest supervised machine learning algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We used a supervised machine learning algorithm (probabilistic random forest) to classify ~130 million sources in the VISTA Survey of the Magellanic Clouds (VMC). We used multi-wavelength photometry from optical to far-infrared as features to be trained on, and spectra of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), galaxies and a range of stellar classes including from new observations with the Southern African Large Telescope (SALT) and SAAO 1.9m telescope. We also retain a label for sources that remain unknown. This yielded average classifier accuracies of ~79% (SMC) and ~87% (LMC). Restricting to the 56,696,719 sources with class probabilities (P$_{class}$) &gt; 80% yields accuracies of ~90% (SMC) and ~98% (LMC). After removing sources classed as 'Unknown', we classify a total of 707,939 (SMC) and 397,899 (LMC) sources, including &gt; 77,600 extragalactic sources behind the Magellanic Clouds. The extragalactic sources are distributed evenly across the field, whereas the Magellanic sources concentrate at the centres of the Clouds, and both concentrate in optical/IR colour-colour/magnitude diagrams as expected. We also test these classifications using independent datasets, finding that, as expected, the majority of X-ray sources are classified as AGN (554/883) and the majority of radio sources are classed as AGN (1756/2694) or galaxies (659/2694), where the relative AGN-galaxy proportions vary substantially with radio flux density. We have found: &gt; 49,500 hitherto unknown AGN candidates, likely including more AGN dust dominated sources which are in a critical phase of their evolution; &gt; 26,500 new galaxy candidates and &gt; 2800 new Young Stellar Object (YSO) candidates.</description>

      <title>Little impact of mergers and galaxy morphology on the production and escape of ionizing photons in the early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08268v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Compact, star-forming galaxies with high star formation rate surface densities ($\Sigma_{\text{SFR}}$) are often efficient Lyman continuum (LyC) emitters at $z\leq 4.5$, likely as intense stellar feedback creates low-density channels that allow photons to escape. Irregular or disturbed morphologies, such as those resulting from mergers, can also facilitate LyC escape by creating anisotropic gas distributions. We investigate the influence of galaxy morphology on LyC production and escape at redshifts $5 \leq z \leq 7$ using observations from various \textit{James Webb Space Telescope} (JWST) surveys. Our sample consists of 436 sources, which are predominantly low-mass ($\sim 10^{8.15} M_\odot$), star-forming galaxies with ionizing photon efficiency ($\xi_{\rm ion}$) values consistent with canonical expectations. Since direct measurements of $f_{\rm esc}$ are not possible during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR), we predict $f_{\rm esc}$ for high-redshift galaxies by applying survival analysis to a subsample of LyC emitters from the Low-Redshift Lyman Continuum Survey (LzLCS), selected to be direct analogs of reionization-era galaxies. We find that these galaxies exhibit on average modest predicted escape fractions ($\sim 0.04$). Additionally, we assess the correlation between morphological features and LyC emission. Our findings indicate that neither $\xi_{\rm ion}$ nor the predicted $f_{\rm esc}$ values show a significant correlation with the presence of merger signatures. This suggests that in low-mass galaxies at $z \geq 5$, strong morphological disturbances are not the primary mechanism driving LyC emission and leakage. Instead, compactness and star formation activity likely play a more pivotal role in regulating LyC escape.</description>

      <title>Protostellar disc structure and dynamics during star formation from cloud-scale initial conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The early evolution of protostellar, star-forming discs, including their density structure, turbulence, magnetic dynamics, and accretion variability, remains poorly understood. We present high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations, using adaptive mesh refinement to capture detailed disc dynamics down to sub-AU scales. Starting from initial conditions derived from a molecular cloud simulation, we model the collapse of a dense core into a protostellar disc over 10,000 yr following sink particle (star) formation, achieving a maximum effective resolution of 0.63 AU. This simulation traces the evolution of the disc density, accretion rates, turbulence, and magnetic field structures. We find that the protostellar disc grows to a diameter of approximately 100 AU, with mass accretion occurring in episodic bursts influenced by the turbulence of the core from which the disc builds up. The disc is highly turbulent with a sonic Mach number of $\sim2$. The magnetic field is wound up by rotational motions, generating a magneto-centrifugal outflow, while episodic accretion events within the disc cause intermittent increases in mass and magnetic energy density, resulting in an equipartition of the thermal and magnetic pressure and an Alfv\'en Mach number of ~ 2. The disc density profiles steepen over time, following a power law consistent with observed young stellar discs and the minimum mass solar nebula. These results underscore the role of turbulence in early accretion variability and offer new insights into the physical and magnetic structure of young protostellar discs.</description>

      <title>PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 I: X-ray exploration of a low-mass cluster with exceptionally-distant radio relics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07651v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relics are diffuse, highly-polarized radio sources that trace merger-driven shocks at the periphery of merging galaxy clusters. The LOFAR survey recently discovered a rare example of double relics in the low-mass cluster PSZ2 G181.06+48.47. Through a detailed exploration of new Chandra and XMM-Newton observations, we reveal that PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 has a lower mass ($M_{500,X}=2.57^{+0.37}_{-0.38}\times10^{14}$ M$_{\odot}$) than previously thought. Despite its cool global temperature of $kT_{500}=3.86^{+0.27}_{-0.29}$ keV, PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 is one of the most disturbed clusters in the Planck sample, with a complex morphological and thermodynamic structure. We discover a set of three discontinuities within &lt;500 kpc of the cluster center, and, from a surface brightness analysis, place $5\sigma$ upper limits of $M_{NE}&lt;1.43$ and $M_{SW}&lt;1.57$ for any shock associated with the relic locations. We also revise established scaling relations for double radio-relics by adding 12 new systems not included in previous work. The PSZ2 G181.06+48.47 relics have the widest separation (scaled for $r_{500}$) of all known double-relic systems. The exceptional distance from the cluster center ($&gt;r_{200}$), indicates the relics may be associated with shocks in the ``run-away" phase. We propose that this late-stage, post-apocenter merger is captured as the two subclusters with a mass ratio of 1.2-1.4 fall back into each other. The outer relic shocks were likely produced at the first core passage, while the inner discontinuities are associated with the second infall.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae are formed by the matter ejected by low-to-intermediate mass stars (~0.8-8 times the mass of the Sun) towards the end of their lives. As hydrogen and then helium fuel sources run out, stars expand. During these giant phases stars also lose sizable amounts of mass. During the second giant phase, after the exhaustion of core helium, the mass loss is so great that stars lose a large fraction of their mass (50 - 90%), leaving behind a small, hot core, known as a white dwarf, surrounded by a nebula. Planetary nebulae are the result of many processes that shape and alter their ionization structure and chemical composition. The resulting nebula, illuminated by the ultraviolet-rich spectrum of the remnant very hot stellar core, is a spectacle of beauty and science. In this chapter, we show that these objects are invaluable laboratories for astrophysics, astrochemistry, and astromineralogy studies, with impact in many areas of Astronomy.</description>

      <title>Reflection-dominated Compton-thick AGN Candidates in the SRG/eROSITA Lockman Hole Survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We search for reflection-dominated Compton-thick active galactic nuclei (CT AGN) candidates in the Lockman Hole region using the data of SRG/eROSITA Lockman Hole survey. We selected sources with anomalously hard photon indices in the $0.3 - 8.0$ keV band, untypical for type I AGN. In particular, we required that the upper end of the $90\%$ error interval did not exceed a fiducial boundary of $\Gamma=1.3$. We found 291 sources which constitute a rare subpopulation among extragalactic X-ray sources detected by eROSITA in the Lockman Hole field, $\approx 5\%$. These sources constitute the eROSITA sample of CT AGN candidates in the Lockman Hole field. We further divide the sources into three categories depending on the availability of reliable redshift and statistically significant detection of intrinsic absorption. We present two catalogues: the bright sample (37 sources) and the faint one (254). We estimate the fraction and sky density of reflection-dominated CT AGN candidates. We show examples of individual spectra and use stacking analysis to search for possible redshift evolution of their properties with redshift. We analyse combined eROSITA spectra of bright sources of different categories with a physically motivated spectral model UXCLUMPY and find them fully consistent with the fits to the about $\sim 1$ Msec XMM-Newton data for one of our reflection-dominated CT candidates, Type 2 galaxy $\text{SRGe J105348.6+573032}$. The catalogues of CT AGN candidates could be a good starting point for planning future studies and follow-ups at all wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Variable Modified Newtonian Mechanics IV: Non Rotating Galaxies</title>

Abstract: At it stands, the $\Lambda CDM$ model does not anticipate the early emergence of massive galaxies \cite{mcgaugh2024}. Canonical Modified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) seems to fail at late time solar system scale \cite{tremaine}-\cite{desmond} and Wide-Binary scales \cite{banik}. To match data, a MOND variant needs a variable MOND acceleration $a_0$ which is strong at high redshift galactic scale and diminishes over redshift to far below Newtonian gravity at solar system scale at late time. We found such a candidate in a relativistic frame-work. In \cite{wong}, a new single-metric solution of Einstein Gravity is found for a point mass residing in an expanding universe, which apart from the Newtonian acceleration, gives rise to an additional MOND-like acceleration in which the MOND acceleration $a_0$ is replaced by the cosmological acceleration $\frac{1}{2}H^2(z)r$. This cosmological acceleration is shown to be far below Newtonian acceleration in the solar system. \\\\ In this work, we study the monolithic evolution of a Milky Way mass protogalactic cloud at recombination in this model where the non-Newtonian acceleration is stronger than Newtonian gravity. To obtain a spherical galaxy we assume that a point on a mass shell at turnaround will pick up non-systematic angular momentum. Assuming a violent relaxation process similar to the simulation studies for MOND and Newtonian gravity, we find that the central core can form a time independent Quasi-Stationary-State (QSS) by $z\gsim 7$, which could explain the galaxy morphology stability observations for $z&lt;6.5$ in \cite{ferreira2}. The virialised potential has a Newtonian acceleration dominant central region and a MOND-like acceleration dominant outer region. We evaluate the corresponding MOND acceleration $a_0^{VM}$ in a virialised potential for a Milky-Way mass elliptical galaxy and find that $a_0^{VM}\sim a_0$.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery in Astrophysics: Unraveling Supermassive Black Hole and Galaxy Coevolution</title>

Abstract: Correlation does not imply causation, but patterns of statistical association between variables can be exploited to infer a causal structure (even with purely observational data) with the burgeoning field of causal discovery. As a purely observational science, astrophysics has much to gain by exploiting these new methods. The supermassive black hole (SMBH)--galaxy interaction has long been constrained by observed scaling relations, that is low-scatter correlations between variables such as SMBH mass and the central velocity dispersion of stars in a host galaxy's bulge. This study, using advanced causal discovery techniques and an up-to-date dataset, reveals a causal link between galaxy properties and dynamically-measured SMBH masses. We apply a score-based Bayesian framework to compute the exact conditional probabilities of every causal structure that could possibly describe our galaxy sample. With the exact posterior distribution, we determine the most likely causal structures and notice a probable causal reversal when separating galaxies by morphology. In elliptical galaxies, bulge properties (built from major mergers) tend to influence SMBH growth, while in spiral galaxies, SMBHs are seen to affect host galaxy properties, potentially through feedback in gas-rich environments. For spiral galaxies, SMBHs progressively quench star formation, whereas in elliptical galaxies, quenching is complete, and the causal connection has reversed. Our findings support theoretical models of hierarchical assembly of galaxies and active galactic nuclei feedback regulating galaxy evolution. Our study suggests the potentiality for further exploration of causal links in astrophysical and cosmological scaling relations, as well as any other observational science.</description>

      <title>Multi-wavelength constraints on the local black hole occupation fraction</title>

Abstract: The fraction of dwarf galaxies hosting central, intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) at low redshifts is an important observational probe of black hole seeding at high redshift. Detections of nuclear accretion signatures in dwarf galaxies provides strong evidence for the presence of these IMBHs. We develop a Bayesian model to infer the black hole occupation fraction assuming a broken power law Eddington ratio distribution function. Our approach accounts for non-detections, incompleteness, and contamination from star-forming-related emission. We apply this model to galaxies with X-ray data from the Chandra Source Catalog at distances $&lt;50$ Mpc, radio data from the VLA Sky Survey at $&lt; 50$ Mpc, and optical variability data from the Palomar Transient Factory at $z&lt;0.055$. We find a black hole occupation fraction of at least $90$ percent at stellar masses of $M_{\star}=10^8~M_{\odot}$ and at least $39$ percent at $M_{\star} = 10^7~M_{\odot}$ (95\% confidence intervals). We show the resulting black hole mass function. These constraints on the IMBH population have implications for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission and for cosmological models of black hole seeding and growth. We also constrain the extremely low luminosity end ($L_{\rm{bol}}\lesssim10^{40}$ erg s$^{-1}$) of the AGN luminosity functions at $z=0$. Our AGN luminosity functions are broadly consistent with an extrapolation of the shallow slope of the AGN luminosity functions from previous work.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Unique Close Quasar-DSFG Pair Linked by a [C II] Bridge at $z=5.63$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06698v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a unique quasar-dusty star-forming galaxy (DSFG) system at $z = 5.63$, consisting of the bright quasar J1133+1603 ($M_{\rm UV} = -27.42$) and its compact, dust-obscured companion, J1133c. ALMA observations reveal a prominent [C II] bridge connecting the quasar and DSFG, indicating ongoing interaction at a projected separation of 1.8 arcsec ($\sim$10 proper kpc). J1133c exhibits unusually bright and broad [C II] emission ($L_{\rm [CII]} &gt; 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, FWHM $&gt; 500$ km s$^{-1}$), with a [C II] luminosity five times that of the quasar, suggesting intense star formation or potential AGN activity. The inferred star formation rate from [C II] is approximately $10^3$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. The remarkable properties of this pair strongly suggest that galaxy interactions may simultaneously trigger both starburst and quasar activity, driving rapid evolution in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Loop I/NPS morphology predictions in the ultralong-wavelength band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Loop I/North Polar Spur (NPS) is the giant arc structure above the Galactic plane observed in radio sky. There is a long-standing debate about its origin. While many people believe it is created by nearby supernova remnants (SNRs), some others consider it is a giant bubble close to the Galactic Center (GC), associated with the Fermi Bubble and eROSITA X-ray bubble. In ultralong wavelength band (wavelength $\gtrsim 10$ m or frequency $\lesssim 30$ MHz), particularly below $\sim 10$ MHz, the free-free absorption of radio signal by the diffuse electrons in interstellar medium (ISM) becomes significant, resulting in sky morphology largely differs from higher frequencies. In this paper, we predict the Loop I/NPS morphology at ultralong wavelength band. We develop emissivity models for the two Loop I/NPS origin scenarios. We find that: For SNR model, the full Loop I/NPS is still a bright arc even at frequency as low as $\sim 1$ MHz. In GC model, while above $\sim 3$ MHz it is still visible; below this frequency it is visible only at Galactic latitude $b\gtrsim 30\degree$. At $b\lesssim 30 \degree$ the Loop I/NPS is invisible due to the absorption by ISM electrons between the GC and the Sun. Upcoming space ultralong wavelentgh projects such as DSL and FARSIDE can potentially distinguish these two scenarios and provide decisive information about the origin of Loop I/NPS.</description>

      <title>Stellar Kinematics of the Milky Way Galaxy in the Post-Newton Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2106.05104v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper the recent interaction model over post-Newtonian theory of gravity has been used to study the stellar dynamics. It implies space time fabric that built over the massive object gets perturbed or literally contracted in presence of the test body having significant mass. In usual practice of general relativity the effect of interaction is missing or negligible but taking in consideration of this additional interaction the geodesic path followed by the test body must be deviated. From the celestial dynamics we know stellar rotation in the galaxy is not in accordance to Newton gravity and it prompts us to reconcile this interactive modified field for the galactic stars. Here we are to study the galactic stellar kinematics over introducing this additional perturbation. The galactic disk including the central super massive black hole and the star rotating around are being modelled theoretically as an effective two body system. In fact application of this model in the Milky Way shows the galactocentric solar rotational speed 220 km/s and is a good agreement with the observations.</description>

      <title>Gravitational-wave dark siren cosmology systematics from galaxy weighting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The detection of GW170817 and the measurement of its redshift from the associated electromagnetic counterpart provided the first gravitational wave determination of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), demonstrating the potential power of standard-siren cosmology. In contrast to this bright siren approach, the dark siren approach can be utilized for gravitational-wave sources in the absence of an electromagnetic counterpart: one considers all galaxies contained within the localization volume as potential hosts. When statistically averaging over the potential host galaxies, weighting them by physically-motivated properties (e.g., tracing star formation or stellar mass) could improve convergence. Using mock galaxy catalogs, we explore the impact of these weightings on the measurement of $H_0$. We find that incorrect weighting schemes can lead to significant biases due to two effects: the assumption of an incorrect galaxy redshift distribution, and preferentially weighting incorrect host galaxies during the inference. The magnitudes of these biases are influenced by the number of galaxies along each line of sight, the measurement uncertainty in the gravitational-wave luminosity distance, and correlations in the parameter space of galaxies. We show that the bias may be overcome from improved localization constraints in future GW detectors, a strategic choice of priors or weighting prescription, and by restricting the analysis to a subset of high-SNR events. We propose the use of hierarchical inference as a diagnostic of incorrectly-weighted prescriptions. Such approaches can simultaneously infer the correct weighting scheme and the values of the cosmological parameters, thereby mitigating the bias in dark siren cosmology due to incorrect host-galaxy weighting.</description>

Abstract: We carried out long-term monitoring of the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA binary black hole (BBH) merger candidate S230922g in search of electromagnetic emission from the interaction of the merger remnant with an embedding active galactic nuclei (AGN) accretion disk. Using a dataset primarily composed of wide-field imaging from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and supplemented by additional photometric and spectroscopic resources, we searched ~ 70% of the sky area probability for transient phenomena, and discovered 6 counterpart candidates. One especially promising candidate - AT 2023aagj - exhibited temporally varying asymmetric components in spectral broad line regions, a feature potentially indicative of an off-center event such as a BBH merger. This represents the first live search and multiwavelength, photometric, and spectroscopic monitoring of a GW BBH optical counterpart candidate in the disk of an AGN.</description>

      <title>The impact of baryons on the internal structure of dark matter haloes from dwarf galaxies to superclusters in the redshift range 0&lt;z&lt;7</title>

Abstract: We investigate the redshift evolution of the concentration-mass relationship of dark matter haloes in state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamic simulations and their dark-matter-only counterparts. By combining the IllustrisTNG suite and the novel MillenniumTNG simulation, our analysis encompasses a wide range of box size ($50 - 740 \: \rm cMpc$) and mass resolution ($8.5 \times 10^4 - 3.1 \times 10^7 \: \rm M_{\odot}$ per baryonic mass element). This enables us to study the impact of baryons on the concentration-mass relationship in the redshift interval $0&lt;z&lt;7$ over an unprecedented halo mass range, extending from dwarf galaxies to superclusters ($\sim 10^{9.5}-10^{15.5} \, \rm M_{\odot}$). We find that the presence of baryons increases the steepness of the concentration-mass relationship at higher redshift, and demonstrate that this is driven by adiabatic contraction of the profile, due to gas accretion at early times, which promotes star formation in the inner regions of haloes. At lower redshift, when the effects of feedback start to become important, baryons decrease the concentration of haloes below the mass scale $\sim 10^{11.5} \, \rm M_{\odot}$. Through a rigorous information criterion test, we show that broken power-law models accurately represent the redshift evolution of the concentration-mass relationship, and of the relative difference in the total mass of haloes induced by the presence of baryons. We provide the best-fit parameters of our empirical formulae, enabling their application to models that mimic baryonic effects in dark-matter-only simulations over six decades in halo mass in the redshift range $0&lt;z&lt;7$.</description>

      <title>MINDS. JWST-MIRI Observations of a Spatially Resolved Atomic Jet and Polychromatic Molecular Wind Toward SY Cha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11176v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The removal of angular momentum from protostellar systems drives accretion onto the central star and may drive the dispersal of the protoplanetary disk. Winds and jets can contribute to removing angular momentum from the disk, though the dominant process remain unclear. To date, observational studies of resolved disk winds have mostly targeted highly inclined disks. We report the detection of extended H2 and [Ne II] emission toward the young stellar object SY Cha with the JWST Mid-InfraRed Instrument Medium Resolution Spectrometer (MIRI-MRS). This is one of the first polychromatic detections of extended H2 toward a moderately inclined, i=51.1 degrees, Class II source. We measure the semi-opening angle of the H2 emission as well as build a rotation diagram to determine the H2 excitation temperature and abundance. We find a wide semi-opening angle, high temperature, and low column density for the H2 emission, all of which are characteristic of a disk wind. We derive a molecular wind mass loss rate of 3+-2e-9 Msun/yr, which is high compared to the previously derived stellar accretion rate of 6.6e-10 Msun/yr. This suggests either that the stellar accretion and the disk wind are driven by different mechanisms or that accretion onto the star is highly variable. These observations demonstrate MIRI-MRS's utility in expanding studies of resolved disk winds beyond edge-on sources.</description>
