      <title>JADES: An Abundance of Ultra-Distant T- and Y-Dwarfs in Deep Extragalactic Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00111v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultra-cool T- (T$_{\mathrm{eff}} \approx$ 500 - 1200 K) and Y-dwarfs (T$_{\mathrm{eff}}$ $\lessapprox 500$ K) have historically been found only a few hundred parsecs from the Sun. The sensitivity and wavelength coverage of the NIRCam instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope offer a unique method for finding low-temperature brown dwarfs in deep extragalactic datasets out to multiple kiloparsecs. Here we report on the selection of a sample of 41 brown dwarf and brown dwarf candidates across the JWST Advanced Deep Extragalactic Survey (JADES) in the GOODS-S and GOODS-N regions. We introduce a new open-source Bayesian tool, the Near-Infrared Fitting for T and Y-dwarfs (\texttt{NIFTY}), to derive effective temperatures, metallicities, and distances from JWST photometry. We find that 31 candidates have fits consistent with T-dwarf temperatures out to 5 - 6 kpc, and 10 candidates have fits consistent with Y-dwarf temperatures out to 1 - 2 kpc. The majority of the sources are best fit with sub-solar metallicity models, consistent with them being subdwarfs in the Milky Way thick disk and halo. We report proper motions for nine brown dwarf candidates (three are newly presented), and calculate the number density of T- and Y-dwarfs as a function of temperature and distance above the Milky Way midplane. We further discuss how Y-dwarfs can serve as contaminants in the search for ultra-high-redshift galaxies. Together, these results demonstrate the power of deep JWST extragalactic imaging to probe the coldest substellar populations far beyond the solar neighborhood, providing new constraints on the Milky Way's structure and brown dwarf demographics.</description>

      <title>Searching for Ultra-light Dark Matter in Spatial Correlations of White Dwarf Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: If dark matter is ultra-light and has certain Standard Model interactions, it can change the mass-radius relation of white dwarf stars. The coherence length of ultra-light dark matter imparts spatial correlations in deviations from the canonical mass-radius relation, and thus white dwarfs can be used to reconstruct the coherence length, or equivalently the particle mass, of the dark matter field. We simulate the observability of such spatial correlations accounting for realistic complications like variable hydrogen envelope thickness, dust, binaries, measurement noise, and distance uncertainties in DA white dwarfs. Using a machine learning approach on simulated data, we measure the dark matter field coherence length and find that large deviations from the mass-radius relation ($\sim10\%$ change in radius) are needed to produce an observable signal given realistic noise sources. We apply our spatial correlation measurement routine to the SDSS catalog of 10,207 DA white dwarfs. We detect a positive spatial correlation among white dwarfs at separations corresponding to a coherence length of $300\pm50$ pc, with an average Z-score of 85 for white dwarfs separated by less than this coherence length. We conclude that this signal is due to observational bias. The signal can be explained by an offset between measurements and theory for nearby cool white dwarfs, and the presence of few, low-temperature white dwarfs with noisy measurements at further distances. With future improvements in white dwarf models and measurement techniques, particularly for cool white dwarfs, this method can provide interesting constraints on ultra-light dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Solar limb faculae: intensity contrast from two vantage points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small-scale magnetic flux concentrations contribute significantly to the brightness variations of the Sun, yet observing them - particularly their magnetic field - near the solar limb remains challenging. Solar Orbiter offers an unprecedented second vantage point for observing the Sun. When combined with observations from the perspective of Earth, this enables simultaneous dual-viewpoint measurements of these magnetic structures, thereby helping to mitigate observational limitations. Using such a dual-viewpoint geometry, we characterise the brightness contrast of faculae near the limb as a function of both their associated magnetic field strength and the observation angle. We analyse data from Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager on board Solar Orbiter (SO/PHI), obtained during an observation program conducted in near-quadrature configuration with Earth, in combination with data from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/HMI). The High Resolution Telescope of SO/PHI observed a facular region located near disc centre as seen from its vantage point, while the same region was simultaneously observed near the solar limb by SDO/HMI. We identify faculae and determine their magnetic field strength from the disc-centre observations, and combine these with continuum intensity measurements at the limb to derive dual-viewpoint contrast curves. We then compare these with contrast curves derived from SDO/HMI alone. Using two viewpoints, we consistently find higher facular contrast near the limb than from a single-viewpoint.</description>

      <title>The Eclipsing $\gamma$ Doradus Star V421 Pegasi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present high-precision TESS photometry of V421 Peg (TIC 301747091), an early F-type eclipsing binary containing a candidate $\gamma$ Dor component. The observed short-cadence data allow the detection of pulsation signals, along with revision of the fundamental properties of the component stars. Detailed binary modeling indicated that the program target is a partially-eclipsing detached system in a circular orbit and that both components are currently in super-synchronous states. The radii of each star were measured with an accuracy of about 1 \%. By periodogram analysis of the outside-eclipse residual lights obtained from the binary star model, we extracted nine significant signals, five of which are likely aliasing frequencies due to sampling artifacts and uncorrected trends in the data used. The other signals of $f_1$, $f_2$, $f_3$, and $f_6$ are considered to be independent pulsations with frequencies ranging from 0.73 day$^{-1}$ to 1.02 day$^{-1}$, corresponding to pulsation constants of 0.63$-$0.88 days. These frequencies, pulsation constants, and position on the H-R diagram reveal that the pulsating signals are $\gamma$ Dor variables arising from the V421 Peg primary component.</description>

      <title>Oscillations of the solar photospheric magnetic field caused by the m = 1 high-latitude inertial mode</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic oscillations at 338 nHz in the Earth frame are observed at high latitudes in direct Doppler velocity measurements. These oscillations correspond to the $m=1$ high-latitude global mode of inertial oscillation. In this study, we investigate the signature of this mode in the photospheric magnetic field using long-term series of line-of-sight magnetograms from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) and the Global Oscillation Network Group (GONG). Through direct observations and spectral analysis, we detect periodic magnetic field oscillations at high latitudes ($65^\circ$--$70^\circ$) with a frequency of 338 nHz in the Earth frame, matching the known frequency of the $m = 1$ high-latitude inertial mode. The observed line-of-sight magnetic field oscillations are predominantly symmetric across the equator. We find a peak magnetic oscillation amplitude of up to $0.2$~gauss and a distinct spatial pattern, both consistent with simplified model calculations in which the radial component of the magnetic field is advected by the mode's horizontal flow field.</description>

      <title>Evaluating solar wind forecast using magnetic maps that include helioseismic far-side information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00608v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To model the structure and dynamics of the heliosphere well enough for high-quality forecasting, it is essential to accurately estimate the global solar magnetic field used as inner boundary condition in solar wind models. However, our understanding of the photospheric magnetic field topology is inherently constrained by the limitation of systematically observing the Sun from only one vantage point, Earth. To address this challenge, we introduce global magnetic field maps that assimilate far-side active regions derived from helioseismology into solar wind modeling. Through a comparative analysis between the combined surface flux transport and helioseismic Far-side Active Region Model (FARM) magnetic maps and the base surface flux transport model without far-side active regions (SFTM), we assess the feasibility and efficacy of incorporating helio-seismic far-side information in space weather forecasting. We are employing the Wang-Sheeley-Arge Solar Wind (WSA) model for statistical evaluation and leveraging the three-dimensional heliospheric MHD model, EUHFORIA, to analyze a case study. Using the WSA model, we show that including far-side magnetic data improves solar wind forecasts for 2013-2014 by up to 50% in correlation and 3% in Root Mean Square Error and Mean Absolute Error, especially near Earth and STEREO-A. Additionally, our 3D modeling shows significant localized differences in heliospheric structure that can be attributed to the presence or absence of active regions in the magnetic maps used as input boundaries. This highlights the importance of including far-side information to more accurately model and predict space weather effects caused by solar wind, solar transients, and geomagnetic disturbances.</description>

      <title>Propagation and Energy Dissipation of Shock Waves in the Solar Chromosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00724v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The solar atmosphere is permeated by various types of waves that originate from subsurface convection. As these waves propagate upward, they encounter they encounter a steep decrease in the density of the medium, leading to their steepening into shock waves. These shock waves typically exhibit a characteristic sawtooth pattern in wavelength-time ($\lambda$-t) plots of various chromospheric spectral lines, viz., H$\alpha$, Ca II 8542 {\AA} to name a few. In this study, we investigate the propagation of shock waves in the lower solar atmosphere using coordinated observations from the Swedish 1-meter Solar Telescope (SST), the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Our analysis reveals that after forming in the chromosphere, these shock waves travel upward through the solar atmosphere, with their signatures detectable not only in the transition region but also in low coronal passbands. These shock waves dissipate their energy into the chromosphere as they propagate. In certain cases, the energy deposited by these waves is comparable to the radiative losses of the chromosphere, highlighting their potential role in chromospheric heating. Our findings reported here provide crucial insights into wave dynamics in the lower solar atmosphere and their contribution to the energy transport process in the chromosphere.</description>

      <title>High energy emission powered by accreting companions of Be/gamma Cas stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of the hard, bright X-ray emission that defines the gamma Cas analog class of Be stars remains an outstanding question in Be star literature. This work explores the possibility that the X-ray flux is produced by accretion onto a white dwarf companion. We use three-dimensional smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to model the prototype gamma Cas system assuming a white dwarf companion and investigate the accretion of the circumstellar material by the secondary star. We contrast these results to a model for 59 Cyg, a non-gamma Cas Be star system with a stripped companion. We find that the secondary stars in both systems form disk-like accretion structures with Keplerian characteristics, similar to those seen in the Be decretion disks. We also find that white dwarf accretion can produce X-ray fluxes that are consistent with the observed values for gamma Cas, while the predicted X-ray luminosities are significantly lower for the non-degenerate companion in 59 Cyg. In addition, using the three-dimensional radiative transfer code, HDUST, we find that these models produce H-alpha emission consistent with the observations for both gamma Cas and 59 Cyg, and that the predicted polarization degrees across optical and UV wavelengths are at detectable levels. Finally, we discuss the impact that future UV spectropolarimetry missions could have on our understanding of these systems.</description>

      <title>Molecular Mobility of Extraterrestrial Ices: Surface Diffusion in Astrochemistry and Planetary Science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Molecules are ubiquitous in space. They are necessary component in the creation of habitable planetary systems and can provide the basic building blocks of life. Solid-state processes are pivotal in the formation of molecules in space and surface diffusion in particular is a key driver of chemistry in extraterrestrial environments, such as the massive clouds in which stars and planets are formed and the icy objects within our Solar System. However, for many atoms and molecules quantitative theoretical and experimental information on diffusion, such as activation barriers, are lacking. This hinders us in unraveling chemical processes in space and determining how the chemical ingredients of planets and life are formed. In this article, an astrochemical perspective on diffusion is provided. Described are the relevant adsorbate-surface systems, the methods to model their chemical processes, and the computational and laboratory techniques to determine diffusion parameters, including the latest developments in the field. While much progress has been made, many astrochemically relevant systems remain unexplored. The complexity of ice surfaces, their temperature-dependent restructuring, and effects at low temperatures create unique challenges that demand innovative experimental approaches and theoretical frameworks. This intersection of astrochemistry and surface science offers fertile ground for physical chemists to apply their expertise. We invite the physical chemistry community to explore these systems, where precise diffusion parameters would dramatically advance our understanding of molecular evolution in space - from interstellar clouds to planetary surfaces - with implications on our understanding on the origins of life and planetary habitability.</description>

      <title>Carbon and nitrogen as indicators of stellar evolution and age. A homogeneous sample of 44 open clusters from the Gaia-ESO Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Low- and intermediate-mass giants undergo a complex chemical evolution that has yet to be observationally probed. The influence of core helium flash on the chemical composition of stellar atmospheres has been an open question since its theoretical prediction 60 years ago. Aims. Based on high-resolution spectral observations of 44 open star clusters in the Gaia-ESO survey, our aim is to perform the first large-scale homogeneous investigation into the carbon and nitrogen photospheric content of low- and intermediate-mass giant stars in different phases of evolution. Methods. We determined carbon and nitrogen abundances using spectral synthesis of the C2 Swan (1,0) band head at 5135 {\AA} and C2 Swan (0,1) band head at 5635.5 {\AA}, 12C14N bands in the interval 6470 - 6490 {\AA}, and the forbidden [O i] line at 6300.31 {\AA}. Results. We revealed differences in C/N abundance ratios between pre- and post-core-He-flash stars. The lower C/N ratios in core He-burning red clump stars are mainly due to the enhancement of nitrogen abundances. We presented calibrations of the relationship between [C/N] and stellar age for solar metallicity low- and intermediate-mass giants taking into account different evolutionary stages. Conclusions. The C/N abundance ratios in the investigated first-ascent giant stars are slightly less affected by the first dredge-up than predicted by the theoretical models. The rotation-induced extra mixing is not as efficient as theoretically predicted. The core helium flash may trigger additional alterations in carbon and nitrogen abundances that are not yet theoretically modelled. We found that the evolutionary stage of stars must be taken into account when using [C/N] as an age indicator.</description>

      <title>The OATMEAL Survey. III. An Aligned Transiting Warm Brown Dwarf and Evidence for Quiescent Brown Dwarf Migration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first measurement of the sky-projected orbital obliquity of a benchmark transiting brown dwarf host, HIP 33609, as a part of the Orbital Architectures of Transiting Massive Exoplanets And Low-mass stars (OATMEAL) survey. HIP 33609 b is a highly eccentric, 68 $M_{\rm J}$ brown dwarf orbiting a 10,300 K, A-type star with an orbital period of 39 days. Its host star is a known member of the 150 Myr old MELANGE-6 moving group, making it an excellent laboratory for testing sub-stellar evolutionary models. Using in-transit spectra collected by the Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) on the Magellan II Clay 6.5 m telescope, we measured a sky-projected orbital obliquity of $|\lambda|= 12.7 \pm 1.3${\deg}. The mass of the brown dwarf is most consistent with a stellar-like fragmentation formation history followed by a period of migration. Given the high eccentricity ($e=0.557$) but low orbital obliquity of the brown dwarf, we claim that coplanar high eccentricity tidal migration seems to be the most plausible pathway, however, it remains difficult to conclusively rule out other migration mechanisms. The low orbital obliquity for HIP 33609 is consistent with previous measurements of high mass-ratio companions, and bears a striking resemblance to the obliquity distribution of transiting warm Jupiters. We suggest brown dwarfs may follow a dynamically quiescent migration pathway, consistent with them forming in isolated conditions.</description>

      <title>ADARI: Visualizing the quality of VLT data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: ADARI (Astronomical DAta Reporting Infrastructure) is a system designed for creating graphical reports of astronomical data so that the quality of these products can be assessed. It has been designed from the ground up to be backend-agnostic, meaning the same ADARI code can be sent to a web plotting API, or a code-based plotting API, with no alteration.
  Quick data inspection is an important feature in data reduction systems. The use cases range from quality control at the telescope, advance quality checks prior to delivering data to the scientists as well as data inspection for users running the pipelines at their home institutes. The goal of ADARI is to deliver the same experience and code for data visualization for all the environments, either running automatically in the Paranal Observatory environment or at the PI premises.
  ADARI contains a library that can be used to develop the creation of reports as well as a command line tool (genreport) to execute such reports. Most of the time the reports are generated as part of the execution of a data reduction workflow implemented with EDPS, the new ESO system for automatically organising data from ESO instruments and for running the reduction pipelines on them.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Model Comparison and Significance: Widespread Errors and how to Correct Them</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayes factors have become a popular tool in exoplanet spectroscopy for testing atmosphere models against one another. We show that the commonly used method for converting these values into significance "sigmas" is invalid. The formula is neither justified nor recommended by its original paper, and overestimates the confidence of results. We use simple examples to demonstrate the invalidity and prior sensitivity of this approach. We review the standard Bayesian interpretation of the Bayes factor as an odds ratio and recommend its use in conjunction with the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) or Bayesian Predictive Information Criterion Simplified (BPICS) in future analyses (Python implementations are included) . As a concrete example, we refit the WASP-39 b NIRSpec transmission spectrum to test for the presence of SO$_2$. The prevalent, incorrect significance calculation gives $3.67\sigma$ whereas the standard Bayesian interpretation yields a null model probability $p(\mathcal{B}|y)=0.0044$. Surveying the exoplanet atmosphere literature, we find widespread use of the erroneous formula. In order to avoid overstating observational results and estimating observation times too low, the community should return to the standard Bayesian interpretation.</description>

      <title>The Evolution of Pop III.1 Protostars Powered by Dark Matter Annihilation. II. Dependence on WIMP Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid appearance of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) at $z\gtrsim7$ requires efficient pathways to form massive black hole seeds. We investigate whether annihilation of weakly interacting massive particles (WIMPs) can alter primordial (Pop III.1) protostellar evolution sufficiently to enable formation of such `heavy'' seeds. Using the one-dimensional Geneva stellar-evolution code (GENEC) with an implemented Gould single-scatter capture module, we compute a grid of protostellar evolution models covering ambient WIMP mass densities $\rho_\chi=10^{12}$-$10^{16}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$, WIMP masses $m_\chi=30$-$3000\ \mathrm{GeV}$, spin-dependent cross sections $\sigma_{\rm SD}=10^{-42}$-$10^{-40}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$, and baryonic accretion rates $\dot{M_*}=(1-3)\times10^{-3}\, M_\odot \,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. We find a robust bifurcation of outcomes. For sufficiently high ambient dark matter density ($\rho_\chi\gtrsim5\times10^{14}\ \mathrm{GeV\,cm^{-3}}$) and capture efficiency ($\sigma_{\rm SD}\gtrsim10^{-41}\ \mathrm{cm^2}$) WIMP annihilation supplies enough energy to inflate protostars onto extended, cool (Hayashi-track) configurations that dramatically suppress ionizing feedback and permit uninterrupted growth to $\sim10^{5}\,M_\odot$. Lighter WIMPs and larger $\sigma_{\rm SD}$ favour earlier and stronger annihilation support; heavier WIMPs delay the effect. For our fiducial case, WIMP masses $&lt;$3 TeV are essential for allowing growth to the supermassive regime, otherwise the protostar evolves to the compact, feedback-limited regime that results in `light'' seeds. These results indicate that, under plausible halo conditions, DM annihilation provides a viable channel for forming heavy black hole seeds.</description>

      <title>A planetary system with a sub-Neptune planet in the habitable zone of TOI-2093</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.00299v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aims. We aim to confirm and measure the mass of the transiting planet candidate around the K5V star TOI-2093, previously announced by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) project. Methods. We combined photometric data from 32 sectors between 2019 and 2024 with 86 radial velocity measurements obtained with the CARMENES spectrograph over a period of 2.4 years, along with a series of ground-based, broadband photometric monitoring campaigns to characterize the host star and the transiting planet candidate, as well as to search for additional planets in the system. Our data indicate that TOI-2093 is a main-sequence star located at a distance of 83 pc, with solar metallicity, and a rotation period of 43.8 +- 1.8 d. Results. We have confirmed the planetary nature of the TESS transiting planet candidate, named TOI-2093 c, through the detection of its Keplerian signal in the spectroscopic data. We measured a planetary radius of 2.30 +- 0.12 Rearth, a Neptune-like mass of 15.8 +- 3.7 Mearth, and an orbital period of 53.81149 +- 0.00017 d. This makes TOI-2093 c the smallest exoplanet known in the habitable zone of a main-sequence FGK star. Given its size and relatively high density, TOI-2093 c belongs to a class of planets with no analog in the Solar System. In addition, the CARMENES data revealed the presence of a second planet candidate with a minimum mass of 10.6 +- 2.5 Mearth and an orbital period of 12.836 +- 0.021 d. This inner planet, which we designated TOI-2093 b, shows no detectable photometric transit in the TESS light curves. The orbital planes of the two planets are misaligned by more than 1.6 deg despite the near 4:1 mean-motion resonance of their orbital periods.</description>

      <title>oMEGACat. VII. Tracing Interstellar and Intracluster Medium of $\omega$ Centauri using Sodium Absorptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00330v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the foreground interstellar medium along the line of sight and intracluster medium of $\omega$ Centauri ($\omega$ Cen) by measuring the equivalent width of Na I D absorptions from MUSE observations. The large line-of-sight velocity difference between $\omega$ Cen and the foreground enables us to separate Na I D absorption contributed from atomic gas in the interstellar and intracluster medium. We find that small-scale substructures in the foreground Na I D distribution correlate with differential reddening derived from photometric methods. Using an empirical Na I D equivalent width-reddening relation, we determine an average reddening of $E(B-V)=0.153\pm0.003$ mag within the half-light radius of $\omega$ Cen. However, the Na I D-inferred differential reddening is significantly larger than photometric estimates. This is likely due to scatter in the Na I D-reddening relation. We find no evidence for intracluster atomic gas from spectra of horizontal branch stars, as there is no significant Na I D absorption at $\omega$ Cen's systemic velocity. Given this non-detection, we place the strongest upper limit to date on the intracluster atomic gas column density in $\omega$ Cen of $\lesssim2.17 \times 10^{18}~\rm{cm^{-2}}$. We also estimate the ionized gas density from pulsar dispersion measure variations, which exceed the atomic gas limit by $\sim$50 times. Nevertheless, the strong correlation between dispersion measure and foreground Na I D suggests that much or all of this ionized gas resides in the foreground. Given ongoing mass loss from bright giant stars, our findings imply that the intracluster gas accumulation timescale is short, and gas removal in the cluster is likely not tied to stripping as $\omega$ Cen passes through the Galactic disk.</description>

      <title>Understanding the evolution of black hole spin in X-ray binary systems: Case study of XTE~J1550-564</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00860v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the X-ray binary system XTE~J1550-564, with the primary objective of analyzing the evolution of the black hole's spin parameter. To achieve this objective, we embarked on the necessary step of identifying a plausible progenitor for the system. Using a set of models covering various parameter combinations, we were able to replicate the system's observed characteristics within acceptable error margins, including fundamental parameters such as component masses, orbital period, donor luminosity, and effective temperature. The model results indicate the possibility of diverse evolutionary pathways for the system, highlighting the significant role played by the initial mass of the donor star and the efficiency of mass transfer episodes. While some models are well-aligned with estimates of the mass transfer rate, they all fall short of explaining the black hole's observed moderate spin ($a^* = 0.49$). We also explored alternative magnetic braking prescriptions, finding that only an extreme and fully conservative scenario, based on the convection and rotation boosted prescription, can reproduce the observed spin and only in a marginal way. Our study attempts to shed light on the complex dynamics of black hole X-ray binaries and the challenges of explaining their observed properties with theoretical models.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the formation of molecules and dust in core collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Core-collapse Supernovae of Type II contribute the chemical enrichment of galaxies through explosion. Their role as dust producers in the high-redshift Universe may be of paramount importance. However, the type and amount of dust they synthesise after outburst is still a matter of debate and the formation processes remain unclear.
  Aims. We aim to identify and understand the chemical processes at play in the dust formation scenario, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust clusters at late post-explosion time. Methods. We revisit existing models by improving on the physics and chemistry of the supernova ejecta. We identify and consider new chemical species and pathways underpinning the formation of dust clusters, and apply a unique exhaustive chemical network to the entire ejecta of a Supernova with a 15 Msun progenitor. We test this new chemistry for various gas conditions in the ejecta, and derive mass yields for molecules and dust clusters.
  Results. We obtain the molecular component of the ejecta up to 11 years after explosion. The most abundant species are, in order of decreasing masses, O2, CO, SiS, SiO, CO2, SO2, CaS, N2, and CS. We identify molecules that are tracers of high-density clumps. As for dust clusters, we find the composition is dominated by silicates and silica, along with carbon dust, but with modest amounts of alumina. Pure metal clusters and metal sulphide and oxide clusters have negligible masses. High-density gas favours the formation of carbon clusters in the outer ejecta region whereas low temperatures hamper the formation of silicates in the oxygen core. The results are in good agreement with existing astronomical data and recent observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. They highlight the importance of chemistry for the derivation of dust budget from Supernovae.</description>

      <title>A Multispacecraft Analysis and Modeling of Type III Radio Burst Exciter Deceleration in Inhomogeneous Heliospheric Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18312v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electron beams accelerated in solar flares and escaping from the Sun along open magnetic field lines can trigger intense radio emissions known as type III solar radio bursts. Utilizing observations by Parker Solar Probe (PSP), STEREO-A (STA), Solar Orbiter (SolO), and Wind spacecrafts, the speeds and accelerations of type III exciters are derived for simple and isolated type III solar bursts. For the first time, simultaneous four spacecraft observations allow to determine positions, and correct the resulting velocities and accelerations for the location between the spacecraft and the apparent source. We observe velocities and acceleration to change as $u(r) \propto r^{-0.37 \pm 0.14}$ and $a(r) \propto r^{-1.71 \pm 0.20}$ with radial distance from the Sun $r$. To explain the electron beam deceleration, we develop a simple gas-dynamic description of the electron beam moving through plasma with monotonically decreasing density. The model predicts that the beam velocity decreases as $u(f)\propto f^{1/4}(r)$, so the acceleration changes $\propto r^{-1.58}$ (and speed as $\propto r^{-0.29}$) for the plasma density profile $n(r)\propto r^{-2.3}$. The deceleration is consistent with the average observation values corrected for the type III source locations. Intriguingly, the observations also show differences in velocity and acceleration of the same type III observed by different spacecrafts. We suggest the difference could be related to the additional time delay caused by radio-wave scattering between the spacecraft and the source.</description>

Abstract: We present the first first X-ray polarization measurements of a white dwarf, the intermediate polar EX Hya. We measured significant polarization only in the 2 -- 3 keV energy band with a polarization degree of 8 percent at a $3\sigma$ significance. No significant polarization was detected above 3 keV, which we attribute to the higher energy bands having lower signal-to-noise. We found that the scattering surface detected by the IXPE is nearly perpendicular to the optical scattering plane, showing that the X-ray scattering surface is the WD and close to the base of the accretion column. Finally, we show how the polarization can be used to estimate the height of the accretion shock above the white dwarf's surface.</description>

      <title>The spectra of a radiative reprocessing outflow model for fast blue optical transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18985</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18985v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The radiation reprocessing model, in which an optically-thick outflow absorbs the high-energy emission from a central source and re-emits in longer wavelengths, has been frequently invoked to explain some optically bright transients, such as fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) whose progenitor and explosion mechanism are still unknown. Previous studies on this model did not take into account the frequency dependence of the opacity. We study the radiative reprocessing and calculate the UV-optical-NIR band spectra from a spherical outflow composed of pure hydrogen gas, for a time-dependent outflowing mass rate. Electron scattering and frequency-dependent bound-free, free-free opacities are considered. The spectrum deviates from the blackbody at NIR and UV frequencies; in particular, it has $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{1.5}$ at NIR frequencies, because at these frequencies the absorption optical depth from the outflow's outer edge to the so-called photon trapping radius is large and is frequency dependent. We apply our model to the proto-type FBOT AT2018cow by {the spectra} to the observed SED. The best-fit mass loss rate suggests that the total outflow mass in AT2018cow is $M_{\rm out} \approx 5.7^{+0.4}_{-0.4} \, M_{\odot}$. If that equals the total mass lost during an explosion, and if the progenitor is a blue supergiant (with a pre-explosion mass of $\sim 20 \, M_{\odot}$), then it will suggest that the central compact remnant mass is at least $\approx \, \rm{14 \, M_{\odot}}$. This would imply that the central remnant is a black hole.</description>

      <title>Multi-directional investigations on quiet time suprathermal ions measured by ASPEX-STEPS on-board Aditya L1</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.11952v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin, acceleration and anisotropy of suprathermal ions in the interplanetary medium during quiet periods have remained poorly understood issues in solar wind physics. To address these aspects, we derive the spectral indices for the quiet time suprathermal ions based on the measurements by the four directionally separated sensors that are part of the Supra-Thermal and Energetic Particle Spectrometer (STEPS) of Aditya Solar Wind Particle EXperiment (ASPEX) on-board Aditya L1 spacecraft. Three out of four STEPS sensors Parker Spiral (PS), Inter-Mediate (IM), Earth Pointing (EP) are in one plane (nearly aligned with the ecliptic plane) while the fourth sensor North Pointing (NP) is in a mutually orthogonal plane. The energy ranges covered by the PS, IM, EP and NP sensors are 0.36-1.32 MeV, 0.14-1.22 MeV, 0.39-1.33 MeV and 0.12-1.23 MeV respectively. The quiet intervals are identified during January November, 2024 and the derived spectral indices (differential directional flux versus energy) are found to be in the range of 2.0 for all directions in the time scale of a few days revealing isotropic nature of their distribution. Further analysis of elemental abundance ratios (3He/4He, Fe/O, and C/O) during the same quiet intervals obtained from the Ultra-Low Energy Isotope Spectrometer (ULEIS) on board the Advanced Composition Explorer (ACE) spacecraft suggests possible contributions from the leftover ions from the previous impulsive (Solar flares) and gradual events (CMEs) in the quiet time suprathermal ion pool.</description>

      <title>Wide binaries in an ultra-faint dwarf galaxy: discovery, population modeling, and a nail in the coffin of primordial black hole dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04555v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of a wide binary population in the ultrafaint dwarf galaxy Bo\"{o}tes I using deep JWST/NIRCam imaging. Our sample consists of 52 candidate binaries with projected separations of 7,000 - 16,000 au and stellar masses from near the hydrogen-burning limit to the main-sequence turnoff ($\sim0.1$ - $0.8~{\rm M_\odot}$). By forward-modeling selection biases and chance alignments, we find that $1.25\pm0.25\%$ of Bo\"{o}tes I stars are members of wide binaries with separations beyond 5,000 au. This fraction, along with the distributions of separations and mass ratios, matches that in the Solar neighborhood, suggesting that wide binary formation is largely insensitive to metallicity, even down to [Fe/H] $\approx -2.5$. The observed truncation in the separation distribution near 16,000 au is well explained by stellar flyby disruptions. We also discuss how the binaries can be used to constrain the galaxy's dark matter properties. We show that our detection places new limits on primordial black hole dark matter, finding that compact objects with $M \gtrsim 5~{\rm M_\odot}$ cannot constitute more than $\sim1\%$ of the dark matter content. In contrast to previous work, we find that wide binaries are unlikely to provide robust constraints on the dark matter profile of ultrafaint galaxies given the uncertainties in the initial binary population, flyby disruptions, and contamination from chance alignments. These findings represent the most robust detection of wide binaries in an external galaxy to date, opening a new avenue for studying binary star formation and survival in extreme environments.</description>
