      <title>ED-Filter: Dynamic Feature Filtering for Eating Disorder Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Eating disorders (ED) are critical psychiatric problems that have alarmed the mental health community. Mental health professionals are increasingly recognizing the utility of data derived from social media platforms such as Twitter. However, high dimensionality and extensive feature sets of Twitter data present remarkable challenges for ED classification. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce a novel method, an informed branch and bound search technique known as ED-Filter. This strategy significantly improves the drawbacks of conventional feature selection algorithms such as filters and wrappers. ED-Filter iteratively identifies an optimal set of promising features that maximize the eating disorder classification accuracy. In order to adapt to the dynamic nature of Twitter ED data, we enhance the ED-Filter with a hybrid greedy-based deep learning algorithm. This algorithm swiftly identifies sub-optimal features to accommodate the ever-evolving data landscape. Experimental results on Twitter eating disorder data affirm the effectiveness and efficiency of ED-Filter. The method demonstrates significant improvements in classification accuracy and proves its value in eating disorder detection on social media platforms.</description>

      <title>Explaining Categorical Feature Interactions Using Graph Covariance and LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14932v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern datasets often consist of numerous samples with abundant features and associated timestamps. Analyzing such datasets to uncover underlying events typically requires complex statistical methods and substantial domain expertise. A notable example, and the primary data focus of this paper, is the global synthetic dataset from the Counter Trafficking Data Collaborative (CTDC) -- a global hub of human trafficking data containing over 200,000 anonymized records spanning from 2002 to 2022, with numerous categorical features for each record. In this paper, we propose a fast and scalable method for analyzing and extracting significant categorical feature interactions, and querying large language models (LLMs) to generate data-driven insights that explain these interactions. Our approach begins with a binarization step for categorical features using one-hot encoding, followed by the computation of graph covariance at each time. This graph covariance quantifies temporal changes in dependence structures within categorical data and is established as a consistent dependence measure under the Bernoulli distribution. We use this measure to identify significant feature pairs, such as those with the most frequent trends over time or those exhibiting sudden spikes in dependence at specific moments. These extracted feature pairs, along with their timestamps, are subsequently passed to an LLM tasked with generating potential explanations of the underlying events driving these dependence changes. The effectiveness of our method is demonstrated through extensive simulations, and its application to the CTDC dataset reveals meaningful feature pairs and potential data stories underlying the observed feature interactions.</description>

      <title>Conformal Inference of Individual Treatment Effects Using Conditional Density Estimates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an era where diverse and complex data are increasingly accessible, the precise prediction of individual treatment effects (ITE) becomes crucial across fields such as healthcare, economics, and public policy. Current state-of-the-art approaches, while providing valid prediction intervals through Conformal Quantile Regression (CQR) and related techniques, often yield overly conservative prediction intervals. In this work, we introduce a conformal inference approach to ITE using the conditional density of the outcome given the covariates. We leverage the reference distribution technique to efficiently estimate the conditional densities as the score functions under a two-stage conformal ITE framework. We show that our prediction intervals are not only marginally valid but are narrower than existing methods. Experimental results further validate the usefulness of our method.</description>

      <title>Median of Forests for Robust Density Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robust density estimation refers to the consistent estimation of the density function even when the data is contaminated by outliers. We find that existing forest density estimation at a certain point is inherently resistant to the outliers outside the cells containing the point, which we call \textit{non-local outliers}, but not resistant to the rest \textit{local outliers}. To achieve robustness against all outliers, we propose an ensemble learning algorithm called \textit{medians of forests for robust density estimation} (\textit{MFRDE}), which adopts a pointwise median operation on forest density estimators fitted on subsampled datasets. Compared to existing robust kernel-based methods, MFRDE enables us to choose larger subsampling sizes, sacrificing less accuracy for density estimation while achieving robustness. On the theoretical side, we introduce the local outlier exponent to quantify the number of local outliers. Under this exponent, we show that even if the number of outliers reaches a certain polynomial order in the sample size, MFRDE is able to achieve almost the same convergence rate as the same algorithm on uncontaminated data, whereas robust kernel-based methods fail. On the practical side, real data experiments show that MFRDE outperforms existing robust kernel-based methods. Moreover, we apply MFRDE to anomaly detection to showcase a further application.</description>

      <title>A Review on Self-Supervised Learning for Time Series Anomaly Detection: Recent Advances and Open Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15196v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Time series anomaly detection presents various challenges due to the sequential and dynamic nature of time-dependent data. Traditional unsupervised methods frequently encounter difficulties in generalization, often overfitting to known normal patterns observed during training and struggling to adapt to unseen normality. In response to this limitation, self-supervised techniques for time series have garnered attention as a potential solution to undertake this obstacle and enhance the performance of anomaly detectors. This paper presents a comprehensive review of the recent methods that make use of self-supervised learning for time series anomaly detection. A taxonomy is proposed to categorize these methods based on their primary characteristics, facilitating a clear understanding of their diversity within this field. The information contained in this survey, along with additional details that will be periodically updated, is available on the following GitHub repository: https://github.com/Aitorzan3/Awesome-Self-Supervised-Time-Series-Anomaly-Detection.</description>

      <title>Estimating Committor Functions via Deep Adaptive Sampling on Rare Transition Paths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The committor functions are central to investigating rare but important events in molecular simulations. It is known that computing the committor function suffers from the curse of dimensionality. Recently, using neural networks to estimate the committor function has gained attention due to its potential for high-dimensional problems. Training neural networks to approximate the committor function needs to sample transition data from straightforward simulations of rare events, which is very inefficient. The scarcity of transition data makes it challenging to approximate the committor function. To address this problem, we propose an efficient framework to generate data points in the transition state region that helps train neural networks to approximate the committor function. We design a Deep Adaptive Sampling method for TRansition paths (DASTR), where deep generative models are employed to generate samples to capture the information of transitions effectively. In particular, we treat a non-negative function in the integrand of the loss functional as an unnormalized probability density function and approximate it with the deep generative model. The new samples from the deep generative model are located in the transition state region and fewer samples are located in the other region. This distribution provides effective samples for approximating the committor function and significantly improves the accuracy. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through both simulations and realistic examples.</description>

      <title>Towards Sharper Information-theoretic Generalization Bounds for Meta-Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, information-theoretic generalization bounds have emerged as a promising approach for analyzing the generalization capabilities of meta-learning algorithms. However, existing results are confined to two-step bounds, failing to provide a sharper characterization of the meta-generalization gap that simultaneously accounts for environment-level and task-level dependencies. This paper addresses this fundamental limitation by establishing novel single-step information-theoretic bounds for meta-learning. Our bounds exhibit substantial advantages over prior MI- and CMI-based bounds, especially in terms of tightness, scaling behavior associated with sampled tasks and samples per task, and computational tractability. Furthermore, we provide novel theoretical insights into the generalization behavior of two classes of noise and iterative meta-learning algorithms via gradient covariance analysis, where the meta-learner uses either the entire meta-training data (e.g., Reptile), or separate training and test data within the task (e.g., model agnostic meta-learning (MAML)). Numerical results validate the effectiveness of the derived bounds in capturing the generalization dynamics of meta-learning.</description>

      <title>I-trustworthy Models. A framework for trustworthiness evaluation of probabilistic classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15617v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As probabilistic models continue to permeate various facets of our society and contribute to scientific advancements, it becomes a necessity to go beyond traditional metrics such as predictive accuracy and error rates and assess their trustworthiness. Grounded in the competence-based theory of trust, this work formalizes I-trustworthy framework -- a novel framework for assessing the trustworthiness of probabilistic classifiers for inference tasks by linking local calibration to trustworthiness. To assess I-trustworthiness, we use the local calibration error (LCE) and develop a method of hypothesis-testing. This method utilizes a kernel-based test statistic, Kernel Local Calibration Error (KLCE), to test local calibration of a probabilistic classifier. This study provides theoretical guarantees by offering convergence bounds for an unbiased estimator of KLCE. Additionally, we present a diagnostic tool designed to identify and measure biases in cases of miscalibration. The effectiveness of the proposed test statistic is demonstrated through its application to both simulated and real-world datasets. Finally, LCE of related recalibration methods is studied, and we provide evidence of insufficiency of existing methods to achieve I-trustworthiness.</description>

      <title>Scale-Insensitive Neural Network Significance Tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper develops a scale-insensitive framework for neural network significance testing, substantially generalizing existing approaches through three key innovations. First, we replace metric entropy calculations with Rademacher complexity bounds, enabling the analysis of neural networks without requiring bounded weights or specific architectural constraints. Second, we weaken the regularity conditions on the target function to require only Sobolev space membership $H^s([-1,1]^d)$ with $s &gt; d/2$, significantly relaxing previous smoothness assumptions while maintaining optimal approximation rates. Third, we introduce a modified sieve space construction based on moment bounds rather than weight constraints, providing a more natural theoretical framework for modern deep learning practices. Our approach achieves these generalizations while preserving optimal convergence rates and establishing valid asymptotic distributions for test statistics. The technical foundation combines localization theory, sharp concentration inequalities, and scale-insensitive complexity measures to handle unbounded weights and general Lipschitz activation functions. This framework better aligns theoretical guarantees with contemporary deep learning practice while maintaining mathematical rigor.</description>

      <title>SAPPHIRE: Preconditioned Stochastic Variance Reduction for Faster Large-Scale Statistical Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Regularized empirical risk minimization (rERM) has become important in data-intensive fields such as genomics and advertising, with stochastic gradient methods typically used to solve the largest problems. However, ill-conditioned objectives and non-smooth regularizers undermine the performance of traditional stochastic gradient methods, leading to slow convergence and significant computational costs. To address these challenges, we propose the $\texttt{SAPPHIRE}$ ($\textbf{S}$ketching-based $\textbf{A}$pproximations for $\textbf{P}$roximal $\textbf{P}$reconditioning and $\textbf{H}$essian $\textbf{I}$nexactness with Variance-$\textbf{RE}$educed Gradients) algorithm, which integrates sketch-based preconditioning to tackle ill-conditioning and uses a scaled proximal mapping to minimize the non-smooth regularizer. This stochastic variance-reduced algorithm achieves condition-number-free linear convergence to the optimum, delivering an efficient and scalable solution for ill-conditioned composite large-scale convex machine learning problems. Extensive experiments on lasso and logistic regression demonstrate that $\texttt{SAPPHIRE}$ often converges $20$ times faster than other common choices such as $\texttt{Catalyst}$, $\texttt{SAGA}$, and $\texttt{SVRG}$. This advantage persists even when the objective is non-convex or the preconditioner is infrequently updated, highlighting its robust and practical effectiveness.</description>

      <title>Value-oriented forecast reconciliation for renewables in electricity markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Forecast reconciliation is considered an effective method for achieving coherence and improving forecast accuracy. However, the value of reconciled forecasts in downstream decision-making tasks has been mostly overlooked. In a multi-agent setup with heterogeneous loss functions, this oversight may lead to unfair outcomes, hence resulting in conflicts during the reconciliation process. To address this, we propose a value-oriented forecast reconciliation approach that focuses on the forecast value for individual agents. Fairness is ensured through the use of a Nash bargaining framework. Specifically, we model this problem as a cooperative bargaining game, where each agent aims to optimize their own gain while contributing to the overall reconciliation process. We then present a primal-dual algorithm for parameter estimation based on empirical risk minimization. From an application perspective, we consider an aggregated wind energy trading problem, where profits are distributed using a weighted allocation rule. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through several numerical experiments, showing that it consistently results in increased profits for all agents involved.</description>

      <title>Measuring Heterogeneity in Machine Learning with Distributed Energy Distance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In distributed and federated learning, heterogeneity across data sources remains a major obstacle to effective model aggregation and convergence. We focus on feature heterogeneity and introduce energy distance as a sensitive measure for quantifying distributional discrepancies. While we show that energy distance is robust for detecting data distribution shifts, its direct use in large-scale systems can be prohibitively expensive. To address this, we develop Taylor approximations that preserve key theoretical quantitative properties while reducing computational overhead. Through simulation studies, we show how accurately capturing feature discrepancies boosts convergence in distributed learning. Finally, we propose a novel application of energy distance to assign penalty weights for aligning predictions across heterogeneous nodes, ultimately enhancing coordination in federated and distributed settings.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Optimal Self-Distillation in Noisy Gaussian Mixture Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16226v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Self-distillation (SD), a technique where a model refines itself from its own predictions, has garnered attention as a simple yet powerful approach in machine learning. Despite its widespread use, the mechanisms underlying its effectiveness remain unclear. In this study, we investigate the efficacy of hyperparameter-tuned multi-stage SD in binary classification tasks with noisy labeled Gaussian mixture data, utilizing a replica theory. Our findings reveals that the primary driver of SD's performance improvement is denoising through hard pseudo-labels, with the most notable gains observed in moderately sized datasets. We also demonstrate the efficacy of practical heuristics, such as early stopping for extracting meaningful signal and bias fixation for imbalanced data. These results provide both theoretical guarantees and practical insights, advancing our understanding and application of SD in noisy settings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract:   This course, intended for undergraduates familiar with elementary calculus and linear algebra, introduces the extension of differential calculus to functions on more general vector spaces, such as functions that take as input a matrix and return a matrix inverse or factorization, derivatives of ODE solutions, and even stochastic derivatives of random functions. It emphasizes practical computational applications, such as large-scale optimization and machine learning, where derivatives must be re-imagined in order to be propagated through complicated calculations. The class also discusses efficiency concerns leading to "adjoint" or "reverse-mode" differentiation (a.k.a. "backpropagation"), and gives a gentle introduction to modern automatic differentiation (AD) techniques.</description>

      <title>A Semiparametric Bayesian Method for Instrumental Variable Analysis with Partly Interval-Censored Time-to-Event Outcome</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a semiparametric Bayesian instrumental variable analysis method for estimating the causal effect of an endogenous variable when dealing with unobserved confounders and measurement errors with partly interval-censored time-to-event data, where event times are observed exactly for some subjects but left-censored, right-censored, or interval-censored for others. Our method is based on a two-stage Dirichlet process mixture instrumental variable (DPMIV) model which simultaneously models the first-stage random error term for the exposure variable and the second-stage random error term for the time-to-event outcome using a bivariate Gaussian mixture of the Dirichlet process (DPM) model. The DPM model can be broadly understood as a mixture model with an unspecified number of Gaussian components, which relaxes the normal error assumptions and allows the number of mixture components to be determined by the data. We develop an MCMC algorithm for the DPMIV model tailored for partly interval-censored data and conduct extensive simulations to assess the performance of our DPMIV method in comparison with some competing methods. Our simulations revealed that our proposed method is robust under different error distributions and can have superior performance over its parametric counterpart under various scenarios. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on an UK Biobank data to investigate the causal effect of systolic blood pressure on time-to-development of cardiovascular disease from the onset of diabetes mellitus.</description>

      <title>Interpretability in Parameter Space: Minimizing Mechanistic Description Length with Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14926v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic interpretability aims to understand the internal mechanisms learned by neural networks. Despite recent progress toward this goal, it remains unclear how best to decompose neural network parameters into mechanistic components. We introduce Attribution-based Parameter Decomposition (APD), a method that directly decomposes a neural network's parameters into components that (i) are faithful to the parameters of the original network, (ii) require a minimal number of components to process any input, and (iii) are maximally simple. Our approach thus optimizes for a minimal length description of the network's mechanisms. We demonstrate APD's effectiveness by successfully identifying ground truth mechanisms in multiple toy experimental settings: Recovering features from superposition; separating compressed computations; and identifying cross-layer distributed representations. While challenges remain to scaling APD to non-toy models, our results suggest solutions to several open problems in mechanistic interpretability, including identifying minimal circuits in superposition, offering a conceptual foundation for 'features', and providing an architecture-agnostic framework for neural network decomposition.</description>

      <title>Decision Making in Changing Environments: Robustness, Query-Based Learning, and Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of interactive decision making in which the underlying environment changes over time subject to given constraints. We propose a framework, which we call \textit{hybrid Decision Making with Structured Observations} (hybrid DMSO), that provides an interpolation between the stochastic and adversarial settings of decision making. Within this framework, we can analyze local differentially private (LDP) decision making, query-based learning (in particular, SQ learning), and robust and smooth decision making under the same umbrella, deriving upper and lower bounds based on variants of the Decision-Estimation Coefficient (DEC). We further establish strong connections between the DEC's behavior, the SQ dimension, local minimax complexity, learnability, and joint differential privacy. To showcase the framework's power, we provide new results for contextual bandits under the LDP constraint.</description>

      <title>Principal Graph Encoder Embedding and Principal Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the concept of principal communities and propose a principal graph encoder embedding method that concurrently detects these communities and achieves vertex embedding. Given a graph adjacency matrix with vertex labels, the method computes a sample community score for each community, ranking them to measure community importance and estimate a set of principal communities. The method then produces a vertex embedding by retaining only the dimensions corresponding to these principal communities. Theoretically, we define the population version of the encoder embedding and the community score based on a random Bernoulli graph distribution. We prove that the population principal graph encoder embedding preserves the conditional density of the vertex labels and that the population community score successfully distinguishes the principal communities. We conduct a variety of simulations to demonstrate the finite-sample accuracy in detecting ground-truth principal communities, as well as the advantages in embedding visualization and subsequent vertex classification. The method is further applied to a set of real-world graphs, showcasing its numerical advantages, including robustness to label noise and computational scalability.</description>

      <title>Private Minimum Hellinger Distance Estimation via Hellinger Distance Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hellinger distance has been widely used to derive objective functions that are alternatives to maximum likelihood methods. Motivated by recent regulatory privacy requirements, estimators satisfying differential privacy constraints are being derived. In this paper, we describe different notions of privacy using divergences and establish that Hellinger distance minimizes the added variance within the class of power divergences for an additive Gaussian mechanism. We demonstrate that a new definition of privacy, namely Hellinger differential privacy, shares several features of the standard notion of differential privacy while allowing for sharper inference. Using these properties, we develop private versions of gradient descent and Newton-Raphson algorithms for obtaining private minimum Hellinger distance estimators, which are robust and first-order efficient. Using numerical experiments, we illustrate the finite sample performance and verify that they retain their robustness properties under gross-error contamination.</description>

      <title>Convergence Analysis of the Wasserstein Proximal Algorithm beyond Geodesic Convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proximal algorithm is a powerful tool to minimize nonlinear and nonsmooth functionals in a general metric space. Motivated by the recent progress in studying the training dynamics of the noisy gradient descent algorithm on two-layer neural networks in the mean-field regime, we provide in this paper a simple and self-contained analysis for the convergence of the general-purpose Wasserstein proximal algorithm without assuming geodesic convexity of the objective functional. Under a natural Wasserstein analog of the Euclidean Polyak-{\L}ojasiewicz inequality, we establish that the proximal algorithm achieves an unbiased and linear convergence rate. Our convergence rate improves upon existing rates of the proximal algorithm for solving Wasserstein gradient flows under strong geodesic convexity. We also extend our analysis to the inexact proximal algorithm for geodesically semiconvex objectives. In our numerical experiments, proximal training demonstrates a faster convergence rate than the noisy gradient descent algorithm on mean-field neural networks.</description>

      <title>Causal Discovery via Bayesian Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.14997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing score-based methods for directed acyclic graph (DAG) learning from observational data struggle to recover the causal graph accurately and sample-efficiently. To overcome this, in this study, we propose DrBO (DAG recovery via Bayesian Optimization)-a novel DAG learning framework leveraging Bayesian optimization (BO) to find high-scoring DAGs. We show that, by sophisticatedly choosing the promising DAGs to explore, we can find higher-scoring ones much more efficiently. To address the scalability issues of conventional BO in DAG learning, we replace Gaussian Processes commonly employed in BO with dropout neural networks, trained in a continual manner, which allows for (i) flexibly modeling the DAG scores without overfitting, (ii) incorporation of uncertainty into the estimated scores, and (iii) scaling with the number of evaluations. As a result, DrBO is computationally efficient and can find the accurate DAG in fewer trials and less time than existing state-of-the-art methods. This is demonstrated through an extensive set of empirical evaluations on many challenging settings with both synthetic and real data. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/baosws/DrBO.</description>

      <title>Divergence-Augmented Policy Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In deep reinforcement learning, policy optimization methods need to deal with issues such as function approximation and the reuse of off-policy data. Standard policy gradient methods do not handle off-policy data well, leading to premature convergence and instability. This paper introduces a method to stabilize policy optimization when off-policy data are reused. The idea is to include a Bregman divergence between the behavior policy that generates the data and the current policy to ensure small and safe policy updates with off-policy data. The Bregman divergence is calculated between the state distributions of two policies, instead of only on the action probabilities, leading to a divergence augmentation formulation. Empirical experiments on Atari games show that in the data-scarce scenario where the reuse of off-policy data becomes necessary, our method can achieve better performance than other state-of-the-art deep reinforcement learning algorithms.</description>

      <title>Salvaging Forbidden Treasure in Medical Data: Utilizing Surrogate Outcomes and Single Records for Rare Event Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The vast repositories of Electronic Health Records (EHR) and medical claims hold untapped potential for studying rare but critical events, such as suicide attempt. Conventional setups often model suicide attempt as a univariate outcome and also exclude any ``single-record'' patients with a single documented encounter due to a lack of historical information. However, patients who were diagnosed with suicide attempts at the only encounter could, to some surprise, represent a substantial proportion of all attempt cases in the data, as high as 70--80%. We innovate a hybrid and integrative learning framework to leverage concurrent outcomes as surrogates and harness the forbidden yet precious information from single-record data. Our approach employs a supervised learning component to learn the latent variables that connect primary (e.g., suicide) and surrogate outcomes (e.g., mental disorders) to historical information. It simultaneously employs an unsupervised learning component to utilize the single-record data, through the shared latent variables. As such, our approach offers a general strategy for information integration that is crucial to modeling rare conditions and events. With hospital inpatient data from Connecticut, we demonstrate that single-record data and concurrent diagnoses indeed carry valuable information, and utilizing them can substantially improve suicide risk modeling.</description>

      <title>Learning with Noisy Labels: the Exploration of Error Bounds in Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous studies have shown that label noise can lead to poor generalization performance, negatively affecting classification accuracy. Therefore, understanding the effectiveness of classifiers trained using deep neural networks in the presence of noisy labels is of considerable practical significance. In this paper, we focus on the error bounds of excess risks for classification problems with noisy labels within deep learning frameworks. We begin by exploring loss functions with noise-tolerant properties, ensuring that the empirical minimizer on noisy data aligns with that on the true data. Next, we estimate the error bounds of the excess risks, expressed as a sum of statistical error and approximation error. We estimate the statistical error on a dependent (mixing) sequence, bounding it with the help of the associated independent block sequence. For the approximation error, we first express the classifiers as the composition of the softmax function and a continuous function from $[0,1]^d$ to $\mathbb{R}^K$. The main task is then to estimate the approximation error for the continuous function from $[0,1]^d$ to $\mathbb{R}^K$. Finally, we focus on the curse of dimensionality based on the low-dimensional manifold assumption.</description>

      <title>Extracting Forward Invariant Sets from Neural Network-Based Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Training Neural Networks (NNs) to serve as Barrier Functions (BFs) is a popular way to improve the safety of autonomous dynamical systems. Despite significant practical success, these methods are not generally guaranteed to produce true BFs in a provable sense, which undermines their intended use as safety certificates. In this paper, we consider the problem of formally certifying a learned NN as a BF with respect to state avoidance for an autonomous system: viz. computing a region of the state space on which the candidate NN is provably a BF. In particular, we propose a sound algorithm that efficiently produces such a certificate set for a shallow NN. Our algorithm combines two novel approaches: it first uses NN reachability tools to identify a subset of states for which the output of the NN does not increase along system trajectories; then, it uses a novel enumeration algorithm for hyperplane arrangements to find the intersection of the NN's zero-sub-level set with the first set of states. In this way, our algorithm soundly finds a subset of states on which the NN is certified as a BF. We further demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm at certifying for real-world NNs as BFs in two case studies. We complemented these with scalability experiments that demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm.</description>

      <title>Reliable Pseudo-labeling via Optimal Transport with Attention for Short Text Clustering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.15194v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Short text clustering has gained significant attention in the data mining community. However, the limited valuable information contained in short texts often leads to low-discriminative representations, increasing the difficulty of clustering. This paper proposes a novel short text clustering framework, called Reliable \textbf{P}seudo-labeling via \textbf{O}ptimal \textbf{T}ransport with \textbf{A}ttention for Short Text Clustering (\textbf{POTA}), that generate reliable pseudo-labels to aid discriminative representation learning for clustering. Specially, \textbf{POTA} first implements an instance-level attention mechanism to capture the semantic relationships among samples, which are then incorporated as a regularization term into an optimal transport problem. By solving this OT problem, we can yield reliable pseudo-labels that simultaneously account for sample-to-sample semantic consistency and sample-to-cluster global structure information. Additionally, the proposed OT can adaptively estimate cluster distributions, making \textbf{POTA} well-suited for varying degrees of imbalanced datasets. Then, we utilize the pseudo-labels to guide contrastive learning to generate discriminative representations and achieve efficient clustering. Extensive experiments demonstrate \textbf{POTA} outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

      <title>Scalable Decentralized Learning with Teleportation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Decentralized SGD can run with low communication costs, but its sparse communication characteristics deteriorate the convergence rate, especially when the number of nodes is large. In decentralized learning settings, communication is assumed to occur on only a given topology, while in many practical cases, the topology merely represents a preferred communication pattern, and connecting to arbitrary nodes is still possible. Previous studies have tried to alleviate the convergence rate degradation in these cases by designing topologies with large spectral gaps. However, the degradation is still significant when the number of nodes is substantial. In this work, we propose TELEPORTATION. TELEPORTATION activates only a subset of nodes, and the active nodes fetch the parameters from previous active nodes. Then, the active nodes update their parameters by SGD and perform gossip averaging on a relatively small topology comprising only the active nodes. We show that by activating only a proper number of nodes, TELEPORTATION can completely alleviate the convergence rate degradation. Furthermore, we propose an efficient hyperparameter-tuning method to search for the appropriate number of nodes to be activated. Experimentally, we showed that TELEPORTATION can train neural networks more stably and achieve higher accuracy than Decentralized SGD.</description>

Abstract: We study a separable design for computing information measures, where the information measure is computed from learned feature representations instead of raw data. Under mild assumptions on the feature representations, we demonstrate that a class of information measures admit such separable computation, including mutual information, $f$-information, Wyner's common information, G{\'a}cs--K{\"o}rner common information, and Tishby's information bottleneck. Our development establishes several new connections between information measures and the statistical dependence structure. The characterizations also provide theoretical guarantees of practical designs for estimating information measures through representation learning.</description>

      <title>Fairness-aware Contextual Dynamic Pricing with Strategic Buyers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contextual pricing strategies are prevalent in online retailing, where the seller adjusts prices based on products' attributes and buyers' characteristics. Although such strategies can enhance seller's profits, they raise concerns about fairness when significant price disparities emerge among specific groups, such as gender or race. These disparities can lead to adverse perceptions of fairness among buyers and may even violate the law and regulation. In contrast, price differences can incentivize disadvantaged buyers to strategically manipulate their group identity to obtain a lower price. In this paper, we investigate contextual dynamic pricing with fairness constraints, taking into account buyers' strategic behaviors when their group status is private and unobservable from the seller. We propose a dynamic pricing policy that simultaneously achieves price fairness and discourages strategic behaviors. Our policy achieves an upper bound of $O(\sqrt{T}+H(T))$ regret over $T$ time horizons, where the term $H(T)$ arises from buyers' assessment of the fairness of the pricing policy based on their learned price difference. When buyers are able to learn the fairness of the price policy, this upper bound reduces to $O(\sqrt{T})$. We also prove an $\Omega(\sqrt{T})$ regret lower bound of any pricing policy under our problem setting. We support our findings with extensive experimental evidence, showcasing our policy's effectiveness. In our real data analysis, we observe the existence of price discrimination against race in the loan application even after accounting for other contextual information. Our proposed pricing policy demonstrates a significant improvement, achieving 35.06% reduction in regret compared to the benchmark policy.</description>

      <title>BoTier: Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization with Tiered Composite Objectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15554v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific optimization problems are usually concerned with balancing multiple competing objectives, which come as preferences over both the outcomes of an experiment (e.g. maximize the reaction yield) and the corresponding input parameters (e.g. minimize the use of an expensive reagent). Typically, practical and economic considerations define a hierarchy over these objectives, which must be reflected in algorithms for sample-efficient experiment planning. Herein, we introduce BoTier, a composite objective that can flexibly represent a hierarchy of preferences over both experiment outcomes and input parameters. We provide systematic benchmarks on synthetic and real-life surfaces, demonstrating the robust applicability of BoTier across a number of use cases. Importantly, BoTier is implemented in an auto-differentiable fashion, enabling seamless integration with the BoTorch library, thereby facilitating adoption by the scientific community.</description>

      <title>Diffusion Generative Modeling for Spatially Resolved Gene Expression Inference from Histology Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spatial Transcriptomics (ST) allows a high-resolution measurement of RNA sequence abundance by systematically connecting cell morphology depicted in Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&amp;E) stained histology images to spatially resolved gene expressions. ST is a time-consuming, expensive yet powerful experimental technique that provides new opportunities to understand cancer mechanisms at a fine-grained molecular level, which is critical for uncovering new approaches for disease diagnosis and treatments. Here, we present $\textbf{Stem}$ ($\textbf{S}$pa$\textbf{T}$ially resolved gene $\textbf{E}$xpression inference with diffusion $\textbf{M}$odel), a novel computational tool that leverages a conditional diffusion generative model to enable in silico gene expression inference from H&amp;E stained images. Through better capturing the inherent stochasticity and heterogeneity in ST data, $\textbf{Stem}$ achieves state-of-the-art performance on spatial gene expression prediction and generates biologically meaningful gene profiles for new H&amp;E stained images at test time. We evaluate the proposed algorithm on datasets with various tissue sources and sequencing platforms, where it demonstrates clear improvement over existing approaches. $\textbf{Stem}$ generates high-fidelity gene expression predictions that share similar gene variation levels as ground truth data, suggesting that our method preserves the underlying biological heterogeneity. Our proposed pipeline opens up the possibility of analyzing existing, easily accessible H&amp;E stained histology images from a genomics point of view without physically performing gene expression profiling and empowers potential biological discovery from H&amp;E stained histology images.</description>

      <title>Refined climatologies of future precipitation over High Mountain Asia using probabilistic ensemble learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High Mountain Asia holds the largest concentration of frozen water outside the polar regions, serving as a crucial water source for more than 1.9 billion people. In the face of climate change, precipitation represents the largest source of uncertainty for hydrological modelling in this area. Future precipitation predictions remain challenging due to complex orography, lack of in situ hydrological observations, and limitations in climate model resolution and parametrisation for this region. To address the uncertainty posed by these challenges, climate models are often aggregated into multi-model ensembles. While multi-model ensembles are known to improve the predictive accuracy and analysis of future climate projections, consensus regarding how models are aggregated is lacking. In this study, we propose a probabilistic machine learning framework to systematically combine 13 regional climate models from the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment (CORDEX) over High Mountain Asia. Our approach accounts for seasonal and spatial biases within the models, enabling the prediction of more faithful precipitation distributions. The framework is validated against gridded historical precipitation data and is used to generate projections for the near-future (2036-2065) and far-future (2066-2095) under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios.</description>

      <title>Disentanglement Analysis in Deep Latent Variable Models Matching Aggregate Posterior Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep latent variable models (DLVMs) are designed to learn meaningful representations in an unsupervised manner, such that the hidden explanatory factors are interpretable by independent latent variables (aka disentanglement). The variational autoencoder (VAE) is a popular DLVM widely studied in disentanglement analysis due to the modeling of the posterior distribution using a factorized Gaussian distribution that encourages the alignment of the latent factors with the latent axes. Several metrics have been proposed recently, assuming that the latent variables explaining the variation in data are aligned with the latent axes (cardinal directions). However, there are other DLVMs, such as the AAE and WAE-MMD (matching the aggregate posterior to the prior), where the latent variables might not be aligned with the latent axes. In this work, we propose a statistical method to evaluate disentanglement for any DLVMs in general. The proposed technique discovers the latent vectors representing the generative factors of a dataset that can be different from the cardinal latent axes. We empirically demonstrate the advantage of the method on two datasets.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Synthetic Oversampling for Imbalanced Datasets Using Proxima-Orion Neighbors and q-Gaussian Weighting Technique</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15790v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel oversampling algorithm to increase the number of instances of minority class in an imbalanced dataset. We select two instances, Proxima and Orion, from the set of all minority class instances, based on a combination of relative distance weights and density estimation of majority class instances. Furthermore, the q-Gaussian distribution is used as a weighting mechanism to produce new synthetic instances to improve the representation and diversity. We conduct a comprehensive experiment on 42 datasets extracted from KEEL software and eight datasets from the UCI ML repository to evaluate the usefulness of the proposed (PO-QG) algorithm. Wilcoxon signed-rank test is used to compare the proposed algorithm with five other existing algorithms. The test results show that the proposed technique improves the overall classification performance. We also demonstrate the PO-QG algorithm to a dataset of Indian patients with sarcopenia.</description>

      <title>Beyond In-Distribution Performance: A Cross-Dataset Study of Trajectory Prediction Robustness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Out-of-Distribution (OoD) generalization ability of three SotA trajectory prediction models with comparable In-Distribution (ID) performance but different model designs. We investigate the influence of inductive bias, size of training data and data augmentation strategy by training the models on Argoverse 2 (A2) and testing on Waymo Open Motion (WO) and vice versa. We find that the smallest model with highest inductive bias exhibits the best OoD generalization across different augmentation strategies when trained on the smaller A2 dataset and tested on the large WO dataset. In the converse setting, training all models on the larger WO dataset and testing on the smaller A2 dataset, we find that all models generalize poorly, even though the model with the highest inductive bias still exhibits the best generalization ability. We discuss possible reasons for this surprising finding and draw conclusions about the design and test of trajectory prediction models and benchmarks.</description>

      <title>The Sample Complexity of Online Reinforcement Learning: A Multi-model Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15910v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the sample complexity of online reinforcement learning for nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous state and action spaces. Our analysis accommodates a large class of dynamical systems ranging from a finite set of nonlinear candidate models to models with bounded and Lipschitz continuous dynamics, to systems that are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters. In the most general setting, our algorithm achieves a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(N \epsilon^2 + \mathrm{ln}(m(\epsilon))/\epsilon^2)$, where $N$ is the time horizon, $\epsilon$ is a user-specified discretization width, and $m(\epsilon)$ measures the complexity of the function class under consideration via its packing number. In the special case where the dynamics are parametrized by a compact and real-valued set of parameters (such as neural networks, transformers, etc.), we prove a policy regret of $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{N p})$, where $p$ denotes the number of parameters, recovering earlier sample-complexity results that were derived for linear time-invariant dynamical systems. While this article focuses on characterizing sample complexity, the proposed algorithms are likely to be useful in practice, due to their simplicity, the ability to incorporate prior knowledge, and their benign transient behavior.</description>

      <title>Rethinking the Bias of Foundation Model under Long-tailed Distribution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-tailed learning has garnered increasing attention due to its practical significance. Among the various approaches, the fine-tuning paradigm has gained considerable interest with the advent of foundation models. However, most existing methods primarily focus on leveraging knowledge from these models, overlooking the inherent biases introduced by the imbalanced training data they rely on. In this paper, we examine how such imbalances from pre-training affect long-tailed downstream tasks. Specifically, we find the imbalance biases inherited in foundation models on downstream task as parameter imbalance and data imbalance. During fine-tuning, we observe that parameter imbalance plays a more critical role, while data imbalance can be mitigated using existing re-balancing strategies. Moreover, we find that parameter imbalance cannot be effectively addressed by current re-balancing techniques, such as adjusting the logits, during training, unlike data imbalance. To tackle both imbalances simultaneously, we build our method on causal learning and view the incomplete semantic factor as the confounder, which brings spurious correlations between input samples and labels. To resolve the negative effects of this, we propose a novel backdoor adjustment method that learns the true causal effect between input samples and labels, rather than merely fitting the correlations in the data. Notably, we achieve an average performance increase of about $1.67\%$ on each dataset.</description>

      <title>Classification Error Bound for Low Bayes Error Conditions in Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15977v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In statistical classification and machine learning, classification error is an important performance measure, which is minimized by the Bayes decision rule. In practice, the unknown true distribution is usually replaced with a model distribution estimated from the training data in the Bayes decision rule. This substitution introduces a mismatch between the Bayes error and the model-based classification error. In this work, we apply classification error bounds to study the relationship between the error mismatch and the Kullback-Leibler divergence in machine learning. Motivated by recent observations of low model-based classification errors in many machine learning tasks, bounding the Bayes error to be lower, we propose a linear approximation of the classification error bound for low Bayes error conditions. Then, the bound for class priors are discussed. Moreover, we extend the classification error bound for sequences. Using automatic speech recognition as a representative example of machine learning applications, this work analytically discusses the correlations among different performance measures with extended bounds, including cross-entropy loss, language model perplexity, and word error rate.</description>

      <title>Gaussian credible intervals in Bayesian nonparametric estimation of the unseen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16008v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unseen-species problem assumes $n\geq1$ samples from a population of individuals belonging to different species, possibly infinite, and calls for estimating the number $K_{n,m}$ of hitherto unseen species that would be observed if $m\geq1$ new samples were collected from the same population. This is a long-standing problem in statistics, which has gained renewed relevance in biological and physical sciences, particularly in settings with large values of $n$ and $m$. In this paper, we adopt a Bayesian nonparametric approach to the unseen-species problem under the Pitman-Yor prior, and propose a novel methodology to derive large $m$ asymptotic credible intervals for $K_{n,m}$, for any $n\geq1$. By leveraging a Gaussian central limit theorem for the posterior distribution of $K_{n,m}$, our method improves upon competitors in two key aspects: firstly, it enables the full parameterization of the Pitman-Yor prior, including the Dirichlet prior; secondly, it avoids the need of Monte Carlo sampling, enhancing computational efficiency. We validate the proposed method on synthetic and real data, demonstrating that it improves the empirical performance of competitors by significantly narrowing the gap between asymptotic and exact credible intervals for any $m\geq1$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Projection-Free Online Learning with Time-Varying Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16046</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16046v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate constrained online convex optimization, in which decisions must belong to a fixed and typically complicated domain, and are required to approximately satisfy additional time-varying constraints over the long term. In this setting, the commonly used projection operations are often computationally expensive or even intractable. To avoid the time-consuming operation, several projection-free methods have been proposed with an $\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4} \sqrt{\log T})$ regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(T^{7/8})$ cumulative constraint violation (CCV) bound for general convex losses. In this paper, we improve this result and further establish \textit{novel} regret and CCV bounds when loss functions are strongly convex. The primary idea is to first construct a composite surrogate loss, involving the original loss and constraint functions, by utilizing the Lyapunov-based technique. Then, we propose a parameter-free variant of the classical projection-free method, namely online Frank-Wolfe (OFW), and run this new extension over the online-generated surrogate loss. Theoretically, for general convex losses, we achieve an $\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4})$ regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(T^{3/4} \log T)$ CCV bound, both of which are order-wise tighter than existing results. For strongly convex losses, we establish new guarantees of an $\mathcal{O}(T^{2/3})$ regret bound and an $\mathcal{O}(T^{5/6})$ CCV bound. Moreover, we also extend our methods to a more challenging setting with bandit feedback, obtaining similar theoretical findings. Empirically, experiments on real-world datasets have demonstrated the effectiveness of our methods.</description>

      <title>Random Reshuffling for Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16055v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the use of different randomisation policies for stochastic gradient algorithms used in sampling, based on first-order (or overdamped) Langevin dynamics, the most popular of which is known as Stochastic Gradient Langevin Dynamics. Conventionally, this algorithm is combined with a specific stochastic gradient strategy, called Robbins-Monro. In this work, we study an alternative strategy, Random Reshuffling, and show convincingly that it leads to improved performance via: a) a proof of reduced bias in the Wasserstein metric for strongly convex, gradient Lipschitz potentials; b) an analytical demonstration of reduced bias for a Gaussian model problem; and c) an empirical demonstration of reduced bias in numerical experiments for some logistic regression problems. This is especially important since Random Reshuffling is typically more efficient due to memory access and cache reasons. Such acceleration for the Random Reshuffling policy is familiar from the optimisation literature on stochastic gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Ringmaster ASGD: The First Asynchronous SGD with Optimal Time Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Asynchronous Stochastic Gradient Descent (Asynchronous SGD) is a cornerstone method for parallelizing learning in distributed machine learning. However, its performance suffers under arbitrarily heterogeneous computation times across workers, leading to suboptimal time complexity and inefficiency as the number of workers scales. While several Asynchronous SGD variants have been proposed, recent findings by Tyurin &amp; Richt\'arik (NeurIPS 2023) reveal that none achieve optimal time complexity, leaving a significant gap in the literature. In this paper, we propose Ringmaster ASGD, a novel Asynchronous SGD method designed to address these limitations and tame the inherent challenges of Asynchronous SGD. We establish, through rigorous theoretical analysis, that Ringmaster ASGD achieves optimal time complexity under arbitrarily heterogeneous and dynamically fluctuating worker computation times. This makes it the first Asynchronous SGD method to meet the theoretical lower bounds for time complexity in such scenarios.</description>

      <title>SWIFT: Mapping Sub-series with Wavelet Decomposition Improves Time Series Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16178v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent work on time-series prediction, Transformers and even large language models have garnered significant attention due to their strong capabilities in sequence modeling. However, in practical deployments, time-series prediction often requires operation in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices, which are unable to handle the computational overhead of large models. To address such scenarios, some lightweight models have been proposed, but they exhibit poor performance on non-stationary sequences. In this paper, we propose $\textit{SWIFT}$, a lightweight model that is not only powerful, but also efficient in deployment and inference for Long-term Time Series Forecasting (LTSF). Our model is based on three key points: (i) Utilizing wavelet transform to perform lossless downsampling of time series. (ii) Achieving cross-band information fusion with a learnable filter. (iii) Using only one shared linear layer or one shallow MLP for sub-series' mapping. We conduct comprehensive experiments, and the results show that $\textit{SWIFT}$ achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple datasets, offering a promising method for edge computing and deployment in this task. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the number of parameters in $\textit{SWIFT-Linear}$ is only 25\% of what it would be with a single-layer linear model for time-domain prediction.

Abstract: Statistical inference for tensors has emerged as a critical challenge in analyzing high-dimensional data in modern data science. This paper introduces a unified framework for inferring general and low-Tucker-rank linear functionals of low-Tucker-rank signal tensors for several low-rank tensor models. Our methodology tackles two primary goals: achieving asymptotic normality and constructing minimax-optimal confidence intervals. By leveraging a debiasing strategy and projecting onto the tangent space of the low-Tucker-rank manifold, we enable inference for general and structured linear functionals, extending far beyond the scope of traditional entrywise inference. Specifically, in the low-Tucker-rank tensor regression or PCA model, we establish the computational and statistical efficiency of our approach, achieving near-optimal sample size requirements (in regression model) and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions (in PCA model) for general linear functionals without requiring sparsity in the loading tensor. Our framework also attains both computationally and statistically optimal sample size and SNR thresholds for low-Tucker-rank linear functionals. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical results, showcasing the framework's utility in diverse applications. This work addresses significant methodological gaps in statistical inference, advancing tensor analysis for complex and high-dimensional data environments.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Quantum Reinforcement Learning with a Quantum Natural Policy Gradient Based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the problem of quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) under model-free settings with quantum oracle access to the Markov Decision Process (MDP). This paper introduces a Quantum Natural Policy Gradient (QNPG) algorithm, which replaces the random sampling used in classical Natural Policy Gradient (NPG) estimators with a deterministic gradient estimation approach, enabling seamless integration into quantum systems. While this modification introduces a bounded bias in the estimator, the bias decays exponentially with increasing truncation levels. This paper demonstrates that the proposed QNPG algorithm achieves a sample complexity of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-1.5})$ for queries to the quantum oracle, significantly improving the classical lower bound of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(\epsilon^{-2})$ for queries to the MDP.</description>

      <title>A Unified Representation of Density-Power-Based Divergences Reducible to M-Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Density-power-based divergences are known to provide robust inference procedures against outliers, and their extensions have been widely studied. A characteristic of successful divergences is that the estimation problem can be reduced to M-estimation. In this paper, we define a norm-based Bregman density power divergence (NB-DPD) -- density-power-based divergence with functional flexibility within the framework of Bregman divergences that can be reduced to M-estimation. We show that, by specifying the function $\phi_\gamma$, NB-DPD reduces to well-known divergences, such as the density power divergence and the $\gamma$-divergence. Furthermore, by examining the combinations of functions $\phi_\gamma$ corresponding to existing divergences, we show that a new divergence connecting these existing divergences can be derived. Finally, we show that the redescending property, one of the key indicators of robustness, holds only for the $\gamma$-divergence.</description>

      <title>Implicit Bias in Matrix Factorization and its Explicit Realization in a New Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16322v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gradient descent for matrix factorization is known to exhibit an implicit bias toward approximately low-rank solutions. While existing theories often assume the boundedness of iterates, empirically the bias persists even with unbounded sequences. We thus hypothesize that implicit bias is driven by divergent dynamics markedly different from the convergent dynamics for data fitting. Using this perspective, we introduce a new factorization model: $X\approx UDV^\top$, where $U$ and $V$ are constrained within norm balls, while $D$ is a diagonal factor allowing the model to span the entire search space. Our experiments reveal that this model exhibits a strong implicit bias regardless of initialization and step size, yielding truly (rather than approximately) low-rank solutions. Furthermore, drawing parallels between matrix factorization and neural networks, we propose a novel neural network model featuring constrained layers and diagonal components. This model achieves strong performance across various regression and classification tasks while finding low-rank solutions, resulting in efficient and lightweight networks.</description>

      <title>Sources of Uncertainty in Supervised Machine Learning -- A Statisticians' View</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.16703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.16703v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Supervised machine learning and predictive models have achieved an impressive standard today, enabling us to answer questions that were inconceivable a few years ago. Besides these successes, it becomes clear, that beyond pure prediction, which is the primary strength of most supervised machine learning algorithms, the quantification of uncertainty is relevant and necessary as well. However, before quantification is possible, types and sources of uncertainty need to be defined precisely. While first concepts and ideas in this direction have emerged in recent years, this paper adopts a conceptual, basic science perspective and examines possible sources of uncertainty. By adopting the viewpoint of a statistician, we discuss the concepts of aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, which are more commonly associated with machine learning. The paper aims to formalize the two types of uncertainty and demonstrates that sources of uncertainty are miscellaneous and can not always be decomposed into aleatoric and epistemic. Drawing parallels between statistical concepts and uncertainty in machine learning, we emphasise the role of data and their influence on uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Effect of hyperparameters on variable selection in random forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.06943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Random forests (RFs) are well suited for prediction modeling and variable selection in high-dimensional omics studies. The effect of hyperparameters of the RF algorithm on prediction performance and variable importance estimation have previously been investigated. However, how hyperparameters impact RF-based variable selection remains unclear. We evaluate the effects on the Vita and the Boruta variable selection procedures based on two simulation studies utilizing theoretical distributions and empirical gene expression data. We assess the ability of the procedures to select important variables (sensitivity) while controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Our results show that the proportion of splitting candidate variables and the sample fraction for the training dataset influence the selection procedures more than the drawing strategy of the training datasets and the minimal terminal node size. A suitable setting of the RF hyperparameters depends on the correlation structure in the data. For weakly correlated predictor variables, the default value of the number of splitting variables is optimal, but smaller values of the sample fraction result in larger sensitivity. In contrast, the difference in sensitivity of the optimal compared to the default value of sample fraction is negligible for strongly correlated predictor variables, whereas smaller values than the default are better in the other settings. In conclusion, the default values of the hyperparameters will not always be suitable for identifying important variables. Thus, adequate values differ depending on whether the aim of the study is optimizing prediction performance or variable selection.</description>

      <title>Gaussian entropic optimal transport: Schr\"odinger bridges and the Sinkhorn algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18432v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropic optimal transport problems are regularized versions of optimal transport problems. These models play an increasingly important role in machine learning and generative modelling. For finite spaces, these problems are commonly solved using Sinkhorn algorithm (a.k.a. iterative proportional fitting procedure). However, in more general settings the Sinkhorn iterations are based on nonlinear conditional/conjugate transformations and exact finite-dimensional solutions cannot be computed. This article presents a finite-dimensional recursive formulation of the iterative proportional fitting procedure for general Gaussian multivariate models. As expected, this recursive formulation is closely related to the celebrated Kalman filter and related Riccati matrix difference equations, and it yields algorithms that can be implemented in practical settings without further approximations. We extend this filtering methodology to develop a refined and self-contained convergence analysis of Gaussian Sinkhorn algorithms, including closed form expressions of entropic transport maps and Schr\"odinger bridges.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding the bias in decision trees</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.04903v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is a widespread and longstanding belief that machine learning models are biased towards the majority (or negative) class when learning from imbalanced data, leading them to neglect or ignore the minority (or positive) class. In this study, we show that this belief is not necessarily correct for decision trees, and that their bias can actually be in the opposite direction. Motivated by a recent simulation study that suggested that decision trees can be biased towards the minority class, our paper aims to reconcile the conflict between that study and decades of other works. First, we critically evaluate past literature on this problem, finding that failing to consider the data generating process has led to incorrect conclusions about the bias in decision trees. We then prove that, under specific conditions related to the predictors, decision trees fit to purity and trained on a dataset with only one positive case are biased towards the minority class. Finally, we demonstrate that splits in a decision tree are also biased when there is more than one positive case. Our findings have implications on the use of popular tree-based models, such as random forests.</description>

      <title>Community Detection for Contextual-LSBM: Theoretical Limitations of Misclassification Rate and Efficient Algorithms</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11139v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The integration of network information and node attribute information has recently gained significant attention in the community detection literature. In this work, we consider community detection in the Contextual Labeled Stochastic Block Model (CLSBM), where the network follows an LSBM and node attributes follow a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). Our primary focus is the misclassification rate, which measures the expected number of nodes misclassified by community detection algorithms. We first establish a lower bound on the optimal misclassification rate that holds for any algorithm. When we specialize our setting to the LSBM (which preserves only network information) or the GMM (which preserves only node attribute information), our lower bound recovers prior results. Moreover, we present an efficient spectral-based algorithm tailored for the CLSBM and derive an upper bound on its misclassification rate. Although the algorithm does not attain the lower bound, it serves as a reliable starting point for designing more accurate community detection algorithms (as many algorithms use spectral method as an initial step, followed by refinement procedures to enhance accuracy).</description>

      <title>Bayesian Spatial Predictive Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.05197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.05197v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to spatial dependence -- often characterized as complex and non-linear -- model misspecification is a prevalent and critical issue in spatial data analysis and prediction. As the data, and thus model performance, is heterogeneous, typical model selection and ensemble methods that assume homogeneity are not suitable. We address the issue of model uncertainty for spatial data by proposing a novel Bayesian ensemble methodology that captures spatially-varying model uncertainty and performance heterogeneity of multiple spatial predictions, and synthesizes them for improved predictions, which we call Bayesian spatial predictive synthesis. Our proposal is defined by specifying a latent factor spatially-varying coefficient model as the synthesis function, which enables spatial characteristics of each model to be learned and ensemble coefficients to vary over regions to achieve flexible predictions. We derive our method from the theoretically best approximation of the data generating process, and show that it provides a finite sample theoretical guarantee for its predictive performance, specifically that the predictions are exact minimax. Two MCMC strategies are implemented for full uncertainty quantification, as well as a variational inference strategy for fast point inference. We also extend the estimation strategy for general responses. Through simulation examples and two real data applications in real estate and ecology, our proposed Bayesian spatial predictive synthesis outperforms standard spatial models and ensemble methods, and advanced machine learning methods, in terms of predictive accuracy and uncertainty quantification, while maintaining interpretability of the prediction mechanism.</description>

      <title>Randomized Block-Coordinate Optimistic Gradient Algorithms for Root-Finding Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.03113v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop two new randomized block-coordinate optimistic gradient algorithms to approximate a solution of nonlinear equations in large-scale settings, which are called root-finding problems. Our first algorithm is non-accelerated with constant stepsizes, and achieves $\mathcal{O}(1/k)$ best-iterate convergence rate on $\mathbb{E}[ \Vert Gx^k\Vert^2]$ when the underlying operator $G$ is Lipschitz continuous and satisfies a weak Minty solution condition, where $\mathbb{E}[\cdot]$ is the expectation and $k$ is the iteration counter. Our second method is a new accelerated randomized block-coordinate optimistic gradient algorithm. We establish both $\mathcal{O}(1/k^2)$ and $o(1/k^2)$ last-iterate convergence rates on both $\mathbb{E}[ \Vert Gx^k\Vert^2]$ and $\mathbb{E}[ \Vert x^{k+1} - x^{k}\Vert^2]$ for this algorithm under the co-coerciveness of $G$. In addition, we prove that the iterate sequence $\{x^k\}$ converges to a solution almost surely, and $k\Vert Gx^k\Vert$ attains a $o(1/k)$ almost sure convergence rate. Then, we apply our methods to a class of large-scale finite-sum inclusions, which covers prominent applications in machine learning, statistical learning, and network optimization, especially in federated learning. We obtain two new federated learning-type algorithms and their convergence rate guarantees for solving this problem class.</description>

Abstract: Machine learning is increasingly deployed in safety-critical domains where erroneous predictions may lead to potentially catastrophic consequences, highlighting the need for learning systems to be aware of how confident they are in their own predictions: in other words, 'to know when they do not know'. In this paper, we propose a novel Random-Set Neural Network (RS-NN) approach to classification which predicts belief functions (rather than classical probability vectors) over the class list using the mathematics of random sets, i.e., distributions over the collection of sets of classes. RS-NN encodes the 'epistemic' uncertainty induced by training sets that are insufficiently representative or limited in size via the size of the convex set of probability vectors associated with a predicted belief function. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art Bayesian and Ensemble methods in terms of accuracy, uncertainty estimation and out-of-distribution (OoD) detection on multiple benchmarks (CIFAR-10 vs SVHN/Intel-Image, MNIST vs FMNIST/KMNIST, ImageNet vs ImageNet-O). RS-NN also scales up effectively to large-scale architectures (e.g. WideResNet-28-10, VGG16, Inception V3, EfficientNetB2 and ViT-Base-16), exhibits remarkable robustness to adversarial attacks and can provide statistical guarantees in a conformal learning setting.</description>

      <title>Selective Generation for Controllable Language Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09254v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Trustworthiness of generative language models (GLMs) is crucial in their deployment to critical decision making systems. Hence, certified risk control methods such as selective prediction and conformal prediction have been applied to mitigating the hallucination problem in various supervised downstream tasks. However, the lack of appropriate correctness metric hinders applying such principled methods to language generation tasks. In this paper, we circumvent this problem by leveraging the concept of textual entailment to evaluate the correctness of the generated sequence, and propose two selective generation algorithms which control the false discovery rate with respect to the textual entailment relation (FDR-E) with a theoretical guarantee: $\texttt{SGen}^{\texttt{Sup}}$ and $\texttt{SGen}^{\texttt{Semi}}$. $\texttt{SGen}^{\texttt{Sup}}$, a direct modification of the selective prediction, is a supervised learning algorithm which exploits entailment-labeled data, annotated by humans. Since human annotation is costly, we further propose a semi-supervised version, $\texttt{SGen}^{\texttt{Semi}}$, which fully utilizes the unlabeled data by pseudo-labeling, leveraging an entailment set function learned via conformal prediction. Furthermore, $\texttt{SGen}^{\texttt{Semi}}$ enables to use more general class of selection functions, neuro-selection functions, and provides users with an optimal selection function class given multiple candidates. Finally, we demonstrate the efficacy of the $\texttt{SGen}$ family in achieving a desired FDR-E level with comparable selection efficiency to those from baselines on both open and closed source GLMs. Code and datasets are provided at https://github.com/ml-postech/selective-generation.</description>

      <title>Improved learning theory for kernel distribution regression with two-stage sampling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14335v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distribution regression problem encompasses many important statistics and machine learning tasks, and arises in a large range of applications. Among various existing approaches to tackle this problem, kernel methods have become a method of choice. Indeed, kernel distribution regression is both computationally favorable, and supported by a recent learning theory. This theory also tackles the two-stage sampling setting, where only samples from the input distributions are available. In this paper, we improve the learning theory of kernel distribution regression. We address kernels based on Hilbertian embeddings, that encompass most, if not all, of the existing approaches. We introduce the novel near-unbiased condition on the Hilbertian embeddings, that enables us to provide new error bounds on the effect of the two-stage sampling, thanks to a new analysis. We show that this near-unbiased condition holds for three important classes of kernels, based on optimal transport and mean embedding. As a consequence, we strictly improve the existing convergence rates for these kernels. Our setting and results are illustrated by numerical experiments.</description>

Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) sample from a target distribution by iteratively transforming noise using the score function of the perturbed target. For any finite training set, this score function can be evaluated in closed form, but the resulting SGM memorizes its training data and does not generate novel samples. In practice, one approximates the score by training a neural network via score-matching. The error in this approximation promotes generalization, but neural SGMs are costly to train and sample, and the effective regularization this error provides is not well-understood theoretically. In this work, we instead explicitly smooth the closed-form score to obtain an SGM that generates novel samples without training. We analyze our model and propose an efficient nearest-neighbor-based estimator of its score function. Using this estimator, our method achieves competitive sampling times while running on consumer-grade CPUs.</description>

      <title>On the estimation of the number of components in multivariate functional principal component analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04540v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Happ and Greven (2018) developed a methodology for principal components analysis of multivariate functional data observed on different dimensional domains. Their approach relies on an estimation of univariate functional principal components for each univariate functional feature. In this paper, we present extensive simulations to investigate choosing the number of principal components to retain. We show empirically that the conventional approach of using a percentage of variance explained threshold for each univariate functional feature may be unreliable when aiming to explain an overall percentage of variance in the multivariate functional data, and thus we advise practitioners to exercise caution.</description>

      <title>MAPPING: Debiasing Graph Neural Networks for Fair Node Classification with Limited Sensitive Information Leakage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.12824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite remarkable success in diverse web-based applications, Graph Neural Networks(GNNs) inherit and further exacerbate historical discrimination and social stereotypes, which critically hinder their deployments in high-stake domains such as online clinical diagnosis, financial crediting, etc. However, current fairness research that primarily craft on i.i.d data, cannot be trivially replicated to non-i.i.d. graph structures with topological dependence among samples. Existing fair graph learning typically favors pairwise constraints to achieve fairness but fails to cast off dimensional limitations and generalize them into multiple sensitive attributes; besides, most studies focus on in-processing techniques to enforce and calibrate fairness, constructing a model-agnostic debiasing GNN framework at the pre-processing stage to prevent downstream misuses and improve training reliability is still largely under-explored. Furthermore, previous work on GNNs tend to enhance either fairness or privacy individually but few probe into their interplays. In this paper, we propose a novel model-agnostic debiasing framework named MAPPING (\underline{M}asking \underline{A}nd \underline{P}runing and Message-\underline{P}assing train\underline{ING}) for fair node classification, in which we adopt the distance covariance($dCov$)-based fairness constraints to simultaneously reduce feature and topology biases in arbitrary dimensions, and combine them with adversarial debiasing to confine the risks of attribute inference attacks. Experiments on real-world datasets with different GNN variants demonstrate the effectiveness and flexibility of MAPPING. Our results show that MAPPING can achieve better trade-offs between utility and fairness, and mitigate privacy risks of sensitive information leakage.</description>

      <title>An analysis of the noise schedule for score-based generative models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04650v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based generative models (SGMs) aim at estimating a target data distribution by learning score functions using only noise-perturbed samples from the target.Recent literature has focused extensively on assessing the error between the target and estimated distributions, gauging the generative quality through the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence and Wasserstein distances.  Under mild assumptions on the data distribution, we establish an upper bound for the KL divergence between the target and the estimated distributions, explicitly depending on any time-dependent noise schedule. Under additional regularity assumptions, taking advantage of favorable underlying contraction mechanisms, we provide a tighter error bound in Wasserstein distance compared to state-of-the-art results. In addition to being tractable, this upper bound jointly incorporates properties of the target distribution and SGM hyperparameters that need to be tuned during training. Finally, we illustrate these bounds through numerical experiments using simulated and CIFAR-10 datasets, identifying an optimal range of noise schedules within a parametric family.</description>

      <title>Universal generalization guarantees for Wasserstein distributionally robust models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11981v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Distributionally robust optimization has emerged as an attractive way to train robust machine learning models, capturing data uncertainty and distribution shifts. Recent statistical analyses have proved that generalization guarantees of robust models based on the Wasserstein distance have generalization guarantees that do not suffer from the curse of dimensionality. However, these results are either approximate, obtained in specific cases, or based on assumptions difficult to verify in practice. In contrast, we establish exact generalization guarantees that cover a wide range of cases, with arbitrary transport costs and parametric loss functions, including deep learning objectives with nonsmooth activations. We complete our analysis with an excess bound on the robust objective and an extension to Wasserstein robust models with entropic regularizations.</description>

      <title>Grid Monitoring with Synchro-Waveform and AI Foundation Model Technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.06942v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Purpose:This article advocates for the development of a next-generation grid monitoring and control system designed for future grids dominated by inverter-based resources. Leveraging recent progress in generative artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and networking technology, we develop a physics-based AI foundation model with high-resolution synchro-waveform measurement technology to enhance grid resilience and reduce economic losses from outages.
  Methods and Results:The proposed framework adopts the AI Foundation Model paradigm, where a generative and pre-trained (GPT) foundation model extracts physical features from power system measurements, enabling adaptation to a wide range of grid operation tasks. Replacing the large language models used in popular AI foundation models, this approach is based on the Wiener-Kallianpur-Rosenblatt innovation model for power system time series, trained to capture the physical laws of power flows and sinusoidal characteristics of grid measurements. The pre-trained foundation model causally extracts sufficient statistics from grid measurement time series for various downstream applications, including anomaly detection, over-current protection, probabilistic forecasting, and data compression for streaming synchro-waveform data. Numerical simulations using field-collected data demonstrate significantly improved fault detection accuracy and detection speed.
  Conclusion:The future grid will be rich in inverter-based resources, making it highly dynamic, stochastic, and low inertia. This work underscores the limitations of existing Supervisory-Control-and-Data-Acquisition and Phasor-Measurement-Unit monitoring systems and advocates for AI-enabled monitoring and control with high-resolution synchro-waveform technology to provide accurate situational awareness, rapid response to faults, and robust network protection.</description>

      <title>Generalized Neyman Allocation for Locally Minimax Optimal Best-Arm Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study investigates an asymptotically locally minimax optimal algorithm for fixed-budget best-arm identification (BAI). We propose the Generalized Neyman Allocation (GNA) algorithm and demonstrate that its worst-case upper bound on the probability of misidentifying the best arm aligns with the worst-case lower bound under the small-gap regime, where the gap between the expected outcomes of the best and suboptimal arms is small. Our lower and upper bounds are tight, matching exactly including constant terms within the small-gap regime. The GNA algorithm generalizes the Neyman allocation for two-armed bandits (Neyman, 1934; Kaufmann et al., 2016) and refines existing BAI algorithms, such as those proposed by Glynn &amp; Juneja (2004). By proposing an asymptotically minimax optimal algorithm, we address the longstanding open issue in BAI (Kaufmann, 2020) and treatment choice (Kasy &amp; Sautmann, 202) by restricting a class of distributions to the small-gap regimes.</description>

      <title>Fault detection in propulsion motors in the presence of concept drift</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.08030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning and statistical methods can improve conventional motor protection systems, providing early warning and detection of emerging failures. Data-driven methods rely on historical data to learn how the system is expected to behave under normal circumstances. An unexpected change in the underlying system may cause a change in the statistical properties of the data, and by this alter the performance of the fault detection algorithm in terms of time to detection and false alarms. This kind of change, called \textit{concept drift}, requires adaptations to maintain constant performance. In this article, we present a machine learning approach for detecting overheating in the stator windings of marine electrical propulsion motors. Using simulated overheating faults injected into operational data, the methods are shown to provide early detection compared to conventional methods based on temperature readings and fixed limits. The proposed monitors are designed to operate for a type of concept drift observed in operational data collected from a specific class of motors in a fleet of ships. Using a mix of real and simulated concept drifts, it is shown that the proposed monitors are able to provide early detections during and after concept drifts, without the need for full model retraining.</description>

      <title>BLoB: Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation by Backpropagation for Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.11675v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) often suffer from overconfidence during inference, particularly when adapted to downstream domain-specific tasks with limited data. Previous work addresses this issue by employing approximate Bayesian estimation after the LLMs are trained, enabling them to quantify uncertainty. However, such post-training approaches' performance is severely limited by the parameters learned during training. In this paper, we go beyond post-training Bayesianization and propose Bayesian Low-Rank Adaptation by Backpropagation (BLoB), an algorithm that continuously and jointly adjusts both the mean and covariance of LLM parameters throughout the whole fine-tuning process. Our empirical results verify the effectiveness of BLoB in terms of generalization and uncertainty estimation, when evaluated on both in-distribution and out-of-distribution data.</description>

      <title>Binary Losses for Density Ratio Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01371v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Estimating the ratio of two probability densities from a finite number of observations is a central machine learning problem. A common approach is to construct estimators using binary classifiers that distinguish observations from the two densities. However, the accuracy of these estimators depends on the choice of the binary loss function, raising the question of which loss function to choose based on desired error properties. For example, traditional loss functions, such as logistic or boosting loss, prioritize accurate estimation of small density ratio values over large ones, even though the latter are more critical in many applications.
  In this work, we start with prescribed error measures in a class of Bregman divergences and characterize all loss functions that result in density ratio estimators with small error. Our characterization extends results on composite binary losses from (Reid &amp; Williamson, 2010) and their connection to density ratio estimation as identified by (Menon &amp; Ong, 2016). As a result, we obtain a simple recipe for constructing loss functions with certain properties, such as those that prioritize an accurate estimation of large density ratio values. Our novel loss functions outperform related approaches for resolving parameter choice issues of 11 deep domain adaptation algorithms in average performance across 484 real-world tasks including sensor signals, texts, and images.</description>

      <title>State-space models are accurate and efficient neural operators for dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03231v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) has emerged as a promising alternative to classical methods for predicting dynamical systems, offering faster and more generalizable solutions. However, existing models, including recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers, and neural operators, face challenges such as long-time integration, long-range dependencies, chaotic dynamics, and extrapolation, to name a few. To this end, this paper introduces state-space models implemented in Mamba for accurate and efficient dynamical system operator learning. Mamba addresses the limitations of existing architectures by dynamically capturing long-range dependencies and enhancing computational efficiency through reparameterization techniques. To extensively test Mamba and compare against another 11 baselines, we introduce several strict extrapolation testbeds that go beyond the standard interpolation benchmarks. We demonstrate Mamba's superior performance in both interpolation and challenging extrapolation tasks. Mamba consistently ranks among the top models while maintaining the lowest computational cost and exceptional extrapolation capabilities. Moreover, we demonstrate the good performance of Mamba for a real-world application in quantitative systems pharmacology for assessing the efficacy of drugs in tumor growth under limited data scenarios. Taken together, our findings highlight Mamba's potential as a powerful tool for advancing scientific machine learning in dynamical systems modeling.

      <description>arXiv:2409.06530v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies simple bilevel problems, where a convex upper-level function is minimized over the optimal solutions of a convex lower-level problem. We first show the fundamental difficulty of simple bilevel problems, that the approximate optimal value of such problems is not obtainable by first-order zero-respecting algorithms. Then we follow recent works to pursue the weak approximate solutions. For this goal, we propose a novel method by reformulating them into functionally constrained problems. Our method achieves near-optimal rates for both smooth and nonsmooth problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first near-optimal algorithm that works under standard assumptions of smoothness or Lipschitz continuity for the objective functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07427v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Implicit networks are a class of neural networks whose outputs are defined by the fixed point of a parameterized operator. They have enjoyed success in many applications including natural language processing, image processing, and numerous other applications. While they have found abundant empirical success, theoretical work on its generalization is still under-explored. In this work, we consider a large family of implicit networks defined parameterized contractive fixed point operators. We show a generalization bound for this class based on a covering number argument for the Rademacher complexity of these architectures.</description>

      <title>Towards a unified and verified understanding of group-operation networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.07476v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A recent line of work in mechanistic interpretability has focused on reverse-engineering the computation performed by neural networks trained on the binary operation of finite groups. We investigate the internals of one-hidden-layer neural networks trained on this task, revealing previously unidentified structure and producing a more complete description of such models in a step towards unifying the explanations of previous works (Chughtai et al., 2023; Stander et al., 2024). Notably, these models approximate equivariance in each input argument. We verify that our explanation applies to a large fraction of networks trained on this task by translating it into a compact proof of model performance, a quantitative evaluation of the extent to which we faithfully and concisely explain model internals. In the main text, we focus on the symmetric group S5. For models trained on this group, our explanation yields a guarantee of model accuracy that runs 3x faster than brute force and gives a &gt;=95% accuracy bound for 45% of the models we trained. We were unable to obtain nontrivial non-vacuous accuracy bounds using only explanations from previous works.</description>

      <title>Adversarially Robust Out-of-Distribution Detection Using Lyapunov-Stabilized Embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10744v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in out-of-distribution (OOD) detection, existing methods still struggle to maintain robustness against adversarial attacks, compromising their reliability in critical real-world applications. Previous studies have attempted to address this challenge by exposing detectors to auxiliary OOD datasets alongside adversarial training. However, the increased data complexity inherent in adversarial training, and the myriad of ways that OOD samples can arise during testing, often prevent these approaches from establishing robust decision boundaries. To address these limitations, we propose AROS, a novel approach leveraging neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) with Lyapunov stability theorem in order to obtain robust embeddings for OOD detection. By incorporating a tailored loss function, we apply Lyapunov stability theory to ensure that both in-distribution (ID) and OOD data converge to stable equilibrium points within the dynamical system. This approach encourages any perturbed input to return to its stable equilibrium, thereby enhancing the model's robustness against adversarial perturbations. To not use additional data, we generate fake OOD embeddings by sampling from low-likelihood regions of the ID data feature space, approximating the boundaries where OOD data are likely to reside. To then further enhance robustness, we propose the use of an orthogonal binary layer following the stable feature space, which maximizes the separation between the equilibrium points of ID and OOD samples. We validate our method through extensive experiments across several benchmarks, demonstrating superior performance, particularly under adversarial attacks. Notably, our approach improves robust detection performance from 37.8% to 80.1% on CIFAR-10 vs. CIFAR-100 and from 29.0% to 67.0% on CIFAR-100 vs. CIFAR-10.</description>

      <title>Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoders for Warped Riemannian Metric Learning and Generative Modeling on Data Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.12779v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid growth of high-dimensional datasets in fields such as single-cell RNA sequencing and spatial genomics has led to unprecedented opportunities for scientific discovery, but it also presents unique computational and statistical challenges. Traditional methods struggle with geometry-aware data generation, interpolation along meaningful trajectories, and transporting populations via feasible paths. To address these issues, we introduce Geometry-Aware Generative Autoencoder (GAGA), a novel framework that combines extensible manifold learning with generative modeling. GAGA constructs a neural network embedding space that respects the intrinsic geometries discovered by manifold learning and learns a novel warped Riemannian metric on the data space. This warped metric is derived from both the points on the data manifold and negative samples off the manifold, allowing it to characterize a meaningful geometry across the entire latent space. Using this metric, GAGA can uniformly sample points on the manifold, generate points along geodesics, and interpolate between populations across the learned manifold using geodesic-guided flows. GAGA shows competitive performance in simulated and real-world datasets, including a 30% improvement over the state-of-the-art methods in single-cell population-level trajectory inference.</description>

      <title>FIT-GNN: Faster Inference Time for GNNs Using Coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.15001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Scalability of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) remains a significant challenge, particularly when dealing with large-scale graphs. To tackle this, coarsening-based methods are used to reduce the graph into a smaller graph, resulting in faster computation. Nonetheless, prior research has not adequately addressed the computational costs during the inference phase. This paper presents a novel approach to improve the scalability of GNNs by reducing computational burden during both training and inference phases. We demonstrate two different methods (Extra-Nodes and Cluster-Nodes). Our study also proposes a unique application of the coarsening algorithm for graph-level tasks, including graph classification and graph regression, which have not yet been explored. We conduct extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets in the order of $100K$ nodes to evaluate the performance of our approach. The results demonstrate that our method achieves competitive performance in tasks involving classification and regression on nodes and graphs, compared to traditional GNNs, while having single-node inference times that are orders of magnitude faster. Furthermore, our approach significantly reduces memory consumption, allowing training and inference on low-resource devices where traditional methods struggle.</description>

      <title>Learning the Regularization Strength for Deep Fine-Tuning via a Data-Emphasized Variational Objective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A number of popular transfer learning methods rely on grid search to select regularization hyperparameters that control over-fitting. This grid search requirement has several key disadvantages: the search is computationally expensive, requires carving out a validation set that reduces the size of available data for model training, and requires practitioners to specify candidate values. In this paper, we propose an alternative to grid search: directly learning regularization hyperparameters on the full training set via model selection techniques based on the evidence lower bound ("ELBo") objective from variational methods. For deep neural networks with millions of parameters, we specifically recommend a modified ELBo that upweights the influence of the data likelihood relative to the prior while remaining a valid bound on the evidence for Bayesian model selection. Our proposed technique overcomes all three disadvantages of grid search. We demonstrate effectiveness on image classification tasks on several datasets, yielding heldout accuracy comparable to existing approaches with far less compute time.</description>

      <title>A Note on Doubly Robust Estimator in Regression Discontinuity Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07978v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This note introduces a doubly robust (DR) estimator for regression discontinuity (RD) designs. RD designs provide a quasi-experimental framework for estimating treatment effects, where treatment assignment depends on whether a running variable surpasses a predefined cutoff. A common approach in RD estimation is the use of nonparametric regression methods, such as local linear regression. However, the validity of these methods still relies on the consistency of the nonparametric estimators. In this study, we propose the DR-RD estimator, which combines two distinct estimators for the conditional expected outcomes. The primary advantage of the DR-RD estimator lies in its ability to ensure the consistency of the treatment effect estimation as long as at least one of the two estimators is consistent. Consequently, our DR-RD estimator enhances robustness of treatment effect estimators in RD designs.</description>

      <title>Modeling Latent Non-Linear Dynamical System over Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08114v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of modeling a non-linear dynamical system when given a time series by deriving equations directly from the data. Despite the fact that time series data are given as input, models for dynamics and estimation algorithms that incorporate long-term temporal dependencies are largely absent from existing studies. In this paper, we introduce a latent state to allow time-dependent modeling and formulate this problem as a dynamics estimation problem in latent states. We face multiple technical challenges, including (1) modeling latent non-linear dynamics and (2) solving circular dependencies caused by the presence of latent states. To tackle these challenging problems, we propose a new method, Latent Non-Linear equation modeling (LaNoLem), that can model a latent non-linear dynamical system and a novel alternating minimization algorithm for effectively estimating latent states and model parameters. In addition, we introduce criteria to control model complexity without human intervention. Compared with the state-of-the-art model, LaNoLem achieves competitive performance for estimating dynamics while outperforming other methods in prediction.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Data for Portfolios: A Throw of the Dice Will Never Abolish Chance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03993v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Simulation methods have always been instrumental in finance, and data-driven methods with minimal model specification, commonly referred to as generative models, have attracted increasing attention, especially after the success of deep learning in a broad range of fields. However, the adoption of these models in financial applications has not kept pace with the growing interest, probably due to the unique complexities and challenges of financial markets. This paper aims to contribute to a deeper understanding of the limitations of generative models, particularly in portfolio and risk management. To this end, we begin by presenting theoretical results on the importance of initial sample size, and point out the potential pitfalls of generating far more data than originally available. We then highlight the inseparable nature of model development and the desired use case by touching on a paradox: generic generative models inherently care less about what is important for constructing portfolios (in particular the long-short ones). Based on these findings, we propose a pipeline for the generation of multivariate returns that meets conventional evaluation standards on a large universe of US equities while being compliant with stylized facts observed in asset returns and turning around the pitfalls we previously identified. Moreover, we insist on the need for more delicate evaluation methods, and suggest, through an example of mean-reversion strategies, a method designed to identify poor models for a given application based on regurgitative training, i.e. retraining the model using the data it has itself generated, which is commonly referred to in statistics as identifiability.</description>

      <title>Is magnitude 'generically continuous' for finite metric spaces?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnitude is a real-valued invariant of metric spaces which, in the finite setting, can be understood as recording the 'effective number of points' in a space as the scale of the metric varies. Motivated by applications in topological data analysis, this paper investigates the stability of magnitude: its continuity properties with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff topology. We show that magnitude is nowhere continuous on the Gromov-Hausdorff space of finite metric spaces. Yet, we find evidence to suggest that it may be 'generically continuous', in the sense that generic Gromov-Hausdorff limits are preserved by magnitude. We make the case that, in fact, 'generic stability' is what matters for applicability.</description>

      <title>Quantum Annealing for Robust Principal Component Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10431v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Principal component analysis is commonly used for dimensionality reduction, feature extraction, denoising, and visualization. The most commonly used principal component analysis method is based upon optimization of the L2-norm, however, the L2-norm is known to exaggerate the contribution of errors and outliers. When optimizing over the L1-norm, the components generated are known to exhibit robustness or resistance to outliers in the data. The L1-norm components can be solved for with a binary optimization problem. Previously, L1-BF has been used to solve the binary optimization for multiple components simultaneously. In this paper we propose QAPCA, a new method for finding principal components using quantum annealing hardware which will optimize over the robust L1-norm. The conditions required for convergence of the annealing problem are discussed. The potential speedup when using quantum annealing is demonstrated through complexity analysis and experimental results. To showcase performance against classical principal component analysis techniques experiments upon synthetic Gaussian data, a fault detection scenario and breast cancer diagnostic data are studied. We find that the reconstruction error when using QAPCA is comparable to that when using L1-BF.</description>

      <title>Federated Granger Causality Learning for Interdependent Clients with State Space Representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13890v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advanced sensors and IoT devices have improved the monitoring and control of complex industrial enterprises. They have also created an interdependent fabric of geographically distributed process operations (clients) across these enterprises. Granger causality is an effective approach to detect and quantify interdependencies by examining how one client's state affects others over time. Understanding these interdependencies captures how localized events, such as faults and disruptions, can propagate throughout the system, possibly causing widespread operational impacts. However, the large volume and complexity of industrial data pose challenges in modeling these interdependencies. This paper develops a federated approach to learning Granger causality. We utilize a linear state space system framework that leverages low-dimensional state estimates to analyze interdependencies. This addresses bandwidth limitations and the computational burden commonly associated with centralized data processing. We propose augmenting the client models with the Granger causality information learned by the server through a Machine Learning (ML) function. We examine the co-dependence between the augmented client and server models and reformulate the framework as a standalone ML algorithm providing conditions for its sublinear and linear convergence rates. We also study the convergence of the framework to a centralized oracle model. Moreover, we include a differential privacy analysis to ensure data security while preserving causal insights. Using synthetic data, we conduct comprehensive experiments to demonstrate the robustness of our approach to perturbations in causality, the scalability to the size of communication, number of clients, and the dimensions of raw data. We also evaluate the performance on two real-world industrial control system datasets by reporting the volume of data saved by decentralization.</description>
