      <title>Estimation of Optimal Dynamic Treatment Assignment Rules under Policy Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05031</link>

Abstract: This paper studies statistical decisions for dynamic treatment assignment problems. Many policies involve dynamics in their treatment assignments where treatments are sequentially assigned to individuals across multiple stages and the effect of treatment at each stage is usually heterogeneous with respect to the prior treatments, past outcomes, and observed covariates. We consider estimating an optimal dynamic treatment rule that guides the optimal treatment assignment for each individual at each stage based on the individual's history. This paper proposes an empirical welfare maximization approach in a dynamic framework. The approach estimates the optimal dynamic treatment rule using data from an experimental or quasi-experimental study. The paper proposes two estimation methods: one solves the treatment assignment problem at each stage through backward induction, and the other solves the whole dynamic treatment assignment problem simultaneously across all stages. We derive finite-sample upper bounds on worst-case average welfare regrets for the proposed methods and show $1/\sqrt{n}$-minimax convergence rates. We also modify the simultaneous estimation method to incorporate intertemporal budget/capacity constraints.</description>

      <title>When Can We Use Two-Way Fixed-Effects (TWFE): A Comparison of TWFE and Novel Dynamic Difference-in-Differences Estimators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.09928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The conventional Two-Way Fixed-Effects (TWFE) estimator has come under scrutiny lately. Recent literature has revealed potential shortcomings of TWFE when the treatment effects are heterogeneous. Scholars have developed new advanced dynamic Difference-in-Differences (DiD) estimators to tackle these potential shortcomings. However, confusion remains in applied research as to when the conventional TWFE is biased and what issues the novel estimators can and cannot address. In this study, we first provide an intuitive explanation of the problems of TWFE and elucidate the key features of the novel alternative DiD estimators. We then systematically demonstrate the conditions under which the conventional TWFE is inconsistent. We employ Monte Carlo simulations to assess the performance of dynamic DiD estimators under violations of key assumptions, which likely happens in applied cases. While the new dynamic DiD estimators offer notable advantages in capturing heterogeneous treatment effects, we show that the conventional TWFE performs generally well if the model specifies an event-time function. All estimators are equally sensitive to violations of the parallel trends assumption, anticipation effects or violations of time-varying exogeneity. Despite their advantages, the new dynamic DiD estimators tackle a very specific problem and they do not serve as a universal remedy for violations of the most critical assumptions. We finally derive, based on our simulations, recommendations for how and when to use TWFE and the new DiD estimators in applied research.</description>
