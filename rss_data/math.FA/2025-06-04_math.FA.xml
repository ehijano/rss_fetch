      <title>General Numerical Radius for Products of Sectorial Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the generalized numerical radius $\omega_N$, associated with a matrix norm $N$ defined by $\omega_N(X) = \sup_{\theta \in \mathbb{R}} N(\operatorname{Re}(e^{i\theta}X))$. We focus on matrices whose numerical ranges are contained in sectors of the complex plane (sectorial matrices) and derive upper bounds for $\omega_N(XY)$ and $\omega_N(X \circ Y)$ for such matrices $X$ and $Y$. Our results generalize and refine well known numerical radius inequalities. Several known inequalities for $\omega(X)$ are recovered as special cases.</description>

      <title>On Hermite type sampling Kantorovich operators in the settings of mixed norm Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we analyze the convergence behavior of Hermite-type sampling Kantorovich operators in the context of mixed norm spaces. We prove certain direct approximation theorems, including the uniform convergence theorem, the Voronovskaja-type asymptotic formula, and an estimate of error in the approximation in terms of the modulus of continuity in mixed norm settings. Next, we estimate the rate of convergence of these sampling Kantorovich operators in terms of the modulus of continuity. In addition, we obtain simultaneous approximation results of these sampling Kantorovich operators, including the uniform approximation, the asymptotic formula, and the approximation error in terms of the modulus of continuity in mixed settings. Finally, using cardinal $B$-splines, the implementation of differentiable functions has been shown.</description>

      <title>Localized frames without inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider countable families of vectors in a separable Hilbert space, which are mutually localized with respect to a fixed localized Riesz basis. We prove the equivalence of the frame property and nine conditions that do not involve any inequalities. This is done by studying the properties of their frame-related operators on the co-orbit spaces generated by the reference Riesz basis. We apply our main result to the setting of shift-invariant spaces and obtain new conditions for stable sets of sampling.</description>

      <title>Rust Implementation of Finite Element Exterior Calculus on Coordinate-Free Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis presents the development of a novel finite element library in Rust based on the principles of Finite Element Exterior Calculus (FEEC). The library solves partial differential equations formulated using differential forms on abstract, coordinate-free simplicial complexes in arbitrary dimensions, employing an intrinsic Riemannian metric derived from edge lengths via Regge Calculus. We focus on solving elliptic Hodge-Laplace eigenvalue and source problems on the nD de Rham complex. We restrict ourselves to first-order Whitney basis functions. The implementation is partially verified through convergence studies.</description>

      <title>Khintchine inequalities, trace monoids and Tur\'an-type problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove scalar and operator-valued Khintchine inequalities for mixtures of free and tensor-independent semicircle variables, interpolating between classical and free Khintchine-type inequalities. Specifically, we characterize the norm of sums of $G$-independent semicircle variables in terms of the spectral radius of the Cayley graph associated with the trace monoid determined by the graph $G$. Our approach relies on a precise correspondence between closed paths in trace monoids and the norms of such operator sums. This correspondence uncovers connections between non-commutative probability, combinatorial group theory, and extremal graph theory. In particular, we formulate Tur\'an-type extremal problems that govern maximal norm growth under classical commutation constraints, and identify the extremal configurations. We hope that the methods and connections developed here will be useful in the study of non-commutative structures constrained by combinatorial symmetries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider Riesz-type nonlocal energies with general interaction kernels and their discretizations related to particle systems. We prove that the discretized energies $\Gamma$-converge in the weak-$*$ topology to the Riesz functional defined over the space of probability measures. We also address the minimization problem for the discretized energies, and prove the existence of minimal configurations of particles in a very general and natural setting.</description>

      <title>Dual realizations of Bergman spaces on strongly convex domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02913v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Fantappi\`e and Laplace transforms realize isomorphisms between analytic functionals supported on a convex compact set $K\subset{\mathbb C}^n$ and certain spaces of holomorphic functions associated with $K$. Viewing the Bergman space of a bounded domain in ${\mathbb C}^n$ as a subspace of the space of analytic functionals supported on its closure, the images of the restrictions of these transforms have been studied in the planar setting. For the Fantappi\`e transform, this was done for simply connected domains (Napalkov Jr--Yulumukhamtov, 1995), and for the Laplace transform, this was done for convex domains (Napalkov Jr--Yulumukhamtov, 2004). In this paper, we study this problem in higher dimensions for strongly convex domains, and establish duality results analogous to the planar case. We also produce examples to show that the planar results cannot be generalized to all convex domains in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Affine Isoperimetric Inequalities for Higher-Order Projection and Centroid Bodies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.07859v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 1970, Schneider introduced the $m$th order difference body of a convex body, and also established the $m$th-order Rogers-Shephard inequality. In this paper, we extend this idea to the projection body, centroid body, and radial mean bodies, as well as prove the associated inequalities (analogues of Zhang's projection inequality, Petty's projection inequality, the Busemann-Petty centroid inequality and Busemann's random simplex inequality). We also establish a new proof of Schneider's $m$th-order Rogers-Shephard inequality. As an application, a $m$th-order affine Sobolev inequality for functions of bounded variation is provided.</description>

Abstract: We investigate spaces of operators which are invariant under translations or modulations by lattices in phase space. The natural connection to the Heisenberg module is considered, giving results on the characterisation of such operators as limits of finite--rank operators. Discrete representations of these operators in terms of elementary objects and the composition calculus are given. Different quantisation schemes are discussed with respect to the results.</description>

      <title>On products and partial isometry of Toeplitz operators with operator-valued symbols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We solve the following problems associated with Toeplitz operators $T_{\Phi}$ on Hilbert space-valued Hardy spaces $H_{\mathcal{E}}^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$ over the unit polydisc $\mathbb{D}^n$. $(I)$ Given operator-valued bounded analytic functions $\Gamma, \Psi$ on $\mathbb{D}^n$, we completely characterize when the product $M_{\Gamma}M_{\Psi}^*$ becomes a Toeplitz operator by identifying tractable conditions on the functions. Furthermore, these conditions can be used to explicitly write the product into a sum of simple Toeplitz operators. $(II)$ We prove that partially isometric Toeplitz operators admit the following factorization: \[ T_{\Phi} = M_{\Gamma} M_{\Psi}^*, \] where, $\Gamma, \Psi$ are operator-valued inner functions on $\mathbb{D}^n$. A few of the immediate consequences are: $(a)$ every partially isometric Toeplitz operator has a partially isometric symbol almost everywhere on $\mathbb{T}^n$ (distinguished boundary of $\mathbb{D}^n$), $(b)$ any partially isometric analytic Toeplitz operator is of the form $M_{\Gamma V^*}$, where $\Gamma$ is an operator-valued inner function and $V$ is an constant isometry. In connection with the result $(ii)$, we establish and use a crucial phenomenon: the range of partially isometric Toeplitz operators is always a Beurling-type invariant subspace of $H_{\mathcal{E}}^2(\mathbb{D}^n)$. Our results are new even in the case of Hardy spaces over the unit disc and extend the work of Brown--Douglas, Deepak--Pradhan--Sarkar on scalar-valued spaces.</description>

      <title>A Characterization of Borel Measures which Induce Lipschitz-Free Space Elements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13319v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We will solve a problem by Aliaga about Lipschitz-Free spaces (denoted by $\mathcal F(M)$): $$\text{Does every Borel measure $\mu$ on a complete metric space $M$ such that $\int d(m,0) d |\mu|(m)&lt; \infty$ induce a weak$^*$ continuous functional $\mathcal L\mu \in \mathcal F(M)$ by the mapping $\mathcal L\mu(f)=\int f d \mu$ ? }$$ In particular, we will show a characterization of the measures such that $\mathcal L\mu \in \mathcal F(M)$, which indeed implies inner-regularity for complete metric spaces, and we will prove that every Borel measure on $M$ induces an element of $\mathcal F(M)$ if and only if the weight of $M$ is strictly less than the least real-valued measurable cardinal, and thus the existence of a metric space on which there is a measure $\mu$ such that $\mathcal L\mu \in \mathcal F(M)^{**} \setminus \mathcal F(M)$ cannot be proven in ZFC.</description>

      <title>Geometric Banach property (T) for metric spaces via Banach representations of Roe algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a notion of geometric Banach property (T) for metric spaces, which jointly generalizes Banach property (T) for groups and geometric property (T) for metric spaces. Our framework is achieved by Banach representations of Roe algebras of metric spaces. We show that geometric Banach property (T) is a coarse geometric invariant, and it is equivalent to the existence of the Kazhdan projections in the Banach-Roe algebras. Further, we study the implications of this property for sequences of finite Cayley graphs, establishing two key results: 1. geometric Banach property (T) of such sequences implies Banach property (T) for their limit groups; 2. while the Banach coarse fixed point property implies geometric Banach property (T), the converse fails. Additionally, we provide a geometric characterization of V. Lafforgue's strong Banach property (T) for a residually finite group in terms of geometric Banach property (T) of its box spaces.</description>

      <title>Characterization of bi-parametric potentials and rate of convergence of truncated hypersingular integrals in the Dunkl setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15748v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the $\beta$-semigroup for $\beta &gt; 0$, which unifies and extends the classical Poisson (for $\beta=1$) and heat (for $\beta=2$) semigroups within the Dunkl analysis framework. Leveraging this semigroup, we derive an explicit representation for the inverse of the Dunkl-Riesz potential and characterize the image of the function space $L_k^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ for $1 \leq p &lt; \frac{n + 2\gamma}{\alpha}$. We further define the bi-parametric potential of order $\alpha$ by $$\mathfrak{S}_k^{(\alpha,\beta)} = \left(I + (-\Delta_k)^{\beta/2}\right)^{-\alpha/\beta}$$ and establish its inverse along with a detailed description of the associated range space. Our approach employs a wavelet-based method that represents the inverse as the limit of truncated hypersingular integrals parameterized by $\epsilon &gt; 0$. To analyze the convergence of these approximations, we introduce the concept of $\eta$-smoothness at a point $x_0$ in the Dunkl setting. We show that if a function $f \in L_k^p(\mathbb{R}^n) \cap L_k^2(\mathbb{R}^n)$, for $1 \leq p \leq \infty$, possesses $\eta$-smoothness at $x_0$, then the truncated hypersingular approximations converge to $f(x_0)$ as $\epsilon \to 0^+$.</description>

      <title>The Laplace and Leray transforms on some (weakly) convex domains in $\mathbb{C}^2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The space of Laplace transforms of holomorphic Hardy-space functions have been characterized as weighted Bergman spaces of entire functions in two cases: that of planar convex domains (Lutsenko--Yumulmukhametov, 1991), and that of strongly convex domains in higher dimensions (Lindholm, 2002). In this paper, we establish such a Paley--Weiner result for a class of (weakly) convex Reinhardt domains in $\mathbb{C}^2$ that are well-modelled by the so-called egg domains. We consider Hardy spaces on these domains with respect to a canonical choice of boundary Monge--Ampere measure. This class of domains was introduced by Barrett--Lanzani (2009) to study the $L^2$-boundedness of the Leray transform in the absence of either strongly convexity or $\mathcal{C}^2$-regularity. The boundedness of the Leray transform plays a crucial role in understanding the image of the Laplace transform. As a supplementary result, we expand the known class of convex Reinhardt domains for which the Leray transform is $L^2$-bounded (with respect to the aforementioned choice of boundary measure). Finally, we also produce an example to show that the Lutsenko--Yumulmukhametov result cannot be expected to generalize to all convex domains in higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Szeg\"o limit theorem for a class of Toeplitz operators on the Bergman space of the unit ball with singular symbols</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20657v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We obtain a Szeg\"o limit theorem for a family of Toeplitz operators defined on the weighted Bergman space of the unit ball $\mathbb{B}_{n}$. The symbols of these operators are supported on some isotropic or co-isotropic submanifold $\Gamma \subseteq \mathbb{B}_{n}$ and can be seen, in general, as measures that are singular with respect to the Lebesgue measure on $\mathbb{C}^{n}$. The given theorem allows to describe the asymptotic behavior of these operators as the parameter of the weighted Bergman space tends to infinity.</description>
