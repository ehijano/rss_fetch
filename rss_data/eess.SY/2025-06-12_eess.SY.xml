      <title>Formalizing Neuromorphic Control Systems: A General Proposal and A Rhythmic Case Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neuromorphic control is receiving growing attention due to the multifaceted advantages it brings over more classical control approaches, including: sparse and on-demand sensing, information transmission, and actuation; energy-efficient designs and realizations in neuromorphic hardware; event-based signal processing and control signal computation. However, a general control-theoretical formalization of what "neuromorphic control systems" are and how we can rigorously analyze, design, and control them is still largely missing. In this note, we suggest a possible path toward formalizing neuromorphic control systems. We apply the proposed framework to a rhythmic control case study and rigorously show how it has the potential to make neuromorphic control systems analysis and design amenable to mature control theoretical approaches like describing function analysis and harmonic balance, fast-slow analysis, discrete and hybrid systems, and robust optimization.</description>

      <title>Model Predictive Control-Based Optimal Energy Management of Autonomous Electric Vehicles Under Cold Temperatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In autonomous electric vehicles (AEVs), battery energy must be judiciously allocated to satisfy primary propulsion demands and secondary auxiliary demands, particularly the Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) system. This becomes especially critical when the battery is in a low state of charge under cold ambient conditions, and cabin heating and battery preconditioning (prior to actual charging) can consume a significant percentage of available energy, directly impacting the driving range. In such cases, one usually prioritizes propulsion or applies heuristic rules for thermal management, often resulting in suboptimal energy utilization. There is a pressing need for a principled approach that can dynamically allocate battery power in a way that balances thermal comfort, battery health and preconditioning, along with range preservation. This paper attempts to address this issue using real-time Model Predictive Control to optimize the power consumption between the propulsion, HVAC, and battery temperature preparation so that it can be charged immediately once the destination is reached.</description>

      <title>Energy Aware Camera Location Search Algorithm for Increasing Precision of Observation in Automated Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10251</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10251v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Visual servoing technology has been well developed and applied in many automated manufacturing tasks, especially in tools' pose alignment. To access a full global view of tools, most applications adopt eye-to-hand configuration or eye-to-hand/eye-in-hand cooperation configuration in an automated manufacturing environment. Most research papers mainly put efforts into developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few of them have discussed the importance of the camera's location in eye-to-hand configuration. In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image shot at different locations. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches for the optimal location where the images' noise level is minimized. Also, this algorithm ensures the camera ends up at a suboptimal (if the optimal one is unreachable) location among the locations already searched, with limited energy available for moving the camera. Unlike a simple brute force approach, the algorithm enables the camera to explore space more efficiently by adapting the search policy from learning the environment. With the aid of an image averaging technique, this algorithm, in use of a solo camera, achieves the observation accuracy in eye-to-hand configurations to a desirable extent without filtering out high-frequency information in the original image. An automated manufacturing application has been simulated and the results show the success of this algorithm's improvement of observation precision with limited energy.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Stable Optimal Control for Infinite-Time Nonlinear Regulation Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infinite-time nonlinear optimal regulation control is widely utilized in aerospace engineering as a systematic method for synthesizing stable controllers. However, conventional methods often rely on linearization hypothesis, while recent learning-based approaches rarely consider stability guarantees. This paper proposes a learning-based framework to learn a stable optimal controller for nonlinear optimal regulation problems. First, leveraging the equivalence between Pontryagin Maximum Principle (PMP) and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, we improve the backward generation of optimal examples (BGOE) method for infinite-time optimal regulation problems. A state-transition-matrix-guided data generation method is then proposed to efficiently generate a complete dataset that covers the desired state space. Finally, we incorporate the Lyapunov stability condition into the learning framework, ensuring the stability of the learned optimal policy by jointly learning the optimal value function and control policy. Simulations on three nonlinear optimal regulation problems show that the learned optimal policy achieves near-optimal regulation control and the code is provided at https://github.com/wong-han/PaperNORC</description>

      <title>Synthesizing Min-Max Control Barrier Functions For Switched Affine Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10296v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of synthesizing non-smooth control barrier functions (CBFs) for continuous-time switched affine systems. Switched affine systems are defined by a set of affine dynamical modes, wherein the control consists of a state-based switching signal that determines the current operating mode. The control barrier functions seek to maintain the system state inside a control invariant set that excludes a given set of unsafe states. We consider CBFs that take the form of pointwise minima and maxima over a finite set of affine functions. Our approach uses ideas from nonsmooth analysis to formulate conditions for min- and max- affine control barrier functions. We show how a feedback switching law can be extracted from a given CBF. Next, we show how to automate the process of synthesizing CBFs given a system description through a tree-search algorithm inspired by branch-and-cut methods from combinatorial optimization. Finally, we demonstrate our approach on a series of interesting examples of switched affine systems.</description>

      <title>Semi-Tensor-Product Based Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The semi-tensor product (STP) of vectors is a generalization of conventional inner product of vectors, which allows the factor vectors to of different dimensions. This paper proposes a domain-based convolutional product (CP). Combining domain-based CP with STP of vectors, a new CP is proposed. Since there is no zero or any other padding, it can avoid the junk information caused by padding. Using it, the STP-based convolutional neural network (CNN) is developed. Its application to image and third order signal identifications is considered.</description>

      <title>Predictive control of wastewater treatment plants as energy-autonomous water resource recovery facilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work proposes an automatic control solution for the operation of conventional wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) as energy-autonomous water resource recovery facilities. We first conceptualize a classification of the quality of treated water for three resource recovery applications (environmental, industrial, and agricultural water reuse). We then present an output-feedback model predictive controller (Output MPC) that operates a plant to produce water of specific quality class, while also producing sufficient biogas to ensure nonpositive energy costs. The controller is demonstrated in the long-term operation of a full-scale WWTP subjected to typical influent loads and periodically changing quality targets. Our results provide a proof-of-concept on the energy-autonomous operation of existing wastewater treatment infrastructure with control strategies that are general enough to accommodate a wide range of resource recovery objectives.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the performance of a V2X-enhanced braking system in real-world crash situations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10535v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By using an automated braking system, such as the Automatic Emergency Brake (AEB), crashes can be avoided in situations where the driver is unaware of an imminent collision. However, conventional AEB systems detect potential collision adversaries with onboard sensor systems, such as radars and cameras, that may fail in non-line-of-sight situations. By leveraging vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, information regarding an approaching vehicle can be received by the ego vehicle at an early point in time, even if the opponent vehicle is occluded by a view obstruction. In this work, we consider a 2-stage braking cascade, consisting of a partial brake, triggered based on V2X information, and a sensor-triggered AEB. We evaluate its crash avoidance performance in real-world crash situations extracted from the German In-Depth Accident Study (GIDAS) database using an accident simulation framework. The results are compared against a sensor-triggered AEB system and a purely V2X-triggered partial brake. To further analyze the results, we identify the crash cause for each situation in which the brake function under test could not prevent the crash. The simulation results show a high added benefit of the V2X-enhanced braking systems compared to the exclusive use of visual-based sensor systems for automated collision prevention.</description>

      <title>Joint System Modeling Approach for Fault Simulation of Start-er/Generator and Gas Generator in All-Electric APU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a joint system modeling approach for fault simulation of all-electric auxiliary power unit (APU), integrating starter/generator turn-to-turn short circuit (TTSC) faults with gas generator gas-path faults.To address challenges in electromechanical coupling, simulation precision and computational efficiency balance, we propose a multi-rate continuous-discrete hybrid simulation architecture. This architecture treats the starter/generator as a continuous system with variable step size in Simulink, while modeling the gas generator as a discrete system with fixed step size in a dynamic-link library (DLL) environment. For the starter/generator fault modeling, a multi-loop approach is deployed to accurately simulate TTSC faults. For the gas generator, we develop an improved GasTurb-DLL modeling method (IGDM) that enhances uncertainty modeling, state-space representation, and tool chain compatibility. Finally, the proposed methodology above was implemented in a case study based on the APS5000 all-electric APU structure and parameters. Model validation was conducted by comparing simulation results--covering steady-state, transients, healthy, and fault conditions--with reference data from third-party software and literature. The close agreement confirms both the model's accuracy and the effectiveness of our modeling methodology. This work establishes a modeling foundation for investigating the opportunities and challenges in fault detection and isolation (FDI) brought by the all electrification of the APU, including joint fault estimation and diagnosis, coupled electromechanical fault characteristics.</description>

      <title>Transient performance of MPC for tracking without terminal constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) for tracking is a recently introduced approach, which extends standard MPC formulations by incorporating an artificial reference as an additional optimization variable, in order to track external and potentially time-varying references. In this work, we analyze the performance of such an MPC for tracking scheme without a terminal cost and terminal constraints. We derive a transient performance estimate, i.e. a bound on the closed-loop performance over an arbitrary time interval, yielding insights on how to select the scheme's parameters for performance. Furthermore, we show that in the asymptotic case, where the prediction horizon and observed time interval tend to infinity, the closed-loop solution of MPC for tracking recovers the infinite horizon optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Sampling-Based Planning Under STL Specifications: A Forward Invariance Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a variant of the Rapidly Exploring Random Tree Star (RRT$^{\star}$) algorithm to synthesize trajectories satisfying a given spatio-temporal specification expressed in a fragment of Signal Temporal Logic (STL) for linear systems. Previous approaches for planning trajectories under STL specifications using sampling-based methods leverage either mixed-integer or non-smooth optimization techniques, with poor scalability in the horizon and complexity of the task. We adopt instead a control-theoretic perspective on the problem, based on the notion of set forward invariance. Specifically, from a given STL task defined over polyhedral predicates, we develop a novel algorithmic framework by which the task is efficiently encoded into a time-varying set via linear programming, such that trajectories evolving within the set also satisfy the task. Forward invariance properties of the resulting set with respect to the system dynamics and input limitations are then proved via non-smooth analysis. We then present a modified RRT$^{\star}$ algorithm to synthesize asymptotically optimal and dynamically feasible trajectories satisfying a given STL specification, by sampling a tree of trajectories within the previously constructed time-varying set. We showcase two use cases of our approach involving an autonomous inspection of the International Space Station and room-servicing task requiring timed revisit of a charging station.</description>

      <title>Joint Beamforming with Extremely Large Scale RIS: A Sequential Multi-Agent A2C Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is a challenging problem to jointly optimize the base station (BS) precoding matrix and the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) phases simultaneously in a RIS-assisted multiple-user multiple-input-multiple-output (MU-MIMO) scenario when the size of the RIS becomes extremely large. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning algorithm called sequential multi-agent advantage actor-critic (A2C) to solve this problem. In addition, the discrete phase of RISs, imperfect channel state information (CSI), and channel correlations between users are taken into consideration. The computational complexity is also analyzed, and the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with the zero-forcing (ZF) beamformer in terms of the sum spectral efficiency (SE). It is noted that the computational complexity of the proposed algorithm is lower than the benchmark, while the performance is better than the benchmark. Throughout simulations, it is also found that the proposed algorithm is robust to medium channel estimation error.</description>

      <title>A Robust Optimization Framework for Flexible Industrial Energy Scheduling: Application to a Cement Plant with Market Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a scenario based robust optimization framework for short term energy scheduling in electricity intensive industrial plants, explicitly addressing uncertainty in planning decisions. The model is formulated as a two-stage Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP) and integrates a hybrid scenario generation method capable of representing uncertain inputs such as electricity prices, renewable generation, and internal demand. A convex objective function combining expected and worst case operational costs allows for tunable risk aversion, enabling planners to balance economic performance and robustness. The resulting schedule ensures feasibility across all scenarios and supports coordinated use of industrial flexibility assets, including battery energy storage and shiftable production. To isolate the effects of market volatility, the framework is applied to a real world cement manufacturing case study considering only day-ahead electricity price uncertainty, with all other inputs treated deterministically. Results show improved resilience to forecast deviations, reduced cost variability, and more consistent operations. The proposed method offers a scalable and risk-aware approach for industrial flexibility planning under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>General Reference Frame Identification and Transformation in Unbalanced Power Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various domains such as power system stability analysis, electric machine modeling, and control of power electronic converters have significantly benefited from the application of coordinate transformations. One of the main benefits is the dimensional reduction, which reduces the complexity of the problems. This paper introduces a novel general transformation based on a geometric framework that directly identifies the plane containing the locus for unbalanced quantities through bivector analysis using Geometric Algebra. The proposed method provides a direct transformation valid for any degree of unbalance in $n$-phase, $(n+1)$-wire sinusoidal systems. The transformation requires only two measurements (voltage or current) taken at different time instants, making it computationally efficient. Moreover, we demonstrate through pure geometric reasoning that our approach is general and encompasses other techniques, such as the classical Clarke transformation. Numerical simulations and experimental validation using a real-time digital simulator and a physical laboratory setup demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. This generalization to multi-dimensional systems, combined with the reduced measurement requirements, represents a significant advancement over existing approaches that are typically restricted to three-phase applications or suffer from computational limitations.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Model Reduction by Moment Matching for Linear and Nonlinear Parametric Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theory and methods to obtain parametric reduced-order models by moment matching are presented. The definition of the parametric moment is introduced, and methods (model-based and data-driven) for the approximation of the parametric moment of linear and nonlinear parametric systems are proposed. These approximations are exploited to construct families of parametric reduced-order models that match the approximate parametric moment of the system to be reduced and preserve key system properties such as asymptotic stability and dissipativity. The use of the model reduction methods is illustrated by means of a parametric benchmark model for the linear case and a large-scale wind farm model for the nonlinear case. In the illustration, a comparison of the proposed approximation methods is drawn and their advantages/disadvantages are discussed.</description>

      <title>Impacts between multibody systems and deformable structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisions and impacts are the principal reasons for impulsive motions, which we frequently see in dynamic responses of systems. Precise modelling of impacts is a challenging problem due to the lack of the accurate and commonly accepted constitutive law that governs their mechanics. Rigid-body approach and soft contact methods are discussed in this paper and examined in the presented numerical examples. The main focus is set to impacts in systems with multiple unilateral contacts and collisions with elastic elements of the reference. Parameters of interconnecting unilateral springs are under discussion.</description>

      <title>Data-driven balanced truncation for second-order systems with generalized proportional damping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Structured reduced-order modeling is a central component in the computer-aided design of control systems in which cheap-to-evaluate low-dimensional models with physically meaningful internal structures are computed. In this work, we develop a new approach for the structured data-driven surrogate modeling of linear dynamical systems described by second-order time derivatives via balanced truncation model-order reduction. The proposed method is a data-driven reformulation of position-velocity balanced truncation for second-order systems and generalizes the quadrature-based balanced truncation for unstructured first-order systems to the second-order case. The computed surrogates encode a generalized proportional damping structure, and the damping coefficients are inferred solely from data by minimizing a least-squares error over the coefficients. Several numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep off-policy actor-critic algorithms have emerged as the leading framework for reinforcement learning in continuous control domains. However, most of these algorithms suffer from poor sample efficiency, especially in environments with sparse rewards. In this paper, we take a step towards addressing this issue by providing a principled directed exploration strategy. We propose Wasserstein Barycenter Soft Actor-Critic (WBSAC) algorithm, which benefits from a pessimistic actor for temporal difference learning and an optimistic actor to promote exploration. This is achieved by using the Wasserstein barycenter of the pessimistic and optimistic policies as the exploration policy and adjusting the degree of exploration throughout the learning process. We compare WBSAC with state-of-the-art off-policy actor-critic algorithms and show that WBSAC is more sample-efficient on MuJoCo continuous control tasks.</description>

      <title>Innovative Adaptive Imaged Based Visual Servoing Control of 6 DoFs Industrial Robot Manipulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Image-based visual servoing (IBVS) methods have been well developed and used in many applications, especially in pose (position and orientation) alignment. However, most research papers focused on developing control solutions when 3D point features can be detected inside the field of view. This work proposes an innovative feedforward-feedback adaptive control algorithm structure with the Youla Parameterization method. A designed feature estimation loop ensures stable and fast motion control when point features are outside the field of view. As 3D point features move inside the field of view, the IBVS feedback loop preserves the precision of the pose at the end of the control period. Also, an adaptive controller is developed in the feedback loop to stabilize the system in the entire range of operations. The nonlinear camera and robot manipulator model is linearized and decoupled online by an adaptive algorithm. The adaptive controller is then computed based on the linearized model evaluated at current linearized point. The proposed solution is robust and easy to implement in different industrial robotic systems. Various scenarios are used in simulations to validate the effectiveness and robust performance of the proposed controller.</description>

      <title>Optimal Voltage Control Using Online Exponential Barrier Method</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper address the optimal voltage control problem of distribution systems with high penetration of inverter-based renewable energy resources, under inaccurate model information. We propose the online exponential barrier method that explicitly leverages the online feedback from grids to enhance the robustness to model inaccuracy and incorporates the voltage constraints to maintain the safety requirements. We provide analytical results on the optimal barrier parameter selection and sufficient conditions for the safety guarantee of converged voltages. We also establish theoretical results on the exponential convergence rate with proper step-size. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated on a 56-bus radial network, where we significantly improve the robustness against model inaccuracy compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>A Novel Feedforward Youla Parameterization Method for Avoiding Local Minima in Stereo Image Based Visual Servoing Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In robot navigation and manipulation, accurately determining the camera's pose relative to the environment is crucial for effective task execution. In this paper, we systematically prove that this problem corresponds to the Perspective-3-Point (P3P) formulation, where exactly three known 3D points and their corresponding 2D image projections are used to estimate the pose of a stereo camera. In image-based visual servoing (IBVS) control, the system becomes overdetermined, as the 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) of the stereo camera must align with 9 observed 2D features in the scene. When more constraints are imposed than available DoFs, global stability cannot be guaranteed, as the camera may become trapped in a local minimum far from the desired configuration during servoing. To address this issue, we propose a novel control strategy for accurately positioning a calibrated stereo camera. Our approach integrates a feedforward controller with a Youla parameterization-based feedback controller, ensuring robust servoing performance. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our method effectively avoids local minima and enables the camera to reach the desired pose accurately and efficiently.</description>

      <title>Learning Safe Control via On-the-Fly Bandit Exploration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Control tasks with safety requirements under high levels of model uncertainty are increasingly common. Machine learning techniques are frequently used to address such tasks, typically by leveraging model error bounds to specify robust constraint-based safety filters. However, if the learned model uncertainty is very high, the corresponding filters are potentially invalid, meaning no control input satisfies the constraints imposed by the safety filter. While most works address this issue by assuming some form of safe backup controller, ours tackles it by collecting additional data on the fly using a Gaussian process bandit-type algorithm. We combine a control barrier function with a learned model to specify a robust certificate that ensures safety if feasible. Whenever infeasibility occurs, we leverage the control barrier function to guide exploration, ensuring the collected data contributes toward the closed-loop system safety. By combining a safety filter with exploration in this manner, our method provably achieves safety in a setting that allows for a zero-mean prior dynamics model, without requiring a backup controller. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first safe learning-based control method that achieves this.</description>

      <title>RICE: Reactive Interaction Controller for Cluttered Canopy Environment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Robotic navigation in dense, cluttered environments such as agricultural canopies presents significant challenges due to physical and visual occlusion caused by leaves and branches. Traditional vision-based or model-dependent approaches often fail in these settings, where physical interaction without damaging foliage and branches is necessary to reach a target. We present a novel reactive controller that enables safe navigation for a robotic arm in a contact-rich, cluttered, deformable environment using end-effector position and real-time tactile feedback. Our proposed framework's interaction strategy is based on a trade-off between minimizing disturbance by maneuvering around obstacles and pushing through them to move towards the target. We show that over 35 trials in 3 experimental plant setups with an occluded target, the proposed controller successfully reached the target in all trials without breaking any branch and outperformed the state-of-the-art model-free controller in robustness and adaptability. This work lays the foundation for safe, adaptive interaction in cluttered, contact-rich deformable environments, enabling future agricultural tasks such as pruning and harvesting in plant canopies.</description>

      <title>System Identification Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks: A Case Study on Buck Converters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) are emerging as a powerful framework for interpretable and efficient system identification in dynamic systems. By leveraging the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, KANs enable function approximation through learnable activation functions, offering improved scalability, accuracy, and interpretability compared to traditional neural networks. This paper investigates the application of KANs to model and analyze the dynamics of a buck converter system, focusing on state-space parameter estimation along with discovering the system equations. Using simulation data, the methodology involves approximating state derivatives with KANs, constructing interpretable state-space representations, and validating these models through numerical experiments. The results demonstrate the ability of KANs to accurately identify system dynamics, verify model consistency, and detect parameter changes, providing valuable insights into their applicability for system identification in modern industrial systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: AutomationML (AML) enables standardized data exchange in engineering, yet existing recommendations for proper AML modeling are typically formulated as informal and textual constraints. These constraints cannot be validated automatically within AML itself. This work-in-progress paper introduces a pipeline to formalize and verify such constraints. First, AML models are mapped to OWL ontologies via RML and SPARQL. In addition, a Large Language Model translates textual rules into SHACL constraints, which are then validated against the previously generated AML ontology. Finally, SHACL validation results are automatically interpreted in natural language. The approach is demonstrated on a sample AML recommendation. Results show that even complex modeling rules can be semi-automatically checked -- without requiring users to understand formal methods or ontology technologies.</description>

      <title>Towards Sustainable Computing: Exploring Energy Consumption Efficiency of Alternative Configurations and Workloads in an Open Source Messaging System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Energy consumption in current large scale computing infrastructures is becoming a critical issue, especially with the growing demand for centralized systems such as cloud environments. With the advancement of microservice architectures and the Internet of Things, messaging systems have become an integral and mainstream part of modern computing infrastructures, carrying out significant workload in a majority of applications. In this paper, we describe an experimental process to explore energy-based benchmarking for RabbitMQ, one of the main open source messaging frameworks. The involved system is described, as well as required components, and setup scenarios, involving different workloads and configurations among the tests as well as messaging system use cases. Alternative architectures are investigated and compared from an energy consumption point of view, for different message rates and consumer numbers. Differences in architectural selection have been quantified and can lead to up to 31\% reduction in power consumption. The resulting dataset is made publicly available and can thus prove helpful for architectures' comparison, energy-based cost modeling, and beyond.</description>

      <title>Higher-Order Uncoupled Learning Dynamics and Nash Equilibrium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study learnability of mixed-strategy Nash Equilibrium (NE) in general finite games using higher-order replicator dynamics as well as classes of higher-order uncoupled heterogeneous dynamics. In higher-order uncoupled learning dynamics, players have no access to utilities of opponents (uncoupled) but are allowed to use auxiliary states to further process information (higher-order). We establish a link between uncoupled learning and feedback stabilization with decentralized control. Using this association, we show that for any finite game with an isolated completely mixed-strategy NE, there exist higher-order uncoupled learning dynamics that lead (locally) to that NE. We further establish the lack of universality of learning dynamics by linking learning to the control theoretic concept of simultaneous stabilization. We construct two games such that any higher-order dynamics that learn the completely mixed-strategy NE of one of these games can never learn the completely mixed-strategy NE of the other. Next, motivated by imposing natural restrictions on allowable learning dynamics, we introduce the Asymptotic Best Response (ABR) property. Dynamics with the ABR property asymptotically learn a best response in environments that are asymptotically stationary. We show that the ABR property relates to an internal stability condition on higher-order learning dynamics. We provide conditions under which NE are compatible with the ABR property. Finally, we address learnability of mixed-strategy NE in the bandit setting using a bandit version of higher-order replicator dynamics.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Beyond 5G and 6G Connectivity: Leveraging NTN and RIS Synergies for Optimized Coverage and Capacity in High-Density Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing demand for reliable, high-capacity communication during large-scale outdoor events poses significant challenges for traditional Terrestrial Networks (TNs), which often struggle to provide consistent coverage in high-density environments. This paper presents a novel 6G radio network planning framework that integrates Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) with Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) to deliver ubiquitous coverage and enhanced network capacity. Our framework overcomes the limitations of conventional deployable base stations by leveraging NTN architectures, including Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites and passive RIS platforms seamlessly integrated with Beyond 5G (B5G) TNs. By incorporating advanced B5G technologies such as Massive Multiple Input Multiple Output (mMIMO) and beamforming, and by optimizing spectrum utilization across the C, S, and Ka bands, we implement a rigorous interference management strategy based on a dynamic SINR model. Comprehensive calculations and simulations validate the proposed framework, demonstrating significant improvements in connectivity, reliability, and cost-efficiency in crowded scenarios. This integration strategy represents a promising solution for meeting the evolving demands of future 6G networks.</description>

      <title>Agentic Semantic Control for Autonomous Wireless Space Networks: Extending Space-O-RAN with MCP-Driven Distributed Intelligence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.10925v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lunar surface operations impose stringent requirements on wireless communication systems, including autonomy, robustness to disruption, and the ability to adapt to environmental and mission-driven context. While Space-O-RAN provides a distributed orchestration model aligned with 3GPP standards, its decision logic is limited to static policies and lacks semantic integration. We propose a novel extension incorporating a semantic agentic layer enabled by the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Agent-to-Agent (A2A) communication protocols, allowing context-aware decision making across real-time, near-real-time, and non-real-time control layers. Distributed cognitive agents deployed in rovers, landers, and lunar base stations implement wireless-aware coordination strategies, including delay-adaptive reasoning and bandwidth-aware semantic compression, while interacting with multiple MCP servers to reason over telemetry, locomotion planning, and mission constraints.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Hybrid Approach to Decentralized Networked Control: Stochastic Network Delays and Poisson Pulsing Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.14750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By designing the decentralized time-regularized (Zeno-free) event-triggered strategies for the state-feedback control law, this paper considers the stochastic stabilization of a class of networked control systems, where two sources of randomness exist in multiple decentralized networks that operate asynchronously and independently: the communication channels are constrained by the stochastic network delays and also by Poisson pulsing denial-of-service (Pp-DoS) attacks. The time delay in the network denotes the length from a transmission instant to the corresponding update instant, and is supposed to be a continuous random variable subject to certain continuous probability distribution; while the attacks' cardinal number is a discrete random variable supposed to be subject to Poisson distribution, so the inter-attack time, i.e., the time between two consecutive attack instants, is subject to exponential distribution. The considered system is modeled as a stochastic hybrid formalism, where the randomness enters through the jump map into the reset value (the inter-attack time directly related) of each triggered strategy. By only sampling/transmitting state measurements when needed and simultaneously by taking the specific medium access protocols into account, the designed event-triggered strategies are synthesized in a state-based and decentralized form, which are robust (tolerable well) to stochastic network delays, under different tradeoff-conditions between the minimum inter-event times, maximum allowable delays (i.e., potentially tolerable delays) and the frequencies of attacks. Using stochastic hybrid tools to combine attack-active parts with attack-over parts, the designed triggered strategies, if designed well according to the actual system needs, can tolerate (be resilient to) the Pp-DoS attacks and stochastic network delays without jeopardizing the stability and Zeno-freeness.</description>

      <title>Quasiperiodic Disturbance Observer for Wideband Harmonic Suppression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00362v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Periodic disturbances composed of harmonics typically occur during periodic operations, impairing performance of mechanical and electrical systems. To improve the performance, control of periodic-disturbance suppression has been studied, such as repetitive control and periodic-disturbance observers. However, actual periodic disturbances are typically quasiperiodic owing to perturbations in each cycle, identification errors of the period, variations in the period, and/or aperiodic disturbances. For robustness against quasiperiodicity, although wideband harmonic suppression is expected, conventional methods have trade-offs among harmonic suppression bandwidth, amplification of aperiodic disturbances, and deviation of harmonic suppression frequencies. This paper proposes a quasiperiodic disturbance observer to compensate for quasiperiodic disturbances while simultaneously achieving the wideband harmonic suppression, non-amplification of aperiodic disturbances, and proper harmonic suppression frequencies. A quasiperiodic disturbance is defined as comprising harmonics and surrounding signals. On the basis of this definition, the quasiperiodic disturbance observer is designed using a periodic-pass filter of a first-order periodic/aperiodic separation filter for its Q-filter, time delay integrated with a zero-phase low-pass filter, and an inverse plant model with a first-order low-pass filter. The periodic-pass filter achieves the wideband harmonic suppression while the zero-phase and first-order low-pass filters prevent the amplification of aperiodic disturbances and deviation of harmonic suppression frequencies. For the implementation, the Q-filter is discretized by an exact mapping of the s-plane to the z-plane, and the inverse plant model is discretized by the backward Euler method.</description>

      <title>Constraint-Driven Multi-USV Coverage Path Generation for Aquatic Environmental Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00579v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we address aquatic environmental monitoring using a fleet of unmanned surface vehicles (USVs). Specifically, we develop an online path generator that provides either circular or elliptic paths based on the real-time feedback so that the USVs efficiently sample the sensor data over given aquatic environment. To this end, we begin by formulating a novel online path generation problem for a group of Dubins vehicles in the form of cost minimization based on the formulation of persistent coverage control. We then transform the cost minimization into a constraint-based specification so that a prescribed performance level is certified. An online coverage path generator is then designed based on the so-called constraint-based control in order to meet the performance certificate together with additional constraints inherent in the parameters that specify the paths. It is also shown there that the present constraint-based approach allows one to drastically reduce the computational complexity stemming from combinations of binary variables corresponding to the turning directions of the USVs. The present coverage path generator is finally demonstrated through simulations and experiments on an original testbed of multiple USVs.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based Approach for Fast Optimal Control of a Stefan Problem with Application to Cell Therapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.18272</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.18272v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article describes a new, efficient way of finding control and state trajectories in optimal control problems by reformulation as a system of differential-algebraic equations (DAEs). The optimal control and state vectors can be obtained via simulation of the resulting DAE system with the selected DAE solver, eliminating the need for an optimization solver. Our simulation-based approach is demonstrated and benchmarked against various optimization-based algorithms via four case studies associated with the optimization and control of a Stefan problem for cell therapy. The simulation-based approach is faster than every optimization-based method by more than an order of magnitude while giving similar/better accuracy in all cases. The solution obtained from the simulation-based approach is guaranteed to be optimal provided that at least one constraint or algebraic equation resulting from the reformulation remains active at all times. The proposed technique offers an efficient and reliable framework for optimal control, serving as a promising alternative to the traditional techniques in applications where speed is crucial, e.g., real-time online model predictive control.</description>

      <title>Battery State of Health Estimation and Incremental Capacity Analysis under General Charging Profiles Using Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19586v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Incremental capacity analysis (ICA) and differential voltage analysis (DVA) are two effective approaches for battery degradation monitoring. One limiting factor for their real-world application is that they require constant-current charging profiles. This research removes this limitation and proposes an approach that enables ICA/DVA-based degradation monitoring under general charging profiles. A novel concept of virtual incremental capacity (VIC) and virtual differential voltage (VDV) is proposed. Then, two related convolutional neural networks (CNNs), called U-Net and Conv-Net, are proposed to construct VIC/VDV curves and estimate the state of health (SOH) from general charging profiles across any state-of-charge (SOC) ranges that satisfy some constraints. Finally, for onboard implementations, two CNNs called Mobile U-Net and Mobile-Net are proposed as replacements for the U-Net and Conv-Net, respectively, to reduce the computational footprint and memory requirements. Using an extensive experimental dataset of battery modules, the proposed CNNs are demonstrated to provide accurate VIC/VDV curves and enable ICA/DVA-based battery degradation monitoring under various fast-charging protocols and different SOC ranges.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Rendezvous and Docking Maneuver Control of Satellite using Cross-Feedback Sliding Mode Controller</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01203v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Satellite rendezvous and docking (RvD) maneuvers are essential for satellite servicing and in-orbit assembly. Traditional approaches often treat translational and rotational motions independently, simplifying control design but potentially leading to inefficiencies in maneuver time and fuel consumption. To address these challenges, a novel cross-feedback sliding mode controller has been proposed, developing an interdependent regulation system for translational and rotational motion. This method decouples the relative translational and rotational motion of chaser satellite with respect to target satellite while incorporating cross-feedback mechanisms to account for their inherent coupling. By incorporating rotational state information into translational control laws and vice versa, the approach ensures coordinated adjustments, enhancing maneuver efficiency. The chaser satellite manages both translational and rotational adjustments to rendezvous and dock with the target satellite. The stability of the cross-feedback sliding mode controller is established within the Lyapunov framework, and simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of this strategy.</description>

      <title>A Quadratic Programming Approach to Flight Envelope Protection Using Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ensuring the safe operation of aerospace systems within their prescribed flight envelope is a fundamental requirement for modern flight control systems. Flight envelope protection prevents violations of aerodynamic, structural, and performance constraints, mitigating risks such as stall, excessive loads, and loss of control. Conventional FEP approaches, such as reference clipping via saturation functions and model-based command filtering, impose constraints at the reference input level but often fail to account for closed-loop system dynamics, potentially leading to constraint violations during transients. This paper introduces a new approach to the flight envelope protection problem by employing a quadratic programming-based safety filter using control barrier functions to dynamically enforce flight envelope constraints while preserving control performance. Unlike traditional reference filtering methods, the control barrier function-based safety filter actively ensures strict forward invariance of the safe flight envelope set, integrating seamlessly with existing control architectures. The proposed framework is implemented in a nonlinear missile flight control system and evaluated in a simulated environment. The results demonstrate its ability to prevent constraint violations while minimizing conservatism, offering a robust alternative to existing flight envelope protection methodologies.</description>

      <title>Day-Ahead Bidding Strategies for Wind Farm Operators under a One-Price Balancing Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05153v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study day-ahead bidding strategies for wind farm operators under a one-price balancing scheme, prevalent in European electricity markets. In this setting, the profit-maximising strategy becomes an all-or-nothing strategy, aiming to take advantage of open positions in the balancing market. However, balancing prices are difficult, if not impossible, to forecast in the day-ahead stage and large open positions can affect the balancing price by changing the direction of the system imbalance. This paper addresses day-ahead bidding as a decision-making problem under uncertainty, with the objective of maximising the expected profit while reducing the imbalance risk related to the strategy. To this end, we develop a stochastic optimisation problem with explicit constraints on the positions in the balancing market, providing risk certificates, and derive an analytical solution to this problem. Moreover, we show how the price-impact of the trading strategy on the balancing market can be included in the ex-post evaluation. Using real data from the Belgian electricity market and an offshore wind farm in the North Sea, we demonstrate that the all-or-nothing strategy negatively impacts the balancing price, resulting in long-term losses for the wind farm. Our risk-constrained strategy, however, can still significantly enhance operational profit compared to traditional point-forecast bidding.</description>

      <title>Synergising Hierarchical Data Centers and Power Networks: A Privacy-Preserving Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20575v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the era of digitization, data centers have emerged as integral contributors sustaining our interlinked world, bearing responsibility for an increasing proportion of the world's energy consumption. To facilitate the their fast rollout while progressing towards net-zero energy systems, the synergy of hierarchical data centers (cloud-fog-edge) and power networks can play a pivotal role. However, existing centralized co-dispatch manners encroach on the privacy of different agents within the integrated systems, meanwhile suffering from the combinatorial explosion. In this research, we propose a near-optimal distributed privacy-preserving approach to solve the non-convex synergy (day-ahead co-dispatch) problem. The synergy problem is formulated as a mixed integer quadratically constrained quadratic programming considering both communication and energy conservation, where Lyapunov optimization is introduced to balance operating costs and uncertain communication delays. To mitigate impacts of the highly non-convex nature, the normalized multi-parametric disaggregation technique is leveraged to reformulate the problem into a mixed integer non-linear programming. To further overcome non-smoothness of the reformulated problem, the customized $\ell_1-$surrogate Lagrangian relaxation method with convergence guarantees is proposed to solve the problem in a distributed privacy-preserving manner. The effectiveness, optimality, and scalability of the proposed methodologies for the synergy problem are validated via numerical simulations. Simulation results also indicate that computing tasks can be delayed and migrated within the hierarchical data centers, demonstrating the flexible resource allocation capabilities of the hierarchical data center architecture, further facilitating peak load balancing in the power network.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, low-order models of the frequency and voltage response of mixed-generation, low-inertia systems are presented. These models are unique in their ability to efficiently and accurately model frequency and voltage dynamics without increasing the computational burden as the share of inverters is increased in a system. The models are validated against industry-grade electromagnetic transient simulation, compared to which the proposed models are several orders of magnitude faster. The accuracy and efficiency of the low-inertia frequency and voltage models makes them well suited for a variety of planning and operational studies, especially for multi-scenario and probabilistic studies, as well as for screening studies to establish impact zones based on the dynamic interactions between inverters and synchronous generators.</description>

      <title>EAST: Environment Aware Safe Tracking using Planning and Control Co-Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01363v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of autonomous mobile robot navigation in unknown environments with moving obstacles. We propose a new method to achieve environment-aware safe tracking (EAST) of robot motion plans that integrates an obstacle clearance cost for path planning, a convex reachable set for robot motion prediction, and safety constraints for dynamic obstacle avoidance. EAST adapts the motion of the robot according to the locally sensed environment geometry and dynamics, leading to fast motion in wide open areas and cautious behavior in narrow passages or near moving obstacles. Our control design uses a reference governor, a virtual dynamical system that guides the robot's motion and decouples the path tracking and safety objectives. While reference governor methods have been used for safe tracking control in static environments, our key contribution is an extension to dynamic environments using convex optimization with control barrier function (CBF) constraints. Thus, our work establishes a connection between reference governor techniques and CBF techniques for safe control in dynamic environments. We validate our approach in simulated and real-world environments, featuring complex obstacle configurations and natural dynamic obstacle motion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work proposes a policy learning algorithm for seeking generalised feedback Nash equilibria (GFNE) in $N_P$-player noncooperative dynamic games. We consider linear-quadratic games with stochastic dynamics and design a best-response dynamics in which players update and broadcast a parametrisation of their state-feedback policies. Our approach leverages the System Level Synthesis (SLS) framework to formulate each player's update rule as the solution to a robust optimisation problem. Under certain conditions, rates of convergence to a feedback Nash equilibrium can be established. The algorithm is showcased in exemplary problems ranging from the decentralised control of unstable systems to competition in oligopolistic markets.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven LQR with Finite-Time Experiments via Extremum-Seeking Policy Iteration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02758v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problems through a novel iterative algorithm named EXtremum-seeking Policy iteration LQR (EXP-LQR). The peculiarity of EXP-LQR is that it only needs access to a truncated approximation of the infinite-horizon cost associated to a given policy. Hence, EXP-LQR does not need the direct knowledge of neither the system and cost matrices. In particular, at each iteration, EXP-LQR refines the maintained policy using a truncated LQR cost retrieved by performing finite-time virtual or real experiments in which a perturbed version of the current policy is employed. Such a perturbation is done according to an extremum-seeking mechanism and makes the overall algorithm a time-varying nonlinear system. By using a Lyapunov-based approach exploiting averaging theory, we show that EXP-LQR exponentially converges to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the optimal gain matrix. We corroborate the theoretical results with numerical simulations involving the control of an induction motor.</description>

      <title>A convex variational principle for the necessary conditions of classical optimal control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A scheme for generating a family of convex variational principles is developed, the Euler- Lagrange equations of each member of the family formally corresponding to the necessary conditions of optimal control of a given system of ordinary differential equations (ODE) in a well-defined sense. The scheme is applied to the Quadratic-Quadratic Regulator problem for which an explicit form of the functional is derived, and existence of minimizers of the variational principle is rigorously shown. It is shown that the Linear-Quadratic Regulator problem with time-dependent forcing can be solved within the formalism without requiring any nonlinear considerations, in contrast to the use of a Riccati system in the classical methodology.
  Our work demonstrates a pathway for solving nonlinear control problems via convex optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.08214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There is growing interest in automating surgical tasks using robotic systems, such as endoscopy for treating gastrointestinal (GI) cancer. However, previous studies have primarily focused on detecting and analyzing objects or robots, with limited attention to ensuring safety, which is critical for clinical applications, where accidents can be caused by unsafe robot motions. In this study, we propose a new control framework that can formally ensure the safety of automating the cutting task in endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD), a representative endoscopic surgical method for the treatment of early GI cancer, by using an endoscopic robot. The proposed framework utilizes Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to accurately identify the boundaries of individual tumors, even in close proximity within the GI tract, ensuring precise treatment and removal while preserving the surrounding normal tissue. Additionally, by adopting a model-free control scheme, safety assurance is made possible even in endoscopic robotic systems where dynamic modeling is challenging. We demonstrate the proposed framework in a simulation-based experimental environment, where the tumors to be removed are close to each other, and show that the safety constraints are enforced. We show that the model-free CBF-based controlled robot eliminates one tumor completely without damaging it, while not invading another nearby tumor.</description>

      <title>Solving Power System Problems using Adiabatic Quantum Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06458v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel combinatorial optimization framework that reformulates existing power system problems into a format executable on quantum annealers. The proposed framework accommodates both normal and complex numbers and enables efficient handling of large-scale problems, thus ensuring broad applicability across power system problems. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate its applicability in two classical problems: (i) power system parameter identification, where we estimate the admittance matrix given voltage and current measurements, and (ii) power flow analysis, where we reformulate the nonlinear equations governing active and reactive power balance. The results show that the proposed framework effectively and efficiently solves both linear and nonlinear power system problems, and thus offers significant advantages in scenarios where traditional solvers face challenges, such as ill-conditioned systems and fault conditions.</description>

      <title>Automated Generation of Precedence Graphs in Digital Value Chains for Automotive Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19835v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This study examines the digital value chain in automotive manufacturing, focusing on the identification, software flashing, customization, and commissioning of electronic control units in vehicle networks. A novel precedence graph design is proposed to optimize this process chain using an automated scheduling algorithm, which combines structured data extraction from heterogeneous sources via natural language processing and classification techniques with mixed integer linear programming for efficient graph generation. The results show significant improvements in key metrics. The algorithm reduces the number of production stations equipped with expensive hardware and software to execute digital value chain processes, while also increasing capacity utilization through efficient scheduling and reduced idle time. Task parallelization is optimized, resulting in streamlined workflows and increased throughput. Compared to the traditional scheduling method, the automated approach has reduced preparation time by 50% and reduced scheduling activities, as it now takes two minutes to create the precedence graph. The flexibility of the algorithm's constraints allows for vehicle-specific configurations while maintaining high responsiveness, eliminating backup stations and facilitating the integration of new topologies. Automated scheduling significantly outperforms manual methods in efficiency, functionality, and adaptability.</description>

      <title>Active inference as a unified model of collision avoidance behavior in human drivers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02215v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collision avoidance -- involving a rapid threat detection and quick execution of the appropriate evasive maneuver -- is a critical aspect of driving. However, existing models of human collision avoidance behavior are fragmented, focusing on specific scenarios or only describing certain aspects of the avoidance behavior, such as response times. This paper addresses these gaps by proposing a novel computational cognitive model of human collision avoidance behavior based on active inference. Active inference provides a unified approach to modeling human behavior: the minimization of free energy. Building on prior active inference work, our model incorporates established cognitive mechanisms such as evidence accumulation to simulate human responses in two distinct collision avoidance scenarios: front-to-rear lead vehicle braking and lateral incursion by an oncoming vehicle. We demonstrate that our model explains a wide range of previous empirical findings on human collision avoidance behavior. Specifically, the model closely reproduces both aggregate results from meta-analyses previously reported in the literature and detailed, scenario-specific effects observed in a recent driving simulator study, including response timing, maneuver selection, and execution. Our results highlight the potential of active inference as a unified framework for understanding and modeling human behavior in complex real-life driving tasks.</description>
