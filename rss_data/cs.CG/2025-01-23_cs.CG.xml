      <title>Faster Fr\'echet Distance under Transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of computing the Fr\'echet distance between two polygonal curves under transformations. First, we consider translations in the Euclidean plane. Given two curves $\pi$ and $\sigma$ of total complexity $n$ and a threshold $\delta \geq 0$, we present an $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{7 + \frac{1}{3}})$ time algorithm to determine whether there exists a translation $t \in \mathbb{R}^2$ such that the Fr\'echet distance between $\pi$ and $\sigma + t$ is at most $\delta$. This improves on the previous best result, which is an $\mathcal{O}(n^8)$ time algorithm.
  We then generalize this result to any class of rationally parameterized transformations, which includes translation, rotation, scaling, and arbitrary affine transformations. For a class $\mathcal T$ of rationally parametrized transformations with $k$ degrees of freedom, we show that one can determine whether there is a transformation $\tau \in \mathcal T$ such that the Fr\'echet distance between $\pi$ and $\tau(\sigma)$ is at most $\delta$ in $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^{3k+\frac{4}{3}})$ time.</description>

      <title>Transforming Dogs on the Line: On the Fr\'echet Distance Under Translation or Scaling in 1D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fr\'echet distance is a computational mainstay for comparing polygonal curves. The Fr\'echet distance under translation, which is a translation invariant version, considers the similarity of two curves independent of their location in space. It is defined as the minimum Fr\'echet distance that arises from allowing arbitrary translations of the input curves. This problem and numerous variants of the Fr\'echet distance under some transformations have been studied, with more work concentrating on the discrete Fr\'echet distance, leaving a significant gap between the discrete and continuous versions of the Fr\'echet distance under transformations. Our contribution is twofold: First, we present an algorithm for the Fr\'echet distance under translation on 1-dimensional curves of complexity n with a running time of $\mathcal{O}(n^{8/3} log^3 n)$. To achieve this, we develop a novel framework for the problem for 1-dimensional curves, which also applies to other scenarios and leads to our second contribution. We present an algorithm with the same running time of $\mathcal{O}(n^{8/3} \log^3 n)$ for the Fr\'echet distance under scaling for 1-dimensional curves. For both algorithms we match the running times of the discrete case and improve the previously best known bounds of $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(n^4)$. Our algorithms rely on technical insights but are conceptually simple, essentially reducing the continuous problem to the discrete case across different length scales.</description>
