      <title>Universal Radial Scaling of Large-Scale Black Hole Accretion for Magnetically Arrested And Rocking Accretion Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accretion onto supermassive black holes (BHs) can launch relativistic jets that inject energy and momentum into their surroundings. Understanding how such feedback shapes large-scale accretion is key to bridging observations from galactic scales (e.g., the Bondi radius, $r_{\rm B}$) down to event horizon scales ($r_{\rm g}$), spanning 5-6 orders of magnitude. We tackle this challenge by varying the spatial scale separation across 2-4 orders of magnitude and performing some of the longest contiguous 3D general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations to date ($t \lesssim 4\times10^6 r_{\rm g}/c$), of Bondi-like accretion of rotating, non-relativistic gas with weak vertical magnetic fields onto a rapidly spinning BH, achieving inflow equilibrium out to $r \gtrsim 10^3 r_{\rm g}$. We find that, regardless of scale separation or ambient gas rotation, all simulations reach a magnetically arrested disk (MAD) state where the BH becomes magnetically saturated. In this state, the mass inflow rate follows a universal radial scaling: $\dot{M}_{\rm in}(r) \sim r^s$ with $s = 0.66 \pm 0.03$. The MAD state self-regulates through jets, outflows, and magnetic flux eruptions that can disrupt coherent angular momentum inflow, giving rise to a rocking accretion disk (RAD) state. This RAD state features chaotically oriented inflows, weak intermittent jets, and a steeper inflow slope of $s = 0.87 \pm 0.05$. The MAD and RAD BH accretion rates become comparable at typical scale separations, $r_{\rm B}/ r_{\rm g} \gtrsim 10^5$. Weaker RAD outflows allow large-scale inflows to resume, restoring the MAD state and enabling a recurring MAD-RAD cycle. These cycles can last tens of Bondi timescales, $t_{\rm B} \sim 0.2\,\text{Myr} \times (r_{\rm B}/10^{5} r_{\rm g})^{3/2} \times (M_{\rm BH}/10^9M_\odot)$, potentially setting the duty cycle of jetted AGN outbursts, such as in M87*.</description>

      <title>Estimating Global Ejecta Mass Ratios in Tycho's SNR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, as a follow-up to our similar analysis of Kepler's supernova remnant (SNR), we estimate total mass ratios of various ejecta elements in Tycho's SNR using Suzaku X-ray data. In our spectral analysis, we account for uncertainties arising from Suzaku's effective area calibration (5%-15%) and from the unknown filling factors of the various plasma components in our spectral model (1%-10%). We compare our calculated ejecta mass ratios to results from previous X-ray analyses of Tycho's SNR and to the nucleosynthesis results from Type Ia supernova simulations. Our estimated ejecta mass ratios for Tycho's SNR are only consistent with simulations that use a $\sim$90% attenuated $^{12}$C$+^{16}$O reaction rate (as for Kepler's SNR), are inconsistent with simulations involving a double detonation of a thick helium layer, and support a Type Ia explosion of normal luminosity where $\sim$85% of the ejecta has been heated by the reverse shock.</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic simulations of black hole evolution in AGN discs II: inclination damping for partially embedded satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the evolution of black holes on orbits with small inclinations ($i &lt; 2^\circ$) to the gaseous discs of active galactic nuclei. We perform 3D adiabatic hydrodynamic simulations within a shearing frame, studying the damping of inclination by black hole-gas gravitation. We find that for objects with $i&lt;3H_0R_0^{-1}$, where $H_0R_0^{-1}$ is the disc aspect ratio, the inclination lost per midplane crossing is proportional to the inclination preceding the crossing, resulting in a net exponential decay in inclination. For objects with $i&gt;3H_0R_0^{-1}$, damping efficiency decreases for higher inclinations. We consider a variety of different AGN environments, finding that damping is stronger for systems with a higher ambient Hill mass: the initial gas mass within the BH sphere-of-influence. We provide a fitting formula for the inclination changes as a function of Hill mass. We find reasonable agreement between the damping driven by gas gravity in the simulations and the damping driven by accretion under a Hill-limited Bondi-Hoyle-Lyttleton prescription. We find that gas dynamical friction consistently overestimates the strength of damping, especially for lower inclination systems, by at least an order of magnitude. For regions in the AGN disc where coplanar binary black hole formation by gas dissipation is efficient, we find that the simulated damping timescales are especially short with $\tau_d &lt; 10P_\mathrm{SMBH}$. We conclude that as the timescales for inclination damping are shorter than the expected interaction time between isolated black holes, the vast majority of binaries formed from gas capture should form from components with negligible inclination to the AGN disc.</description>

      <title>Gone with the Wind: JWST-MIRI Unveils a Strong Outflow from the Quiescent Stellar-Mass Black Hole A0620-00</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present new observations of the black hole X-ray binary A0620-00 using the Mid-Infrared Instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope, during a state where the X-ray luminosity is 9 orders of magnitude below Eddington, and coordinated with radio, near-infrared and optical observations. The goal is to understand the nature of the excess mid-infrared (MIR) emission originally detected by Spitzer red-ward of 8 $\mu$m. The stellar-subtracted MIR spectrum is well-modeled by a power law with a spectral index of $\alpha=0.72\pm0.01$, where the flux density scales with frequency as $F_\nu \propto \nu^{\alpha}$. The spectral characteristics, along with rapid variability--a 40% flux flare at 15$\mu$m and 25% achromatic variability in the 5-12 $\mu$m range--rule out a circumbinary disk as the source of the MIR excess. The Low Resolution Spectrometer reveals a prominent emission feature at 7.5 $\mu$m, resulting from the blend of three hydrogen recombination lines. While the contribution from partially self-absorbed synchrotron radiation cannot be ruled out, we argue that thermal bremsstrahlung from a warm (a few $10^4$ K) wind accounts for the MIR excess; the same outflow is responsible for the emission lines. The inferred mass outflow rate indicates that the system's low luminosity is due to a substantial fraction of the mass supplied by the donor star being expelled through a wind rather than accreted onto the black hole.</description>

      <title>The Northern Cross Fast Radio Burst project: V. Search for transient radio emission from Galactic magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The radio emission from magnetars is poorly understood and poorly characterized observationally, in particular for what concerns single pulses and sporadic events. The interest in it was boosted by the detection in 2020 of an extremely bright ms radio signal from the Galactic magnetar designated Soft Gamma Repeater (SGR) SGR J1935+2154, which occurred almost simultaneously with a typical magnetar short burst of X-rays. As of now, this event remains the Galactic radio pulse that is the most reminiscent of fast radio bursts (FRBs) and the only one with a sound association with a known progenitor. Aims. We aim to constrain the rate of impulsive radio events from magnetars, by means of an intensive monitoring using a high-sensitivity radio telescope. Methods. We performed a long-term campaign on seven Galactic magnetars (plus one candidate) using the Northern Cross transit radio telescope (in Medicina, Italy) searching for short timescales and dispersed radio pulses. Results. We obtained no detections in more than 560 hours of observation, setting an upper limit at 95% confidence level of &lt;52 yr$^{-1}$ on the rate of events with energy &gt;10$^{28}$ erg, which is consistent with limits in literature. Furthermore, under some assumptions on the magnetars properties and energetic behavior, we found that our upper limits point towards the fact that the entire population of FRBs observed cannot be explained by radio bursts emitted by magnetars.</description>

      <title>Collimation of Fast Radio Burster 20201124A; Repeaters vs. Apparent Non-Repeaters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The recent report of a period in the active repeating Fast Radio Burster 20201124A and measurement of its spindown rate place bounds on the solid angle of its emission on the basis of energetics. The bound depends on the (unknown) efficiency of conversion of rotational energy to coherent radio emission and implies a lower bound on the Lorentz factor of the radiating charges. Bursts may be emitted along the magnetic dipole axis, in repeaters aligned with the rotational axis and the line of sight but misaligned in apparent non-repeaters. This may explain the difficulty of finding periodicity in repeaters and the low duty cycle of apparent non-repeaters.</description>

      <title>A Criterion for Magnetars Producing Giant Flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, the straight flux rope in the model of giant flares on magnetars (Meng et al. 2014) was replaced with a curved one and the equilibrium behavior of the flux rope was investigated. Two footpoints of the flux rope are anchored to the spherical surface of magnetar. The forces acting on the flux rope include magnetic tension, magnetic pressure, curvature force, gravity. The equilibrium in the flux rope, so as in the global configuration, is achieved as these forces offset each other. Changes in the background environment drive the configuration to evolve through a set of equilibria in a quasi-static fashion until the critical point is reached and the loss of equilibrium in the configuration occurs, invoking a giant flare. We establish a criterion to identify magnetars capable of producing giant flares. Among the four forces, the curvature force as well as the magnetic compression tend to expel the flue rope outward. In a given magnetic configuration, the curvature force and magnetic compression are proportional to the square of the current intensity of the flux rope, which is determined by the frozen-flux condition and background magnetic field strength. We find that only when $\eta = G M m / ({{{R^4}{B_0}^2}})&lt; 0.48 $ is satisfied, the system reaches a critical point and potentially undergoes catastrophe. Here, $G, M, m, R$, and $B_{0}$ are the gravitational constant, the mass of neutron star, the mass of flux rope, the radius of neutron star, and the surface magnetic field strength of neutron star, respectively. The physical meaning of this criterion is that when $\eta \propto m / B_{0}^{2}$ is small enough, the curvature force and magnetic pressure can be sufficiently large to overcome gravitational confinement. This criterion establishes a basis for identifying magnetars capable of producing giant flares.</description>

      <title>A White Paper on The Multi-Messenger Science Landscape in India</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The multi-messenger science using different observational windows to the Universe such as Gravitational Waves (GWs), Electromagnetic Waves (EMs), Cosmic Rays (CRs), and Neutrinos offer an opportunity to study from the scale of a neutron star to cosmological scales over a large cosmic time. At the smallest scales, we can explore the structure of the neutron star and the different energetics involved in the transition of a pre-merger neutron star to a post-merger neutron star. This will open up a window to study the properties of matter in extreme conditions and a guaranteed discovery space. On the other hand, at the largest cosmological scales, multi-messenger observations allow us to study the long-standing problems in physical cosmology related to the Hubble constant, dark matter, and dark energy by mapping the expansion history of the Universe using GW sources. Moreover, the multi-messenger studies of astrophysical systems such as white dwarfs, neutron stars, and black holes of different masses, all the way up to a high redshift Universe, will bring insightful understanding into the physical processes associated with them that are inaccessible otherwise. This white paper discusses the key cases in the domain of multi-messenger astronomy and the role of observatories in India which can explore uncharted territories and open discovery spaces in different branches of physics ranging from nuclear physics to astrophysics.</description>

      <title>All-sky search for individual Primordial Black Hole bursts with LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial Black Holes~(PBHs) are hypothetical black holes with a wide range of masses that formed in the early universe. As a result, they may play an important cosmological role and provide a unique probe of the early universe. A PBH with an initial mass of approximately $10^{15}$~g is expected to explode today in a final burst of Hawking radiation. In this work, we conduct an all-sky search for individual PBH burst events using the data collected from March 2021 to July 2024 by the Water Cherenkov Detector Array of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO). Three PBH burst durations, 10~s, 20~s, and 100~s, are searched, with no significant PBH bursts observed. The upper limit on the local PBH burst rate density is set to be as low as 181~pc$^{-3}$~yr$^{-1}$ at 99$\%$ confidence level, representing the most stringent limit achieved to date.</description>

      <title>Chasing Serendipity: Tackling Transient Sources with Neutrino Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The discovery of ultra-high-energy neutrinos by IceCube marked the beginning of neutrino astronomy. Yet, the origin and production mechanisms of these neutrinos remain open questions. With the recent observation of the highest-energy neutrino event to date by the KM3NeT collaboration, transient sources - astrophysical objects that emit particles in brief, localized bursts - have emerged as promising candidates. In this work, we revisit the identification of such sources in IceCube and future neutrino telescopes, focusing on how both the timing and sky localization of the source affect the detection sensitivity. We highlight the crucial role of the source's right ascension in determining the effective area of detectors not located at the poles, such as KM3NeT, and present a framework to consistently account for this dependence. As a case study, we investigate evaporating primordial black holes (PBHs) as transient neutrino sources, showing that the detection prospects and localization accuracy are strongly influenced by the PBH's position in the sky. Our results emphasize the complementarity between neutrino and gamma-ray observatories and showcase the potential of a global network of neutrino detectors to identify and localize transient events that might be missed by traditional photon-based instruments.</description>

      <title>Identification of New Candidate Be/X-Ray Binary Systems in the Small Magellanic Cloud via Analysis of S-CUBED Source Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has long been known that a large population of Be/X-ray Binaries (BeXRBs) exists in the Milky Way's neighboring dwarf galaxy, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), due to a recent period of intense star formation. Since 2016, efforts have been made to monitor this population and identify new BeXRBs through the Swift SMC Survey (S-CUBED). S-CUBED's weekly observation cadence has identified many new BeXRBs that exist within the SMC, but evidence suggests that more systems exist that have thusfar escaped detection. A major challenge in identifying new BeXRBs is their transient nature at high-energy wavelengths, which prevents them from being detected via their X-ray emission characteristics when not in outburst. In order to identify sources that may have been missed due to a long period of quiescence, it becomes necessary to devise methods of detection that rely on wavelengths at which BeXRBs are more persistent emitters. In this work, we attempt to use archival analysis of infrared, optical, and ultraviolet observations to identify new candidate BeXRBs that have been overlooked within the S-CUBED source catalog. Using X-ray/optical selection of source properties, unsupervised clustering, SED-fitting to VizieR archival measurements, and ultraviolet light curve analysis, we are able to identify six new candidate BeXRB systems that otherwise would have been missed by automated analysis pipelines. Using these results, we demonstrate the use of ultraviolet through near-infrared observational data in identifying candidate BeXRBs when they cannot be identified using their X-ray emission.</description>

      <title>Novel methodology to obtain transonic solutions for dissipative flows around compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel methodology to obtain global transonic solutions around compact objects is reported here. A unified methodology to obtain accretion as well as wind solutions around these objects has been presented. Flows around compact objects are dissipative, and the conservation equations are therefore stiff. In such conditions, obtaining of sonic point(s) and hence, the transonic solution is not trivial. The conserved equations of motion fail to integrate in the presence of realistic viscosity, thereby making it difficult to obtain a global solution. This inhibits one from getting an actual picture of an astrophysical flow. The current work addresses this long-standing issue of obtaining solutions for both accretion and wind. The methodology developed utilises the inner boundary conditions and takes recourse to implicit-explicit (ImEx) integration schemes, to obtain general global transonic accretion and wind solutions. This is the first time such an attempt has been made. Current work considers the different cooling processes like bremsstrahlung, synchrotron and their inverse-Comptonizations, which are found to affect the thermodynamics of the flow. This methodology could successfully generate all topologies of global solutions, multiple sonic point regime, as well as shocks. A broad parameter space study has been done in this work. In an upcoming part II of the paper, a detailed discussion on the spectra and luminosity of the accretion and wind solutions has been presented.</description>

      <title>`Dark' Matter Effect as a Novel Solution to the KM3-230213A Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent KM3NeT observation of the ${\cal O}(100~{\rm PeV})$ event KM3-230213A is puzzling because IceCube with much larger effective area times exposure has not found any such events. We propose a novel solution to this conundrum in terms of dark matter (DM) scattering in the Earth's crust. We show that intermediate dark-sector particles that decay into muons are copiously produced when high-energy ($\sim100~\text{PeV}$) DM propagates through a sufficient amount of Earth overburden. The same interactions responsible for DM scattering in Earth also source the boosted DM flux from a high-luminosity blazar. We address the non-observation of similar events at IceCube via two examples of weakly coupled long-lived dark sector scenarios that satisfy all the lab-based constraints. We calculate the corresponding dark sector cross sections, lifetimes and blazar luminosities required to yield one event at KM3NeT, and also predict the number of IceCube events for these parameters that can be tested very soon. Our proposed DM explanation of the event can also be distinguished from a neutrino-induced event in future high-energy neutrino flavor analyses, large-scale DM direct detection experiments, as well as at future colliders.</description>

      <title>Gas meets Kozai: the influence of a gas-rich accretion disc on hierarchical triples undergoing von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.23889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) consist of a central supermassive black hole (SMBH) embedded in a region with both high gas and stellar densities: the gas is present as a thin accretion disc that fuels the central SMBH, while the stars form a dense, roughly isotropic nuclear star cluster. The binaries present in such a cluster could be considered naturally as triples, with the SMBH as a third object, and their dynamics also depend on the interaction with the gas-rich disc. In this paper, we study the evolution of such a binary on an inclined orbit with respect to the disc. The binary experiences both eccentricity excitation via the von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) effect and drag forces from each time it penetrates the disc. We find that, as the outer orbital inclination decreases, the evolution of inner orbital separation can transition from a regime of gradual hardening to a regime of rapid softening. As such binaries grow wider, their minimum pericentre distances (during ZLK oscillations) decrease. We show that a simple geometric condition, modulated by the complex ZLK evolution, dictates whether a binary expands or contracts due to the interactions with the AGN disc. Our results suggest that the interaction with gas-rich accretion disc could enhance the rate of stellar mergers and formation of gravitational wave sources, as well as other transients. The treatment introduced here is general and could apply, with the proper modifications, to hierarchical triples in other gas-rich systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23895v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The "ringdown" radiation emitted by oscillating black holes has great scientific potential. By carefully predicting the frequencies and amplitudes of black hole quasinormal modes and comparing them with gravitational-wave data from compact binary mergers we can advance our understanding of the two-body problem in general relativity, verify the predictions of the theory in the regime of strong and dynamical gravitational fields, and search for physics beyond the Standard Model or new gravitational degrees of freedom. We summarize the state of the art in our understanding of black hole quasinormal modes in general relativity and modified gravity, their excitation, and the modeling of ringdown waveforms. We also review the status of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA ringdown observations, data analysis techniques, and the bright prospects of the field in the era of LISA and next-generation ground-based gravitational-wave detectors.</description>

      <title>Radial and Non-Radial Oscillations of Protoneutron Stars with Hyperonic Composition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper explores radial and non-radial oscillations of protoneutron stars (PNSs) as they evolve from hot, neutrino-rich configurations through deleptonization to cold, catalyzed states. The equation of state (EoS) is modeled using a density-dependent relativistic mean-field framework, with stellar evolution characterized by changes in entropy and lepton fraction. Both nucleonic and hyperonic compositions are considered. Non-radial $f$- and $p_1$-mode oscillations are computed using both the Cowling approximation and full general relativity. Trapped neutrinos initially increase the error of the Cowling approximation for $f$-modes, which decreases during deleptonization and rises again in the cold phase. In contrast, $p_1$-mode errors peak during intermediate stages due to evolving pressure and density gradients. The emergence of hyperons modestly raises oscillation frequencies in both modes. Existing universal relations for $f$-mode frequency and damping time lack model independence for PNSs, motivating a more robust relation. In particular, our proposed universal relation involving the moment of inertia and $\tilde{\eta}$ shows strong agreement across all evolutionary phases, offering a temperature-sensitive, model-independent scaling for asteroseismology. Radial oscillations of a $1.4,M_\odot$ PNS are also studied for different EoSs. Our results show that displacement ($\xi$) and pressure perturbation ($\eta$) profiles are highly sensitive to thermal state, composition, and compactness. Hyperonic stars show higher frequencies, altered node structures, and stronger pressure perturbations due to EoS softening. Differences in frequency separation $\Delta \nu_n$ and fundamental frequency $\nu_0$ between nucleonic and hyperonic models provide clear observational diagnostics for probing PNS interiors and constraining the dense matter EoS.</description>

      <title>Minimising the numerical viscosity in Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations of discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulations using the Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) technique typically include numerical viscosity to model shocks and maintain particle order on the kernel scale. This numerical viscosity is composed of linear and quadratic terms, with coefficients $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ and $\beta_{\rm SPH}$ respectively. Setting these coefficients too high results in excessive numerical dissipation, whereas setting them too low may lead to unwanted effects such as particle penetration, which also leads to excess dissipation. In this study, we simulate accretion discs using the SPH code {\sc phantom} to investigate the effective disc viscosity arising from numerical viscosity. We model steady-state coplanar and circular discs with different values of $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ and $\beta_{\rm SPH}$, from which we determine the coefficients that lead to minimum levels of numerical viscosity by maximising the steady-state disc surface density for the same mass input rate. We find that, for planar and circular discs, the default values of the numerical viscosity parameters in the {\sc phantom} code can be too high particularly for the quadratic term. As higher values of the coefficients are required to adequately capture strong shocks in the flow, we suggest that the coefficient of the quadratic term should be time-dependent in a similar manner to the presently used ``switches'' on the linear term. This can be simply achieved by setting $\beta_{\rm SPH}$ to be a constant multiple of $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ with $\alpha_{\rm SPH}$ determined by an appropriate switch, as previously advocated in the literature.</description>

      <title>CGCS 6306, another X-ray-emitting asymptotic giant branch star confirmed to be a symbiotic binary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A number of asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are known to exhibit UV excess and/or X-ray emission. These have been considered signposts of a hot white dwarf (WD) companion in a symbiotic system (SySt), but AGB stars are so bright that they easily outshine these companions hampering their detection at optical wavelengths. A recent multi-wavelength investigation on the X-ray-emitting AGB (X-AGB) star Y Gem has confirmed the presence of a WD companion and, thus, its SySt nature. Our goal is to explore the true nature of another X-AGB star, namely CGCS 6306, to investigate whether some objects from this group may in fact be unnoticed symbiotic systems with AGB donors. Optical spectra and photometric data, together with X-ray observations, have been analyzed to investigate the properties of the stellar components and accretion process in CGCS 6306. CGCS 6306 is a carbon Mira with a pulsation period of 362 days. Its optical spectrum exhibits the typical saw-shaped features of molecular absorptions in addition to H I and He I recombination and [O I] and [O III] forbidden emission lines. The H$\alpha$ line profile is broad, which can be interpreted as evidence for an accretion disk. The X-ray spectrum is hard, typical of highly-extincted hot plasma emission, and the X-ray luminosity is $\approx10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The detection of high-excitation optical emission lines and the X-ray properties of CGCS 6306 confirm the presence of a WD companion, making it a bona-fide $\delta$-type X-SySt. Its X-ray luminosity is comparable to that of Y Gem, the other X-AGB confirmed to be a SySt, which was found to exhibit a high accretion rate. The lack of suitable information on the UV and blue optical properties of CGCS 6306, however, precludes a definitive estimate of the accretion rate in this system. Since CGCS 6306 is a carbon Mira, it adds to the small group of Galactic carbon SySts.</description>

      <title>Could a Primordial Black Hole Explosion Explain the KM3NeT Event?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A black hole is expected to end its lifetime in a cataclysmic runaway burst of Hawking radiation, emitting all Standard Model particles with ultra-high energies. Thus, the explosion of a nearby primordial black hole (PBH) has been proposed as a possible explanation for the $\sim 220$ PeV neutrino-like event recently reported by the KM3NeT collaboration. Assuming a PBH origin, we find that the source would need to lie at a distance of approximately $4 \times 10^{-5}$ pc, i.e., within the Solar System, to produce the observed event. At such proximity, the resulting flux of gamma-rays and cosmic rays would be detectable at Earth. By incorporating the time-dependent field of view of gamma-ray observatories, we show that LHAASO should have recorded on the order of ${\cal O}(10^8)$ events between fourteen and seven hours prior to the KM3NeT detection. IceCube should also have detected about 100 events at the time of the burst. The absence of any such multi-messenger signal, particularly in gamma-ray data, strongly disfavors the interpretation of the KM3-230213A event as arising from evaporation in a minimal four-dimensional Schwarzschild scenario.</description>

      <title>Test for LISA foreground Gaussianity and stationarity: extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extreme Mass Ratio Inspirals (EMRIs) are key observational targets for the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. Unresolvable EMRI signals contribute to the formation of a gravitational wave background (GWB). Characterizing the statistical features of the GWB from EMRIs is of great importance, as EMRIs will ubiquitously affect large segments of the inference scheme. In this work, we apply a frequentist test for GWB Gaussianity and stationarity, exploring three astrophysically-motivated EMRI populations. We construct the resulting signal by combining state-of-the-art EMRI waveforms and a detailed description of the LISA response with time-delay interferometric variables.Depending on the brightness of the GWB, our analysis demonstrates that the resultant EMRI foregrounds show varying degrees of departure from the usual statistical assumptions that the GWBs are both Gaussian and Stationary. If the GWB is non-stationary with non-Gaussian features, this will challenge the robustness of Gaussian-likelihood model, when applied to global inference results, e.g. foreground estimation, background detection, and individual-source parameters reconstruction.</description>

      <title>Breaking boundaries: extending the orbit-averaged Fokker-Planck equation inside the loss cone</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we present a new formulation of loss cone theory as a reaction-diffusion system, which accounts for loss cone events through a sink term and can be orbit-averaged. It can recover the standard approach based on boundary conditions, and is derived from a simple physical model that overcomes many of the classical theoretical constraints. We test our formulation by computing the relaxed distribution of disruptive orbits in phase space, that has a simple analytic form and matches the pericentre of tidal disruption events at disruption predicted by steady-state models, comparably well or better than other available formulas. This formulation of the problem is particularly suitable for including more physics in tidal disruptions and the analogous problem of gravitational captures, e.g. strong scatterings, gravitational waves emission, physical stellar collisions, and repeating partial disruptions -- that can all act on timescale shorter than two-body relaxation and might cause the tension between the observed vs theoretically predicted popultation of tidal disruptions.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high-energy cosmic rays from ultra-fast outflows of active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.05667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.05667v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) as potential sources of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We focus on cosmic-ray nuclei, an aspect not explored previously. These large-scale, mildly-relativistic outflows, characterised by velocities up to half the speed of light, are a common feature of AGN. We study the cosmic-ray spectrum and maximum energy attainable in these environments with 3D CRPropa simulations and apply our method to 86 observed UFOs. Iron nuclei can be accelerated up to $\sim10^{20}\,$eV at the wind-termination shock in some UFOs, but the escaping flux is strongly attenuated due to photonuclear interactions with intense AGN photon fields. The maximum energy of nuclei escaping a typical UFO is limited by photodisintegration to below $\sim 10^{17}\,$eV. However, in the most extreme $5-10\%$ of UFOs, helium (nitrogen) [iron] nuclei can escape with energy exceeding $10^{17.4}$ ($10^{17.8}$) $[10^{18.4}]\,$eV. Protons and neutrons, either primaries or by-products of photodisintegration, escape UFOs with little attenuation, with half of the observed UFOs reaching energies exceeding $10^{18}\,$eV. Thus, UFOs emerge as viable sources of the diffuse cosmic-ray flux between the end of the Galactic cosmic-rays and the highest-energy extragalactic flux. For a few UFOs in our sample, nuclei escape without photodisintegration with energy up to $10^{19.8}\,$eV. This occurs during low-emission states of the AGN, which would make UFOs intermittent sources of UHECR nuclei up to the highest observed energies. The role of UFOs as UHECR sources is testable with neutrino telescopes due to a substantial accompanying flux of PeV neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Prompt Periodicity in the GRB 211211A Precursor: Black-hole or magnetar engine?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The merger origin long GRB 211211A was a class (re-)defining event. A precursor was identified with a $\sim 1$ s separation from the main burst, as well as a claimed candidate quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) with a frequency $\sim20$ Hz. Here, we explore the implications of the precursor, assuming the quasi-periodicity is real. The precursor variability timescale requires relativistic motion with a Lorentz factor $\Gamma\gtrsim80$, and implies an engine driven jetted outflow. The declining amplitude of the consecutive pulses requires an episodic engine with an `on/off' cycle consistent with the QPO. For a black-hole central engine, the QPO can have its origin in Lense-Thirring precession of the inner disk at $\sim6-9$ $r_g$ (gravitational radii) for a mass $M_\bullet\leq4.5$ $M_{\odot}$, and $\lesssim 7$ $r_g$ for $M_\bullet&gt;4.5$ $M_{\odot}$ and dimensionless spin $\chi\sim 0.3 - 0.9$. Alternatively, at a disk density of $\sim10^{8 - 12}$ g cm$^{-3}$, the required magnetic field strength for a QPO via magnetohydrodynamic effects will be on the order $B\sim10^{12 - 14}$ G. If the central engine is a short lived magnetar or hypermassive neutron star, then a low-frequency QPO can be produced via instabilities within the disk at a radius of $\sim20 - 70$ km, for a disk density $\sim10^{9 - 12}$ g cm$^{-3}$ and magnetic field $\gtrsim10^{13 - 14}$ G. The QPO cannot be coupled to the neutron star spin, as the co-rotation radius is beyond the scale of the disk. Neither engine can be ruled out -- however, we favour an origin for the precursor candidate QPO as early jet-disk coupling for a neutron star -- black hole merger remnant with mass $M_\bullet&gt;4.5$ $M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>The slowest spinning Galactic-field spider PSR J1932+2121: A history of inefficient mass transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05372v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope is discovering hundreds of new pulsars, including a slowly spinning compact binary millisecond pulsar (spin period $P_{\rm spin}=14.2$\,ms) which showed radio eclipses and evidence of ablation of its companion: PSR J1932+2121. Its orbital period is $P_{\rm orb}=0.08$\,d and the minimum companion mass is estimated as 0.12\,\Msun. Hence, this pulsar is classified as part of the Galactic-field spider (redback) population. However, it spins almost an order of magnitude slower than other Galactic-field spiders. Using detailed evolutionary calculations with {\tt MESA}, we model the formation, mass-transfer and radio-pulsar phases, in order to explain the observed properties of PSR\,J1932+2121. We find that PSR\,J1932+2121 is a redback that has experienced an inefficient mass-transfer phase resulting in a lower accretion efficiency (in the range of 0.3 to 0.5) and subsequently slower spin compared to other spiders. We narrow down the initial range of $P_{\rm orb}$ that best reproduces its properties, to 2.0--2.6\,d. Current models of accretion-induced magnetic field decay are not able to explain its unusually high surface magnetic field of $2\times 10^{9}$\,G. Hence, PSR\,J1932+2121 provides a unique opportunity to study inefficient accretion-induced spin up and surface magnetic field decay of pulsars.</description>

      <title>Cyclostationary signals in LISA: a practical application to Milky Way satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08274v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) anticipated to be detected by the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) are Galactic double white dwarf binaries (DWDs). However, most of these binaries will be unresolved, and their GWs will overlap incoherently, creating a stochastic noise known as the Galactic foreground. Similarly, the population of unresolved systems in the Milky Way's (MW) satellites is expected to contribute to a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB). Due to their anisotropy and the annual motion of the LISA constellation, both the Galactic foreground and the satellite SGWB fall into the category of cyclostationary processes. Leveraging this property, we develop a purely frequency-based method to study LISA's capability to detect the MW foreground and SGWBs from the most promising MW satellites. We analyze both mock data generated by an astrophysically motivated SGWB spectrum, and realistic ones from a DWD population generated via binary population synthesis. We are able to recover or put constrains on the candidate foregrounds, reconstructing -- in the presence of noise uncertainties -- their sky distribution and spectrum. Our findings highlight the significance of the interplay between the astrophysical spectrum and LISA's sensitivity to detect the satellites' SGWB. Considering an astrophysically motivated prior on the satellite positions improves their detectability, which becomes otherwise challenging in the presence of the Galactic foreground. Furthermore, we explore the potential to observe a hypothetical satellite located behind the Galactic disk. Our results suggest that a Large Magellanic Cloud-like satellite could indeed be observable by LISA.</description>

      <title>Electron Penetration Acceleration in Turbulent Magnetic Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using particle-in-cell simulations to study fast radio burst (FRB) propagation in a tenuous plasma, we identified a novel mechanism that occurs during the growth of turbulent magnetic loops: electron penetration acceleration. The loops have an electromagnetic left-hand chirality distinct from that of well-known quasistatic magnetic islands. The fast electrons penetrate through the loops and thus are accelerated to unexpected relativistic energies due to the symmetry breaking induced by the coupling between the loop field and the non-relativistic electromagnetic wave. The identified features of penetration acceleration and magnetic loops might provide a new perspective for understanding particle injection into relativistic collisionless shock precursors invoked in FRB-swept cosmic backgrounds. Additionally, we show that this FRB-relevant phenomenon could be tested in scaled laboratory experiments using a multi-terawatt laser impinging on gas targets.</description>

      <title>Predicting the outcome of collisional neutrino flavor conversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.16961v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collisional flavor instabilities, driven by differing neutrino and antineutrino reaction rates, are expected to occur in dense astrophysical environments like supernovae and neutron star mergers, but have yet to be incorporated in large-scale simulations. We derive analytical expressions for the asymptotic state resulting from a homogeneous and isotropic instability, and apply these predictions to two representative conditions from a neutron star merger simulation. We emphasize the importance of using a collision term that allows for both damping of flavor coherence and relaxation back to the classical steady-state. When this classical configuration is collisional-unstable, the resulting asymptotic state reflects a compromise between classical relaxation and flavor conversion, defining a "quantum" equilibrium with nonzero coherence. This analysis highlights the possibility of a trade-off between classical and quantum effects, an important feature with regard to the inclusion of flavor oscillation physics into global simulations.</description>
