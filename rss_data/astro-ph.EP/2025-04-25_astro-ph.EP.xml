      <title>Thermal Emission and Confirmation of the Frigid White Dwarf Exoplanet WD 1856+534b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of thermal emission from and confirm the planetary nature of WD 1856+534b, the first transiting planet known to orbit a white dwarf star. Observations with JWST's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) reveal excess mid-infrared emission from the white dwarf, consistent with a closely-orbiting Jupiter-sized planet with a temperature of $186^{+6}_{-7}$ K. We attribute this excess flux to the known giant planet in the system, making it the coldest exoplanet from which light has ever been directly observed. These measurements constrain the planet's mass to no more than six times that of Jupiter, confirming its planetary nature and ruling out previously unexcluded low-mass brown dwarf scenarios. WD 1856+534b is now the first intact exoplanet confirmed within a white dwarf's "forbidden zone", a region where planets would have been engulfed during the star's red giant phase. Its presence provides direct evidence that planetary migration into close orbits, including the habitable zone, around white dwarfs is possible. With an age nearly twice that of the Solar System and a temperature akin to our own gas giants, WD 1856+534b demonstrates JWST's unprecedented ability to detect and characterize cold, mature exoplanets, opening new possibilities for imaging and characterizing these worlds in the solar neighborhood.</description>

      <title>Formation and Evolution Simulations of Saturn, Including Composition Gradients and Helium Immiscibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The formation of Saturn is modeled by detailed numerical simulations according to the core-nucleated accretion scenario. Previous models are enhanced to include the dissolution of accreting planetesimals, composed of water ice, rock, and iron, in the gaseous envelope of the planet, leading to a non-uniform composition with depth. The immiscibility of helium in metallic hydrogen layers is also considered. The calculations start at a mass $0.5$ Earth masses and are extended to the present day. At 4.57 Gyr, the model, proceeding outwards, has the following structure: (i) a central core composed of $100$% heavy elements and molecules, (ii) a region with decreasing heavy element mass fraction, down to a value of $0.1$, (iii) a layer of uniform composition with the helium mass fraction $Y$ enhanced over the primordial value, (iv) a helium rain region with a gradient in $Y$, (v) an outer convective, adiabatic region with uniform composition in which $Y$ is reduced from the primordial value, and (vi) the very outer layers where cloud condensation of the heavy elements occurs. Models of the distribution of heavy elements as a function of radius are compared with those derived to fit the observations of the Cassini mission, with rough qualitative agreement. The helium mass fraction in Saturn's outer layers is estimated to be around $20$%. Models are found which provide good agreement with Saturn's intrinsic luminosity and radius.</description>

      <title>A Search for Planet Nine with IRAS and AKARI Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The outer solar system is theoretically predicted to harbour an undiscovered planet, often referred to as P9. Simulations suggest that its gravitational influence could explain the unusual clustering of minor bodies in the Kuiper Belt. However, no observational evidence for P9 has been found so far, as its predicted orbit lies far beyond Neptune, where it reflects only a faint amount of Sunlight. This work aims to find P9 candidates by taking advantage of two far-infrared all-sky surveys, which are IRAS and AKARI. The epochs of these two surveys were separated by 23 years, which is large enough to detect the ~3'/year orbital motion of P9. We use a dedicated AKARI Far-Infrared point source list for our P9 search - AKARI Monthly Unconfirmed Source List, which includes sources detected repeatedly only in hours timescale, but not after months. We search for objects that moved slowly between IRAS and AKARI detections given in the catalogues. First, we estimated the expected flux and orbital motion of P9 by assuming its mass, distance, and effective temperature to ensure it can be detected by IRAS and AKARI, then applied the positional and flux selection criteria to narrow down the number of sources from the catalogues. Next, we produced all possible candidate pairs whose angular separations were limited between 42' and 69.6', corresponding to the heliocentric distance range of 500 - 700 AU and the mass range of 7 - 17 Earth masses. There are 13 pairs obtained after the selection criteria. After image inspection, we found one good candidate, of which the IRAS source is absent from the same coordinate in the AKARI image after 23 years and vice versa. However, AKARI and IRAS detections are not enough to determine the full orbit of this candidate. This issue leads to the need for follow-up observations, which will determine the Keplerian motion of our candidate.</description>

      <title>The tidal heating of the exoplanet 55 Cnc e. The role of the orbital eccentricity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Observations with warm Spitzer and JWST revealed high and variable brightness in the planet 55 Cnc e.
  Aims. Inventory of the tidal effects on the rotational and orbital evolution of the planet 55 Cnc e enhanced by the nonzero orbital eccentricity.
  Methods. The creep-tide theory is used in simulations and dynamical analyses that explore the difficult trapping of the planet rotation in a 3:2 spin-orbit resonance and the most probable synchronization of the rotation.
  Results. The strong tidal dissipation of energy, enhanced by the non-zero orbital eccentricity, may explain the observed brightness anomalies. However, the strong dissipation should also circularize the orbit. The observed non-zero eccentricity, if true, would indicate that an unknown planet in a close orbital resonance with 55 Cnc e perturbing the motion of this planet should exist.</description>

      <title>On the feasibility of laser satellite communications from the Martian surface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Free space optical (FSO) communication using lasers is a rapidly developing field in telecommunications that can offer advantages over traditional radio frequency technology. For example, optical laser links may allow transmissions at far higher data rates, require less operating power and smaller systems and have a smaller risk of interception. In recent years, FSO laser links have been demonstrated, tested or integrated in a range of environments and scenarios. These include FSO links for terrestrial communication, between ground stations and cube-sats in low Earth orbit, between ground and satellite in lunar orbit, as part of scientific or commercial space relay networks, and deep space communications beyond the moon. The possibility of FSO links from and to the surface of Mars could be a natural extension of these developments. In this paper we evaluate some effects of the Martian atmosphere on the propagation of optical communication links, with an emphasis on the impact of dust on the total link budget. We use the output of the Mars Climate Database to generate maps of the dust optical depth for a standard Mars climatology, as well as for a warm (dusty) atmosphere. These dust optical depths are then extrapolated to a wavelength of 1.55 um, and translated into total slant path optical depths to calculate link budgets and availability statistics for a link between the surface and a satellite in a sun-synchronous orbit. The outcomes of this study are relevant to potential future missions to Mars that may require laser communications to or from its surface. For example, the results could be used to constrain the design of communication terminals suitable to the Mars environment, or to assess the link performance as a function of ground station location.</description>

      <title>Towards understanding stellar variability at the sub m/s level: Isolating granulation signals in synthetic spectral lines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Granulation in the photospheres of FGK-type stars induces variability in absorption lines, complicating exoplanet detection via radial velocities and characterisation via transmission spectroscopy. We aim to quantify the impact of granulation on the radial velocity and bisector asymmetry of stellar absorption lines of varying strengths and at different limb angles. We use 3D radiation-hydrodynamic simulations from MURaM paired with MPS-ATLAS radiative transfer calculations to synthesise time series' for four Fe I lines at different limb angles for a solar-type star. Our line profiles are synthesised at an extremely high resolution (R = 2,000,000), exceeding what is possible observationally and allowing us to capture intricate line shape variations. We introduce a new method of classifying the stellar surface into three components and use this to parameterise the line profiles. Our parameterisation method allows us to disentangle the contributions from p-modes and granulation, providing the unique opportunity to study the effects of granulation without contamination from p-mode effects. We validate our method by comparing radial velocity power spectra of our granulation time series to observations from the LARS spectrograph. We find that we are able to replicate the granulation component extracted from observations of the Fe I 617 nm line at the solar disk centre. We use our granulation-isolated results to show variations in convective blueshift and bisector asymmetry at different limb angles, finding good agreement with empirical results. We show that weaker lines have higher velocity contrast between granules and lanes, resulting in higher granulation-induced velocity fluctuations. Our parameterisation provides a computationally efficient strategy to construct new line profiles, laying the groundwork for future improvements in mitigating stellar noise in exoplanet studies.</description>

      <title>Stellar Physics Across the HR Diagram with Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17361v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia Data Release 3 (GDR3) contains a wealth of information to advance our knowledge of stellar physics. In these lecture notes we introduce the data products from GDR3 that can be exploited by the stellar physics community. Then we visit different regions of the HR diagram, discuss the open scientific questions, and describe how GDR3 can help advance this particular topic. Specific regions include hot OB and A type stars, FGK main sequence, giants, and variable sources, low mass stars, and ultra-cool dwarfs. Examples of scientific exploitation are also provided. These lecture notes are accompanied by a 3-hour lecture presentation and a 3-hour practical session that are publicly available on the website of the Ecole Evry Schatzman 2023: Stellar physics with Gaia, https://ees2023.sciencesconf.org/, see Lectures and Hands-on Work.</description>

      <title>Insights from Analytical Theory of Eccentric Circumbinary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17658v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eccentric cavities in circumbinary disks precess on timescales much longer than the binary orbital period. These long-lived steady states can be understood as trapped modes in an effective potential primarily determined by the binary quadrupole and the inner-disk pressure support, with associated frequencies $\omega_Q$ and $\omega_P$. Within this framework, we show that the ratio $\omega_P/\omega_Q$ is the main parameter determining the mode spectrum, and obtain a thorough understanding of it by systematically solving this problem with various degrees of sophistication. We first find analytical solutions for truncated power-law disks and use this insight in disks with smooth central cavities. Our main findings are: (i) The number of modes increases for thinner disks and more-equal-mass binaries. (ii) For 2D disks, the normalized ground-mode frequency, $\omega_0/(\omega_Q+\omega_P)$, decreases monotonically with the ratio $\omega_P/\omega_Q$. (iii) For thin disks, $\omega_P\ll\omega_Q$, the ground-mode frequency coincides with the maximum of the effective potential, which tracks the gravitational quadrupole frequency inside the inner-disk cavity, and is thus rather sensitive to the density profile of the cavity, where these modes are localized. (iv) For thick disks, $\omega_P\gg\omega_Q$, increasing pressure support anchors the peak of the effective potential at the inner cavity radius as the ground-mode extends farther out and its frequency decreases. (v) In agreement with numerical simulations, with $\omega_P/\omega_Q \simeq 0.1$, we find that disk precession is rather insensitive to the density profile and ground-mode frequencies for 3D disks are about half the value for 2D disks.</description>

      <title>A Complex Systems Approach to Exoplanet Atmospheric Chemistry: New Prospects for Ruling Out the Possibility of Alien Life-As-We-Know-It</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05359v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The near-term capability to characterize terrestrial exoplanet atmospheres may bring us closer to discovering alien life through atmospheric data. However, remotely detectable candidate biosignature gases are subject to false positive signals because they can also be produced abiotically, raising a critical need to develop methods to determine whether a gas is produced abiotically or not. To distinguish biological, abiotic and anomalous sources (unidentified as abiotic or biotic) of biosignature gases, we take a complex systems approach implementing chemical reaction network analysis of planetary atmospheres. We simulated 30,000 terrestrial atmospheres, organized in two datasets: Archean Earth-like worlds and modern Earth-like worlds. For Archean Earth-like worlds we study cases where CH4 is produced abiotically via serpentinization, biologically via methanogenesis, or from anomalous sources. We also simulate modern Earth-like atmospheres with and without industrial CFC-12. We show how network properties can effectively distinguish scenarios where CH4 is produced from methanogenesis and serpentinization. Network analysis also distinguishes modern Earth-like atmospheres with CFC-12 from those without it. Using Bayesian analysis, we demonstrate how atmospheric network statistics can provide stronger confidence for ruling out biological explanations compared to gas abundance statistics alone. Our results confirm how a network theoretic approach allows distinguishing hypotheses about biological, abiotic and anomalous atmospheric drivers, and importantly, allows ruling out life-as-we-know-it as a possible explanation. We conclude with a discussion of how further developing statistical inference methods for spectral data that incorporate network properties could significantly strengthen future biosignature detection efforts.</description>

      <title>The role of Ohmic dissipation of internal currents on Hot Jupiter radii</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11501</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11501v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The inflated radii observed in hundreds of Hot Jupiters represent a long-standing open issue. The observed correlation between radii and irradiation strength, and the occasional extreme cases, nearly double the size of Jupiter, remain without a comprehensive quantitative explanation. In this investigation, we delve into this issue within the framework of Ohmic dissipation, one of the most promising mechanisms for explaining the radius anomaly. Using the evolutionary code MESA, we simulate the evolution of irradiated giant planets, spanning the range 1 to 8 Jupiter masses, incorporating an internal source of Ohmic dissipation located beneath the radiative-convective boundary. Our modeling is based on physical parameters, and accounts for the approximated conductivity and the evolution of the magnetic fields, utilizing widely-used scaling laws. We compute the radius evolution across a spectrum of masses and equilibrium temperatures, considering varying amounts of Ohmic dissipation, calculated with the internal conductivity profile and an effective parametrization of the currents, based on the typical radius of curvature of the field lines. Our analysis reveals that this internal Ohmic dissipation can broadly reproduce the range of observed radii using values of radius of curvature up to about one order of magnitude lower than what we estimate from the Juno measurements of the Jovian magnetosphere and from MHD dynamo simulations presented herein. The observed trend with equilibrium temperature can be explained if the highly-irradiated planets have more intense and more small-scale magnetic fields. This suggests the possibility of an interplay between atmospherically induced currents and the interior, via turbulence, in agreement with recent box simulations of turbulent MHD in atmospheric columns.</description>

      <title>Occurrence rates of accreting companions from a new method for computing emission-line survey sensitivity: application to the H-alpha Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01491v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A key scientific goal of exoplanet surveys is to characterize the underlying population of planets in the local galaxy. In particular, the properties of accreting protoplanets can inform the rates and physical processes of planet formation. We develop a novel method to compute sensitivity to protoplanets in emission-line direct-imaging surveys, enabling estimates of protoplanet population properties under various planetary accretion and formation theories. In this work, we specialize to the case of H-alpha and investigate three formation models governing the planetary-mass-to-mass-accretion-rate power law, and two accretion models that describe the scaling between total accretion luminosity and observable H-alphaline luminosity. We apply our method to the results of the Magellan Giant Accreting Protoplanet Survey (GAPlanetS) to place the first constraints on accreting companion occurrence rates in systems with transitional circumstellar disks. We compute the posterior probability for transitional disk systems to host an accreting companion (-7 &lt; log MMdot &lt;-3) within 2 arcseconds (~200 au). Using our two accretion models, we find consistent protoplanet rates, with median and 68% credible intervals of 0.16 (+0.19, -0.10) and 0.22 (+0.26, -0.14) accreting companions per star, respectively. Our technique enables studying protoplanet populations under flexible assumptions about planet formation. This formalism provides the statistical underpinning necessary for protoplanet surveys to discriminate among formation and accretion theories for planets and brown dwarfs.</description>

      <title>The Interplay between Dust Dynamics and Turbulence Induced by the Vertical Shear Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction between gas and dust in protoplanetary disks (PPDs) plays a crucial role in setting the stage of planet formation. In particular, the streaming instability (SI) is well recognized as the mechanism for planetesimal formation out of this interaction. The outer region of PPDs is likely subject to the vertical shear instability (VSI), representing a major source of disk turbulence characterized by vertical corrugation that leads to strong dust stirring. In the meantime, the VSI turbulence in 3D generates vortices through the Rossby wave instability (RWI), which can trap dust and thereby promote dust concentration. In this study, we use the multifluid dust module in Athena++ to conduct 2D axisymmetric global simulations of PPDs with mesh refinement and 3D global simulations with modest resolution. In 2D, the VSI corrugation mode is weakened by dust back-reaction, while the SI can still survive regardless of initial conditions. Dust clumping occurs and is seeded by VSI-induced zonal flows. In 3D, dust can settle even more with increased dusty buoyancy, suppressing the VSI corrugation mode. Meanwhile, dust back-reaction enhances dust concentration in RWI vortices, though higher resolution is needed to assess dust clumping.</description>
