Abstract: Wellness and mindfulness act as buzzwords these days, often seen as separate from physics. Yet we know they are important, and everything is related to physics! In this article, we will consider a few simple classroom activities that can both help students internalize the basic physics of forces and motion and also help facilitate well-being in our classes.</description>

      <title>Combining Physics and Mathematics Learning: A Taylor Series Analysis of an Oscillating Magnetic Field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03599v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we present a simple and low-cost experiment designed to study the oscillations of the magnetic field created by a cylindrical magnet under two different conditions: far and short distances from the magnetic sensor. A Taylor series expansion of the magnetic field function has been done to study the convergence of the polynomial series to the real field in both situations. To carry out the experiment, a small cylindrical magnet has been attached to an oscillating and well-known spring-mass system. The resulting oscillating magnetic field has been registered with the smartphone by using the magnetometer sensor. A very good agreement has been obtained between the theoretical model for the magnetic field and the experimental data collected with the sensor located near and far from a cylindrical magnet and along its longitudinal axis.</description>

      <title>The Cable to the Moon: Veritasium's Light Bulb Experiment in Low-Cost Miniature Form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a popular YouTube video by the channel Veritasium, the following question is posed: Imagine you have a giant circuit consisting of a battery, a switch, a light bulb, and two wires which are each 300,000 km long. That is the distance that light travels in one second. So, they [the wires] would reach out halfway to the Moon and then come back to be connected to the light bulb, which is one meter away. Now the question is: After I close this switch, how long would it take for the light bulb to light up: Is it half a second, one second, two seconds, 1m/c or none of the above?
  As part of the Physics Specialist Camp 2022 in Seifhennersdorf -- a final event of the Saxon Physics Olympiad -- students from grades 9 and 10 built a miniature model consisting of a printed circuit board and two 10-meter cables to experimentally study the question. This article describes the experimental setup, presents some exemplary results, and explains them in detail. To enable reconstruction for educational purposes, the final PCB layout, as well as the supply sources and design considerations, are provided.</description>

      <title>Accelerating the Fusion Workforce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03372v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fusion energy research and development landscape has seen significant advances in recent years, with important scientific and technological breakthroughs and a rapid rise of investment in the private sector. The workforce needs of the nascent fusion industry are growing at a rate that academic workforce development programs are not currently able to match. This paper presents the findings of the Workforce Accelerator for Fusion Energy Development Conference held in Hampton, Virginia, United States of America (USA), on May 29-30 2024, which was funded by the US National Science Foundation (NSF). A major goal of the conference was to focus on bringing public and private stakeholders together to identify opportunities for partnership in fusion research and education with the goal of meeting the needs for a talented and diverse workforce. Representatives from industry, academia, and national laboratories participated in the conference through the preparation of white papers, presentations, and group discussions, and the production of recommendations to address the challenges facing the US fusion workforce.</description>

      <title>Interference of interference effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03505v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the interference of individual photons in a linear-optical setup comprised of two overlapping Mach$\unicode{x2013}$Zehnder interferometers joined via a common beam splitter. We show how, in this setup, two kinds of standard interference effects$\unicode{x2014}$namely, single-photon Mach$\unicode{x2013}$Zehnder interference and two-photon Hong$\unicode{x2013}$Ou$\unicode{x2013}$Mandel interference$\unicode{x2014}$interfere with one another, partially canceling each other out. This new perspective, along with the overall pedagogical exposition of this work, is intended as an intuitive illustration of why quantum effects can combine nontrivially and, moreover, of the fundamental notion that quantum interference happens at measurement. This work can serve as a bridge to more advanced quantum mechanical concepts. For instance, analyses of this setup in terms of entanglement have a rich history and can be used to test the predictions of quantum mechanics versus local realism (e.g., as in Hardy's Paradox).</description>
