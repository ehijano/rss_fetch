      <title>Signal selective amplification for below-the-threshold stimulus in Fitzhugh-Nagumo neuronal model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Brain operates at remarkably low signal power. It has been noted that noise may play a constructive role in neural networks and facilitate the subthreshold signaling. The process of spiking pattern excitation at the characteristic neuronal spiking frequency from the random noisy stimulus remains unexplained. Furthermore, recent research indicates that neuronal processing enables signal selective amplification. Also, there is a growing number of studies indicating the role of coloured noise for spike generation, while noise shaping effect have been recently observed in neuronal networks as well as in single neurons. We demonstrate for the first time that noise shaping enables efficient signal amplification and spike excitation for below-the-threshold stimulus. On the example of the seminal FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) model we reveal that the complex interplay between the fast and slow FHN variables leads to noise accumulation at the FHN characteristic spiking frequencies, while tails follow a power-law frequency scaling. We demonstrate that the discovered effect allows selective amplification of signal waveforms presenting a novel type of amplification process.</description>

      <title>Assessing the Brain Wave Hypothesis: Call for Commentary</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It has been proposed that there is a wave excitation in animal brains, whose role is to represent three dimensional local space in a working memory. Evidence for the wave comes from the mammalian thalamus, the central body of the insect brain, and from computational models of spatial cognition. This is described in related papers. I assess the Bayesian probability that the wave exists, from this evidence. The probability of the wave in the brain is robustly greater than 0.4. If there is such a wave, we may need to re-think our whole understanding of the brain, in a break from classical neuroscience. I ask other researchers to comment on the wave hypothesis and on this assessment. In a companion paper, I outline possible ways to test it.</description>

      <title>A Machine Learning Approach for Identifying Anatomical Biomarkers of Early Mild Cognitive Impairment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00040v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alzheimer Disease poses a significant challenge, necessitating early detection for effective intervention. MRI is a key neuroimaging tool due to its ease of use and cost effectiveness. This study analyzes machine learning methods for MRI based biomarker selection and classification to distinguish between healthy controls and those who develop mild cognitive impairment within five years. Using 3 Tesla MRI data from ADNI and OASIS 3, we applied various machine learning techniques, including MATLAB Classification Learner app, nested cross validation, and Bayesian optimization. Data harmonization with polynomial regression improved performance. Consistent features identified were the entorhinal, hippocampus, lateral ventricle, and lateral orbitofrontal regions. For balanced ADNI data, Naive Bayes with z score harmonization performed best. For balanced OASIS 3, SVM with z score correction excelled. In imbalanced data, RUSBoost showed strong performance on ADNI and OASIS 3. Z score harmonization highlighted the potential of a semi automatic pipeline for early AD detection using MRI.</description>

      <title>Survey on biomarkers in human vocalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent years has witnessed an increase in technologies that use speech for the sensing of the health of the talker. This survey paper proposes a general taxonomy of the technologies and a broad overview of current progress and challenges. Vocal biomarkers are often secondary measures that are approximating a signal of another sensor or identifying an underlying mental, cognitive, or physiological state. Their measurement involve disturbances and uncertainties that may be considered as noise sources and the biomarkers are coarsely qualified in terms of the various sources of noise involved in their determination. While in some proposed biomarkers the error levels seem high, there are vocal biomarkers where the errors are expected to be low and thus are more likely to qualify as candidates for adoption in healthcare applications.</description>

      <title>Retinotopic Mapping Enhances the Robustness of Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foveated vision, a trait shared by many animals, including humans, has not been fully utilized in machine learning applications, despite its significant contributions to biological visual function. This study investigates whether retinotopic mapping, a critical component of foveated vision, can enhance image categorization and localization performance when integrated into deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Retinotopic mapping was integrated into the inputs of standard off-the-shelf convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which were then retrained on the ImageNet task. As expected, the logarithmic-polar mapping improved the network's ability to handle arbitrary image zooms and rotations, particularly for isolated objects. Surprisingly, the retinotopically mapped network achieved comparable performance in classification. Furthermore, the network demonstrated improved classification localization when the foveated center of the transform was shifted. This replicates a crucial ability of the human visual system that is absent in typical convolutional neural networks (CNNs). These findings suggest that retinotopic mapping may be fundamental to significant preattentive visual processes.</description>
