      <title>Multiple power laws and scaling relation in exploratory locomotion of the snail Tegula nigerrima</title>

Abstract: One of goals in soft robotics is to achive spontaneous behavior like real organisms. To gain a clue to achieve this, we examined the long (16-hour) spontaneous exploratory locomotion of snails. The active forager snail, Tegula nigerrima, from an intertidal rocky shore was selected to test the general hypothesis that nervous systems are inherently near a critical state, which is self-organized to drive spontaneous animal behavior. This hypothesis, known as the critical brain hypothesis, was originally proposed for vertebrate species, but it might be applicable to other invertebrate species as well. We first investigated the power spectra of the speed of locomotion of the snails ($N=39$). The spectra showed $1/{f^\alpha}$ fluctuation, which is one of the signatures of self-organized criticality. The $\alpha$ was estimated to be about 0.9. We further examined whether the spatial and temporal quantities show multiple power-laws and scaling relations, which are rigorous criteria of criticality. Although the satisfaction of these criteria is limited to a truncated region and provides limited evidence to demonstrate the aspect of self-organization, the multiple power-laws and the scaling relations were overall satisfied. Therefore, these results additionally support the generality of the critical brain hypothesis.</description>

      <title>A twenty-first century statistical physics of life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.20506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.20506v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The molecular biology revolution of the last seventy five years has transformed our view of living systems. Scientific explanations of biological phenomena are now synonymous with the identification of the genes, proteins, and signaling molecules involved. The hegemony of the molecular paradigm has only become more pronounced as new technologies allow us to make measurements at scale. Combining this wealth of data with new ``artificial intelligence'' techniques is viewed as the future of biology. Here, we challenge this emerging ``common sense'', laying out a roadmap for developing a theoretical understanding of life. We argue that a twenty-first century theoretical biology must be founded on a new type of statistical physics suited to the living world. Rather than merely constructing statistical models, a statistical theory requires developing ``quantitative abstractions'' for understanding the gene-organism-environment triad. This necessitates overcoming four major challenges that distinguish living matter: (1) living systems are composed of a large number of heterogeneous parts rather than a large number of identical objects; (2) living systems control and manipulate the physical world in a manner that is extremely different from the ways considered in traditional statistical physics; (3) living systems necessarily operate out of equilibrium; (4) living systems are evolved objects with a function, resulting in new types of constraints that must be imposed on probabilistic ensembles. We conclude by discussing a few key themes that we view as promising directions for developing a statistical physics of life: typicality, localized biological control, a linear response of complex systems with non-reciprocal interactions, biological resource allocation, and learning and adaptation in overparameterized systems.</description>
