      <title>Deep Learning-based Single-Shot Composite Fringe Projection Profilometry with Pixel-Wise Uncertainty Quantification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Driven by the growing demand for high-speed 3D measurement in advanced manufacturing, optical metrology algorithms must deliver high accuracy and robustness under dynamic conditions. Fringe projection profilometry (FPP) offers high precision, yet the 2pi ambiguity of the wrapped phase means that conventional absolute phase recovery typically relies on multiple coded patterns, sacrificing temporal resolution. Deep learning-based composite FPP (CFPP) shows promise for single-shot phase recovery from a composite fringe, but limited interpretability makes it difficult to assess reconstruction reliability or trace error sources in the absence of ground truth. To address this, we propose HSURE-CFPP (Heteroscedastic Snapshot-ensemble Uncertainty-aware Ratio Estimation for CFPP). HSURE-CFPP predicts the numerator-denominator ratio used for wrapped-phase computation with a heteroscedastic snapshot-ensemble network, enabling ultra-fast 3D imaging from a single composite fringe and producing pixel-wise uncertainty maps for confidence assessment and unreliable-region identification. Specifically, a heteroscedastic likelihood jointly estimates pixel-wise noise variance to capture data uncertainty, while a snapshot ensemble quantifies model uncertainty via dispersion across snapshots, yielding total predictive uncertainty as an interpretable reliability measure. Experiments on static and dynamic scenes demonstrate that HSURE-CFPP achieves high-accuracy reconstruction at high speed and that the predicted uncertainty correlates well with reconstruction errors, providing a deployable quality-assessment mechanism for deep-learning-based FPP.</description>

      <title>Freestanding Resist Metasurface Supporting Higher-Order BICs for Efficient Field Enhancement in TMD Monolayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhancing light-matter coupling in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors such as transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers remains a central challenge in nanophotonics due to their atomic thickness, which limits their interaction volume with light. Here, we demonstrate that first-order quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs) supported by a freestanding metasurface provide exceptionally strong surface field enhancement, enabling efficient coupling with a tungsten disulfide (WS2) monolayer. Triangular-lattice polymer patterns on silicon nitride membranes are fabricated to realize these higher-order modes. Simulations reveal that first-order quasi-BICs exhibit much stronger field enhancement than zeroth-order modes at the top surface where the WS2 monolayer is placed. Photoluminescence (PL) measurements confirm a remarkable PL enhancement factor of 127 for first-order quasi-BICs, over six times larger than that of zeroth-order quasi-BICs. These results establish higher-order BICs in freestanding metasurfaces as a powerful route to engineer light-matter interactions in 2D semiconductors for advanced nanophotonic and quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Modulating anomalous thermal quenching behavior of stimulation luminescence via high-orbit electronic satellite-stabilized Trap state in germanate-based phosphors for 5D optical data storage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Persistent luminescence (PersL) materials, widely used in emergency lighting and information storage, are primarily employed at room temperature. However, their luminescent performance deteriorates sharply at high temperatures. Herein, a serials of Mg2GeO4:Ti4+,Ln3+ (Ln = Tb, Eu) phosphors demonstrated anomalous thermal quenching PersL due to the temperature-dependent Fermi-Dirac distribution of bound charge carriers of Ti4+Mg2+ as remote electron traps and VMg2+ as hole traps. The high carrier retention rate of phosphors is attributed to the ability of Ti4+Mg2+ positive charge center to strongly trap non-bonding electrons over a long range (about 20 angstroms) as the electronic satellite for its stable operation. Under external optical/thermal stimulation, the released electrons and holes recombine at the different luminescent levels of Tb3+, resulting in the emission of different PersL branching ratios. Using these phosphors, we have developed 5D optical data storage (2D plane + trap depth + temperature + time) and the encrypted engine program for high-temperature aerospace engines. This study reveals the energy storage process of long-range trapping and releasing electrons by Ti4+ electron traps, and provides a new design concept for the design of PersL materials.</description>

      <title>Optical Quasi-symmetry Groups for Meron Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce quasi-symmetry groups in optics emerging from the commutation between mirror operation and the spin-orbit interaction (SOI) of light. Contrary to the principle of symmetry inheritance in free-space optics, where the symmetry of any structured field is strictly constrained by that of its source, we show that strong SOI enables quasi-symmetry-protected formation of meron lattices even when the underlying optical sources violate the nominal rotational symmetry. By analyzing the Hermiticity of the electric-dipole radiation amplitude in a circular polarization basis, we derive an effective mirror operator acting only on a subset of C3 polarized dipole emitters, forming a quasi-symmetry group that commutes with SOI. This quasi-symmetry guarantees exact C3 merons and gives rise to a robust polarization zone within which continuously varying input polarizations generate identical topological textures. Our work establishes quasi-symmetry as a new fundamental principle in optical physics and opens pathways to engineered topological structures of light beyond conventional symmetry constraints.</description>

      <title>Uncooled low-noise thin-film optomechanical resonator for thermal sensing on lithium niobate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optomechanical transduction harnesses the interaction between optical fields and mechanical motion to achieve sensitive measurement of weak mechanical quantities with inherently low noise. Lithium niobate combines low optical loss, strong piezoelectricity, high intrinsic fQ_m factor, and low thermal conductivity, making it promising for exploring optomechanical platforms targeting thermal sensing applications. Here, we developed an integrated optomechanical platform on thin-film lithium niobate with precisely engineered optical, mechanical, and thermal fields within a compact 40 {\mu}m by 40 {\mu}m footprint. The platform integrates suspended microring resonators with ultrathin central membranes, reducing mechanical stiffness and effective mass while maintaining a high optical factor Q_o of 1e6 and mechanical quality factor Q_m of 1117, which increases to 5.1e4 after oscillation. The design suppresses thermal dissipation into the silicon substrate and enhances thermal sensitivity, achieving a temperature coefficient of frequency of -124 ppm/K and a noise-equivalent power of 6.2 nW/sqrt(Hz) at 10 kHz at room temperature. This compact and scalable platform opens up new opportunities for high-sensitivity thermal sensing, supports heterogeneous integration with infrared absorbers for uncooled infrared detection, and enables fully integrated, all-optical on-chip readout, paving the way toward large-format, low-noise infrared sensing arrays.</description>

      <title>Photonic Waveguide Circuit Integrated with Carbon Nanotube Single-Photon Source Operating at Room Temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photonic integrated circuits require robust room-temperature single-photon sources to enable scalable quantum technologies. Single-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs), with their unique excitonic properties and chemical tunability, are attractive candidates, but their integration into photonic circuits remains challenging. In this work, we demonstrate the integration of functionalized CNTs as room-temperature single-photon emitters into photonic cavities and waveguide circuits. (6,5) CNTs with aryl sp$^3$ defects are either stochastically deposited via drop-casting or deterministically positioned on photonic cavities using an anthracene-assisted transfer method guided by real-time photoluminescence monitoring. Photoluminescence spectra reveal cavity-enhanced emission, while second-order autocorrelation measurements confirm single-photon propagation through the photonic integrated circuit, highlighting the potential of CNTs for scalable, room-temperature quantum photonic applications.</description>

      <title>Thermally adaptive textile inspired by morpho butterfly for all-season comfort and visible aesthetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02774v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A longstanding challenge in personal thermal management has been transitioning from static, appearance-limited passive radiative cooling (PDRC) materials to systems that are both dynamically adaptive and visually versatile. The central hurdle remains the inherent compromise between color saturation and cooling power. Inspired by organisms such as butterflies, which decouple structural color from thermal function, we present a smart textile that seamlessly merges a dynamic thermochromic layer with static photonic crystals (PCs). This design enables the solar reflectance to be autonomously switched-from approximately 0.6 in the colored state for heating to about 0.9 in the high-reflectance state for cooling. Consequently, outdoor experiments validated substantial temperature regulation: the fabric achieves a surface temperature reduction of 3-4 {\deg}C in summer and a heating difference of &lt;1 {\deg}C in winter compared to commercial reference materials, all while maintaining high-saturation colors. This dual-mode operation offers a viable pathway for achieving adaptive, aesthetic, and energy-free thermal comfort.</description>

      <title>High-Q AlN microresonators for nonlinear near-infrared and near-visible photonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High Q-factors of microresonators are crucial for nonlinear integrated photonics, as many nonlinear dynamics have quadratic or even cubic dependence on Q-factors. The unique material properties make AlN microresonators invaluable for microcomb generation, Raman lasing and visible integrated photonics. However, the loss level of AlN falls behind other integrated platforms. By optimizing the fabrication, we demonstrate record Q-factors of 5.4$\times$10$^6$ and 2.2$\times$10$^6$ for AlN microresonators in the near-infrared and near-visible, respectively. Polarized-mode-interaction was used to create anomalous dispersion to support bright AlN Dirac solitons. Measurement of polarization-dependent spectra reveals the polarization hybridization of the Dirac soliton. In a microresonator with normal dispersion, Raman assisted four-wave-mixing (RFWM) was observed to initiate platicon formation, adding an approach to generate normal dispersion microcombs. A design of width-varying waveguides was used to ensure both efficient coupling and high Q-factor for racetrack microresonators at 780 nm. The microresonator was pumped to generate near-visble Raman laser at 820 nm with a fundamental linewidth narrower than 220 Hz. Our work unlocks new opportunities for integrated AlN photonics by improving Q-factors and uncovering nonlinear dynamics in AlN microresonators.</description>

      <title>A Vehicle-portable Ultra-stable Laser for Operating on Highways</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Portable ultra-stable lasers are essential for high-precision measurements. This study presents a 1550 nm vehicle-portable ultra-stable laser designed for continuous real-time operation on highways. We implement several measures to mitigate environmental impacts, including active temperature control with a standard deviation of mK/day to reduce frequency drift of the optical reference cavity, all-polarization-maintaining fiber devices to enhance the robustness of the optical path, and highly integrated electronic units to diminish thermal effects. The performance of the ultra-stable laser is evaluated through real-time beat frequency measurements with another similar ultra-stable laser over a transport distance of approximately 100 km, encompassing rural roads, national roads, urban roads, and expressways. The results indicate frequency stability of approximately 10-12/(0.01s-100 s) during transport, about 5E-14/s while the vehicle is stationary with the engine running, and around 3E-15/s with the engine off, all without active vibration isolation. This work marks the first recorded instance of a portable ultra-stable laser achieving continuous real-time operation on highways and lays a crucial foundation for non-laboratory applications, such as mobile laser communication and dynamic free-space time-frequency comparison.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Evanescent Wave Interaction for Enhanced Optical NO2 Detection with Carbon Nanotube-Coated Side-Polished Fiber</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Evanescent-wave gas sensors employing side-polished optical fibers (SPFs) functionalized with nanomaterial coatings represent a promising platform for compact, sensitive detection. While single-walled carbon nanotube (SWCNT) films are recognized for their gas adsorption capabilities, their integration with photonic structures often overlooks complex light-matter interactions. In this work, we report a counterintuitive polarization-dependent response in an evanescent-wave NO2 sensor, fabricated by depositing aerosol-synthesized SWCNT thin films onto SPFs. The device demonstrates high performance, including a limit of detection of 400 ppb and stable operation in humid environments. However, its sensing behavior deviates strikingly from established models: upon NO2 exposure, transmitted light intensity increases for TM polarization but decreases for TE polarization, a phenomenon not attributable solely to changes in the intrinsic absorption of the SWCNTs. We pinpoint that the dominant mechanism is a gas-induced alteration of the SWCNT film's complex refractive index, which subsequently perturbs the evanescent field mode profile of the waveguide. Numerical simulations confirm that accounting for this mode-profile redistribution is essential to accurately describe the sensor's response. Revealed mechanism provides an important design framework for advanced evanescent-field sensors based on tunable nanomaterial claddings.</description>

      <title>Collective light-matter interaction in plasmonic waveguide quantum electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rabi oscillations characterize light-matter hybridization in the waveguide quantum electrodynamics~(WQED) framework, with their associated decay rates reflecting excitation damping, yet their behavior remains unresolved when collective emitters are coupled to a collective waveguide mode. This scenario reveals a conceptually novel collective-light-collective-matter interaction, realizable when a timed-Dicke state~(TDS) of subwavelength emitters couples to a slow, delocalized surface-plasmon mode, forming a hybridized plasmon-polariton~(HPP). The HPP acquires its directionality from the TDS via momentum matching. It also exhibits plasmonic characteristics, with excitation frequencies following the surface-plasmon dispersion relation. We obtain a Rabi oscillation and a long-time decay that describe the HPP and use them to reveal weak- and strong-coupling regimes through the emergence of normal-mode splitting. By performing a finite-time Lyapunov-exponent analysis, we show that the HPP also exhibits instantaneous decay and identify three distinct decay regimes: early-time rapid, transient-time oscillatory, and long-time classical. Finally, by analyzing the emission spectrum, we observe an anticrossing of the peak doublets~(a feature also seen in cavity QED setups) which originates from quantum vacuum effects and the resulting non-Markovian HPP evolution in our WQED.</description>

      <title>Acoustic Analogy of Quantum Baldin Sum Rule for Optimal Causal Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02630v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The mass law is a cornerstone in predicting sound transmission loss, yet it neglects the constraints of causal dispersion. Current causality-based theories, such as the Rozanov limit, are applicable only to one-port reflective absorbers. Here, we derive a universal sum rule governing causal scattering in acoustic systems, establishing a rigorous analogy to the Baldin sum rule in quantum field theory. This relation reveals that the integral of the extinction cross-section is fundamentally locked by the scatterer's static effective mass and stiffness, which is validated numerically using seminal examples of underwater metamaterials. Furthermore, the proposed sum rule predicts an optimal condition for an anomalously broadened transmission loss bandwidth, as experimentally observed through the spectral shaping effect of an acoustic Fano resonator. Our findings open up an unexplored avenue for enhancing the scattering bandwidth of passive metamaterials.</description>

      <title>Stable boundary modes for fragile topology from spontaneous PT-symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators protected by nonlocal symmetries or with fragile topology usually do not admit robust in-gap edge modes due to the incompatibility between the symmetry and the boundary. Here, we show that in a parity-time (PT) symmetric system robust in-gap topological edge modes can be stably induced by non-Hermitian couplings that spontaneously break the PT symmetry of the eigenstates. The topological edge modes traverse the imaginary spectral gap between a pair of fragile topological bands, which is opened by the presence of the non-Hermitian perturbation. We demonstrate that the net number of resulting in-gap modes is protected by an operator version of anomaly cancellation that extends beyond the Hermitian limit. The results imply that loss and gain can in principle drive fragile topological phenomena to stable topological phenomena.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a symmetry-informed representation for hybrid photon--exciton--phonon quantum electrodynamics Hamiltonians to restore Bloch's theorem. The interchange of momenta between fermions and bosons breaks crystalline excitons' translational symmetry under strong coupling. Restoring said symmetry, we efficiently compute experimentally accessible observables without introducing approximations to the Hamiltonian, enabling investigations that elucidate material properties in strong coupling with applications enhancing coherent transport and unlocking symmetry-forbidden matter transitions.</description>

      <title>Theoretical analysis of performance limitation of computational refocusing in optical coherence tomography</title>

Abstract: High-numerical-aperture optical coherence tomography (OCT) enables sub-cellular imaging but faces a trade-off between lateral resolution and depth of focus. Computational refocusing can correct defocus in Fourier-domain OCT, yet its limitations remain unaddressed theoretically. We formulate the lateral imaging process of OCT by using pupil-based imaging theory and the constraints of the computational refocusing in point-scanning OCT and spatially-coherent full-field OCT (FFOCT) are analyzed. The constrains in lateral sampling density and the confocality are considered, and it is shown that the maximum correctable defocus (MCD) is primarily limited by confocality in point-scanning OCT, while spatially-coherent FFOCT has no such constraint and can achieve virtually infinite MCD with a proper and reasonable sampling density. This makes spatially-coherent FFOCT particularly suitable for optical coherence microscopy.</description>

      <title>Optically trapped exciton-polariton condensates in a perovskite microcavity</title>

Abstract: We demonstrate room temperature optical trapping and generation of high-order angular harmonics in exciton-polariton condensates in a monocrystalline CsPbBr$_3$ perovskite-filled microcavity. Using an annular nonresonant excitation profile focused onto the perovskite, we observed power-driven switching between different transverse modes of the optically induced trap. We explore the interplay between the perovskite crystal dimensions and the optical trap diameter that allows the condensate to transition from whispering gallery-like petal shapes to extended ripple states. Our results underline the feasibility in creating high-order quantum states in perovskite polariton condensates for reconfigurable and structured room temperature nonlinear lasing.</description>

      <title>Light-Driven Skyrmion Crystal Generation in Plasmonic Metasurfaces Through the Inverse Faraday Effect</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.23800v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Skyrmions are topological structures defined by a winding vector configuration that yields a quantized topological charge. In magnetic materials, skyrmions manifest as stable, mobile spin textures, positioning them at the forefront of spintronics research. Meanwhile, their optical counterparts unlock new possibilities for manipulating and directing light at the nanoscale. Exploring the territories where magnetism and optics meet therefore holds immense promise for ultrafast control over magnetic processes. Here, we report the generation of a skyrmion-topological lattice through the inverse Faraday effect in a plasmonic metasurface. Specifically, a hexagonal array of gold nanodisks induces unidirectional drift photocurrents in each nanodisk, while counterpropagating phantom currents arise in the hexagonal interstices. This interplay creates a lattice of skyrmionic magnetic textures. Crucially, the all optical, large scale formation of skyrmions potentially at ultrafast timescales offers a pathway for integrating these topological spin textures into magnetic materials, laying the groundwork for next-generation data storage and processing technologies.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable nonrigid moire exciton polariton supersolids at room temperature</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A supersolid is a macroscopic quantum state which sustains superfluid and crystallizing structure together after breaking the U(1) symmetry and translational symmetry. On the other hand, a moire pattern can form by superimposing two periodic structures along a particular direction. Up to now, supersolids and moire states are disconnected from each other. In this work we show that exciton polariton supersolids can form moire states in a double degenerate parametric scattering process which creates two constituted supersolids with different periods in a liquid crystal microcavity. In addition, we demonstrate the nonrigidity of the moire exciton polariton supersolids by electrically tuning the wavevector and period of one supersolid component with another one being fixed. Our work finds a simple way to link moire states and supersolids, which offers to study nontrivial physics emerging from the combination of moire lattices and supersolids which can be electrically tuned at room temperature.</description>

      <title>Optically Switchable Fluorescence Enhancement at Critical Interparticle Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11541v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Plasmonic nanostructures provide electric field localization to be used as a fluorescence enhancement tool for the closely located fluorophores. However, metallic structures exhibit non-radiative energy transfer at close proximity, which suppresses the boost in the photoluminescence spectrum due to inhomogeneous medium. Compensation to non-radiative losses is fundamentally restricted, therefore defining the critical interparticle distances, where the fluorescence enhancement is detectable hold utmost importance for device applications. In this work, we numerically identified the critical interparticle distances of a metal nanoparticle (MNP) and quantum emitters (QEs) with angstrom resolution by analyzing the interplay between quantum yield and non-radiative decay. By engaging a collimated light application on silver nanoparticle (AgNP) placed at a critical distance, we simulated an active fluorescence enhancement switch yielding observable 7-fold increase in fluorescence intensity. The provided free space simulation includes the complete response of AgNP with retardation and higher order multi-polar effects for which the previous analytical works fall short. While the model bridges the absorption and emission spectra via corresponding Stokes shift values and presents a general approach for the interaction of QEs and MNPs in Rayleigh regime, it can be extended to Mie regime for larger QEs and can be modified for dielectric device environment.</description>

      <title>All-Dielectric Metasurface with a Two-Dimensional Locally Flat Photonic Band</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20871v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Photonic flatbands offer promising light-matter interaction due to their unique slow-light nature. In recent years, flatbands have also attracted significant interest in optical engineering because of their angle-insensitive resonant characteristics. However, to date, no studies have reported the dispersionless behavior of flatbands under arbitrary two-dimensional incident angles. Here, we present a two-dimensional photonic flatband created using a silicon metasurface with a Lieb lattice-inspired structure which demonstrates a locally flat photonic band for both transverse electric (TE) and transverse magnetic (TM) polarized light. Employing Fourier imaging, we analyze the energy-momentum dispersion of the flatband metasurface under arbitrary two-dimensional incident angles, demonstrating dispersionless flatbands with a change in resonance within $\pm2 nm$ up to $\pm24\^o$ or $\pm5\^o$, depending on the polarization state and incident angle. This geometry can be adapted for various applications in local field enhancement, enhanced photodetection, and augmented reality displays.</description>

      <title>Optimizing steady-state synchronization in disordered semiconductor lasers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07302v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Disorder can profoundly influence synchronization in networks of nonlinear oscillators, sometimes enhancing coherence through external tuning. In semiconductor lasers, however, achieving high-quality steady-state synchronization is desired, while intrinsic and typically uncontrollable disorder poses a major challenge. Under fixed frequency disorder, we investigate homogeneous fully coupled external-cavity semiconductor lasers governed by the complex, time-delayed Lang-Kobayashi equations with experimentally relevant parameters and identify an optimal coupling strength that maximizes steady-state synchronization in the weak-coupling regime. This optimum appears for any fixed configuration of intrinsic frequency detuning and scales inversely with the number of lasers, leading to a linear scaling of the total coupling cost with the number of lasers. A theory based on an effective thermodynamic potential explains this disorder-mediated optimization, revealing a general mechanism by which moderate coupling can overcome static heterogeneity in nonlinear physical systems.</description>

      <title>Effects of thermal annealing and film thickness on the structural and optical properties of indium-tin-oxide thin films</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.01441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Indium-tin oxide (ITO) is a crucial functional layer for the optoelectronic applications, such as non-volatile color display thin films based on the ITO/phase-change material (PCM)/ITO/reflective metal multilayer structures on a silicon substrate. In addition to non-volatile color tuning by PCMs, thermally induced crystallization may alter the optical properties of ITO layers as well. But the potential change in color of the ITO layers is not considered so far. In this work, we investigate the structural and optical properties of ITO thin films via X-ray diffraction, spectroscopic ellipsometry and ultraviolet-visible spectrophotometry measurements. After thermal annealing at 250 {\deg}C, the ITO thin films of 15-100 nm get crystallized with strong changes in refractive index n and extinction coefficient k in the visible light range. However, for the 5-nm ITO thin film, crystallization is only observed after thermal annealing at 350 {\deg}C and the change in color is limited upon phase transition. We provide a colormap of the ITO/platinum/silicon structure in terms of the annealing temperature (150-350 {\deg}C) and ITO film thickness (5-100 nm). Our work suggests that the intrinsic change in colors of ITO layers should also be considered for the PCM-based reconfigurable display application.</description>

      <title>Design of Microlens Arrays for Thermal Imaging with Spintronic Poisson Bolometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12491v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Infrared (IR) detectors are widely used for their ability to sense thermal radiation. Recently, a room-temperature infrared detector known as the spintronic Poisson bolometer was introduced. Operating in a probabilistic regime governed by Poissonian counting statistics, it establishes a fundamentally different detection mechanism with the potential to beat conventional sensitivity limits. While offering fast digital readout, its sensitivity is currently limited by a small active area and array fill factor. In this work, we present design guidelines for spherical plano-convex microlens arrays that enhance light collection in spintronic Poisson bolometer arrays in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR). Guided by the simulations, we fabricate a microlens array sample to demonstrate that the chosen geometrical parameters are realistic and compatible with the fabrication process. A unique radiometric-stochastic model is used to quantify the resulting sensitivity improvements. Our work is the first systematic integration of microlens design with spintronic Poisson bolometer arrays, bridging microphotonics, spintronics, and thermal imaging.</description>

      <title>Addressing intramolecular vibrational redistribution in a single molecule through pump and probe surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02117v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development of accurate tools to characterize Intramolecular Vibrational Redistribution (IVR) is of major interest in chemistry. In this context, surface-enhanced vibrational spectroscopies stand up as well-established techniques to study molecular vibrational lines and populations with a sensitivity that can reach the singe-molecule level. However, to date, this possibility has not been fully developed to address IVR. Here, we establish a quantum mechanical framework based on molecular optomechanics that accounts for IVR, and adopt it to analyze strategies to optimize IVR characterization by vibrational spectroscopy. In particular, we model two different pump-and-probe configurations where the vibrational pumping is provided either by infrared laser illumination or by Stokes SERS. We show for the two pumping configurations the existence of clear signatures on the anti-Stokes SERS spectra of population transfer between coupled vibrational modes in a molecule. Our calculations adopt realistic molecular and SERS parameters, suggesting that these signatures of IVR are accessible at the single-molecule level with current experimental platforms.</description>

      <title>Photon blockade effect from synergistic optical parametric amplification and driving force in Kerr-medium single-mode cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01819v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work investigates photon blockade control in a hybrid quantum system containing a Kerr-nonlinear cavity coupled to an optical parametric amplifier (OPA). The dynamics are governed by a master equation derived from an effective Hamiltonian that includes cavity decay. To obtain analytical solutions, the system's quantum state is expanded in the Fock basis up to the two-photon level. Solving the steady-state Schrodinger equation yields probability amplitudes and the analytical conditions for optimal photon blockade. Results confirm that photon blockade is achievable with suitable parameters. Excellent agreement is found between the analytical solutions and numerical simulations for the steady-state, equal-time second-order correlation function, validating both the analytical method and the blockade effect. Numerically, the average intracavity photon number increases significantly under resonance, providing a theoretical pathway for enhancing single-photon source brightness. Furthermore, the driving phase is shown to regulate the optimal blockade region: it shifts the parabolic region within the two-dimensional parameter space of driving strength and OPA nonlinearity and can even reverse its opening direction. The influence of Kerr nonlinearity is also examined. Photon blockade remains robust across a wide range of Kerr strengths. Physical analysis attributes the effect to destructive quantum interference between two distinct excitation pathways that suppress two-photon states. While Kerr nonlinearity shifts the system's energy levels, it does not disrupt this interference mechanism, explaining the effect's stability over a broad parameter range.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Induced Transparency-Absorption and Normal-Anomalous Dispersion Characteristics of ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ Medium or Any J-Type Configuration Atomic Vapors Subject to a Vector Magnetic Field and a Weak Resonant Pump</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02113v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have developed an analytical framework for magnetically induced transparency-absorption (MITA) and normal-anomalous dispersion (MINAD) in a weakly driven ${}^{87}\text{Rb}$ vapor, or any J-type three-level system, under a vector magnetic field. By solving the Bloch equations in the stationary, quasi-stationary, and short-pulse regimes, we obtained closed-form expressions for the atomic populations and coherences and identified a bifurcation in the oscillatory dynamics at zero longitudinal Zeeman splitting. The Fourier-domain analysis reveals alternating transparency/absorption and normal/anomalous dispersion with frequency-dependent sign reversals, enabling spectrally selective filtering and group-delay effects. Slow oscillatory behavior in the radio-frequency range makes the system suitable for weak magnetic-field sensing, while fast oscillations at optical frequencies suggest applications in spectral filtering and frequency-comb-like signal shaping. The results provide a theoretical basis for experimental observation of MITA/MINAD and for optimizing atomic-vapor platforms for precision magnetometry and related photonic functionalities.</description>
