      <title>Oriented bond-site percolation in random environment and contact processes with periodic recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00329v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate oriented bond-site percolation on the planar lattice in which entire columns are stretched. Generalising recent results by Hil\'ario et al., we establish non-trivial percolation under a $(1+\varepsilon)$-th moment condition on the stretches and use this to prove survival of contact processes with periodic recoveries as well as in random environments.</description>

      <title>The strong convergence phenomenon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a seminal 2005 paper, Haagerup and Thorbj{\o}rnsen discovered that the norm of any noncommutative polynomial of independent complex Gaussian random matrices converges to that of a limiting family of operators that arises from Voiculescu's free probability theory. In recent years, new methods have made it possible to establish such strong convergence properties in much more general situations, and to obtain even more powerful quantitative forms of the strong convergence phenomenon. These, in turn, have led to a number of spectacular applications to long-standing open problems on random graphs, hyperbolic surfaces, and operator algebras, and have provided flexible new tools that enable the study of random matrices in unexpected generality. This survey aims to provide an introduction to this circle of ideas.</description>

      <title>Paper-Scissors-Stone Model for Interacting Population and its Limit Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper treats a random collision model of three species, which is represented by the random time change of three standard Poisson processes. The prey-predator relation in the random collision model looks like paper-scissors-stone game, and the model is called the paper-scissors model. At first, we investigate the stochastic structure of our model. By using stochastic calculus, the model is decomposed into a semi-martingale, and we prove a weak law of large numbers and a central limit theorem. The main purpose of this paper is to obtain an ordinary differential equation from the weak law and a stochastic differential equation from the central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>The predicable dance of random walk: local limit theorems on finitely-generated abelian groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In random walk theory, it is customary to assume that a given walk is irreducible and/or aperiodic. While these prevailing assumptions make particularly tractable the analysis of random walks and help to highlight their diffusive nature, they eliminate a natural phenomenon: the dance. This dance can be seen, for example, in the so-called simple random walk on the integers where a random walker moves back and forth between even and odd integers. It can also be seen in the random walk on the integer lattice that takes only those steps available to a knight on a chess board. In this work, we develop a general Fourier-analytic method to describe random walks on finitely-generated abelian groups, making no assumptions concerning aperiodicity or irreducibility. Our main result is a local central limit theorems that describes the large-time behavior of the transition probabilities for any random walk whose driving measure has finite second moments. Generalizing the ubiquitous Gaussian approximation, our asymptotic is given as a product of two functions, one that describes the diffusion and another that describes the dance. Interestingly, our ``dance function" is gotten as a Haar integral over a subgroup of the group's Pontryagin dual. Our results recapture many long-standing results, especially the local limit theorems made famous by F. Spitzer's classic text, Principles of Random Walk.</description>

      <title>Stein's method for max-stable random vectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the omnipresence of extreme value distributions in limit theorems involving extremes of random processes, we adapt Stein's method to include these laws as possible target distributions. We do so by using the generator approach of Stein's method, which is possible thanks to a recently introduced family of semi-groups. We study the corresponding Stein solution and its properties when the working distance is either the smooth Wasserstein distance or the Kolmogorov distance. We make use of those results to bound the distance between two max-stable random vectors, as well as to get a rate of convergence for the de Haan-LePage series in smooth Wasserstein distance.</description>

      <title>A Critical Note on Information Distortion in a Supply Chain The Bullwhip Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the seminal paper Information Distortion in a Supply Chain: The Bullwhip Effect (Lee, et al. 1997, hereafter referred to as LPW), order batching is regarded as one of the four sources of the bullwhip effect. LPW proved that, in all cases (random ordering, balanced ordering, and correlated ordering), order batching will surely lead to bullwhip effects. However, we identify two improper assumptions in LPW. First, the batched order Zt is de facto the moving summation of previous demands, including overlapping demands. In fact, the batched order should be modeled as periodic summation of previous demands. Second, in the random ordering case, the number of retailers n is modeled as a binomial variable which is identically distributed for a randomly chosen period t in a review cycle. In fact, n should follow a sequential hypergeometric distribution. To address the two issues, we decompose a demand sequence using law of the total variance, exploring variance interplay between batched and non-batched demands in the positively correlated case. We find that even under the contrived iid assumption in LPW, order batching does not necessarily lead to the bullwhip effect.</description>

      <title>Malliavin differentiability for the excursion measure of a Gaussian field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00704v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the Malliavin differentiability of the excursion volume of a Gaussian field. In particular, we prove that if the moments of the covariance kernel go to 0 polinomially, then we can determine exactly for which p the excursion measure has pth square integrable Malliavin derivative. While our approach can not be implemented for Gaussian fields indexed by discrete sets (where the moments do not vanish), when the Gaussian field is indexed by Rd and stationary, or indexed by Sd and isotropic, the condition on the polynomial decay of the mentioned moments can be inferred starting from simple and general conditions on the covariance function of the field.</description>

      <title>Dispersion models on a circle: universal properties and asymptotic results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a sequence of masses $m_0,m_1,...$ arriving uniformly at random at some points $u_0,u_1,...$ on the unit circle $\mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z}$ (or on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, in the discrete version). Upon arrival, each mass undergoes a relaxation phase during which it is dispersed, possibly also at random. This process can model many physical phenomena, such as the diffusion of liquid in a porous medium. In the discrete case, it can model parking (related to additive coalescence and hashing with linear probing) in which the cars are permitted to follow random displacement policies.
  The dispersion policies considered in the paper ensure that at time $k$, after the successive dispersions of $m_0,\cdots,m_{k-1}$, the total covered region has Lebesgue measure $m_0+\cdots+m_{k-1}$. Furthermore, during the dispersion of a given mass, the covered domain increases continuously, except when it merges with another covered connected component (CC).
  We show a very general exchangeability property for the sequence of covered CC. Additionally, we demonstrate a universal spacing property between these CC, and a notable general result: if the $(u_i)$ are independent and rotationally invariant, then the number of free (not covered) CC follows a binomial distribution whose parameters depend solely on the number and total mass of arrived particles. Furthermore, conditional on the number of CC, the sizes of the free CC follow a simple Dirichlet distribution in the continuous case, regardless of the dispersion policy considered and the values of the masses. We also characterize the distribution of the occupied space.
  In the second part of the paper, we study the total cost associated with these models for various cost models, and establish connections with the additive coalescent. We also provide an asymptotic representation of the limiting covered space as the number of masses goes to infinity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random fields of scales result when the class of musical scales is thought as a set of sites, and a site can be in one of two possible states (or spins): On or Off. We present a flexible simulated annealing model that produces generic configurations arising from equilibrium states (or Gibbs measures) associated to hamiltonian energy functions defined in terms of musical interactions with parameters that can be manipulated to customize properties of the scales. The starting point is to think of the set of scales as the combinatorial class of integer compositions and the final result is an effective thermodynamic search engine implemented in an open access application for the 12-TET tuning system: Scaletor.</description>

      <title>Random walks in a field of soft traps and criticality for the dissipative Abelian Sandpile Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the dissipative abelian sandpile model, we analyze the trajectories of a one-dimensional random walk in a landscape of soft traps. These traps, placed at increasing distances from each other, correspond to dissipative sites in the associated dissipative abelian sandpile model. We identify a critical growth rate of the sizes of intervals between successive traps where there is a transition between finiteness and non-finiteness of the expected survival time of the random walk. This corresponds to a transition between non-criticality and criticality of the associated dissipative abelian sandpile model. Therefore, in this setting, we thus identify precisely how much dissipation can be added to the original abelian sandpile model in order to disrupt its criticality.</description>

      <title>Geometric Gaussian Approximations of Probability Distributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Approximating complex probability distributions, such as Bayesian posterior distributions, is of central interest in many applications. We study the expressivity of geometric Gaussian approximations. These consist of approximations by Gaussian pushforwards through diffeomorphisms or Riemannian exponential maps. We first review these two different kinds of geometric Gaussian approximations. Then we explore their relationship to one another. We further provide a constructive proof that such geometric Gaussian approximations are universal, in that they can capture any probability distribution. Finally, we discuss whether, given a family of probability distributions, a common diffeomorphism can be found to obtain uniformly high-quality geometric Gaussian approximations for that family.</description>

      <title>Generalization performance of narrow one-hidden layer networks in the teacher-student setting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00629v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. networks with a large number of hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of weight statistics. In doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or full-batch gradient descent.</description>

      <title>Closed Estimates of Leray Projected Transport Noise and Strong Solutions of the Stochastic Euler Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.00787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the incompressible Euler and Navier-Stokes equations on the three dimensional torus, in velocity form, perturbed by a transport or transport-stretching Stratonovich noise. Closed control of the noise contributions in energy estimates are demonstrated, for any positive integer ordered Sobolev Space and the equivalent Stokes Space; difficulty arises due to the presence of the Leray Projector disrupting cancellation of the top order derivative. This is particularly pertinent in the case of a transport noise without stretching, where the vorticity form cannot be used. As a consequence we obtain, for the first time, the existence of a local strong solution to the corresponding stochastic Euler equation. Furthermore, smooth solutions are shown to exist until blow-up in $L^1\left([0,T];W^{1,\infty}\right)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.00834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we use the Vandermonde matrices and their properties to give a new proof of the classical result of Karl Weierstrass about the approximation of continuous functions $f$ on closed intervals, using a sequence of polynomials. The proof solves linear systems of equations using that the Vandermonde matrices have always non zero determinants, when the entries of the power series of the rows of the matrix are all different. We provide several examples, and we also use our method to observe that the sequence of polynomials that we construct algebraically approaches the Taylor series of a function $f$ which is infinitely differentiable.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.13739v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In [arXiv:1701.00018, arXiv:2107.07984] an explicit biorthogonalization method was developed that applies to a class of determinantal measures which describe the evolution of several variants of classical interacting particle systems in the KPZ universality class. The method leads to explicit Fredholm determinant formulas for the multipoint distributions of these systems which are suitable for asymptotic analysis. In this paper we extend the method to a broader class of determinantal measures which is applicable to systems where particles have different jump speeds and different memory lengths. As an application of our results we study three particular examples: some variants of TASEP with two blocks of particles having different speeds, a version of discrete time TASEP which mixes particles with sequential and parallel update, and a version of sequential TASEP with a block of long memory particles placed at the bulk of the system.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17635v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ be an $n\times n$ matrix with iid entries where $A_{ij} \sim \mathrm{Ber}(p)$ is a Bernoulli random variable with parameter $p = d/n$. We show that the empirical measure of the eigenvalues converges, in probability, to a deterministic distribution as $n \rightarrow \infty$. This essentially resolves a long line of work to determine the spectral laws of iid matrices and is the first known example for non-Hermitian random matrices at this level of sparsity.</description>

      <title>Off-diagonal long-range order for the free Bose gas via the Feynman--Kac formula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.07481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.07481v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the path-integral representation of the ideal Bose gas under various boundary conditions. We show that Bose--Einstein condensation occurs at the famous critical density threshold, by proving that its $1$-particle-reduced density matrix exhibits off-diagonal long-range order above that threshold, but not below. Our proofs are based on the well-known Feynman--Kac formula and a representation in terms of a crucial Poisson point process. Furthermore, in the condensation regime, we derive a law of large numbers with strong concentration for the number of particles in short loops. In contrast to the situation for free boundary conditions, where the entire condensate sits in just one loop, for all other boundary conditions we obtain the limiting Poisson--Dirichlet distribution for the collection of the lengths of all long loops. Our proofs are new and purely probabilistic (apart from a standard eigenvalue expansion), using elementary tools like Markov's inequality, Poisson point processes, combinatorial formulas for cardinalities of particular partition sets, and asymptotics for random walks with Pareto-distributed steps.</description>

      <title>The golf model on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ and on $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13380v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a particle model, that we call the $\textit{golf model}$. Initially, on a graph $G$, balls and holes are placed at random on some distinct vertices. The balls then move one by one, doing a random walk on $G$, starting from their initial vertex and stopping at the first empty hole they encounter, which they fill. On finite graphs, under reasonable assumptions (if there are more holes than balls, and if the Markov chain characterizing the random walks is irreducible) a final configuration is reached almost surely. In the paper, we are mainly interested in ${\bf H}^1$, the set of remaining holes. We give the distribution of ${\bf H}^1$ on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, and describe a phase transition for the largest distance between two consecutive holes when the number of remaining holes is of order $\sqrt{n}$. We show that the model on $\mathbb{Z}$ is well-defined if every vertex contains either a ball with probability $d_{\sf b}$, a hole with probability $d_{\sf h}$, or nothing, independently from the other vertices, as long as $d_{\sf b} \leq d_{\sf h}$, and we describe the law of ${\bf H}^1$ in this case.</description>

      <title>Large random matrices with given margins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study large random matrices with i.i.d. entries conditioned to have prescribed row and column sums (margins), a problem connected to relative entropy minimization, Schr\"odinger bridges, contingency tables, and random graphs with given degree sequences. Our central result is a `transference principle': the complex margin-conditioned matrix can be closely approximated by a simpler matrix whose entries are independent and drawn from an exponential tilting of the original model. The tilt parameters are determined by the sum of two potentials. We establish phase diagrams for `tame margins', where these potentials are uniformly bounded. This framework resolves a 2011 conjecture by Chatterjee, Diaconis, and Sly on $\delta$-tame degree sequences and generalizes a sharp phase transition in contingency tables obtained by Dittmer, Lyu, and Pak in 2020. For tame margins, we show that a generalized Sinkhorn algorithm can compute the potentials at a dimension-free exponential rate. Our limit theory further establishes that for a convergent sequence of tame margins, the potentials converge as fast as the margins converge.
  We apply this framework and obtain several key results for the conditioned matrix: The marginal distribution of any single entry is asymptotically an exponential tilting of the base measure, resolving a 2010 conjecture by Barvinok on contingency tables. The conditioned matrix concentrates in cut norm around a `typical table' (the expectation of the tilted model), which acts as a static Schr\"odinger bridge between the margins. The empirical singular value distribution of the rescaled matrix converges to an explicit law determined by the variance profile of the tilted model. In particular, we confirm the universality of the Marchenko-Pastur law for constant linear margins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19878v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The transpose top-$2$ with random shuffle (J. Theoret. Probab., 2020) is a lazy random walk on the alternating group $A_n$ generated by $3$-cycles of the form $(\star,n-1,n)$ and $(\star,n,n-1)$. We obtain the limit profile of this random walk by comparing it with the random walk on $A_n$ generated by all $3$-cycles. Our method employs a non-commutative Fourier analysis analogue of the comparison method introduced by Nestoridi (Electron. J. Probab., 2024). We also give the complete spectrum of the alternating group graph, thus answering a question of Huang and Huang (J. Algebraic Combin., 2019).</description>

Abstract: We prove a conjecture of Levine and Silvestri that the driven-dissipative activated random walk model on an interval drives itself directly to and then sustains a critical density.

      <description>arXiv:2502.17076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the action of local conformal transformations on several measures related to the Gaussian free field and Schramm--Loewner evolutions. The main novelty of our work is a Cameron--Martin-type formula for the welding homeomorphism of the SLE loop measure ($\kappa\in(0,4]$); its proof relies on a rigorous interpretation (and computation) of the "Jacobian" of the conformal welding map, which we relate to the "$bc$-ghost system" from bosonic string theory. We also give an intrinsic definition of the trace of the GFF on SLE, and prove a characterisation of the free boundary GFF in $\mathbb{D}$. As an application, we introduce a new and intrinsic approach to the conformal welding of quantum surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We analyze pivot probabilities in Gaussian elimination with partial pivoting (GEPP) for $2 \times 2$ random matrix ensembles. For GUE matrices, we resolve a previously reported discrepancy between theoretical predictions and empirical observations by deriving the exact pivot probability under standard LAPACK-style implementations. We further show that Dumitriu-Edelman tridiagonal $\beta$-ensembles agree with the earlier theoretical expectations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we prove a conjecture by Aas and Linusson on the two-point correlations of adjacent particles in a continuous multispecies TASEP on a ring (AIHPD, 2018). We use the theory of multiline queues as devised by Ferrari and Martin (AOP, 2008) to interpret the conjectures in terms of placements of numbers in triangular arrays. Further, we use projections to calculate correlations in the continuous multispecies TASEP using a distribution on these placements.</description>

Abstract: We analyze the combinatorics behind the operation of taking the logarithm of the generating function $G_k$ for $k^\text{th}$ generalized Catalan numbers. We provide combinatorial interpretations in terms of lattice paths and in terms of tree graphs. Using explicit bijections, we are able to recover known closed expressions for the coefficients of $\log G_k$ by purely combinatorial means of enumeration. The non-algebraic proof easily generalizes to higher powers $\log^a G_k$, $a\geq 2$.</description>

      <title>Hardest Monotone Functions for Evolutionary Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07438v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we revisit the question how hard it can be for the $(1+1)$ Evolutionary Algorithm to optimize monotone pseudo-Boolean functions. By introducing a more pessimistic stochastic process, the partially-ordered evolutionary algorithm (PO-EA) model, Jansen first proved a runtime bound of $O(n^{3/2})$. More recently, Lengler, Martinsson and Steger improved this upper bound to $O(n \log^2 n)$ by an entropy compression argument. In this work, we analyze monotone functions that may adversarially vary at each step of the optimization, so-called dynamic monotone functions. We introduce the function Switching Dynamic BinVal (SDBV) and prove, using a combinatorial argument, that for the $(1+1)$-EA with any mutation rate $p \in [0,1]$, SDBV is drift minimizing within the class of dynamic monotone functions. We further show that the $(1+1)$-EA optimizes SDBV in $\Theta(n^{3/2})$ generations. Therefore, our construction provides the first explicit example which realizes the pessimism of the \poea model. Our simulations demonstrate matching runtimes for both the static and the self-adjusting $(1,\lambda)$-EA and $(1+\lambda)$-EA. Moreover, devising an example for fixed dimension, we illustrate that drift minimization does not equal maximal runtime beyond asymptotic analysis.</description>

      <title>An Unconditional Representation of the Conditional Score in Infinite-Dimensional Linear Inverse Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15643v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models (SDMs) have emerged as a powerful tool for sampling from the posterior distribution in Bayesian inverse problems. However, existing methods often require multiple evaluations of the forward mapping to generate a single sample, resulting in significant computational costs for large-scale inverse problems. To address this, we propose an unconditional representation of the conditional score-function (UCoS) tailored to linear inverse problems, which avoids forward model evaluations during sampling by shifting computational effort to an offline training phase. In this phase, a task-dependent score function is learned based on the linear forward operator. Crucially, we show that the conditional score can be derived exactly from a trained (unconditional) score using affine transformations, eliminating the need for conditional score approximations. Our approach is formulated in infinite-dimensional function spaces, making it inherently discretization-invariant. We support this formulation with a rigorous convergence analysis that justifies UCoS beyond any specific discretization. Finally we validate UCoS through high-dimensional computed tomography (CT) and image deblurring experiments, demonstrating both scalability and accuracy.</description>

      <title>Meta-Posterior Consistency for the Bayesian Inference of Metastable System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01868v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The vast majority of the literature on learning dynamical systems or stochastic processes from time series has focused on stable or ergodic systems, for both Bayesian and frequentist inference procedures. However, most real-world systems are only metastable, that is, the dynamics appear to be stable on some time scale, but are in fact unstable over longer time scales. Consistency of inference for metastable systems may not be possible, but one can ask about metaconsistency: Do inference procedures converge when observations are taken over a large but finite time interval, but diverge on longer time scales? In this paper we introduce, discuss, and quantify metaconsistency in a Bayesian framework. We discuss how metaconsistency can be exploited to efficiently infer a model for a sub-system of a larger system, where inference on the global behavior may require much more data, or there is no theoretical guarantee as to the asymptotic success of inference procedures. We also discuss the relation between metaconsistency and the spectral properties of the model dynamical system in the case of uniformly ergodic and non-ergodic diffusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.02054v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Three mathematical constants bear the name of the venerable Leonhard Euler: Euler's number, $e=2.718281\ldots$; the Euler-Mascheroni constant, $\gamma=0.577216\ldots$; and the Euler-Gompertz constant, $\delta=0.596347\ldots$. In the present work, we consider two joint appearances of these constants, one in a well-known equation of Hardy (interpretable in connection with inverse second moments of the Poisson probability distribution), and the other from a sequence of probabilities generated by recursively conditional Exponential (i.e., Poisson-event waiting-time) distributions. In both cases, we explore generalizations of the initial observations to offer more comprehensive results, including extensions of Hardy's equation.</description>

      <title>Duality and Policy Evaluation in Distributionally Robust Bayesian Diffusion Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19294v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a Bayesian diffusion control problem of expected terminal utility maximization. The controller imposes a prior distribution on the unknown drift of an underlying diffusion. The Bayesian optimal control, tracking the posterior distribution of the unknown drift, can be characterized explicitly. However, in practice, the prior will generally be incorrectly specified, and the degree of model misspecification can have a significant impact on policy performance. To mitigate this and reduce overpessimism, we introduce a distributionally robust Bayesian control (DRBC) formulation in which the controller plays a game against an adversary who selects a prior in divergence neighborhood of a baseline prior. The adversarial approach has been studied in economics and efficient algorithms have been proposed in static optimization settings. We develop a strong duality result for our DRBC formulation. Combining these results together with tools from stochastic analysis, we are able to derive a loss that can be efficiently trained (as we demonstrate in our numerical experiments) using a suitable neural network architecture. As a result, we obtain an effective algorithm for computing the DRBC optimal strategy. The methodology for computing the DRBC optimal strategy is greatly simplified, as we show, in the important case in which the adversary chooses a prior from a Kullback-Leibler distributional uncertainty set.</description>
