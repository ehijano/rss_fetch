      <title>FDTRImageEnhancer: Combining Physics-Informed Deconvolution and Microstructure-Aware Deep Learning to Enhance Thermal Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FDTRImageEnhancer, an open-source computational framework that improves thermal conductivity mapping from Frequency Domain ThermoReflectance (FDTR) phase data by integrating a physics-based Gaussian convolution abstraction with microstructure-aware deep learning. The Gaussian kernel models the spatial averaging effects of pump and probe beams, while k-means clustering of high-resolution structural images reduces the parameter space for inverse modeling. A physics-informed neural network jointly minimizes phase-data error and deviation from analytically recovered conductivity maps, enabling the detection of grain boundary thermal conductivity drops visually obscured in conventional FDTR inversions. Demonstrated on finite element-generated synthetic data, the framework recovers bulk values within less than 0.5% error and qualitatively resolves grain boundary effects despite limited image resolution. Full Python code and datasets are provided for reproducibility, with the methodology readily adaptable to other inverse thermal transport problems.</description>

      <title>The non-contact assessment of the bridge expansion joint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is to provide information on a newly developed design methodology for the evaluation of bridge expansion joints with respect to their noise emission and overall technical condition. The methodology also gives recommendations for operational non-destructive measurements of the condition of bridge gates using a crossing laser sensors, CPX sensors or the necessary technical equipment and the method of collecting, processing and evaluating the measured data. The method can easily scan and evaluate geometry and/or noise emission of extensive number of joints by passing them without traffic interruption. The aim is to establish a methodology for comparing the noise and condition of bridge expansion joints in the road network, both over time (monitoring long-term trends in noise emission and degradation) and comparing different states and different types of bridge closures between each other.</description>

      <title>Monitoring, assessment and numerical analysis of the masonry bridge pier defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The paper thoroughly analyses the significant cracking on the newly refurbished masonry bridge pier in Lovosice. The cracks of width up to 15 mm appeared shortly after the reconstruction of the bridge and were the subject of a detailed assessment. First, a monitoring system was mounted to analyse the behaviour during the year and the dependency on the temperature. Next, a dive inspection was done in order to evaluate the conditions under the water. The next step was to make a diagnostics survey, based on the drilling, endoscopic tests and water pressure tests. Based on the results, several detailed numerical models were created in order to analyse the pier behaviour and conduct a parametric study to investigate various factors, leading to the defects. The numerical models covered the complex geometry of the pier, consisting of the inner poor concrete core and outer shell from sandstone masonry blocks. The above-described procedure revealed the causes of the defects and also recommended the proper strengthening of the pier.</description>

      <title>Global Forecasting of Tropical Cyclone Intensity Using Neural Weather Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP) models that integrate coupled physical equations forward in time are the traditional tools for simulating atmospheric processes and forecasting weather. With recent advancements in deep learning, Neural Weather Models (NeWMs) have emerged as competent medium-range NWP emulators, with performances that compare favorably to state-of-the-art NWP models. However, they are commonly trained on reanalyses with limited spatial resolution (e.g., 0.25{\deg} horizontal grid spacing), which smooths out key features of weather systems. For example, tropical cyclones (TCs)-among the most impactful weather events due to their devastating effects on human activities-are challenging to forecast, as extrema like wind gusts, used as proxies for TC intensity, are smoothed in deterministic forecasts at 0.25{\deg} resolution. To address this, we use our best observational estimates of wind gusts and minimum sea level pressure to train a hierarchy of post-processing models on NeWM outputs. Applied to Pangu-Weather and FourCastNet v2, the post-processing models produce accurate and reliable forecasts of TC intensity up to five days ahead. Our post-processing algorithm is tracking-independent, preventing full misses, and we demonstrate that even linear models extract predictive information from NeWM outputs beyond what is encoded in their initial conditions. While spatial masking improves probabilistic forecast consistency, we do not find clear advantages of convolutional architectures over simple multilayer perceptrons for our NeWM post-processing purposes. Overall, by combining the efficiency of NeWMs with a lightweight, tracking-independent post-processing framework, our approach improves the accessibility of global TC intensity forecasts, marking a step toward their democratization.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Backscatter Model for Unstructured Solvers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stochastic Backscatter Model involves the generation of a set of random variables characterised by prescribed correlations in space and time. These variables are obtained by smoothing an initially uncorrelated random field, which produces an exponentially decaying spatial correlation. The smoothing is applied implicitly and sequentially along the three coordinate directions of the computational domain, making the approach suitable only for structured CFD solvers. To extend the method to unstructured solvers, implicit Laplace smoothing can be employed instead. However, the spatial correlation resulting from this alternative approach must be derived analytically. This constitutes the main objective of the present dissertation.</description>

      <title>A meshless method for computational electromagnetics with improved dispersion properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The finite difference time domain method is one of the most popular methods in computational electromagnetics. This work considers two possible ways of generalising it to a meshless setting by employing local radial basis function interpolation. The resulting methods turn out to be unstable, but can be stabilised by adding properly chosen hyperviscosity terms to the update equations. We demonstrate that the proposed meshless methods are convergent and can enjoy a decreased dispersion anisotropy compared to the finite difference time domain method.</description>

      <title>Interplay between trimer structure and magnetic ground state in Ba5Ru3O12 probed by Neutron and muSR techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06113v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report a detailed inelastic neutron scattering (INS) and muon spin relaxation (muSR) investigation of a trimer Ruthenate Ba5Ru3O12 system, which undergoes long-range antiferromagnetic ordering at TN = 60 K. The INS reveals two distinct spin wave excitations below TN: one at 5.6 meV and the other at 10-15 meV. By accompanying the INS spectra based on a linear spin wave theory using SpinW software and machine learning force fields (MLFFs), we show that Ba5Ru3O12 exhibits spin frustration due to competing exchange interactions between neighboring and next-neighboring Ru-moments, exchange anisotropy, and strong spin-orbit coupling, which yields a non-collinear spin structure, in contrast to other ruthenate trimers in this series. Interestingly, these magnetic excitations do not completely vanish even at high temperatures above TN, evidencing short-range magnetic correlations in this trimer system. This is further supported by muSR spectroscopy, which exhibits a gradual drop in the initial asymmetry around the magnetic phase transition and is further verified through maximum entropy analysis. The results of muSR spectroscopy indicate a dynamic nature of magnetic order, attributed to local magnetic anisotropy within the trimer as a result of local structural distortion and different hybridization, consistent with canted spin-structure. We predict the ground state of Ru3O12-isolated trimer through theoretical calculations, which agree with the experimentally observed spin excitation</description>

      <title>Hamiltonian Simulation for Advection-Diffusion Equation with arbitrary transport field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel approach to solve the advection-diffusion equation under arbitrary transporting fields using a quantum-inspired 'Schrodingerisation' technique for Hamiltonian simulation. Although numerous methods exist for solving partial differential equations (PDEs), Hamiltonian simulation remains a relatively underexplored yet promising direction-particularly in the context of long-term, fault-tolerant quantum computing. Building on this potential, our quantum algorithm is designed to accommodate non-trivial, spatially varying transport fields and is applicable to both 2D and 3D advection-diffusion problems. To ensure numerical stability and accuracy, the algorithm combines an upwinding discretization scheme for the advective component and the central differencing for diffusion, adapted for quantum implementation through a tailored mix of approximation and optimization techniques. We demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness on benchmark scenarios involving coupled rotational, shear, and diffusive transport in two and three dimensions. Additionally, we implement the 2D advection-diffusion equation using 16 qubits on IBM Quantum hardware, validating our method and highlighting its practical applicability and robustness.</description>

      <title>Harmonic potentials in the de Rham complex</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16822v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Representing vector fields by scalar or vector potentials can be a challenging task in domains with cavities or tunnels, due to the presence of harmonic fields which are both irrotational and solenoidal but may have no scalar or vector potentials. For harmonic fields normal to the boundary, which can exist in domains with cavities, it is possible to define scalar potentials with Dirichlet boundary conditions fitted to the domain's cavities. For harmonic fields tangent to the boundary, which can exist in domains with tunnels, a similar construction was lacking. In this article we present a construction of vector potentials that yield a basis for the tangent harmonic fields. Our vector potentials are obtained by solving curl-curl problems with inhomogeneous tangent boundary conditions that are fitted to closed curves looping around the tunnels. Applied to structure-preserving finite elements, our method also provides an exact geometric parametrization of the discrete harmonic fields.</description>

      <title>TheUse of Conditional Variational Autoencoders in Generating Stellar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) that generates stellar spectra covering 4000 $\le$ $T_{\mathrm{eff}$ $\le$ 11,000 K, $2.0 \le \log g \le 5.0$ dex, $-1.5 \le [\mathrm{M}/\mathrm{H}] \le +1.5$ dex, $v\sin i \le 300$ km/s, $\xi_t$ between 0 and 4 km/s, and for any instrumental resolving powers less than 115,000. The spectra can be calculated in the wavelength range 4450-5400 \AA. Trained on a grid of \textsc{SYNSPEC} spectra, the network synthesizes a spectrum in around two orders of magnitude faster than line-by-line radiative transfer. We validate the CVAE on $10^4$ test spectra unseen during training. Pixel-wise statistics yield a median absolute residual of &lt;$1.8\times10^{-3}$ flux units with no wavelength-dependent bias. A residual error map across the parameters plane shows $\langle|\Delta F|\rangle&lt;2\times10^{-3}$ everywhere, and marginal diagnostics versus $T_{\mathrm{eff}}$, $\log g$, $v\sin i$, $\xi_t$, and $[Fe/H]$\ reveal no relevant trends. These results demonstrate that the CVAE can serve as a drop-in, physics-aware surrogate for radiative transfer codes, enabling real-time forward modeling in stellar parameter inference and offering promising tools for spectra synthesis for large astrophysical data analysis.</description>

      <title>Predict open quantum dynamics with data-informed quantum-classical dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a data-informed quantum-classical dynamics (DIQCD) approach for predicting the evolution of an open quantum system. The equation of motion in DIQCD is a Lindblad equation with a flexible, time-dependent Hamiltonian that can be optimized to fit sparse and noisy data from local observations of an extensive open quantum system. We demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of DIQCD for both experimental and simulated quantum devices. We show that DIQCD can predict entanglement dynamics of ultracold molecules (Calcium Fluoride) in optical tweezer arrays. DIQCD also successfully predicts carrier mobility in organic semiconductors (Rubrene) with accuracy comparable to nearly exact numerical methods.</description>

      <title>Cooperative Suppression Strategy for Dual Thermal Transport Channels in Crystalline Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel design principle for achieving ultralow thermal conductivity in crystalline materials via a "heavy-light and soft-stiff" structural motif. By combining heavy and light atomic species with soft and stiff bonding networks, both particle-like ($\kappa_p$) and wave-like ($\kappa_c$) phonon transport channels are concurrently suppressed. First-principles calculations show that this architecture induces a hierarchical phonon spectrum: soft-bonded heavy atoms generate dense low-frequency modes that enhance scattering and reduce $\kappa_p$, while stiff-bonded light atoms produce sparse high-frequency optical branches that disrupt coherence and lower $\kappa_c$. High-throughput screening identifies Tl$_4$SiS$_4$ ($\kappa_p$ = 0.10, $\kappa_c$ = 0.06 W/mK) and Tl$_4$GeS$_4$ ($\kappa_p$ = 0.09, $\kappa_c$ = 0.06 W/mK) as representative candidates with strongly suppressed transport in both channels. A minimal 1D triatomic chain model further demonstrates the generality of this mechanism, offering a new paradigm for phonon engineering beyond the conventional $\kappa_p$-$\kappa_c$ trade-off.</description>

      <title>Structured Quantum Baths with Memory: A QuTiP Framework for Spectral Diagnostics and Machine Learning Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17514v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a compact simulation framework for modeling open quantum systems coupled to structured, memory-retaining baths using QuTiP. Our method models the bath as a finite set of layered qubits with adjustable connections, interpreted either as a physical realization or as a conceptual representation, rather than as a continuum. This explicit modeling enables direct control over non-Markovian dynamics and allows spectral diagnostics via Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of system observables. Using a triangle-based bath motif and its extension to a six-qubit anisotropic fractal-like architecture, we demonstrate how spectral fingerprints encode bath topology and memory depth. Standard machine learning tools such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and gradient boosting can then be employed to infer bath parameters and estimate proximity to exceptional points (EPs). The results suggest that spectral analysis can serve as a unifying, quantum-platform agnostic tool across theory, simulation, and experiment, offering both a student-accessible and experimentally relevant approach to understanding coherence loss and memory flow in quantum hardware. Rather than treating noise as an adversary to be eliminated, our approach views structured baths as collaborative partners, enabling controlled memory and delocalized memory and information flow for engineered quantum dynamics. In addition to its diagnostic power, the framework offers a modular and reproducible platform for teaching open quantum systems. Ultimately, we frame this as a pedagogical tool: students can pair FFT-based spectral features with lightweight ML (e.g., PCA and gradient boosting) to extract data-rich, interpretable signatures of open-system and non-Hermitian dynamics.</description>

      <title>Solving advection equations with reduction multigrids on GPUs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Methods for solving hyperbolic systems typically depend on unknown ordering (e.g., Gauss-Seidel, or sweep/wavefront/marching methods) to achieve good convergence. For many discretisations, mesh types or decompositions these methods do not scale well in parallel. In this work we demonstrate that the combination of AIRG (a reduction multigrid which uses GMRES polynomials) and PMISR DDC (a CF splitting algorithm which gives diagonally dominant submatrices) can be used to solve linear advection equations in parallel on GPUs with good weak scaling. We find that GMRES polynomials are well suited to GPUs when applied matrix-free, either as smoothers (at low order) or as an approximate coarse grid solver (at high order). To improve the parallel performance we automatically truncate the multigrid hierarchy given the quality of the polynomials as coarse grid solvers. Solving time-independent advection equations in 2D on structured grids, we find 66-101% weak scaling efficiency in the solve and 47-63% in the setup with AIRG, across the majority of Lumi-G, a pre-exascale GPU machine.</description>

      <title>Thomson problem on a spherical cap</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17625v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the low-energy configurations of N mutually repelling charges confined to a spherical cap and interacting via the Coulomb potential. In the continuum limit, this problem was solved by Lord Kelvin, who found a non-uniform charge distribution with an integrable singularity at the boundary. To explore the discrete analogue, we developed an efficient numerical method that enables energy minimization while maintaining the number of charges at the cap's edge fixed. Using this approach we have obtained numerical results for various values of N and cap angular widths. Based on these results, we analyze the emergence and behavior of topological defects as functions of both N and the cap's curvature.</description>

      <title>Harnessing the edge of chaos for combinatorial optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.17655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems with continuous variables can be used for solving combinatorial optimization problems with discrete variables.In particular, numerical simulations of them can be used as heuristic algorithms with a desirable property, namely, parallelizability, which allows us to execute them in a massively parallel manner using cutting-edge many-core processors, leading to ultrafast performance. However, the dynamical-system approaches with continuous variables are usually less accurate than conventional approaches with discrete variables such as simulated annealing. To improve the solution accuracy of a representative dynamical system-based algorithm called simulated bifurcation (SB), which was found from classical simulation of a quantum nonlinear oscillator network exhibiting quantum bifurcation, here we generalize it by introducing nonlinear control of individual bifurcation parameters and show that the generalized SB (GSB) can achieve almost 100% success probabilities for some large-scale problems. As a result, the time to solution for a 2,000-variable problem is shortened to 10 ms by a GSB-based machine, which is two orders of magnitude shorter than the best known value, 1.3 s, previously obtained by an SB-based machine. To examine the reason for the ultrahigh performance, we investigated chaos in the GSB changing the nonlinear-control strength and found that the dramatic increase of success probabilities happens near the edge of chaos. That is, the GSB can find a solution with high probability by harnessing the edge of chaos. This finding suggests that dynamical-system approaches to combinatorial optimization will be enhanced by harnessing the edge of chaos, opening a broad possibility to tackle intractable combinatorial optimization problems by nature-inspired approaches.</description>

      <title>One pocket to activate them all: Efforts on understanding the modulator pocket in K2P channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The modulator pocket is a cryptic site discovered in the TREK1 K2P channel that accommodates agonists capable of increasing the channel's activity. Since its discovery, equivalent sites in other K2P channels have been shown to bind various ligands, both endogenous and exogenous. In this review, we attempt to elucidate how the modulator pocket contributes to K2P channel activation. To this end, we first describe the gating mechanisms reported in the literature and rationalize their modes of action. We then highlight previous experimental and computational evidence for agonists that bind to the modulator pocket, together with mutations at this site that affect gating. Finally, we elaborate how the activation signal arising from the modulator pocket is transduced to the gates in K2P channels. In doing so, we outline a potential common modulator pocket architecture across K2P channels: a largely amphipathic structure -consistent with the expected properties of a pocket exposed at the interface between a hydrophobic membrane and the aqueous solvent- but still with some important channel-sequence-variations. This architecture and its key differences can be leveraged for the design of new selective and potent modulators.</description>

      <title>Numerical investigations around the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Theorem on Log-lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the recent concept of fluids projected onto Log-Lattices, we investigate the validity of the Gallavotti-Cohen Fluctuation Theorem (GCFT) in the context of fluid mechanics. The dynamics of viscous flows are inherently irreversible, which violates a fundamental assumption of the fluctuation theorem. To address this issue, Gallavotti introduced a new model, the Reversible Navier-Stokes Equation (RNS), which recovers the time-reversal symmetry of the Navier-Stokes (NS) equations while retaining the core characteristics of the latter. We show that for fluids on Log-Lattices, the GCFT holds for the RNS system. Furthermore, we show that this result can be extended, under certain assumptions, to the traditional, irreversible Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, we show that the phase space contraction rate satisfies a large deviation relation which rate function can be estimated.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-induced magnetism in fullerene monolayers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18125v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using molecular orbital theory, we introduce magnetism in pure-carbon, charge-neutral fullerene monolayers which are otherwise non-magnetic. By controlling either molecular or lattice symmetry, we can realise highly-tuneable magnetic fullerene monolayers. We demonstrate a general design principle based on group theory analysis and explain the origin of magnetism using two representative systems with $S_4$ and $C_3$ molecular symmetries. Moreover, for building blocks that lack appropriate molecular symmetry, we can enforce crystalline symmetry to induce magnetism as well. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of realising our proposed magnetic fullerene monolayers by examining a previously synthesised C$_{60}$ system. Our work opens a new direction in introducing magnetism in non-magnetic building blocks by enforcing either molecular or lattice symmetry.</description>

      <title>Geometry and dynamics of spring networks of spherical topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18184v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spring network model constitutes the backbone in the representations of a host of physical systems. In this work, we report the disturbance-driven microscopic dynamics of an isolated, closed spring network of spherical topology in mechanical equilibrium. The system permits self-intersection. We first show the lowest-energy configurations of the closed spring networks as packings of regular triangles. The dynamics of the disturbed spring network is analyzed from the multiple perspectives of energetics, structural instability, and speed distribution. We reveal the crumpling transition of strongly disturbed spring networks and the rapid convergence of the speed distribution toward the Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This work demonstrates the rich physics arising from the interplay of flexibility and dynamics. The results may yield insights into the shape fluctuation and structural instability of deformable membranes from the dynamical perspective.</description>

      <title>Uncertain data assimilation for urban wind flow simulations with OpenLB-UQ</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18202v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate prediction of urban wind flow is essential for urban planning, pedestrian safety, and environmental management. Yet, it remains challenging due to uncertain boundary conditions and the high cost of conventional CFD simulations. This paper presents the use of the modular and efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) framework OpenLB-UQ for urban wind flow simulations. We specifically use the lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) coupled with a stochastic collocation (SC) approach based on generalized polynomial chaos (gPC). The framework introduces a relative-error noise model for inflow wind speeds based on real measurements. The model is propagated through a non-intrusive SC LBM pipeline using sparse-grid quadrature. Key quantities of interest, including mean flow fields, standard deviations, and vertical profiles with confidence intervals, are efficiently computed without altering the underlying deterministic solver. We demonstrate this on a real urban scenario, highlighting how uncertainty localizes in complex flow regions such as wakes and shear layers. The results show that the SC LBM approach provides accurate, uncertainty-aware predictions with significant computational efficiency, making OpenLB-UQ a practical tool for real-time urban wind analysis.</description>

      <title>Flexibility-Conditioned Protein Structure Design with Flow Matching</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18211v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in geometric deep learning and generative modeling have enabled the design of novel proteins with a wide range of desired properties. However, current state-of-the-art approaches are typically restricted to generating proteins with only static target properties, such as motifs and symmetries. In this work, we take a step towards overcoming this limitation by proposing a framework to condition structure generation on flexibility, which is crucial for key functionalities such as catalysis or molecular recognition. We first introduce BackFlip, an equivariant neural network for predicting per-residue flexibility from an input backbone structure. Relying on BackFlip, we propose FliPS, an SE(3)-equivariant conditional flow matching model that solves the inverse problem, that is, generating backbones that display a target flexibility profile. In our experiments, we show that FliPS is able to generate novel and diverse protein backbones with the desired flexibility, verified by Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. FliPS and BackFlip are available at https://github.com/graeter-group/flips .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19806v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Time delays increase the effective dimensionality of reservoirs, thus suggesting that time delays in reservoirs can enhance their performance, particularly their memory and prediction abilities. We find new closed-form expressions for memory and prediction functions of linear time-delayed reservoirs in terms of the power spectrum of the input and the reservoir transfer function. We confirm this relationship numerically for some time-delayed reservoirs using simulations, including when the reservoir can be linearized but is actually nonlinear. Finally, we use these closed-form formulae to address the utility of multiple time delays in linear reservoirs in order to perform memory and prediction, finding similar results to previous work on nonlinear reservoirs. We hope these closed-form formulae can be used to understand memory and predictive capabilities in time-delayed reservoirs.</description>

Abstract: We present a Machine Learning approach based on Symbolic Regression to derive, from either numerically generated or experimentally measured spectral data, closed-form expressions that model the optical properties of biological materials. To evaluate the performance of our approach, we consider three case studies with the aim of retrieving the refractive index of the materials that constitute the biological structures considered. The results obtained show that, in addition to retrieving readable and dimensionally homogeneous dispersion models, the expressions found have a physical meaning and their algebraic form is similar to that of the models used to characterize the dispersive behavior of transparent dielectrics in the visible region.</description>

Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping inverse design in manufacturing, enabling high-performance discovery in materials, products, and processes. However, purely data-driven approaches often struggle in realistic manufacturing settings characterized by sparse data, high-dimensional design spaces, and complex constraints. This perspective proposes an integrated framework built on three complementary pillars: domain knowledge to establish physically meaningful objectives and constraints while removing variables with limited relevance, physics-informed machine learning to enhance generalization under limited or biased data, and large language model-based interfaces to support intuitive, human-centered interaction. Using injection molding as an illustrative example, we demonstrate how these components can operate in practice and conclude by highlighting key challenges for applying such approaches in realistic manufacturing environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.13521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a compact, noise-resilient reconstructive spectrometer-on-a-chip that achieves high-resolution hyperspectral imaging across an extended near-infrared (NIR) range up to 1100nm. The device integrates monolithically fabricated silicon photodiodes enhanced with photon-trapping surface textures (PTST), enabling improved responsivity in the low-absorption NIR regime. Leveraging a fully connected neural network, we demonstrate accurate spectral reconstruction from only 16 uniquely engineered detectors, achieving &lt;0.05 RMSE and 8nm resolution over a wide spectral range of 640nm to 1100nm. Our system outperforms conventional spectrometers, maintaining signal-to-noise ratio above 30dB even with 40dB of added detector noise; extending functionality to longer wavelengths up to 1100nm, while the traditional spectrometers fail to perform beyond 950nm due to poor detector efficiency and noise performance. With a footprint of 0.4mm2, dynamic range of 50dB, ultrafast time response (57ps), and high photodiode gain (&gt;7000), this AI-augmented silicon spectrometer is well-suited for portable, real-time, and low-light applications in biomedical imaging, environmental monitoring, and remote sensing. The results establish a pathway toward fully integrated, high-performance hyperspectral sensing in a CMOS-compatible platform.</description>

      <title>Trotter-based quantum algorithm for solving transport equations with exponentially fewer time-steps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15691v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The extent to which quantum computers can simulate physical phenomena and solve the partial differential equations (PDEs) that govern them remains a central open question. In this work, one of the most fundamental PDEs is addressed: the multidimensional transport equation with space- and time-dependent coefficients. We present a quantum numerical scheme based on three steps: quantum state preparation, evolution, and measurement of relevant observables. The evolution step combines a high-order centered finite difference with a time-splitting scheme based on product formula approximations, also known as Trotterization. We introduce novel vector-norm analysis and prove that the number of time-steps can be reduced by a factor exponential in the number of qubits compared to previously established operator-norm analysis, thereby significantly lowering the projected computational resources. We also present efficient quantum circuits and numerical simulations that confirm the predicted vector-norm scaling. We report results on real quantum hardware for the one-dimensional convection equation, and solve a non-linear ordinary differential equation via its associated Liouville equation, a particular case of transport equations. This work provides a practical framework for efficiently simulating transport phenomena on quantum computers, with potential applications in plasma physics, molecular gas dynamics and non-linear dynamical systems, including chaotic systems.</description>
