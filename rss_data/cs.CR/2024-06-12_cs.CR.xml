      <title>1-D CNN-Based Online Signature Verification with Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online signature verification plays a pivotal role in security infrastructures. However, conventional online signature verification models pose significant risks to data privacy, especially during training processes. To mitigate these concerns, we propose a novel federated learning framework that leverages 1-D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for online signature verification. Furthermore, our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework regarding 1-D CNN and federated learning. Particularly, the experiment results highlight that our framework 1) minimizes local computational resources; 2) enhances transfer effects with substantial initialization data; 3) presents remarkable scalability. The centralized 1-D CNN model achieves an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 3.33% and an accuracy of 96.25%. Meanwhile, configurations with 2, 5, and 10 agents yield EERs of 5.42%, 5.83%, and 5.63%, along with accuracies of 95.21%, 94.17%, and 94.06%, respectively.</description>

      <title>SecureNet: A Comparative Study of DeBERTa and Large Language Models for Phishing Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phishing, whether through email, SMS, or malicious websites, poses a major threat to organizations by using social engineering to trick users into revealing sensitive information. It not only compromises company's data security but also incurs significant financial losses. In this paper, we investigate whether the remarkable performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) can be leveraged for particular task like text classification, particularly detecting malicious content and compare its results with state-of-the-art Deberta V3 (DeBERTa using ELECTRA-Style Pre-Training with Gradient-Disentangled Embedding Sharing) model. We systematically assess the potential and limitations of both approaches using comprehensive public datasets comprising diverse data sources such as email, HTML, URL, SMS, and synthetic data generation. Additionally, we demonstrate how LLMs can generate convincing phishing emails, making it harder to spot scams and evaluate the performance of both models in this context. Our study delves further into the challenges encountered by DeBERTa V3 during its training phases, fine-tuning methodology and transfer learning processes. Similarly, we examine the challenges associated with LLMs and assess their respective performance. Among our experimental approaches, the transformer-based DeBERTa method emerged as the most effective, achieving a test dataset (HuggingFace phishing dataset) recall (sensitivity) of 95.17% closely followed by GPT-4 providing a recall of 91.04%. We performed additional experiments with other datasets on the trained DeBERTa V3 model and LLMs like GPT 4 and Gemini 1.5. Based on our findings, we provide valuable insights into the effectiveness and robustness of these advanced language models, offering a detailed comparative analysis that can inform future research efforts in strengthening cybersecurity measures for detecting and mitigating phishing threats.</description>

      <title>Raccoon: Prompt Extraction Benchmark of LLM-Integrated Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the proliferation of LLM-integrated applications such as GPT-s, millions are deployed, offering valuable services through proprietary instruction prompts. These systems, however, are prone to prompt extraction attacks through meticulously designed queries. To help mitigate this problem, we introduce the Raccoon benchmark which comprehensively evaluates a model's susceptibility to prompt extraction attacks. Our novel evaluation method assesses models under both defenseless and defended scenarios, employing a dual approach to evaluate the effectiveness of existing defenses and the resilience of the models. The benchmark encompasses 14 categories of prompt extraction attacks, with additional compounded attacks that closely mimic the strategies of potential attackers, alongside a diverse collection of defense templates. This array is, to our knowledge, the most extensive compilation of prompt theft attacks and defense mechanisms to date. Our findings highlight universal susceptibility to prompt theft in the absence of defenses, with OpenAI models demonstrating notable resilience when protected. This paper aims to establish a more systematic benchmark for assessing LLM robustness against prompt extraction attacks, offering insights into their causes and potential countermeasures. Resources of Raccoon are publicly available at https://github.com/M0gician/RaccoonBench.</description>

      <title>Decentralized Reliability Estimation for Mixnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time decryption mixnets can anonymously route data packets with end to end latency that can be as low as a second, making them usable for a variety of applications. Such mixnets however lack verifiable reliability properties that ensure the correct processing and delivery of packets, while existing verifiability mechanisms are incompatible with scalable low latency continuous-time mixnets due to imposing overheads measuring in minutes to hours. This work addresses this gap by proposing a scheme that can estimate reliability scores for links and nodes forming a continuous-time mixnet where some form of credentials authorize clients to send traffic. The scores can be computed publicly by all participants from a set of measurement packets that are eventually revealed and act as a random sample of the traffic, without affecting mixnet transmission latency for client packets. Our scheme relies on VRF-based routing, a novel primitive that ensures that legitimate client packets follow the routing policy of the mixnet, as well as randomly generating unforgeable measurement packets. We experimentally validate our construction both in unreliable and adversarial settings, demonstrating its feasibility.</description>

      <title>Scalable Private Search with Wally</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents Wally, a private search system that supports efficient semantic and keyword search queries against large databases. When sufficient clients are making the queries, Wally performance is significantly better than previous systems. In previous private search systems, for each client query, the server must perform at least one expensive cryptographic operation per database entry. As a result, performance degraded proportionally with the number of entries in the database. In Wally we get rid of this limitation. Specifically, for each query the server performs cryptographic operations only against a few database entries. We achieve these results by requiring each client to add a few fake queries, and sends each query via an anonymous network to the server at independently chosen random instants. Additionally, each client also uses somewhat homomorphic encryption (SHE) to hide whether a query is real or fake, Wally provides $(\epsilon, \delta)$-differential privacy guarantee, which is an accepted standard for strong privacy. The number of fake queries each client makes depends inversely on the number of clients making queries. Therefore, the fake queries' overhead vanishes as the number of clients increases, enabling scalability to millions of queries and large databases. Concretely, Wally can serve $8$M requests at a rate of 3,000 queries per second. That is around 60x higher than the state-of-the-art scheme.</description>

      <title>An LLM-Assisted Easy-to-Trigger Backdoor Attack on Code Completion Models: Injecting Disguised Vulnerabilities against Strong Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06822v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed code completion tasks, providing context-based suggestions to boost developer productivity in software engineering. As users often fine-tune these models for specific applications, poisoning and backdoor attacks can covertly alter the model outputs. To address this critical security challenge, we introduce CodeBreaker, a pioneering LLM-assisted backdoor attack framework on code completion models. Unlike recent attacks that embed malicious payloads in detectable or irrelevant sections of the code (e.g., comments), CodeBreaker leverages LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for sophisticated payload transformation (without affecting functionalities), ensuring that both the poisoned data for fine-tuning and generated code can evade strong vulnerability detection. CodeBreaker stands out with its comprehensive coverage of vulnerabilities, making it the first to provide such an extensive set for evaluation. Our extensive experimental evaluations and user studies underline the strong attack performance of CodeBreaker across various settings, validating its superiority over existing approaches. By integrating malicious payloads directly into the source code with minimal transformation, CodeBreaker challenges current security measures, underscoring the critical need for more robust defenses for code completion.</description>

      <title>A Survey of Backdoor Attacks and Defenses on Large Language Models: Implications for Security Measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06852</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06852v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The large language models (LLMs), which bridge the gap between human language understanding and complex problem-solving, achieve state-of-the-art performance on several NLP tasks, particularly in few-shot and zero-shot settings. Despite the demonstrable efficacy of LMMs, due to constraints on computational resources, users have to engage with open-source language models or outsource the entire training process to third-party platforms. However, research has demonstrated that language models are susceptible to potential security vulnerabilities, particularly in backdoor attacks. Backdoor attacks are designed to introduce targeted vulnerabilities into language models by poisoning training samples or model weights, allowing attackers to manipulate model responses through malicious triggers. While existing surveys on backdoor attacks provide a comprehensive overview, they lack an in-depth examination of backdoor attacks specifically targeting LLMs. To bridge this gap and grasp the latest trends in the field, this paper presents a novel perspective on backdoor attacks for LLMs by focusing on fine-tuning methods. Specifically, we systematically classify backdoor attacks into three categories: full-parameter fine-tuning, parameter-efficient fine-tuning, and attacks without fine-tuning. Based on insights from a substantial review, we also discuss crucial issues for future research on backdoor attacks, such as further exploring attack algorithms that do not require fine-tuning, or developing more covert attack algorithms.</description>

      <title>Ollabench: Evaluating LLMs' Reasoning for Human-centric Interdependent Cybersecurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06863v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to enhance Agent-Based Modeling by better representing complex interdependent cybersecurity systems, improving cybersecurity threat modeling and risk management. However, evaluating LLMs in this context is crucial for legal compliance and effective application development. Existing LLM evaluation frameworks often overlook the human factor and cognitive computing capabilities essential for interdependent cybersecurity. To address this gap, I propose OllaBench, a novel evaluation framework that assesses LLMs' accuracy, wastefulness, and consistency in answering scenario-based information security compliance and non-compliance questions. OllaBench is built on a foundation of 24 cognitive behavioral theories and empirical evidence from 38 peer-reviewed papers. OllaBench was used to evaluate 21 LLMs, including both open-weight and commercial models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft, Meta and so on. The results reveal that while commercial LLMs have the highest overall accuracy scores, there is significant room for improvement. Smaller low-resolution open-weight LLMs are not far behind in performance, and there are significant differences in token efficiency and consistency among the evaluated models. OllaBench provides a user-friendly interface and supports a wide range of LLM platforms, making it a valuable tool for researchers and solution developers in the field of human-centric interdependent cybersecurity and beyond.</description>

      <title>On the Communication Complexity of Secure Multi-Party Computation With Aborts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A central goal of cryptography is Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC), where $n$ parties desire to compute a function of their joint inputs without letting any party learn about the inputs of its peers. Unfortunately, it is well-known that MPC guaranteeing output delivery to every party is infeasible when a majority of the parties are malicious. In fact, parties operating over a point-to-point network (i.e. without access to a broadcast channel) cannot even reach an agreement on the output when more than one third of the parties are malicious (Lamport, Shostak, and Pease, JACM 1980).
  Motivated by this infeasibility in the point-to-point model, Goldwasser and Lindell (J. Cryptol 2005) introduced a definition of MPC that does not require agreement, referred to as MPC with selective abort. Under this definition, any party may abort the protocol if they detect malicious behavior. They showed that MPC with selective abort is feasible for any number of malicious parties by implementing a broadcast functionality with abort.
  While the model of MPC with abort has attracted much attention over the years, little is known about its communication complexity over point-to-point networks. In this work, we study the communication complexity of MPC with abort and devise nearly-optimal communication efficient protocols in this model. Namely, we prove trade-offs between the number of honest parties $h$, the communication complexity, and the locality of the protocols. Here, locality is a bound on the number of peers with which each party must communicate.</description>

      <title>FAULT+PROBE: A Generic Rowhammer-based Bit Recovery Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rowhammer is a security vulnerability that allows unauthorized attackers to induce errors within DRAM cells. To prevent fault injections from escalating to successful attacks, a widely accepted mitigation is implementing fault checks on instructions and data.
  We challenge the validity of this assumption by examining the impact of the fault on the victim's functionality. Specifically, we illustrate that an attacker can construct a profile of the victim's memory based on the directional patterns of bit flips. This profile is then utilized to identify the most susceptible bit locations within DRAM rows. These locations are then subsequently leveraged during an online attack phase with side information observed from the change in the victim's behavior to deduce sensitive bit values. Consequently, the primary objective of this study is to utilize Rowhammer as a probe, shifting the emphasis away from the victim's memory integrity and toward statistical fault analysis (SFA) based on the victim's operational behavior.
  We show FAULT+PROBE may be used to circumvent the verify-after-sign fault check mechanism, which is designed to prevent the generation of erroneous signatures that leak sensitive information. It does so by injecting directional faults into key positions identified during a memory profiling stage. The attacker observes the signature generation rate and decodes the secret bit value accordingly. This circumvention is enabled by an observable channel in the victim. FAULT+PROBE is not limited to signing victims and can be used to probe secret bits on arbitrary systems where an observable channel is present that leaks the result of the fault injection attempt. To demonstrate the attack, we target the fault-protected ECDSA in wolfSSL's implementation of the TLS 1.3 handshake. We recover 256-bit session keys with an average recovery rate of 22 key bits/hour and a 100% success rate.</description>

      <title>Turning the Tide on Dark Pools? Towards Multi-Stakeholder Vulnerability Notifications in the Ad-Tech Supply Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online advertising relies on a complex and opaque supply chain that involves multiple stakeholders, including advertisers, publishers, and ad-networks, each with distinct and sometimes conflicting incentives. Recent research has demonstrated the existence of ad-tech supply chain vulnerabilities such as dark pooling, where low-quality publishers bundle their ad inventory with higher-quality ones to mislead advertisers. We investigate the effectiveness of vulnerability notification campaigns aimed at mitigating dark pooling. Prior research on vulnerability notifications has primarily focused on single-stakeholder scenarios, and it is unclear whether vulnerability notifications can be effective in the multi-stakeholder ad-tech supply chain. We implement an automated vulnerability notification pipeline to systematically evaluate the responsiveness of various stakeholders, including publishers, ad-networks, and advertisers to vulnerability notifications by academics and activists. Our nine-month long multi-stakeholder notification study shows that notifications are an effective method for reducing dark pooling vulnerabilities in the online advertising ecosystem, especially when targeted towards ad-networks. Further, the sender reputation does not impact responses to notifications from activists and academics in a statistically different way. In addition to being the first notification study targeting the online advertising ecosystem, we are also the first to study multi-stakeholder context in vulnerability notifications.</description>

      <title>Breaking Free: Efficient Multi-Party Private Set Union Without Non-Collusion Assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-party private set union (MPSU) protocol enables $m$ $(m &gt; 2)$ parties, each holding a set, to collectively compute the union of their sets without revealing any additional information to other parties. There are two main categories of MPSU protocols: The first builds on public-key techniques. All existing works in this category involve a super-linear number of public-key operations, resulting in poor practical efficiency. The second builds on oblivious transfer and symmetric-key techniques. The only existing work in this category is proposed by Liu and Gao (ASIACRYPT 2023), which features the best concrete performance among all existing protocols, despite its super-linear computation and communication. Unfortunately, it does not achieve the standard semi-honest security, as it inherently relies on a non-collusion assumption, which is unlikely to hold in practice. Therefore, the problem of constructing a practical MPSU protocol based on oblivious transfer and symmetric-key techniques in standard semi-honest model remains open. Furthermore, there is no MPSU protocol achieving both linear computation and linear communication complexity, which leaves another unresolved problem. In this work, we resolve these two open problems. We propose the first MPSU protocol based on oblivious transfer and symmetric-key techniques in the standard semi-honest model. This protocol is $4.9-9.3 \times$ faster than Liu and Gao in the LAN setting. Concretely, our protocol requires only $3.6$ seconds in online phase for 3 parties with sets of $2^{20}$ items each. We propose the first MPSU protocol achieving both linear computation and linear communication complexity, based on public-key operations. This protocol has the lowest overall communication costs and shows a factor of $3.0-36.5\times$ improvement in terms of overall communication compared to Liu and Gao.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern vehicles are increasingly vulnerable to attacks that exploit network infrastructures, particularly the Controller Area Network (CAN) networks. To effectively counter such threats using contemporary tools like Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) based on data analysis and classification, large datasets of CAN messages become imperative. This paper delves into the feasibility of generating synthetic datasets by harnessing the modeling capabilities of simulation frameworks such as Simulink coupled with a robust representation of attack models to present CARACAS, a vehicular model, including component control via CAN messages and attack injection capabilities. CARACAS showcases the efficacy of this methodology, including a Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) model, and focuses on attacks targeting torque control in two distinct scenarios.</description>

      <title>DSig: Breaking the Barrier of Signatures in Data Centers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data centers increasingly host mutually distrustful users on shared infrastructure. A powerful tool to safeguard such users are digital signatures. Digital signatures have revolutionized Internet-scale applications, but current signatures are too slow for the growing genre of microsecond-scale systems in modern data centers. We propose DSig, the first digital signature system to achieve single-digit microsecond latency to sign, transmit, and verify signatures in data center systems. DSig is based on the observation that, in many data center applications, the signer of a message knows most of the time who will verify its signature. We introduce a new hybrid signature scheme that combines cheap single-use hash-based signatures verified in the foreground with traditional signatures pre-verified in the background. Compared to prior state-of-the-art signatures, DSig reduces signing time from 18.9 to 0.7 us and verification time from 35.6 to 5.1 us, while keeping signature transmission time below 2.5 us. Moreover, DSig achieves 2.5x higher signing throughput and 6.9x higher verification throughput than the state of the art. We use DSig to (a) bring auditability to two key-value stores (HERD and Redis) and a financial trading system (based on Liquibook) for 86% lower added latency than the state of the art, and (b) replace signatures in BFT broadcast and BFT replication, reducing their latency by 73% and 69%, respectively</description>

      <title>On Kernel's Safety in the Spectre Era (Extended Version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The efficacy of address space layout randomization has been formally demonstrated in a shared-memory model by Abadi et al., contingent on specific assumptions about victim programs. However, modern operating systems, implementing layout randomization in the kernel, diverge from these assumptions and operate on a separate memory model with communication through system calls. In this work, we relax Abadi et al.'s language assumptions while demonstrating that layout randomization offers a comparable safety guarantee in a system with memory separation. However, in practice, speculative execution and side-channels are recognized threats to layout randomization. We show that kernel safety cannot be restored for attackers capable of using side-channels and speculative execution and introduce a new condition, that allows us to formally prove kernel safety in the Spectre era. Our research demonstrates that under this condition, the system remains safe without relying on layout randomization. We also demonstrate that our condition can be sensibly weakened, leading to enforcement mechanisms that can guarantee kernel safety for safe system calls in the Spectre era.</description>

      <title>Erasing Radio Frequency Fingerprinting via Active Adversarial Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting is to identify a wireless device from its uniqueness of the analog circuitry or hardware imperfections. However, unlike the MAC address which can be modified, such hardware feature is inevitable for the signal emitted to air, which can possibly reveal device whereabouts, e.g., a sniffer can use a pre-trained model to identify a nearby device when receiving its signal. Such fingerprint may expose critical private information, e.g., the associated upper-layer applications or the end-user. In this paper, we propose to erase such RF feature for wireless devices, which can prevent fingerprinting by actively perturbation from the signal perspective. Specifically, we consider a common RF fingerprinting scenario, where machine learning models are trained from pilot signal data for identification. A novel adversarial attack solution is designed to generate proper perturbations, whereby the perturbed pilot signal can hide the hardware feature and misclassify the model. We theoretically show that the perturbation would not affect the communication function within a tolerable perturbation threshold. We also implement the pilot signal fingerprinting and the proposed perturbation process in a practical LTE system. Extensive experiment results demonstrate that the RF fingerprints can be effectively erased to protect the user privacy.</description>

      <title>Making 'syscall' a Privilege not a Right</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07429v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Browsers, Library OSes, and system emulators rely on sandboxes and in-process isolation to emulate system resources and securely isolate untrusted components. All access to system resources like system calls (syscall) need to be securely mediated by the application. Otherwise system calls may allow untrusted components to evade the emulator or sandbox monitor, and hence, escape and attack the entire application or system. Existing approaches, such as ptrace, require additional context switches between kernel and userspace, which introduce high performance overhead. And, seccomp-bpf supports only limited policies, which restricts its functionality, or it still requires ptrace to provide assistance.
  In this paper, we present nexpoline, a secure syscall interception mechanism combining Memory Protection Keys (MPK) and Seccomp or Syscall User Dispatch (SUD). Our approach transforms an application's syscall instruction into a privilege reserved for the trusted monitor within the address space, allowing flexible user defined policy. To execute a syscall, the application must switch contexts via nexpoline. It offers better efficiency than secure interception techniques like ptrace, as nexpoline can intercept syscalls through binary rewriting securely. Consequently, nexpoline ensures the safety, flexibility and efficiency for syscall interception. Notably, it operates without kernel modifications, making it viable on current Linux systems without needing root privileges. Our benchmarks demonstrate improved performance over ptrace in interception overhead while achieving the same security guarantees. When compared to similarly performing firejail, nexpoline supports more complex policies and enables the possibility to emulate system resources.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Tuning: Defending Against Jailbreak Attacks for LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although safely enhanced Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tackling various complex tasks in a zero-shot manner, they remain susceptible to jailbreak attacks, particularly the unknown jailbreak attack. To enhance LLMs' generalized defense capabilities, we propose a two-stage adversarial tuning framework, which generates adversarial prompts to explore worst-case scenarios by optimizing datasets containing pairs of adversarial prompts and their safe responses. In the first stage, we introduce the hierarchical meta-universal adversarial prompt learning to efficiently and effectively generate token-level adversarial prompts. In the second stage, we propose the automatic adversarial prompt learning to iteratively refine semantic-level adversarial prompts, further enhancing LLM's defense capabilities. We conducted comprehensive experiments on three widely used jailbreak datasets, comparing our framework with six defense baselines under five representative attack scenarios. The results underscore the superiority of our proposed methods. Furthermore, our adversarial tuning framework exhibits empirical generalizability across various attack strategies and target LLMs, highlighting its potential as a transferable defense mechanism.</description>

      <title>A Multi-module Robust Method for Transient Stability Assessment against False Label Injection Cyberattacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The success of deep learning in transient stability assessment (TSA) heavily relies on high-quality training data. However, the label information in TSA datasets is vulnerable to contamination through false label injection (FLI) cyberattacks, resulting in degraded performance of deep TSA models. To address this challenge, a Multi-Module Robust TSA method (MMR) is proposed to rectify the supervised training process misguided by FLI in an unsupervised manner. In MMR, a supervised classification module and an unsupervised clustering module are alternatively trained to improve the clustering friendliness of representation leaning, thereby achieving accurate clustering assignments. Leveraging the clustering assignments, we construct a training label corrector to rectify the injected false labels and progressively enhance robustness and resilience against FLI. However, there is still a gap on accuracy and convergence speed between MMR and FLI-free deep TSA models. To narrow this gap, we further propose a human-in-the-loop training strategy, named MMR-HIL. In MMR-HIL, potential false samples can be detected by modeling the training loss with a Gaussian distribution. From these samples, the most likely false samples and most ambiguous samples are re-labeled by a TSA experts guided bi-directional annotator and then subjected to penalized optimization, aimed at improving accuracy and convergence speed. Extensive experiments indicate that MMR and MMR-HIL both exhibit powerful robustness against FLI in TSA performance. Moreover, the contaminated labels can also be effectively corrected, demonstrating superior resilience of the proposed methods.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Entanglement is Necessary for EFI Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.06881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.06881v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Regarding minimal assumptions, most of classical cryptography is known to depend on the existence of One-Way Functions (OWFs). However, recent evidence has shown that this is not the case when considering quantum resources. Besides the well known unconditional security of Quantum Key Distribution, it is now known that computational cryptography may be built on weaker primitives than OWFs, e.g., pseudo-random states [JLS18], one-way state generators [MY23], or EFI pairs of states [BCQ23]. We consider a new quantum resource, pseudo-entanglement, and show that the existence of EFI pairs, one of the current main candidates for the weakest computational assumption for cryptography (necessary for commitments, oblivious transfer, secure multi-party computation, computational zero-knowledge proofs), implies the existence of pseudo-entanglement, as defined by [ABF+24, ABV23] under some reasonable adaptations. We prove this by constructing a new family of pseudo-entangled quantum states given only EFI pairs. Our result has important implications for the field of computational cryptography. It shows that if pseudo-entanglement does not exist, then most of cryptography cannot exist either. Moreover, it establishes pseudo-entanglement as a new minimal assumption for most of computational cryptography, which may pave the way for the unification of other assumptions into a single primitive. Finally, pseudo-entanglement connects physical phenomena and efficient computation, thus, our result strengthens the connection between cryptography and the physical world.</description>

      <title>AudioMarkBench: Benchmarking Robustness of Audio Watermarking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.06979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The increasing realism of synthetic speech, driven by advancements in text-to-speech models, raises ethical concerns regarding impersonation and disinformation. Audio watermarking offers a promising solution via embedding human-imperceptible watermarks into AI-generated audios. However, the robustness of audio watermarking against common/adversarial perturbations remains understudied. We present AudioMarkBench, the first systematic benchmark for evaluating the robustness of audio watermarking against watermark removal and watermark forgery. AudioMarkBench includes a new dataset created from Common-Voice across languages, biological sexes, and ages, 3 state-of-the-art watermarking methods, and 15 types of perturbations. We benchmark the robustness of these methods against the perturbations in no-box, black-box, and white-box settings. Our findings highlight the vulnerabilities of current watermarking techniques and emphasize the need for more robust and fair audio watermarking solutions. Our dataset and code are publicly available at \url{https://github.com/moyangkuo/AudioMarkBench}.</description>

      <title>Is Stateful Fuzzing Really Challenging?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fuzzing has been proven extremely effective in finding vulnerabilities in software. When it comes to fuzz stateless systems, analysts have no doubts about the choice to make. In fact, among the plethora of stateless fuzzers devised in the last 20 years, AFL (with its descendants AFL++ and LibAFL) stood up for its effectiveness, speed and ability to find bugs. On the other hand, when dealing with stateful systems, it is not clear what is the best tool to use. In fact, the research community struggles to devise (and benchmark) effective and generic stateful fuzzers. In this short paper, we discuss the reasons that make stateful fuzzers difficult to devise and benchmark.</description>

      <title>Muffliato: Peer-to-Peer Privacy Amplification for Decentralized Optimization and Averaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05091v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized optimization is increasingly popular in machine learning for its scalability and efficiency. Intuitively, it should also provide better privacy guarantees, as nodes only observe the messages sent by their neighbors in the network graph. But formalizing and quantifying this gain is challenging: existing results are typically limited to Local Differential Privacy (LDP) guarantees that overlook the advantages of decentralization. In this work, we introduce pairwise network differential privacy, a relaxation of LDP that captures the fact that the privacy leakage from a node $u$ to a node $v$ may depend on their relative position in the graph. We then analyze the combination of local noise injection with (simple or randomized) gossip averaging protocols on fixed and random communication graphs. We also derive a differentially private decentralized optimization algorithm that alternates between local gradient descent steps and gossip averaging. Our results show that our algorithms amplify privacy guarantees as a function of the distance between nodes in the graph, matching the privacy-utility trade-off of the trusted curator, up to factors that explicitly depend on the graph topology. Finally, we illustrate our privacy gains with experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>Text-CRS: A Generalized Certified Robustness Framework against Textual Adversarial Attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.16630v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The language models, especially the basic text classification models, have been shown to be susceptible to textual adversarial attacks such as synonym substitution and word insertion attacks. To defend against such attacks, a growing body of research has been devoted to improving the model robustness. However, providing provable robustness guarantees instead of empirical robustness is still widely unexplored. In this paper, we propose Text-CRS, a generalized certified robustness framework for natural language processing (NLP) based on randomized smoothing. To our best knowledge, existing certified schemes for NLP can only certify the robustness against $\ell_0$ perturbations in synonym substitution attacks. Representing each word-level adversarial operation (i.e., synonym substitution, word reordering, insertion, and deletion) as a combination of permutation and embedding transformation, we propose novel smoothing theorems to derive robustness bounds in both permutation and embedding space against such adversarial operations. To further improve certified accuracy and radius, we consider the numerical relationships between discrete words and select proper noise distributions for the randomized smoothing. Finally, we conduct substantial experiments on multiple language models and datasets. Text-CRS can address all four different word-level adversarial operations and achieve a significant accuracy improvement. We also provide the first benchmark on certified accuracy and radius of four word-level operations, besides outperforming the state-of-the-art certification against synonym substitution attacks.</description>

      <title>Cybersecurity in Critical Infrastructures: A Post-Quantum Cryptography Perspective</title>

Abstract: The machinery of industrial environments was connected to the Internet years ago with the scope of increasing their performance. However, this change made such environments vulnerable against cyber-attacks that can compromise their correct functioning resulting in economic or social problems. Moreover, implementing cryptosystems in the communications between operational technology (OT) devices is a more challenging task than for information technology (IT) environments since the OT networks are generally composed of legacy elements, characterized by low-computational capabilities. Consequently, implementing cryptosystems in industrial communication networks faces a trade-off between the security of the communications and the amortization of the industrial infrastructure. Critical Infrastructure (CI) refers to the industries which provide key resources for the daily social and economical development, e.g. electricity. Furthermore, a new threat to cybersecurity has arisen with the theoretical proposal of quantum computers, due to their potential ability of breaking state-of-the-art cryptography protocols, such as RSA or ECC. Many global agents have become aware that transitioning their secure communications to a quantum secure paradigm is a priority that should be established before the arrival of fault-tolerance. In this paper, we aim to describe the problematic of implementing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to CI environments. For doing so, we describe the requirements for these scenarios and how they differ against IT. We also introduce classical cryptography and how quantum computers pose a threat to such security protocols. Furthermore, we introduce state-of-the-art proposals of PQC protocols and present their characteristics. We conclude by discussing the problematic of integrating PQC in industrial environments.</description>

      <title>Proving membership in LLM pretraining data via data watermarks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.10892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detecting whether copyright holders' works were used in LLM pretraining is poised to be an important problem. This work proposes using data watermarks to enable principled detection with only black-box model access, provided that the rightholder contributed multiple training documents and watermarked them before public release. By applying a randomly sampled data watermark, detection can be framed as hypothesis testing, which provides guarantees on the false detection rate. We study two watermarks: one that inserts random sequences, and another that randomly substitutes characters with Unicode lookalikes. We first show how three aspects of watermark design -- watermark length, number of duplications, and interference -- affect the power of the hypothesis test. Next, we study how a watermark's detection strength changes under model and dataset scaling: while increasing the dataset size decreases the strength of the watermark, watermarks remain strong if the model size also increases. Finally, we view SHA hashes as natural watermarks and show that we can robustly detect hashes from BLOOM-176B's training data, as long as they occurred at least 90 times. Together, our results point towards a promising future for data watermarks in real world use.</description>

Abstract: The growing number of cases that require digital forensic analysis raises concerns about the ability of law enforcement to conduct investigations promptly. Consequently, this paper delves into the potential and effectiveness of integrating Large Language Models (LLMs) into digital forensic investigation to address these challenges. A comprehensive literature review is carried out, encompassing existing digital forensic models, tools, LLMs, deep learning techniques, and the use of LLMs in investigations. The review identifies current challenges within existing digital forensic processes and explores both the obstacles and possibilities of incorporating LLMs. In conclusion, the study asserts that the adoption of LLMs in digital forensics, with appropriate constraints, has the potential to improve investigation efficiency, improve traceability, and alleviate technical and judicial barriers faced by law enforcement entities.</description>

      <title>Unified Mechanism-Specific Amplification by Subsampling and Group Privacy Amplification</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Amplification by subsampling is one of the main primitives in machine learning with differential privacy (DP): Training a model on random batches instead of complete datasets results in stronger privacy. This is traditionally formalized via mechanism-agnostic subsampling guarantees that express the privacy parameters of a subsampled mechanism as a function of the original mechanism's privacy parameters. We propose the first general framework for deriving mechanism-specific guarantees, which leverage additional information beyond these parameters to more tightly characterize the subsampled mechanism's privacy. Such guarantees are of particular importance for privacy accounting, i.e., tracking privacy over multiple iterations. Overall, our framework based on conditional optimal transport lets us derive existing and novel guarantees for approximate DP, accounting with R\'enyi DP, and accounting with dominating pairs in a unified, principled manner. As an application, we analyze how subsampling affects the privacy of groups of multiple users. Our tight mechanism-specific bounds outperform tight mechanism-agnostic bounds and classic group privacy results.</description>

Abstract: This article measures how sparsity can make neural networks more robust to membership inference attacks. The obtained empirical results show that sparsity improves the privacy of the network, while preserving comparable performances on the task at hand.

      <title>Post-train Black-box Defense via Bayesian Boundary Correction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16979</link>

Abstract: Classifiers based on deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attack, where the widely existing vulnerability has invoked the research in defending them from potential threats. Given a vulnerable classifier, existing defense methods are mostly white-box and often require re-training the victim under modified loss functions/training regimes. While the model/data/training specifics of the victim are usually unavailable to the user, re-training is unappealing, if not impossible for reasons such as limited computational resources. To this end, we propose a new post-train black-box defense framework. It can turn any pre-trained classifier into a resilient one with little knowledge of the model specifics. This is achieved by new joint Bayesian treatments on the clean data, the adversarial examples and the classifier, for maximizing their joint probability. It is further equipped with a new post-train strategy which keeps the victim intact, avoiding re-training. We name our framework Bayesian Boundary Correction (BBC). BBC is a general and flexible framework that can easily adapt to different data types. We instantiate BBC for image classification and skeleton-based human activity recognition, for both static and dynamic data. Exhaustive evaluation shows that BBC has superior robustness and can enhance robustness without severely hurting the clean accuracy, compared with existing defense methods.</description>

      <title>Better Safe than Sorry: Pre-training CLIP against Targeted Data Poisoning and Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05862v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) on large image-caption datasets has achieved remarkable success in zero-shot classification and enabled transferability to new domains. However, CLIP is extremely more vulnerable to targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks, compared to supervised learning. Perhaps surprisingly, poisoning 0.0001% of CLIP pre-training data is enough to make targeted data poisoning attacks successful. This is four orders of magnitude smaller than what is required to poison supervised models. Despite this vulnerability, existing methods are very limited in defending CLIP models during pre-training. In this work, we propose a strong defense, SAFECLIP, to safely pre-train CLIP against targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks. SAFECLIP warms up the model by applying unimodal contrastive learning (CL) on image and text modalities separately. Then, it divides the data into safe and risky sets, by applying a Gaussian Mixture Model to the cosine similarity of image-caption pair representations. SAFECLIP pre-trains the model by applying the CLIP loss to the safe set and applying unimodal CL to image and text modalities of the risky set separately. By gradually increasing the size of the safe set during pre-training, SAFECLIP effectively breaks targeted data poisoning and backdoor attacks without harming the CLIP performance. Our extensive experiments on CC3M, Visual Genome, and MSCOCO demonstrate that SAFECLIP significantly reduces the success rate of targeted data poisoning attacks from 93.75% to 0% and that of various backdoor attacks from up to 100% to 0%, without harming CLIP's performance.</description>

      <title>Are Normalizing Flows the Key to Unlocking the Exponential Mechanism?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.09200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.09200v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Exponential Mechanism (ExpM), designed for private optimization, has been historically sidelined from use on continuous sample spaces, as it requires sampling from a generally intractable density, and, to a lesser extent, bounding the sensitivity of the objective function. Any differential privacy (DP) mechanism can be instantiated as ExpM, and ExpM poses an elegant solution for private machine learning (ML) that bypasses inherent inefficiencies of DPSGD. This paper seeks to operationalize ExpM for private optimization and ML by using an auxiliary Normalizing Flow (NF), an expressive deep network for density learning, to approximately sample from ExpM density. The method, ExpM+NF is an alternative to SGD methods for model training. We prove a sensitivity bound for the $\ell^2$ loss permitting ExpM use with any sampling method. To test feasibility, we present results on MIMIC-III health data comparing (non-private) SGD, DPSGD, and ExpM+NF training methods' accuracy and training time. We find that a model sampled from ExpM+NF is nearly as accurate as non-private SGD, more accurate than DPSGD, and ExpM+NF trains faster than Opacus' DPSGD implementation. Unable to provide a privacy proof for the NF approximation, we present empirical results to investigate privacy including the LiRA membership inference attack of Carlini et al. and the recent privacy auditing lower bound method of Steinke et al. Our findings suggest ExpM+NF provides more privacy than non-private SGD, but not as much as DPSGD, although many attacks are impotent against any model. Ancillary benefits of this work include pushing the SOTA of privacy and accuracy on MIMIC-III healthcare data, exhibiting the use of ExpM+NF for Bayesian inference, showing the limitations of empirical privacy auditing in practice, and providing several privacy theorems applicable to distribution learning.</description>

      <title>Trainwreck: A damaging adversarial attack on image classifiers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14772v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Adversarial attacks are an important security concern for computer vision (CV). As CV models are becoming increasingly valuable assets in applied practice, disrupting them is emerging as a form of economic sabotage. This paper opens up the exploration of damaging adversarial attacks (DAAs) that seek to damage target CV models. DAAs are formalized by defining the threat model, the cost function DAAs maximize, and setting three requirements for success: potency, stealth, and customizability. As a pioneer DAA, this paper proposes Trainwreck, a train-time attack that conflates the data of similar classes in the training data using stealthy ($\epsilon \leq 8/255$) class-pair universal perturbations obtained from a surrogate model. Trainwreck is a black-box, transferable attack: it requires no knowledge of the target architecture, and a single poisoned dataset degrades the performance of any model trained on it. The experimental evaluation on CIFAR-10 and CIFAR-100 and various model architectures (EfficientNetV2, ResNeXt-101, and a finetuned ViT-L-16) demonstrates Trainwreck's efficiency. Trainwreck achieves similar or better potency compared to the data poisoning state of the art and is fully customizable by the poison rate parameter. Finally, data redundancy with hashing is identified as a reliable defense against Trainwreck or similar DAAs. The code is available at https://github.com/JanZahalka/trainwreck.</description>

      <title>Can ChatGPT Detect DeepFakes? A Study of Using Multimodal Large Language Models for Media Forensics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14077v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: DeepFakes, which refer to AI-generated media content, have become an increasing concern due to their use as a means for disinformation. Detecting DeepFakes is currently solved with programmed machine learning algorithms. In this work, we investigate the capabilities of multimodal large language models (LLMs) in DeepFake detection. We conducted qualitative and quantitative experiments to demonstrate multimodal LLMs and show that they can expose AI-generated images through careful experimental design and prompt engineering. This is interesting, considering that LLMs are not inherently tailored for media forensic tasks, and the process does not require programming. We discuss the limitations of multimodal LLMs for these tasks and suggest possible improvements.</description>

      <title>Mutual Information Guided Backdoor Mitigation for Pre-trained Encoders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) is increasingly attractive for pre-training encoders without requiring labeled data. Downstream tasks built on top of those pre-trained encoders can achieve nearly state-of-the-art performance. The pre-trained encoders by SSL, however, are vulnerable to backdoor attacks as demonstrated by existing studies. Numerous backdoor mitigation techniques are designed for downstream task models. However, their effectiveness is impaired and limited when adapted to pre-trained encoders, due to the lack of label information when pre-training. To address backdoor attacks against pre-trained encoders, in this paper, we innovatively propose a mutual information guided backdoor mitigation technique, named MIMIC. MIMIC treats the potentially backdoored encoder as the teacher net and employs knowledge distillation to distill a clean student encoder from the teacher net. Different from existing knowledge distillation approaches, MIMIC initializes the student with random weights, inheriting no backdoors from teacher nets. Then MIMIC leverages mutual information between each layer and extracted features to locate where benign knowledge lies in the teacher net, with which distillation is deployed to clone clean features from teacher to student. We craft the distillation loss with two aspects, including clone loss and attention loss, aiming to mitigate backdoors and maintain encoder performance at the same time. Our evaluation conducted on two backdoor attacks in SSL demonstrates that MIMIC can significantly reduce the attack success rate by only utilizing &lt;5% of clean data, surpassing seven state-of-the-art backdoor mitigation techniques.</description>
