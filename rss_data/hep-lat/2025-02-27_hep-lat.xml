      <title>The Roberge-Weiss transition for QCD in a magnetic background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how a magnetic background field influences the location and the nature of the Roberge-Weiss (RW) finite temperature transition for $N_f = 2+1$ QCD with physical quark masses. To that purpose, we perform numerical simulations of the finite temperature theory, discretized through stout staggered quarks and the tree-level improved Symanzik pure gauge action, considering two different values of the Euclidean temporal extent in lattice units, $N_t = 6, 8$. The RW transition temperature $T_{RW}$ decreases with $eB$, in particular it follows closely the behavior of the pseudo-critical QCD crossover temperature $T_{pc}$, so that $T_{RW} (eB) - T_{pc}(eB)$ is practically constant, within errors, for magnetic fields up to $eB \sim 1$ GeV$^2$; consistent results are found from the drop of the chiral condensate, which signals chiral symmetry restoration, leading also to the phenomenon of inverse magnetic catalysis above the transition. Moreover, we find that the magnetic field turns the RW transition from second order to first order, with a tri-critical magnetic field in-between 1 and 2.4 GeV$^2$, i.e. for magnetic fields substantially lower than those for which the standard QCD transition turns to first order.</description>

      <title>Extracting scattering amplitudes for arbitrary two-particle systems with one-particle left-hand cuts via lattice QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive a general formalism that relates the spectrum of two-particle systems in a finite volume to physical scattering amplitudes, taking into account the presence of any left-hand branch cuts due to single-particle exchanges. The method first relates the finite-volume spectrum to an infinite-volume short-range quantity, denoted \mathcal{M}_0, and then relates the latter to the physical scattering amplitudes via known integral equations. The derivation of both relations is performed using all-orders perturbation theory and is exact up to neglected exponentially suppressed volume dependence. The relations hold for arbitrary two-particle systems with any number of coupled channels, non-identical and non-degenerate particles, and any intrinsic spin.</description>

      <title>Sampling reduced density matrix to extract fine levels of entanglement spectrum and restore entanglement Hamiltonian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.16709v6 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The reduced density matrix (RDM) plays a key role in quantum entanglement and measurement, as it allows the extraction of almost all physical quantities related to the reduced degrees of freedom. However, restricted by the degrees of freedom in the environment, the total system size is often limited, let alone the subsystem. To address this challenge, we propose a quantum Monte Carlo scheme with a low technical barrier, enabling precise extraction of the RDM. To demonstrate the power of the method, we present the fine levels of the entanglement spectrum (ES), which is the logarithmic eigenvalues of the RDM. We clearly show the ES for a $1$D ladder with a long entangled boundary, and that for the $2$D Heisenberg model with a tower of states. Furthermore, we put forward an efficient way to restore the entanglement Hamiltonian in operator-form from the sampled RDM data. Our simulation results, utilizing unprecedentedly large system sizes, establish a practical computational framework for determining entanglement quantities based on the RDM, such as the ES, particularly in scenarios where the environment has a huge number of degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Chiral Representation of the Nucleon Mass at Leading Two-loop Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19168v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We calculate the nucleon mass in a manifestly relativistic baryon chiral perturbation theory up to the leading two-loop order. Through dimensional counting analysis, we perform the chiral expansion and verify the validity of the extended-on-mass-shell scheme at the two-loop level. As a result, we obtain the complete chiral representation of the nucleon mass up to $\mathcal{O}(p^5)$, which preserves the original analytic properties and satisfies the correct power counting. The obtained chiral result is well-suited for chiral extrapolation and provides an excellent description of lattice QCD data across a broad range of pion masses. We find that the $\mathcal{O}(p^5)$ contribution is small, approximately $10$ MeV, and varies only mildly with increasing pion mass, demonstrating good convergence of the nucleon mass up to pion masses of about 350 MeV at two-loop order.</description>

      <title>Work and heat exchanged during sudden quenches of strongly coupled quantum systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19418v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: How should one define thermodynamic quantities (internal energy, work, heat, etc.) for quantum systems coupled to their environments strongly? We examine three (classically equivalent) definitions of a quantum system's internal energy under strong-coupling conditions. Each internal-energy definition implies a definition of work and a definition of heat. Our study focuses on quenches, common processes in which the Hamiltonian changes abruptly. In these processes, the first law of thermodynamics holds for each set of definitions by construction. However, we prove that only two sets obey the second law. We illustrate our findings using a simple spin model. Our results guide studies of thermodynamic quantities in strongly coupled quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Stochastic quantization with discrete fictitious time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14260v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new approach to stochastic quantization \`a la Parisi-Wu with a discrete fictitious time. The noise average is modified by weights, which results in the equivalence in the large time limit to the correlation function of the corresponding quantum field theory {\it without taking any continuum limit of fictitious time}. We test our method in a zero-dimensional toy model both perturbatively and numerically.</description>
