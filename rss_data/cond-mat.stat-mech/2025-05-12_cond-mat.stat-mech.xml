      <title>Operator Spreading, Duality, and the Noisy Long-Range FKPP Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06353v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Operator spreading provides a new characterization of quantum chaos beyond the semi-classical limit. There are two complementary views of how the characteristic size of an operator, also known as the butterfly light cone, grows under chaotic quantum time evolution: A discrete stochastic population dynamics or a stochastic reaction-diffusion equation in the continuum. When the interaction decays as a power function of distance, the discrete population dynamics model features superlinear butterfly light cones with stretched exponential or power-law scaling. Its continuum counterpart, a noisy long-range Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovsky-Piscunov (FKPP) equation, remains less understood. We use a mathematical duality to demonstrate their equivalence through an intermediate model, which replaces the hard local population limit by an equilibrium population. Through an algorithm with no finite size effect, we demonstrate numerically remarkable agreements in their light cone scalings.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning Tool to Analyse Spectroscopic Changes in High-Dimensional Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06466v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fibrinogen is an abundant protein found in human blood plasma that plays crucial roles in various physiological processes. When nanoparticles (NPs) are introduced into a biological solution, layers of biomolecules form on their surface, creating a corona. Understanding how the structure of the protein evolves into the corona is essential for evaluating the safety and toxicity of nanotechnology. However, the influence of NP properties on protein conformation is not well understood. In this study, we propose a new method that addresses this issue by analyzing multi-component spectral data using Machine Learning (ML). We apply the method to fibrinogen at blood concentrations while interacting with hydrophobic carbon or hydrophilic silicon dioxide NPs, revealing striking differences in the temperature dependence of the protein structure between the two cases. Our unsupervised ML method a) does not suffer from the challenges associated with the curse of dimensionality, and b) simultaneously handles spectral data from various sources. The method provides a deeper understanding of the correlation between protein structure and NP interactions, which could support the development of nanomedical tools to treat various conditions.</description>

      <title>Geometric Quantum Thermodynamic Engine under an Isothermal Operation: An Application of a Thouless Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06851v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a geometric formalism for the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of a small system coupled to external isothermal reservoirs as an application of Thouless pumping, where the electrochemical potentials of the reservoirs and parameters in the system's Hamiltonian are adiabatically controlled. By analyzing the quantum master equation for the Anderson model of a quantum dot under the wide-band approximation, we obtain the work and effective efficiency of the thermodynamic engine as functions of the phase difference between the externally controlled electrochemical potentials after the system reaches a geometric cyclic state. Since the entropy production is negligible in adiabatic operations, the process we consider is reversible, analogous to the Carnot cycle.</description>

      <title>Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis correlations via non-linear Hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06869v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The thermalizing dynamics of many-body systems is often described through the lens of the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH).
  ETH postulates that the statistical properties of observables, when expressed in the energy eigenbasis, are described by smooth functions,
  that also describe correlations among the matrix elements. However, the form of these functions is usually left undetermined. In this work, we investigate the structure of such smooth functions by focusing on their Fourier transform, recently identified as free cumulants. Using non-linear hydrodynamics, we provide a prediction for the late-time behavior of time-ordered free cumulants in the thermodynamic limit. The prediction is further corroborated by large-scale numerical simulations of a non-integrable spin-$1$ Ising model, which exhibits diffusive transport behavior. Good agreement is observed in both infinite and finite-temperature regimes and for a collection of local observables. Our results indicate that the smooth multi-point correlation functions within the ETH framework admit a universal hydrodynamic description at low frequencies.</description>

      <title>Ultraslow Growth of Domains in a Random-Field System With Correlated Disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study domain growth kinetics in a random-field system in the presence of a spatially correlated disorder $h_{i}(\vec r)$ after an instantaneous quench at a finite temperature $T$ from a random initial state corresponding to $T=\infty$. The correlated disorder field $h_{i}(\vec r)$ arises due to the presence of magnetic impurities, decaying spatially in a power-law fashion. We use Glauber spin-flip dynamics to simulate the kinetics at the microscopic level. The system evolves via the formation of ordered magnetic domains. We characterize the morphology of domains using the equal-time correlation function $C(r,t)$ and structure factor $S(k,t)$. In the large-$k$ limit, $S(k, t)$ obeys Porod's law: $S(k, t)\sim k^{-(d+1)}$. The average domain size $L(t)$ asymptotically follows \textit{double logarithmic growth behavior}.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory of point vortices at order $1/N$ and $1/N^{2}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the long-term relaxation of a distribution of $N$ point vortices in two-dimensional hydrodynamics, in the limit of weak collective amplification. Placing ourselves within the limit of an average axisymmetric distribution, we stress the connections with generic long-range interacting systems, whose relaxation is described within angle-action coordinates. In particular, we emphasise the existence of two regimes of relaxation, depending on whether the system's profile of mean angular velocity (frequency) is a non-monotonic [resp. monotonic] function of radius, which we refer to as profile (1) [resp. profile (2)]. For profile (1), relaxation occurs through two-body non-local resonant couplings, i.e. $1/N$ effects, as described by the inhomogeneous Landau equation. For profile (2), the impossibility of such two-body resonances submits the system to a ``kinetic blocking''. Relaxation is then driven by three-body couplings, i.e. $1/N^{2}$ effects, whose associated kinetic equation has only recently been derived. For both regimes, we compare extensively the kinetic predictions with large ensemble of direct $N$-body simulations. In particular, for profile (1), we explore numerically an effect akin to ``resonance broadening'' close to the extremum of the angular velocity profile. Quantitative description of such subtle nonlinear effects will be the topic of future investigations.</description>

      <title>Integrability and Chaos via fractal analysis of Spectral Form Factors: Gaussian approximations and exact results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the mathematical equivalence between the spectral form factor, a quantity used to identify the onset of quantum chaos and scrambling in quantum many-body systems, and the classical problem of statistical characterization of planar random walks. We thus associate to any quantum Hamiltonian a random process on the plane. We set down rigorously the conditions under which such random process becomes a Wiener process in the thermodynamic limit and the associated distribution of the distance from the origin becomes Gaussian. This leads to the well known Gaussian behavior of the spectral form factor for quantum chaotic (non-integrable) models, which we show to be violated at low temperature. For systems with quasi-free spectrum (integrable), instead, the distribution of the SFF is Log-Normal. We compute all the moments of the spectral form factor exactly without resorting to the Gaussian approximation. Assuming degeneracies in the quantum chaotic spectrum we solve the classical problem of random walker taking steps of unequal lengths. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Hausdorff dimension of the frontier of the random walk, defined as the boundary of the unbounded component of the complement, approaches 1 for the integrable Brownian motion, while the non-integrable walk approaches that obtained by the Schramm-Loewner Evolution (SLE) with the fractal dimension $4/3$. Additionally, we numerically show that Bethe Ansatz walkers fall into a category similar to the non-integrable walkers.</description>

      <title>Simulating the non-unitary Yang-Lee conformal field theory on the fuzzy sphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06342v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fuzzy sphere method has enjoyed great success in the study of (2+1)-dimensional unitary conformal field theories (CFTs) by regularizing them as quantum Hall transitions on the sphere. Here, we extend this approach to the Yang-Lee CFT-the simplest non-unitary CFT. We use an Ising quantum-Hall ferromagnet Hamiltonian with a transverse field and an imaginary longitudinal field, the latter breaks the Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian and thus the unitarity of the associated quantum field theory. Non-unitary conformal field theories-particularly the Yang-Lee CFT-pose significant challenges to conventional fuzzy sphere approaches. To overcome these obstacles, here we utilize a different method for determining critical points that requires no a priori knowledge of CFT scaling dimensions. Our method instead leverages the state-operator correspondence while utilizing two complementary criteria: the conformality of the energy spectrum and its consistency with conformal perturbation theory. We also discuss a new finite-size scaling on the fuzzy sphere that allows us to extract conformal data more reliably, and compare it with the conventional analysis using the (1+1)-dimensional Yang-Lee problem as an example. Our results show broad agreement with previous Monte-Carlo and conformal bootstrap results. We also uncover one previously unknown primary operator and several operator product expansion coefficients.</description>

      <title>Fractional Chern Insulators and Competing States in a Twisted MoTe$_2$ Lattice Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct an interacting lattice model for twisted $\mathrm{MoTe}_{2}$ bilayers at a twist angle of approximately 3.7\degree. We use the infinite density matrix renormalization group (iDMRG) in a cylinder geometry to identify a variety of competing integer and fractional Chern insulators and charge density wave (CDW) states that emerge upon the spontaneous breaking of time reversal symmetry by valley polarization. We use finite-size analysis to establish the robustness of Chern insulating states even in geometries that admit competing CDWs, and explore the phase transitions between these states driven by increasing sublattice potential or interaction strength. Our work highlights the crucial role played by direct spin exchange in stabilizing the parent valley-polarized Chern ferromagnet band, and by the mixing with higher bands in destabilizing CIs/FCIs in favor of CDW orders.</description>

      <title>Magnetothermal Properties with Sampled Effective Local Field Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a first-principles method for predicting the magnetothermal properties of solid-state materials, which we call Sampled Effective Local Field Estimation. This approach achieves over two orders of magnitude improvement in sample efficiency compared to current state-of-the-art methods, as demonstrated on representative material systems. We validate our predictions against experimental data for well-characterized magnetic materials, showing excellent agreement. The method is fully automated and requires minimal computational resources, making it well suited for integration into high-throughput materials discovery workflows. Our method offers a scalable and accurate predictive framework that can accelerate the design of next-generation materials for magnetic refrigeration, cryogenic cooling, and magnetic memory technologies.</description>

      <title>On the validity of the complex Langevin method near the deconfining phase transition in QCD at finite density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06551</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06551v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our previous paper [JHEP 10 (2020) 144], we found that the complex Langevin (CL) method works for QCD at finite density on the $16^3 \times 32$ lattice in the low-temperature high-density regime within the range $\mu / T = 1.6 - 9.6$ with $\mu$ and $T$ being the quark chemical potential and the temperature, which enabled us to see a clear trend towards the formation of the Fermi sphere. Here we investigate the validity of the CL method on the $24^3 \times 12$ lattice in the deconfined phase near the deconfinement phase transition. As before, we use four-flavor staggered fermions and judge the validity using the criterion based on the probability distribution of the drift term. The spatial extent is $L = (1.3 - 2.7 {\rm ~fm} )&gt; \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1} \sim 1{\rm ~fm}$, in contrast to our previous study with $L &lt; \Lambda_{\rm LQCD}^{-1}$. We find that the CL method works in a broad region up to $\mu / T = 4.8$, while it starts to fail as we approach the phase boundary due to the singular drift problem, which can be understood qualitatively by extending the Banks-Casher relation to the case at finite density.</description>

      <title>Geometry of Learning -- L2 Phase Transitions in Deep and Shallow Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06597v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: When neural networks (NNs) are subject to L2 regularization, increasing the regularization strength beyond a certain threshold pushes the model into an under-parameterization regime. This transition manifests as a first-order phase transition in single-hidden-layer NNs and a second-order phase transition in NNs with two or more hidden layers. This paper establishes a unified framework for such transitions by integrating the Ricci curvature of the loss landscape with regularizer-driven deep learning. First, we show that a curvature change-point separates the model-accuracy regimes in the onset of learning and that it is identical to the critical point of the phase transition driven by regularization. Second, we show that for more complex data sets additional phase transitions exist between model accuracies, and that they are again identical to curvature change points in the error landscape. Third, by studying the MNIST data set using a Variational Autoencoder, we demonstrate that the curvature change points identify phase transitions in model accuracy outside the L2 setting. Our framework also offers practical insights for optimizing model performance across various architectures and datasets. By linking geometric features of the error landscape to observable phase transitions, our work paves the way for more informed regularization strategies and potentially new methods for probing the intrinsic structure of neural networks beyond the L2 context.</description>

      <title>Functional renormalization group equations for antisymmetric tensor field models at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Within the framework of the functional renormalization group, we derived the flow equations for the scale-dependent effective action at finite temperature for models involving an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor field. The analysis focuses on scenarios where the vacuum expectation value emerges due to symmetry breaking patterns, specifically $SU(n) \to USp(n)$ and $SO(n) \to SU(n/2)$. The derived equations provide insights into the behavior of these models under varying scales and temperatures, contributing to the understanding of phase transitions in systems with complex symmetry structures.</description>

      <title>Temperature chaos may emerge many thermodynamic states in spin glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07038v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a large-scale simulation of the three-dimensional and mean-field spin glasses down to a very low but finite temperature. We extrapolate pertinent observables, e.g., the disorder-averaged central weight to zero temperature, finding that many thermodynamic states at a finite temperature and two ground states at zero temperature are fully compatible. While the disorder-averaged central weight monotonically decreases with decreasing temperature, this is far from true for individual samples. This motivates us to link this behaviour with the well-known temperature chaos. At an observing temperature, a sample may or may not have pure state coexistence depending on whether it is undergoing temperature chaos, which is a random process. Therefore, temperature chaos is likely responsible for the emergence of many pure states, providing a natural and intuitive explanation for the coexistence of expensive domain-wall excitations and many pure states at the disorder-averaged level.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of photon emission rate near QCD critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute photon emission rate enhancement near the QCD critical point using an effective theory of dynamic critical phenomena and derive a universal photon spectrum. The emission rate scales similarly to conductivity, increasing with the correlation length ($\xi$), diverging at the critical point. The spectrum exhibits $\omega dN_{\gamma}/d^3k \propto \omega^{-1/2}$ in the scaling regime, with the transition occurring at a frequency comparable to shear damping rate $\omega \sim \gamma_{\eta}/\xi^2$, reflecting the nonequilibrium properties of the near-critical liquid.</description>

      <title>Generation of magnetic chiral solitons, skyrmions, and hedgehogs with electric fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07210v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric-field controls of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions (DMIs) have recently been discussed from the microscopic viewpoint. Since the DMI plays a critical role in generating topological spin textures (TSTs) such as the chiral soliton, the magnetic skyrmion, and the magnetic hedgehog, electric-field controls of these TSTs have become an important issue. This paper shows that such electric-field-induced DMI indeed creates and annihilates TSTs by numerically solving the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for many-body spin systems at finite temperatures. We show that when a strong electric field is applied in a proper way to one- or two-dimensional ferromagnets, the Hamiltonians are changed into the well-known spin models for the chiral soliton or the skyrmion lattice, and the TST states emerge. We utilize a machine-learning method to count the number of generated TSTs. In the three-dimensional (3D) case, we demonstrate the electric-field induction of a magnetic hedgehog structure as follows: Applying a strong enough electric field along a proper direction to a skyrmion-string state (a triple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state) at low but finite temperatures, we find that the field-induced DMI can drive a quadruple-$\boldsymbol{q}$ state with hedgehog-antihedgehog pairs. This result indicates that we have succeeded in constructing a simple 3D short-range interacting spin model hosting a magnetic hedgehog structure.</description>

      <title>Compression, Regularity, Randomness and Emergent Structure: Rethinking Physical Complexity in the Data-Driven Era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07222v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complexity science offers a wide range of measures for quantifying unpredictability, structure, and information. Yet, a systematic conceptual organization of these measures is still missing.
  We present a unified framework that locates statistical, algorithmic, and dynamical measures along three axes (regularity, randomness, and complexity) and situates them in a common conceptual space. We map statistical, algorithmic, and dynamical measures into this conceptual space, discussing their computational accessibility and approximability.
  This taxonomy reveals the deep challenges posed by uncomputability and highlights the emergence of modern data-driven methods (including autoencoders, latent dynamical models, symbolic regression, and physics-informed neural networks) as pragmatic approximations to classical complexity ideals. Latent spaces emerge as operational arenas where regularity extraction, noise management, and structured compression converge, bridging theoretical foundations with practical modeling in high-dimensional systems.
  We close by outlining implications for physics-informed AI and AI-guided discovery in complex physical systems, arguing that classical questions of complexity remain central to next-generation scientific modeling.</description>

      <title>Interplay between timescales governs the residual activity of a harmonically bound active Brownian particle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active microparticles in confining potentials manifest complex and intriguing dynamical phenomena, as their activity competes with confinement. The steady-state position distributions of harmonically bound active Brownian particles (HBABPs) exhibit a crossover from Boltzmann-like to bimodal, commonly recognized as passive to active transition, upon variation of the activity and the confinement strength. By studying optically trapped phoretically active Janus colloids, along with simulations and analytical calculations of HBABPs, we provide a comprehensive dynamical description emphasizing the resultant velocity to examine this understanding. Our results establish that the crossover is instead from active to passive-like, and is governed solely by the interplay between the persistence time $\tau_{\rm R}$, and the equilibration time in harmonic potential $\tau_k$. When $\tau_{\rm R} &lt; \tau_k$, despite a Boltzmann-like position distribution, the HBABP retains a substantial resultant or residual active velocity, denoting an activity-dominated regime. In contrast, at $\tau_{\rm R} &gt; \tau_k$, the restoring force fully counterbalances propulsion at a radial distance, where the HBABP exhibits harmonically bound Brownian particle (HBBP)-like dynamics, and the position distribution becomes bimodal. We further provide a quantitative measure of the residual activity, which decreases monotonically with $\tau_{\rm R} / \tau_k$, eventually converging to a nominal value corresponding to HBBP as $\tau_{\rm R} / \tau_k$ exceeds 1, corroborating our conclusions.</description>

      <title>Inverse Bauschinger Effect in Active Ultrastable Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memory effects in amorphous materials have been widely studied because of their possible widespread future applications. We show here that ultrastable glasses can exhibit a transient reversible memory effect when subjected to both a local driving force via Run-and-tumble active particles and global shear. We investigate the system's response across different yielding regimes by selectively switching the shear direction at different strains. We analyze how changes in shear direction influence yielding, post-yield behavior, and structural evolution in active amorphous solids. Our model active system exhibits an enhanced anisotropic response, displaying both conventional and inverse Bauschinger effects, depending on the deformation history. The results indicate that activity-induced shear band networks create structural memory, enabling the system to heal upon shear reversal due to the transient nature of this phenomenon. Additionally, we observe that shear softening under cyclic loading produces an irreversible, stable, and less branched network structure with increasing cycles. These findings provide novel insights into how activity and shear collectively contribute to mechanical response, including memory formation in ultrastable disordered systems.</description>

      <title>Interaction Effects on the Electronic Floquet Spectra: Excitonic Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet engineering of electronic states by light is a central topic in modern experiments. However, the impact of many-body interactions on the single-electron properties remains unclear in this non-equilibrium situation. We propose that interaction effects could be reasonably understood by performing perturbative expansion in both the pump field and the electron-electron interaction when computing physical quantities. As an example, we apply this approach to semiconductors and show analytically that excitonic effects, i.e., effects of electron-hole interaction, lead to dramatic corrections to the single-electron Floquet spectra even when the excitons are only virtually excited by the pump light. We compute these effects in phosphorene and monolayer MoS$_2$ for time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (Tr-ARPES) and ultrafast optical experiments.</description>

      <title>Flowing from the Ising Model on the Fuzzy Sphere to the 3D Lee-Yang CFT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07655v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We employ the Fuzzy Sphere regulator to study the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. The model is defined by deforming the Ising model on the Fuzzy Sphere via a purely imaginary longitudinal magnetic field. This model undergoes a quantum phase transition, whose critical point we determine and identify with the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. We show how to tune the model and find that the lowest-lying states of the Hamiltonian align well with the expected CFT spectrum. We discuss the Fuzzy Sphere estimates for the scaling dimension $\Delta_\phi$ of the lowest primary operator. Finally, we interpret small deviations from the CFT expectations in terms of the leading irrelevant operators of the Lee-Yang CFT. We show that the Fuzzy Sphere calculations are compatible with the best five-loop $\epsilon$-expansion estimates.</description>

      <title>Analytic theory of dropout regularization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dropout is a regularization technique widely used in training artificial neural networks to mitigate overfitting. It consists of dynamically deactivating subsets of the network during training to promote more robust representations. Despite its widespread adoption, dropout probabilities are often selected heuristically, and theoretical explanations of its success remain sparse. Here, we analytically study dropout in two-layer neural networks trained with online stochastic gradient descent. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a set of ordinary differential equations that fully characterize the evolution of the network during training and capture the effects of dropout. We obtain a number of exact results describing the generalization error and the optimal dropout probability at short, intermediate, and long training times. Our analysis shows that dropout reduces detrimental correlations between hidden nodes, mitigates the impact of label noise, and that the optimal dropout probability increases with the level of noise in the data. Our results are validated by extensive numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Mixed state deep thermalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07795v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of the mixed state projected ensemble (MSPE), a collection of mixed states describing a local region of a quantum many-body system, conditioned upon measurements of the complementary region which are incomplete. This constitutes a generalization of the pure state projected ensemble in which measurements are assumed ideal and complete, and which has been shown to tend towards limiting pure state distributions depending only on symmetries of the system, thus representing a new kind of universality in quantum equilibration dubbed deep thermalization. We study the MSPE generated by solvable (1+1)d dual-unitary quantum circuit evolution, and identify the limiting mixed state distributions which emerge at late times depending on the size of the incomplete measurement, which we assume to be lossy, finding that they correspond to certain random density matrix ensembles known in the literature. We also derive the rate of the emergence of such universality. Furthermore, we investigate the quantum information properties of the states composing the ensemble, specifically their capacity to teleport quantum information between the ends of the system. The teleportation fidelity is upper bounded by the quantum conditional entropy, which we find exhibits a sharp transition from zero to maximal when the number of measurements lost matches of that the number of degrees of freedom to be teleported. Our results initiate the first investigation of deep thermalization for mixed state ensembles, which are relevant for present-day quantum simulation experiments wherein measurements are typically not perfect, and also amount to a physical and natural way of sampling from hitherto abstract random density matrix ensembles.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Exact Dynamical Structure Factor of the Heisenberg Antiferromagnetic Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:1402.3855v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit our initial derivations of the exact 2-spinon $S_2$ and 4-spinon $S_4$ dynamical structure factors (DSF). First we show that the latter derivations had normalization factors that are twice and quadriple the correct ones respectively. This means that $S_2$ contributes not 72% as was previously thought but 36% to the total DSF. We also calculated the contribution of $S_4$ to be between 18% and 20% and not 27% as was calculated by Caux and Hagemans. In fact we show that the latter reference had also the normalization factor twice the correct value and had it done the numeric integrations correctly it would have obtained a contribution between 36% and 40% for $S_4$. Furthermore, we prove that its claim that our initial derivation of $S_4$ was also incorrect in its dependency on the spectral parameters is incorrect because fixing the momentun transfer $k$ up to $2\pi$ as the latter reference did to justify its claim only amounts to mutltiplying the overall factor by 2 because as we will prove in this paper $S_4$ is periodic in $k$ with period $2\pi$. Also in this paper we derive $S_n$ for general $n$ by following a different approach compared to our initial derivation of $S_4$. Although for $S_4$ both the new derivation and the initial one lead to equivalent formulas that are expressed differently, the new form presented in this paper is much more elegant and compact and also reveals new hidden and nontrivial symmetries which substantially simplify the numeric evaluation of $S_4$ and its sum rules. Moreover based on the results of this paper we propose a simple approximation to the total DSF of the Heisenberg model. Finally we comment on how our work might resolve the discrepancy between the exact theoretic results and experiemntal data as reported by Zaliznyak et al.</description>

Abstract: The Jarzynski equality allows the calculation of free-energy differences using values of work measured from nonequilibrium trajectories. The number of trajectories required to accurately estimate free-energy differences in this way grows sharply with the size of work fluctuations, motivating the search for protocols that perform desired transformations with minimum work. However, protocols of this nature can involve varying temperature, to which the Jarzynski equality does not apply. We derive a variant of the Jarzynski equality that applies to varying-temperature protocols, and show that it can have better convergence properties than the standard version of the equality. We derive this modified equality, and the associated fluctuation relation, within the framework of Markovian stochastic dynamics, complementing related derivations done within the framework of Hamiltonian dynamics.</description>

      <title>First-Passage Time for Upper Bounds on Fluctuations of Trajectory Observables</title>

Abstract: General upper bounds on fluctuations of trajectory observables were recently obtained. It turned out that the size of fluctuations of dynamical observable is limited from below and from above. For the moment generating function of general upper bounds on the size of fluctuations, the moments (average value and variance) of the size of fluctuations are obtained. A more complex and interesting task is to obtain the first-passage time for process of upper bounds on the moments and first-passage time (FPT) of the observable A, which are obtained by calculating the moments and FPT of the process of upper bound. Characteristic functions, average values and variances of the first-passage time of reaching fluctuations of observables of the trajectory of the Markov chain of positive and negative levels are also obtained. Some general issues of the relationship between the theory of random processes (using the example of the risk theory used) and thermodynamics of trajectories are also considered.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Eigenstate thermalization has been numerically shown to occur for few-body observables in a wide range of nonintegrable models. For intensive sums of few-body observables, a weaker version of eigenstate thermalization known as weak eigenstate thermalization has been proved to occur in general. Here, we unveil a stricter weak eigenstate thermalization phenomenon that occurs in quadratic models exhibiting quantum chaos in the single-particle sector (quantum-chaotic quadratic models) and in integrable interacting models. In such models, we argue that few-body observables that have a properly defined system-size independent norm are guaranteed to exhibit at least a polynomially vanishing variance (over the entire many-body energy spectrum) of the diagonal matrix elements, a phenomenon we dub normal weak eigenstate thermalization. We prove that normal weak eigenstate thermalization is a consequence of single-particle eigenstate thermalization, i.e., it can be viewed as a manifestation of quantum chaos at the single-particle level. We report numerical evidence of normal weak eigenstate thermalization for quantum-chaotic quadratic models such as the three-dimensional Anderson model in the delocalized regime and the power-law random banded matrix model, as well as for the integrable interacting spin-1/2 XYZ and XXZ models.</description>

Abstract: We apply evolutionary reinforcement learning to a simulation model in order to identify efficient time-dependent erasure protocols for a physical realization of a one-bit memory by an underdamped mechanical cantilever. We show that these protocols, when applied to the cantilever in the laboratory, are considerably more efficient than our best hand-designed protocols. The learned protocols allow reliable high-speed erasure by minimizing the heating of the memory during the operation. More generally, the combination of methods used here opens the door to the rational design of efficient protocols for a variety of physics applications.</description>

      <title>Theory of Order-Disorder Phase Transitions Induced by Fluctuations Based on Network Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Both quantum phase transitions and thermodynamic phase transitions are probably induced by fluctuations, yet the specific mechanism through which fluctuations cause phase transitions remains unclear in existing theories. This paper summarizes different phases into combinations of three types of network structures based on lattice models transformed into network models. These three network structures correspond to ordered, boundary, and disordered conditions, respectively. By utilizing the transformation relationships satisfied by these three network structures and classical probability, this work derive the high-order detailed balance relationships satisfied by strongly correlated systems. Using the high-order detailed balance formula, this work obtain the weights of the maximum entropy network structures in general cases. Consequently, I clearly describe the process of ordered-disordered phase transitions based on fluctuations and provide critical exponents and phase transition points. Finally, I verify this theory using the Ising model in different dimensions, the frustration scenario of the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic Ising model, and the expectation of ground-state energy in the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model.</description>

      <title>Time-delayed Newton's law of cooling with a finite-rate thermal quench: Impact on the Mpemba and Kovacs effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.13665v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mpemba and Kovacs effects are two notable memory phenomena observed in nonequilibrium relaxation processes. In a recent study [Phys.~Rev.~E \textbf{109}, 044149 (2024)], these effects were analyzed within the framework of the time-delayed Newton's law of cooling under the assumption of instantaneous temperature quenches. Here, the analysis is extended to incorporate finite-rate quenches, characterized by a nonzero quench duration $\sigma$. The results indicate that a genuine Mpemba effect is absent under finite-rate quenches if both samples experience the same thermal environment during the quenching process. However, if $\sigma$ remains sufficiently small, the deviations in the thermal environment stay within an acceptable range, allowing the Mpemba effect to persist with a slightly enhanced magnitude. In contrast, the Kovacs effect is significantly amplified, with the transient hump in the temperature evolution becoming more pronounced as both the waiting time and $\sigma$ increase. These findings underscore the importance of incorporating finite-time effects in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation models and offer a more realistic perspective for experimental studies.</description>

Abstract: Water is an unusual liquid. Its thermophysical properties are non-monotonic with temperature T and pressure p. It's not been known how water's behaviors are encoded in its molecules. We give a statistical physics model, Cage Water, which assumes three bonding states: van der Waals, pairwise hydrogen bonding, and multi-body cooperative caging hydrogen bonds. The model is analytical, so very fast to compute, yet it gives excellent agreement with extensive pT experiments. Through readily interpretable substates, Cage Water explains water's liquid anomalies -- including its controversial liquid-liquid supercooling transition -- as simple switchovers among the three bonding types.</description>

      <title>General Hamiltonian description of nonreciprocal interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05246v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.</description>

      <title>Particle exchange statistics beyond fermions and bosons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05203v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is commonly believed that there are only two types of particle exchange statistics in quantum mechanics, fermions and bosons, with the exception of anyons in two dimension. In principle, a second exception known as parastatistics, which extends outside of two dimensions, has been considered but was believed to be physically equivalent to fermions and bosons. In this paper we show that nontrivial parastatistics inequivalent to either fermions or bosons can exist in physical systems. These new types of identical particles obey generalized exclusion principles, leading to exotic free-particle thermodynamics distinct from any system of free fermions and bosons. We formulate our theory by developing a second quantization of paraparticles, which naturally includes exactly solvable non-interacting theories, and incorporates physical constraints such as locality. We then construct a family of exactly solvable quantum spin models in one and two dimensions where free paraparticles emerge as quasiparticle excitations, and their exchange statistics can be physically observed and is notably distinct from fermions and bosons. This demonstrates the possibility of a new type of quasiparticle in condensed matter systems, and, more speculatively, the potential for previously unconsidered types of elementary particles.</description>

      <title>Gibbs-preserving operations requiring infinite amount of quantum coherence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03479v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gibbs-preserving operations have been studied as one of the standard free processes in quantum thermodynamics. Although they admit a simple mathematical structure, their operational significance has been unclear due to the potential hidden cost to implement them using an operatioanlly motivated class of operations, such as thermal operations. Here, we show that this hidden cost can be infinite -- we present a family of Gibbs-preserving operations that cannot be implemented by thermal operations aided by any finite amount of quantum coherence. Our result implies that there are uncountably many Gibbs-preserving operations that require unbounded thermodynamic resources to implement, raising a question about employing Gibbs-preserving operations as available thermodynamics processes. This finding is a consequence of the general lower bounds we provide for the coherence cost of approximately implementing a certain class of Gibbs-preserving operations with a desired accuracy. We find that our lower bound is almost tight, identifying a quantity -- related to the energy change caused by the channel to implement -- as a fundamental quantifier characterizing the coherence cost for the approximate implementation of Gibbs-preserving operations.</description>

      <title>From Single Genes to Populations: Quantifying Broken Detailed Balance in Transcription</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12897v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Are there thermodynamic or information theoretic constraints governing mRNA expression? Here we use the framework of stochastic thermodynamics to assess detailed balance breaking in transcription. For the canonical two-state model of transcription, we derive exact analytic expressions for the entropy production rate of transcription at steady state, expressions that can be evaluated from knowledge of the kinetic parameters of the two-state model. This allows us to easily evaluate the entropy production rate of thousands of genes across seven datasets of two-state model parameters without needing to evaluate the entropy production rate from trajectory-based computation. A data-driven approach then exposes that most genes avoid parameter regimes associated with large entropy production rates, akin to a mesoscopic version of energy expenditure minimization. Importantly, we show that this is not a thermodynamic phenomenon, since the entropy production rate from the two state gene model provides only a weak bound on the housekeeping energy needed to power transcription. Finally, we show that cell-to-cell variability can make mRNA expression seem more or less irreversible than a ``representative cell'' would imply. Overall, our study presents a theoretical and data-driven approach to uncovering the potential thermodynamic and information theoretic constraints that dictate observed behaviors in transcription.</description>

Abstract: Cover times quantify the speed of exhaustive search. In this work, we compute exactly the mean cover time associated with a one-dimensional Brownian search under exponentially distributed resetting. We also approximate the moments of cover times of a wide range of stochastic search processes in $d$-dimensional continuous space and on an arbitrary discrete network under frequent stochastic resetting. These results hold for a large class of resetting time distributions and search processes including diffusion and Markov jump processes.</description>

      <title>Global decomposition of networks into multiple cores formed by local hubs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00355v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Networks are ubiquitous in various fields, representing systems where nodes and their interconnections constitute their intricate structures. We introduce a network decomposition scheme to reveal multiscale core-periphery structures lurking inside, using the concept of locally defined nodal hub centrality and edge-pruning techniques built upon it. We demonstrate that the hub-centrality-based edge pruning reveals a series of breaking points in network decomposition, which effectively separates a network into its backbone and shell structures. Our local-edge decomposition method iteratively identifies and removes locally least connected nodes, and uncovers an onion-like hierarchical structure as a result. Compared with the conventional $k$-core decomposition method, our method based on relative information residing in local structures exhibits a clear advantage in terms of discovering locally crucial substructures. As an application of the method, we present a scheme to detect multiple core-periphery structures and the decomposition of coarse-grained supernode networks, by combining the method with the network community detection.</description>

      <title>Pfaffian structure of the eigenvector overlap for the symplectic Ginibre ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17935v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the integrable structure and scaling limits of the conditioned eigenvector overlap of the symplectic Ginibre ensemble of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices with independent quaternion elements. The average of the overlap matrix elements constructed from left and right eigenvectors, conditioned to $x$, are derived in terms of a Pfaffian determinant. Regarded as a two-dimensional Coulomb gas with the Neumann boundary condition along the real axis, it contains a kernel of skew-orthogonal polynomials with respect to the weight function $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2(1+|z-x|^2)e^{-2|z|^2}$, including a non-trivial insertion of a point charge. The mean off-diagonal overlap is related to the diagonal (self-)overlap by a transposition, in analogy to the complex Ginibre ensemble. For $x$ conditioned to the real line, extending previous results at $x=0$, we determine the skew-orthogonal polynomials and their skew-kernel with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$. This is done in two steps and involves a Christoffel perturbation of the weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)=|z-\overline{x}|^2\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, by computing first the corresponding quantities for the unperturbed weight $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$. Its kernel is shown to satisfy a differential equation at finite matrix size $N$. This allows us to take different large-$N$ limits, where we distinguish bulk and edge regime along the real axis. The limiting mean diagonal overlaps and corresponding eigenvalue correlation functions of the point processes with respect to $\omega^{(\mathrm{over})}(z)$ are determined. We also examine the effect on the planar orthogonal polynomials when changing the variance in $\omega^{(\mathrm{pre})}(z)$, as this appears in the eigenvector statistics of the complex Ginibre ensemble.</description>

Abstract: We propose a symmetry-based approach to constructing lattice models for chiral topological phases, focusing on non-Abelian anyons. Using a 2+1D version of anyon chains and modular tensor categories(MTCs), we ensure exact MTC symmetry at the microscopic level. Numerical simulations using tensor networks demonstrate chiral edge modes for topological phases with Ising and Fibonacci anyons. Our method contrasts with conventional solvability approaches, providing a new theoretical avenue to explore strongly coupled 2+1D systems, revealing chiral edge states in non-Abelian anyonic systems.</description>

Abstract: Exactly solvable models in quantum many body dynamics provide valuable insights into many interesting physical phenomena, and serve as platforms to rigorously investigate fundamental theoretical questions. Nevertheless, they are extremely rare and existing solvable models and solution techniques have serious limitations. In this paper we introduce a new family of exactly solvable unitary circuits which model quantum many body dynamics in discrete space and time. Unlike many previous solvable models, one can exactly compute the full quantum dynamics initialized from any matrix product state in this new family of models. The time evolution of local observables and correlations, the linear growth of Renyi entanglement entropy, spatiotemporal correlations, and out-of-time-order correlations are all exactly computable. A key property of these models enabling the exact solution is that any time evolved local operator is an exact matrix product operator with finite bond dimension, even at arbitrarily long time, which we prove using the underlying (weak) Hopf algebra structure along with tensor network techniques. We lay down the general framework for the construction and solution of this family of models, and give several explicit examples. In particular, we study in detail a model constructed out of a weak Hopf algebra that is very close to a floquet version of the PXP model, and the exact results we obtain may shed light on the phenomenon of quantum many body scars, and more generally, floquet quantum dynamics in constrained systems.</description>

      <title>Observable Measurement-Induced Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09353v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: One of the main postulates of quantum mechanics is that measurements destroy quantum coherence (wave function collapse). Recently it was discovered that in a many-body system dilute local measurements still preserve some coherence across the entire system. As the measurement density is increased, a phase transition occurs that is characterized by the disentanglement of different parts of the system. Unfortunately, this transition is impossible to observe experimentally for macroscopic systems because it requires an exponentially costly full tomography of the many-body wave function or a comparison with the simulation on an oracle classical computer. In this work we report the discovery of another measurement-induced phase transition that can be observed experimentally if quantum dynamics can be reversed. On one side of this phase transition the quantum information encoded in some part of the Hilbert space is fully recovered after the time inversion. On the other side, all quantum information is corrupted. This transition also manifests itself as the change in the behavior of the probability to observe the same measurement outcome in the process that consists of identical blocks repeated many times. In each block the unitary evolution is followed by the measurement. On one side of the transition the probability decreases exponentially with the number of repetitions, on the other it tends to a constant as the number of repetitions is increased. We confirm the existence of the proposed phase transition through numerical simulations of realistic quantum circuits and analytical calculations using an effective random-matrix theory model.</description>

      <title>Discrete distributions are learnable from metastable samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Physically motivated stochastic dynamics are often used to sample from high-dimensional distributions. However such dynamics often get stuck in specific regions of their state space and mix very slowly to the desired stationary state. This causes such systems to approximately sample from a metastable distribution which is usually quite different from the desired, stationary distribution of the dynamic. We rigorously show that, in the case of multi-variable discrete distributions, the true model describing the stationary distribution can be recovered from samples produced from a metastable distribution under minimal assumptions about the system. This follows from a fundamental observation that the single-variable conditionals of metastable distributions that satisfy a strong metastability condition are on average close to those of the stationary distribution. This holds even when the metastable distribution differs considerably from the true model in terms of global metrics like Kullback-Leibler divergence or total variation distance. This property allows us to learn the true model using a conditional likelihood based estimator, even when the samples come from a metastable distribution concentrated in a small region of the state space. Explicit examples of such metastable states can be constructed from regions that effectively bottleneck the probability flow and cause poor mixing of the Markov chain. For specific cases of binary pairwise undirected graphical models (i.e. Ising models), we extend our results to further rigorously show that data coming from metastable states can be used to learn the parameters of the energy function and recover the structure of the model.</description>

      <title>Chaotic-Integrable Transition for Disordered Orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have drawn connections between the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the multi-orbit Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, emphasizing their similarities and differences regarding chaotic behaviors. The features of the spectral form factor, such as the dip-ramp-plateau structure and the adjacent gap ratio, indicate chaos in the disordered orbital Hatsugai-Kohmoto model. One significant conclusion is that the plateau value of the out-of-time-order correlator, whether in the Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with two- or four-body interactions, or a disorder-free Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, does not effectively differentiate between integrable and chaotic phases in many-body systems. This observation suggests a limitation in using out-of-time-order correlator plateau values as a diagnostic tool for chaos. Our exploration of these ideas provides a deeper understanding of how chaos arises in non-Fermi liquid systems and the tools we use to study it. It opens the door to further questions, particularly about whether there are more effective ways to distinguish between chaotic and integrable phases in these complex systems.</description>

      <title>The Dean-Kawasaki equation and stochastic density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Dean-Kawasaki (DK) equation, which is at the basis of stochastic density functional theory (SDFT), was proposed in the mid-nineties to describe the evolution of the density of interacting Brownian particles, which can represent a large number of systems such as colloidal suspensions, supercooled liquids, polymer melts, biological molecules, active or chemotactic particles, or ions in solution. This theoretical framework, which can be summarized as a mathematical reformulation of the coupled overdamped Langevin equations that govern the dynamics of the particles, has attracted a significant amount of attention during the past thirty years. In this review, I present the context in which this framework was introduced, and I recall the main assumptions and calculation techniques that are employed to derive the DK equation. Then, in the broader context of statistical mechanics, I show how SDFT is connected to other theories, such fluctuating hydrodynamics, macroscopic fluctuation theory, or mode-coupling theory. The mathematical questions that are raised by the DK equation are presented in a non-specialist language. In the last parts of the review, I show how the original result was extended in several directions, I present the different strategies and approximations that have been employed to solve the DK equation, both analytically and numerically. I finally list the different situations where SDFT was employed to describe the fluctuations of Brownian suspensions, from the physics of active matter to the description of charged particles and electrolytes.</description>

      <title>The Ising model as a window on quantum gravity with matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19015v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that the Ising model CFT can be used to obtain some clear insights into 3D (quantum) gravity with matter. We review arguments for the existence of its holographic description, and concentrate on the time dependence of perturbations of the theory at high temperature, which would correspond to throwing matter into a black hole in the dual picture. Apart from an expected QNM-like exponential damping, we observe a plateau, a burst and a subsequent re-emergence of the whole signal, the latter being apparently at odds with a black hole interpretation. We provide an explanation of this phenomenon in terms of the properties of bulk matter fields interacting with the BTZ black hole and the fact that the geometry/metric is not fundamental but a derived quantity in the Chern-Simons formulation of 3D gravity. This allows for evading the black hole information paradox in the present context.</description>

      <title>Quantum thermodynamics and semi-definite optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In quantum thermodynamics, a system is described by a Hamiltonian and a list of non-commuting charges representing conserved quantities like particle number or electric charge, and an important goal is to determine the system's minimum energy in the presence of these conserved charges. In optimization theory, a semi-definite program (SDP) involves a linear objective function optimized over the cone of positive semi-definite operators intersected with an affine space. These problems arise from differing motivations in the physics and optimization communities and are phrased using very different terminology, yet they are essentially identical mathematically. By adopting Jaynes' mindset motivated by quantum thermodynamics, we observe that minimizing free energy in the aforementioned thermodynamics problem, instead of energy, leads to an elegant solution in terms of a dual chemical potential maximization problem that is concave in the chemical potential parameters. As such, one can employ standard (stochastic) gradient ascent methods to find the optimal values of these parameters, and these methods are guaranteed to converge quickly. At low temperature, the minimum free energy provides an excellent approximation for the minimum energy. We then show how this Jaynes-inspired gradient-ascent approach can be used in both first- and second-order classical and hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for minimizing energy, and equivalently, how it can be used for solving SDPs, with guarantees on the runtimes of the algorithms. The approach discussed here is well grounded in quantum thermodynamics and, as such, provides physical motivation underpinning why algorithms published fifty years after Jaynes' seminal work, including the matrix multiplicative weights update method, the matrix exponentiated gradient update method, and their quantum algorithmic generalizations, perform well at solving SDPs.</description>
