      <title>Active Liquid-Liquid Phase-Separation in a Confining Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) in a confining environment is believed to play an important role in cell biology. Recently, it was shown that when active noise at the microscopic level is included in the classical theory of nucleation and growth then this does not cause the breakdown of detailed balance at the \textit{macroscopic} level provided that the droplet radius is the only collective coordinate. Here, we present a simple model for active LLPS in a confining environment, with the droplet location in a confining potential as a second collective coordinate, and find that detailed balance \textit{is} broken at the macroscopic level in an unusual fashion, using the Fluctuation-Dissipation Theorem as a diagnostic.</description>

      <title>Microscopic origin of liquid viscosity from unstable localized modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viscosity is the resistance of a liquid to flow, governed by atomic-scale friction between its constituent atoms. While viscosity can be directly computed using the Green-Kubo formalism, this method does not fully elucidate the physical mechanisms underlying such momentum transport coefficient. In fact, the microscopic origin of liquid viscosity remains poorly understood. In this work, we calculate the viscosity of a $\mathrm{Cu_{50}Zr_{50}}$ metallic liquid and a Kob-Andersen model in a large range of temperatures and compare the results with a theoretical formula based on nonaffine linear response and instantaneous normal mode theory. This analysis reveals that only unstable localized instantaneous normal modes (ULINMs) contribute to viscosity, providing a microscopic definition of viscosity as diffusive momentum transport facilitated by local structural excitations mediated by ULINMs as precursors. Leveraging on the concept of configurational entropy, a quantitative model to connect viscosity with ULINMs is also proposed and validated in both the Arrhenius and non-Arrhenius regimes. In summary, our work provides a microscopic definition of liquid viscosity and highlights the fundamental role of ULINMs as its building blocks, ultimately opening the path to an atomic-scale prediction of viscosity in liquids and glasses.</description>

      <title>Non-electrostatic interactions as random fields in charged liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an equation capable of treating both the electrostatic and non-electrostatic interactions in the charged liquids. The equation derived is a complex version of the Poisson-Boltzmann equation, in which the non-electrostatic interactions are transformed to complex random fields by the field theory. Thus, the non-electrostatic interactions of the ions in the charged liquids can be simulated easily by generating random numbers according to the random fields. To solve the equation, the finite element method has been applied. The non-electrostatic interactions treated in the equation are general. In this study, we take the steric effect of ions as an example. Results show that the steric effect can be clearly caught by the equation.</description>

      <title>Are crumpled sheets marginally stable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study networks of coupled bistable elastic elements, recently proposed as a model for crumpled thin sheets. The networks are poised on the verge of a localized instability, and the model allows unique access to both local and global properties associated with marginal stability. We directly measure pseudo-gaps in the spectrum of local excitations, as well as diverging fluctuations under shear. The networks also host quasi-localized, low-frequency vibrational modes, and scale-free avalanches of instabilities. We propose a correction to the scaling between the pseudo-gap exponent and avalanche statistics based on diverging length fluctuations. Crucially, the dynamics are dominated by a small population of bonds which are locally unstable. Our model combines a coarse-grained view with a continuous, real-space implementation, providing novel insights to a wide class of amorphous solids.</description>

      <title>Defects Enhance Stability in 12-fold Symmetric Soft-Matter Quasicrystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quasicrystals are materials that exhibit long-range order without translational periodicity. In soft matter, the most commonly observed quasicrystal has 12-fold symmetry and consists of tilings made out of squares and triangles. Intriguingly, both in experiments and simulations, these tilings nearly always appear with many vacancy-related defects that are connected to an additional tile: a rhombus. In this letter, we explore the role of rhombus defects on the entropy of square-triangle 12-fold quasicrystals. We introduce a novel lattice-based Monte Carlo simulation method that uses open boundaries to allow the concentration of defects to fluctuate. Our simulations show that rhombus tiles significantly increase the configurational entropy of the quasicrystal phase, enhancing its stability. These findings highlight the critical role of defects in stabilizing soft-matter quasicrystals.</description>

      <title>Applications of aligned nanofiber for tissue engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In tissue engineering, we seek to address comprehensive tissue repair and regeneration needs. Aligned nanofibers have emerged as powerful and versatile tools, attributable to their structural and biochemical congruence with the natural extracellular matrix (ECM). This review delineates the contemporary applications of aligned nanofibers in tissue engineering, spotlighting their implementation across musculoskeletal, neural, and cardiovascular tissue domains. The influence of fiber alignment on critical cellular behaviors - cell adhesion, migration, orientation, and differentiation - is reviewed. We also discuss how nanofibers are improved by adding growth factors, peptides, and drugs to help tissues regenerate better. Comprehensive analyses of in vivo trials and clinical studies corroborate the efficacy and safety of these fibers in tissue engineering applications. The review culminates with exploring extant challenges, concurrently charting prospective avenues in aligned nanofiber-centric tissue engineering.</description>

      <title>Structural Diversity in Condensed Matter: A General Characterization of Crystals, Amorphous Solids and the Structures Between</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A definition of structural diversity, adapted from the biodiversity literature, is introduced to provide a general characterization of structures of condensed matter. Using the Favored Local Structure (FLS) lattice model as a testbed, the diversity measure is found to effectively filter extrinsic noise and to provide a useful differentiation between crystal and amorphous structures. We identify an interesting class of structures intermediate between crystals and glasses that are characterised by a complex combination of short-range ordering and long-range disorder. We demonstrate how the diversity can be used as an order parameter to organise various scenarios by structure change in response to increasing diversity.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Correlations in Elastic Moduli and Local Stresses at the Unjamming Transition</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.19908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the behavior of spatially heterogeneous elastic moduli as well as the correlations between local moduli in model solids with short-range repulsive potentials. We show through numerical simulations that local elastic moduli exhibit long-range correlations, similar to correlations in the local stresses. Specifically, the correlations in local shear moduli exhibit anisotropic behavior at large lengthscales characterized by pinch-point singularities in Fourier space, displaying a structural pattern akin to shear stress correlations. Focussing on two-dimensional jammed solids approaching the unjamming transition, we show that stress correlations exhibit universal properties, characterized by a quadratic $p^2$ dependence of the correlations as the pressure $p$ approaches zero, independent of the details of the model. In contrast, the modulus correlations exhibit a power-law dependence with different exponents depending on the specific interaction potential. Furthermore, we illustrate that while affine responses lack long-range correlations, the total modulus, which encompasses non-affine behavior, exhibits long-range correlations.</description>

      <title>A generalized geometric mechanics theory for multi-curve-fold origami: vertex constrained universal configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Folding paper along curves leads to spatial structures that have curved surfaces meeting at spatial creases, defined as curve-fold origami. In this work, we provide an Eulerian framework focusing on the mechanics of arbitrary curve-fold origami, especially for multi-curve-fold origami with vertices. We start with single-curve-fold origami that has wide panels. Wide panel leads to different domains of mechanical responses induced by various generator distributions of the curved surface. The theories are then extended to multi-curve-fold origami, involving additional geometric correlations between creases. As an illustrative example, the deformation and equilibrium configuration of origami with annular creases are studied both theoretically and numerically. Afterward, single-vertex curved origami theory is studied as a special type of multi-curve-fold origami. We find that the extra periodicity at the vertex strongly constrains the configuration space, leading to a region near the vertex that has a striking universal equilibrium configuration regardless of the mechanical properties. Both theories and numerics confirm the existence of the universality in the near-field region. In addition, the far-field deformation is obtained via energy minimization and validated by finite element analysis. Our generalized multi-curve-fold origami theory, including the vertex-contained universality, is anticipated to provide a new understanding and framework for the shape programming of the curved fold origami system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.14440v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An increasing interest in molecular structures whose long term dynamics resemble those of bistable mechanical systems promotes the search of possible candidates that may operate as two-state switching units. Of particular interest are the systems that are capable to exhibit such bistable effects as spontaneous vibrations, stochastic resonance and spontaneous synchronization. Previously, in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations it has been demonstrated that short pyridine-furan springs show these bistable phenomena. In this article we introduce a coarse-grained model of such springs and investigate the possibility to observe the bistability effects, such as spontaneous vibrations. Our findings allow the studies of short pyridine-furan springs at large time and length scales and open field for further computational research of large bistable systems.</description>

      <title>Competing addition processes give distinct growth regimes in the assembly of 1D filaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a model to describe the concentration-dependent growth of protein filaments. Our model contains two states, a low entropy/high affinity ordered state and a high entropy/low affinity disordered state. Consistent with experiments, our model shows a diffusion-limited linear growth regime at low concentration, followed by a concentration independent plateau at intermediate concentrations, and rapid disordered precipitation at the highest concentrations. We show that growth in the linear and plateau regions is the result of two processes that compete amid the rapid binding and unbinding of non-specific states. The first process is the addition of ordered molecules during the periods where the end of the filament is free of incorrectly bound molecules. The second process is the capture of defects, which occurs when consecutive ordered additions occur on top of incorrectly bound molecules. We show that a key molecular property is the probability that a diffusive collision results in a correctly bound state. Small values of this probability suppress the defect capture growth mode, resulting in a plateau in the growth rate when incorrectly bound molecules become common enough to poison ordered growth. We show that conditions that non-specifically suppress or enhance intermolecular interactions, such as the addition of depletants or osmolytes, have opposite effects on the growth rate in the linear and plateau regimes. In the linear regime stronger interactions promote growth by reducing dissolution events, but in the plateau regime stronger interactions inhibit growth by stabilizing incorrectly bound molecules.</description>

      <title>Arrested on heating: controlling the motility of active droplets by temperature</title>

Abstract: Self-propelling active matter relies on the conversion of energy from the undirected, nanoscopic scale to directed, macroscopic motion. One of the challenges in the design of synthetic active matter lies in the control of dynamic states, or motility gaits. Here, we present an experimental system of self-propelling droplets with thermally controllable and reversible dynamic states, from unsteady over meandering to persistent to arrested motion. These states are known to depend on the P\'eclet number of the molecular process powering the motion, which we can now tune by using a temperature sensitive mixture of surfactants as propulsion fuel. We quantify the droplet dynamics by analysing flow and chemical fields for the individual states, comparing them to canonical models for autophoretic particles. In the context of these models, we experimentally observe, in situ, the fundamental first broken symmetry that translates an isotropic, immotile base state to self-propelled motility.</description>

      <title>Universal Translational and Rotational Mobility Expressions of Phoretic and Self-phoretic Particles with Arbitrary Interaction Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18861v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mobility of externally-driven phoretic propulsion of particles is evaluated by simultaneously solving the solute conservation equation, interaction potential equation, and the modified Stokes equation. While accurate, this approach is cumbersome, especially when the interaction potential decays slowly compared to the particle size. In contrast to external phoresis, the motion of self-phoretic particles is typically estimated by relating the translation and rotation velocities with the local slip velocity. While this approach is convenient and thus widely used, it is only valid when the interaction decay length is significantly smaller than the particle size. Here, by taking inspiration from Brady J. Fluid Mech. (2021), vol. 922, A10, which combines the benefits of two approaches, we reproduce their unified mobility expressions with arbitrary interaction potentials and show that these expressions can conveniently recover the well-known mobility relationships of external electrophoresis and diffusiophoresis for arbitrary double-layer thickness. Additionally, we show that for a spherical microswimmer, the derived expressions relax to the slip velocity calculations in the limit of the thin interaction lengthscales. We also employ the derived mobility expressions to calculate the velocities of an autophoretic Janus particle. We find that there is significant dampening in the translation velocity even when the interaction length is an order of magnitude larger than the particle size. Finally, we study the motion of a catalytically self-propelled particle, while it also propels due to external concentration gradients, and demonstrate how the two propulsion modes compete with each other.</description>

      <title>Experimental Insights into Droplet Behavior on Van der Waals and Non-Van der Waals Liquid-Impregnated Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.11321v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Droplet impact is a fascinating phenomenon that occurs when a liquid droplet collides with a surface. It is not only a fundamental area of scientific inquiry but also has practical implications across many industries and natural systems. The dynamics during droplet impact on liquid-impregnated surfaces are of special interest because the properties of the surface and impregnated liquid may significantly change the impact outcome. We present a detailed study of the impact and subsequent retraction of liquid droplets on a liquid-impregnated surface using high-speed imagery. Square-shaped textures with varying post-spacings of 5, 20, and 30 um on a silicon wafer were fabricated and functionalised using octadecyl trichlorosilane. Two different lubricants, silicone oil and hexadecane, were infused to investigate how their properties affect impact dynamics. Droplet impacts were investigated on these surfaces across a broad range of Weber numbers (28-495). Additionally, we measured the stability of the LIS surface by calculating spreading coefficients and contact angles. The experiments revealed that the properties of the infused oil play an insignificant role in droplet dynamics, including spreading, rebound, and unique phenomena related to oil interaction with surface textures. This study provides insights into the intricate dynamics of droplet interactions with LIS, offering valuable contributions to understanding surface-wetting phenomena.</description>
