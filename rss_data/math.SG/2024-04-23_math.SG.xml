      <title>Generic doubling of rectangular pegs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove a multiplicity result for rectangular pegs that there is a generic class of smooth Jordan curves in which every curve admits two geometrically distinct similar inscribed rectangles with aspect angle in $(0,\frac{\pi}{2})$, based on the a priori existence result of rectangular peg by Greene and Lobb, in which the rectangular peg problem is translated into finding intersection points of two Lagrangian tori. The key insights are certain generic geometric transversality of the two tori, and the correspondence between the intersection points and the inscribed rectangles. We present two distinct proofs: one involves the Lagrangian Floer homology, and the other is differential topological in nature which employs a novel computation formula for the algebraic intersection number. In Appendix B, written jointly with Urs Frauenfelder, we provide the detailed derivation of this computation formula.</description>

      <title>Reduction of coK\"{a}hler and 3-cosymplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The notion of coK\"{a}hler manifolds (resp. 3-cosymplectic manifolds) is an odd-dimensional analogue of the one of K\"{a}hler manifolds (resp. hyperK\"{a}hler manifolds). In this paper, we obtain reduction theorems of coK\"{a}hler manifolds and 3-cosymplectic manifolds. We prove that K\"{a}hler and coK\"{a}hler reductions have a natural compatibility with respect to cone constructions, that is, the coK\"{a}hler quotient of the cone of a K\"{a}hler manifold (resp. the K\"{a}hler quotient of the cone of a coK\"{a}hler manifold) coincides with the cone of the K\"{a}hler quotient (resp. the cone of the coK\"{a}hler quotient). We also show that hyperK\"{a}hler and 3-cosymplectic reductions admit the compatibility with respect to cone constructions. We further prove that the compatibility of K\"{a}hler and coK\"{a}hler reductions with respect to mapping torus constructions also does hold.</description>

      <title>Legendrian Lavrentiev links</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lavrentiev curves form a special class of rectifiable curves which includes cusp-free piecewise smooth curves. We call a Lavrentiev curve Legendrian if the integral of the contact form equals zero on any its subarc. We define Legendrian isotopies of such curves and prove that the equivalence classes of Legendrian Lavrentiev links with respect to Legendrian isotopies coincide with smooth classes.</description>

      <title>A note on Stein fillability of circle bundles over symplectic manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that, given a closed integral symplectic manifold $(\Sigma, \omega)$ of dimension $2n \geq 4$, for every integer $k&gt;\int_{\Sigma}\omega^{n}$, the Boothby-Wang bundle over $(\Sigma, k\omega)$ carries no Stein fillable contact structure. This negatively answers a question raised by Eliashberg. A similar result holds for Boothby-Wang orbibundles. As an application, we prove the non-smoothability of some isolated singularities.</description>

      <title>Divergence-free framings of three-manifolds via eigenspinors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14331v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gromov used convex integration to prove that any closed orientable three-manifold equipped with a volume form admits three divergence-free vector fields which are linearly independent at every point. We provide an alternative proof of this (inspired by Seiberg-Witten theory) using geometric properties of eigenspinors in three dimensions. In fact, our proof shows that for any Riemannian metric, one can find three divergence-free vector fields such that at every point they are orthogonal and have the same non-zero length.</description>

      <title>On the Lagrangian capacity of convex or concave toric domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.11022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2207.11022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish computational results concerning the Lagrangian capacity, originally defined by Cieliebak-Mohnke. More precisely, we show that the Lagrangian capacity of a 4-dimensional convex toric domain is equal to its diagonal. Working under the assumption that there is a suitable virtual perturbation scheme which defines the curve counts of linearized contact homology, we extend the previous result to any convex or concave toric domain. This result gives a positive answer to a conjecture of Cieliebak-Mohnke for the Lagrangian capacity of the ellipsoid.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic mirrors for minimal adjoint orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.02471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.02471v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I discuss mirrors of Landau-Ginzburg models formed by a minimal semisimple adjoint orbit of $\mathfrak{sl}(n)$ together with a potential obtained via the Cartan-Killing form. I show that the Landau-Ginzburg models produced by the Gross-Siebert recipe give precisely the objects of the desired mirrors.
  It is known that Landau-Ginzburg model $LG(2)$ over the semisimple adjoint orbit of $\mathfrak{sl}(2)$ does not have projective mirrors. I prove Homological Mirror Symmetry for $LG(2)$ by constructing a Landau-Ginzburg mirror and showing that its Orlov category of singularities is equivalent to $Fuk(LG(2))$.</description>

      <title>Exotic 4-manifolds with signature zero</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10908v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We produce infinitely many distinct irreducible smooth 4-manifolds homeomorphic to #(2m+1)(CP^2 # -CP^2) and #(2n+1)(S^2 x S^2), respectively, for each m&gt;3 and n&gt;4. These provide the smallest exotic closed simply connected 4-manifolds with signature zero known to date, and in each one of these homeomorphism classes, we get minimal symplectic 4-manifolds. Our novel exotic 4-manifolds are derived from fairly special small Lefschetz fibrations we build via positive factorizations in the mapping class group, with spin and non-spin monodromies.</description>
