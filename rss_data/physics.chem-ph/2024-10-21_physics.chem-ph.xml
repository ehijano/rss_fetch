      <title>Force switching and potential shifting lead to errors in free energies of alchemical transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In molecular simulations, the accurate treatment of long-range energy terms, such as van der Waals interactions, is crucial for reliable free energy calculations. Methods like force switching, potential switching, and potential shifting are commonly employed to smooth the truncation of these interactions at a specified cutoff distance, but their effects on free energy calculations are not well understood. In this study, we systematically explore the effects of these modifiers on the accuracy of free energy calculations using two model systems: Lennard-Jones spheres and a simplified anthracene in water. Our results reveal that the free energy of solvation using potential switching is essentially independent of cutoff, while force switching and potential shifting introduce errors as a function of cutoff significant enough to affect the utility of the calculations.</description>

      <title>Ultrafast Processes in 1,2-Dichloroethene measured with a Universal XUV probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The presence of two chlorine atoms in 1,2-dichloroethene allows for isomerisation around the double bond. This isomerisation can lead to rich photochemistry. We present a time-resolved pump-probe photoelectron spectroscopy measurement on both the cis- and trans- isomers of 1,2-dichloroethene. A universal XUV probe of 22.3 eV is used allowing observation of photoelectrons formed anywhere on the potential energy surface, even from the ground-state or dissociation products. Following excitation with a 200 nm probe both ultrafast excited state dynamics and product formation are observed within the time resolution of the experiment. Excited state population begins to return to the ground state on an ultrafast time scale (&lt; 70 fs) and population of products channels is observed on the same timescale. With the aid of ab initio calculations it is found that population transfer from the excited state is facilitated by vibrational modes involving C-C-H bends.</description>

      <title>A Bond-Based Machine Learning Model for Molecular Polarizabilities and A Priori Raman Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of machine learning (ML) algorithms in molecular simulations has become commonplace in recent years. There now exists, for instance, a multitude of ML force field algorithms that have enabled simulations approaching ab initio level accuracy at time scales and system sizes that significantly exceed what is otherwise possible with traditional methods. Far fewer algorithms exist for predicting rotationally equivariant, tensorial properties such as the electric polarizability. Here, we introduce a kernel ridge regression algorithm for machine learning of the polarizability tensor. This algorithm is based on the bond polarizability model and allows prediction of the tensor components at the cost similar to that of scalar quantities. We subsequently show the utility of this algorithm by simulating gas phase Raman spectra of biphenyl and malonaldehyde using classical molecular dynamics simulations of these systems performed with the recently developed MACE-OFF23 potential. The calculated spectra are shown to agree very well with the experiments and thus confirm the expediency of our algorithm as well as the accuracy of the used force field. More generally, this work demonstrates the potential of physics-informed approaches to yield simple yet effective machine learning algorithms for molecular properties.</description>

      <title>Design of Amine-Functionalized Materials for Direct Air Capture Using Integrated High-Throughput Calculations and Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13982v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Direct air capture (DAC) of carbon dioxide is a critical technology for mitigating climate change, but current materials face limitations in efficiency and scalability. We discover novel DAC materials using a combined machine learning (ML) and high-throughput atomistic modeling approach. Our ML model accurately predicts high-quality, density functional theory-computed CO$_{2}$ binding enthalpies for a wide range of nitrogen-bearing moieties. Leveraging this model, we rapidly screen over 1.6 million binding sites from a comprehensive database of theoretically feasible molecules to identify materials with superior CO$_{2}$ binding properties. Additionally, we assess the synthesizability and experimental feasibility of these structures using established ML metrics, discovering nearly 2,500 novel materials suitable for integration into DAC devices. Altogether, our high-fidelity database and ML framework represent a significant advancement in the rational development of scalable, cost-effective carbon dioxide capture technologies, offering a promising pathway to meet key targets in the global initiative to combat climate change.</description>

      <title>Efficient charge-preserving excited state preparation with variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining the spectrum and wave functions of excited states of a system is crucial in quantum physics and chemistry. Low-depth quantum algorithms, such as the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and its variants, can be used to determine the ground-state energy. However, current approaches to computing excited states require numerous controlled unitaries, making the application of the original Variational Quantum Deflation (VQD) algorithm to problems in chemistry or physics suboptimal. In this study, we introduce a charge-preserving VQD (CPVQD) algorithm, designed to incorporate symmetry and the corresponding conserved charge into the VQD framework. This results in dimension reduction, significantly enhancing the efficiency of excited-state computations. We present benchmark results with GPU-accelerated simulations using systems up to 24 qubits, showcasing applications in high-energy physics, nuclear physics, and quantum chemistry. This work is performed on NERSC's Perlmutter system using NVIDIA's open-source platform for accelerated quantum supercomputing - CUDA-Q.</description>

      <title>Microscopic Amp\`ere current-current interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid development of modern measurement techniques, the energy resolution of $1 \, meV$ can now be easily obtained. Generally, the driving mechanisms of the physical, chemical or biological processes of the matters or the living organisms on Earth at about $1 \, meV$ energy scale are assumed to stem from the fundamental microscopic Coulomb interaction, its various reduced ones and the relativistic corrections. In this article, by using a path integral approach on a non-relativistic quantum electrodynamics theory, we show that there is another fundamental microscopic electromagnetic interaction at this energy scale, the microscopic Amp\`ere current-current interaction. It has time-dependent dynamical feature and can be the driving interaction of the physical, chemical or biological processes at about $1\, meV$ energy scale. A new Amp\`ere-type exchange spin interaction is also found with a magnitude about $10^{-4}$ of the well-known Heisenberg exchange spin interaction.</description>
