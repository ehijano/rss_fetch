      <title>Winter Soldier: Backdooring Language Models at Pre-Training with Indirect Data Poisoning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pre-training of large language models (LLMs) relies on massive text datasets sourced from diverse and difficult-to-curate origins. Although membership inference attacks and hidden canaries have been explored to trace data usage, such methods rely on memorization of training data, which LM providers try to limit. In this work, we demonstrate that indirect data poisoning (where the targeted behavior is absent from training data) is not only feasible but also allow to effectively protect a dataset and trace its use. Using gradient-based optimization prompt-tuning, we make a model learn arbitrary secret sequences: secret responses to secret prompts that are absent from the training corpus. We validate our approach on language models pre-trained from scratch and show that less than 0.005% of poisoned tokens are sufficient to covertly make a LM learn a secret and detect it with extremely high confidence ($p &lt; 10^{-55}$) with a theoretically certifiable scheme. Crucially, this occurs without performance degradation (on LM benchmarks) and despite secrets never appearing in the training set.</description>

      <title>Fair Data Exchange with Constant-Time Proofs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fair Data Exchange (FDE) protocol introduced at CCS 2024 offers atomic pay-per-file transfers with constant-size proofs, but its prover and verifier runtimes still scale linearly with the file length n. We collapse these costs to essentially constant by viewing the file as a rate-1 Reed-Solomon (RS) codeword, extending it to a lower-rate RS code with constant redundancy, encrypting this extended vector, and then proving correctness for only a small random subset of the resulting ciphertexts; RS decoding repairs any corrupted symbols with negligible failure probability. Our protocol preserves full client- and server-fairness, and adds only a tunable communication redundancy overhead.
  Finally, we patch the elliptic-curve mismatch in the Bitcoin instantiation of FDE with a compact zk-SNARK, enabling the entire exchange to run off-chain and falling back to just two on-chain transactions when channels are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Narrowing the Gap between TEEs Threat Model and Deployment Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.14964v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Confidential Virtual Machines (CVMs) provide isolation guarantees for data in use, but their threat model does not include physical level protection and side-channel attacks. Therefore, current deployments rely on trusted cloud providers to host the CVMs' underlying infrastructure. However, TEE attestations do not provide information about the operator hosting a CVM. Without knowing whether a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) runs within a provider's infrastructure, a user cannot accurately assess the risks of physical attacks. We observe a misalignment in the threat model where the workloads are protected against other tenants but do not offer end-to-end security assurances to external users without relying on cloud providers. The attestation should be extended to bind the CVM with the provider. A possible solution can rely on the Protected Platform Identifier (PPID), a unique CPU identifier. However, the implementation details of various TEE manufacturers, attestation flows, and providers vary. This makes verification of attestations, ease of migration, and building applications without relying on a trusted party challenging, highlighting a key limitation that must be addressed for the adoption of CVMs. We discuss two points focusing on hardening and extensions of TEEs' attestation.</description>

      <title>Private Continual Counting of Unbounded Streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15018v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of differentially private continual counting in the unbounded setting where the input size $n$ is not known in advance. Current state-of-the-art algorithms based on optimal instantiations of the matrix mechanism cannot be directly applied here because their privacy guarantees only hold when key parameters are tuned to $n$. Using the common `doubling trick' avoids knowledge of $n$ but leads to suboptimal and non-smooth error. We solve this problem by introducing novel matrix factorizations based on logarithmic perturbations of the function $\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-z}}$ studied in prior works, which may be of independent interest. The resulting algorithm has smooth error, and for any $\alpha &gt; 0$ and $t\leq n$ it is able to privately estimate the sum of the first $t$ data points with $O(\log^{2+2\alpha}(t))$ variance. It requires $O(t)$ space and amortized $O(\log t)$ time per round, compared to $O(\log(n)\log(t))$ variance, $O(n)$ space and $O(n \log n)$ pre-processing time for the nearly-optimal bounded-input algorithm of Henzinger et al. (SODA 2023). Empirically, we find that our algorithm's performance is also comparable to theirs in absolute terms: our variance is less than $1.5\times$ theirs for $t$ as large as $2^{24}$.</description>

      <title>Systems-Theoretic and Data-Driven Security Analysis in ML-enabled Medical Devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The integration of AI/ML into medical devices is rapidly transforming healthcare by enhancing diagnostic and treatment facilities. However, this advancement also introduces serious cybersecurity risks due to the use of complex and often opaque models, extensive interconnectivity, interoperability with third-party peripheral devices, Internet connectivity, and vulnerabilities in the underlying technologies. These factors contribute to a broad attack surface and make threat prevention, detection, and mitigation challenging. Given the highly safety-critical nature of these devices, a cyberattack on these devices can cause the ML models to mispredict, thereby posing significant safety risks to patients. Therefore, ensuring the security of these devices from the time of design is essential. This paper underscores the urgency of addressing the cybersecurity challenges in ML-enabled medical devices at the pre-market phase. We begin by analyzing publicly available data on device recalls and adverse events, and known vulnerabilities, to understand the threat landscape of AI/ML-enabled medical devices and their repercussions on patient safety. Building on this analysis, we introduce a suite of tools and techniques designed by us to assist security analysts in conducting comprehensive premarket risk assessments. Our work aims to empower manufacturers to embed cybersecurity as a core design principle in AI/ML-enabled medical devices, thereby making them safe for patients.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a multithread and efficient cryptographic hardware access (MECHA) for efficient and fast cryptographic operations that eliminates the need for context switching. Utilizing a UNIX domain socket, MECHA manages multiple requests from multiple applications simultaneously, resulting in faster processing and improved efficiency. We comprise several key components, including the Server thread, Client thread, Transceiver thread, and a pair of Sender and Receiver queues. MECHA design is portable and can be used with any communication protocol, with experimental results demonstrating a 83% increase in the speed of concurrent cryptographic requests compared to conventional interface design. MECHA architecture has significant potential in the field of secure communication applications ranging from cloud computing to the IoT, offering a faster and more efficient solution for managing multiple cryptographic operation requests concurrently.</description>

      <title>Advanced Prediction of Hypersonic Missile Trajectories with CNN-LSTM-GRU Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15043</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15043v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Advancements in the defense industry are paramount for ensuring the safety and security of nations, providing robust protection against emerging threats. Among these threats, hypersonic missiles pose a significant challenge due to their extreme speeds and maneuverability, making accurate trajectory prediction a critical necessity for effective countermeasures. This paper addresses this challenge by employing a novel hybrid deep learning approach, integrating Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs). By leveraging the strengths of these architectures, the proposed method successfully predicts the complex trajectories of hypersonic missiles with high accuracy, offering a significant contribution to defense strategies and missile interception technologies. This research demonstrates the potential of advanced machine learning techniques in enhancing the predictive capabilities of defense systems.</description>

      <title>Toward a Lightweight, Scalable, and Parallel Secure Encryption Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exponential growth of Internet of Things (IoT) applications has intensified the demand for efficient, high-throughput, and energy-efficient data processing at the edge. Conventional CPU-centric encryption methods suffer from performance bottlenecks and excessive data movement, especially in latency-sensitive and resource-constrained environments. In this paper, we present SPiME, a lightweight, scalable, and FPGA-compatible Secure Processor-in-Memory Encryption architecture that integrates the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES-128) directly into a Processing-in-Memory (PiM) framework. SPiME is designed as a modular array of parallel PiM units, each combining an AES core with a minimal control unit to enable distributed in-place encryption with minimal overhead. The architecture is fully implemented in Verilog and tested on multiple AMD UltraScale and UltraScale+ FPGAs. Evaluation results show that SPiME can scale beyond 4,000 parallel units while maintaining less than 5\% utilization of key FPGA resources on high-end devices. It delivers over 25~Gbps in sustained encryption throughput with predictable, low-latency performance. The design's portability, configurability, and resource efficiency make it a compelling solution for secure edge computing, embedded cryptographic systems, and customizable hardware accelerators.</description>

      <title>CWGAN-GP Augmented CAE for Jamming Detection in 5G-NR in Non-IID Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15075v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the ever-expanding domain of 5G-NR wireless cellular networks, over-the-air jamming attacks are prevalent as security attacks, compromising the quality of the received signal. We simulate a jamming environment by incorporating additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) into the real-world In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) OFDM datasets. A Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) is exploited to implement a jamming detection over various characteristics such as heterogenous I/Q datasets; extracting relevant information on Synchronization Signal Blocks (SSBs), and fewer SSB observations with notable class imbalance. Given the characteristics of datasets, balanced datasets are acquired by employing a Conv1D conditional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network-Gradient Penalty(CWGAN-GP) on both majority and minority SSB observations. Additionally, we compare the performance and detection ability of the proposed CAE model on augmented datasets with benchmark models: Convolutional Denoising Autoencoder (CDAE) and Convolutional Sparse Autoencoder (CSAE). Despite the complexity of data heterogeneity involved across all datasets, CAE depicts the robustness in detection performance of jammed signal by achieving average values of 97.33% precision, 91.33% recall, 94.08% F1-score, and 94.35% accuracy over CDAE and CSAE.</description>

      <title>Flexible Hardware-Enabled Guarantees for AI Compute</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As artificial intelligence systems become increasingly powerful, they pose growing risks to international security, creating urgent coordination challenges that current governance approaches struggle to address without compromising sensitive information or national security. We propose flexible hardware-enabled guarantees (flexHEGs), that could be integrated with AI accelerators to enable trustworthy, privacy-preserving verification and enforcement of claims about AI development. FlexHEGs consist of an auditable guarantee processor that monitors accelerator usage and a secure enclosure providing physical tamper protection. The system would be fully open source with flexible, updateable verification capabilities. FlexHEGs could enable diverse governance mechanisms including privacy-preserving model evaluations, controlled deployment, compute limits for training, and automated safety protocol enforcement. In this first part of a three part series, we provide a comprehensive introduction of the flexHEG system, including an overview of the governance and security capabilities it offers, its potential development and adoption paths, and the remaining challenges and limitations it faces. While technically challenging, flexHEGs offer an approach to address emerging regulatory and international security challenges in frontier AI development.</description>

      <title>International Security Applications of Flexible Hardware-Enabled Guarantees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As AI capabilities advance rapidly, flexible hardware-enabled guarantees (flexHEGs) offer opportunities to address international security challenges through comprehensive governance frameworks. This report examines how flexHEGs could enable internationally trustworthy AI governance by establishing standardized designs, robust ecosystem defenses, and clear operational parameters for AI-relevant chips. We analyze four critical international security applications: limiting proliferation to address malicious use, implementing safety norms to prevent loss of control, managing risks from military AI systems, and supporting strategic stability through balance-of-power mechanisms while respecting national sovereignty. The report explores both targeted deployments for specific high-risk facilities and comprehensive deployments covering all AI-relevant compute. We examine two primary governance models: verification-based agreements that enable transparent compliance monitoring, and ruleset-based agreements that automatically enforce international rules through cryptographically-signed updates. Through game-theoretic analysis, we demonstrate that comprehensive flexHEG agreements could remain stable under reasonable assumptions about state preferences and catastrophic risks. The report addresses critical implementation challenges including technical thresholds for AI-relevant chips, management of existing non-flexHEG hardware, and safeguards against abuse of governance power. While requiring significant international coordination, flexHEGs could provide a technical foundation for managing AI risks at the scale and speed necessary to address emerging threats to international security and stability.</description>

      <title>EVA-S2PMLP: Secure and Scalable Two-Party MLP via Spatial Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Privacy-preserving neural network training in vertically partitioned scenarios is vital for secure collaborative modeling across institutions. This paper presents \textbf{EVA-S2PMLP}, an Efficient, Verifiable, and Accurate Secure Two-Party Multi-Layer Perceptron framework that introduces spatial-scale optimization for enhanced privacy and performance. To enable reliable computation under real-number domain, EVA-S2PMLP proposes a secure transformation pipeline that maps scalar inputs to vector and matrix spaces while preserving correctness. The framework includes a suite of atomic protocols for linear and non-linear secure computations, with modular support for secure activation, matrix-vector operations, and loss evaluation. Theoretical analysis confirms the reliability, security, and asymptotic complexity of each protocol. Extensive experiments show that EVA-S2PMLP achieves high inference accuracy and significantly reduced communication overhead, with up to $12.3\times$ improvement over baselines. Evaluation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that the framework maintains model utility while ensuring strict data confidentiality, making it a practical solution for privacy-preserving neural network training in finance, healthcare, and cross-organizational AI applications.</description>

      <title>PDLRecover: Privacy-preserving Decentralized Model Recovery with Machine Unlearning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized learning is vulnerable to poison attacks, where malicious clients manipulate local updates to degrade global model performance. Existing defenses mainly detect and filter malicious models, aiming to prevent a limited number of attackers from corrupting the global model. However, restoring an already compromised global model remains a challenge. A direct approach is to remove malicious clients and retrain the model using only the benign clients. Yet, retraining is time-consuming, computationally expensive, and may compromise model consistency and privacy.
  We propose PDLRecover, a novel method to recover a poisoned global model efficiently by leveraging historical model information while preserving privacy. The main challenge lies in protecting shared historical models while enabling parameter estimation for model recovery. By exploiting the linearity of approximate Hessian matrix computation, we apply secret sharing to protect historical updates, ensuring local models are not leaked during transmission or reconstruction. PDLRecover introduces client-side preparation, periodic recovery updates, and a final exact update to ensure robustness and convergence of the recovered model. Periodic updates maintain accurate curvature information, and the final step ensures high-quality convergence. Experiments show that the recovered global model achieves performance comparable to a fully retrained model but with significantly reduced computation and time cost. Moreover, PDLRecover effectively prevents leakage of local model parameters, ensuring both accuracy and privacy in recovery.</description>

      <title>CipherMind: The Longest Codebook in the World</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the widespread application of large language models has inspired us to consider using inference for communication encryption. We therefore propose CipherMind, which utilizes intermediate results from deterministic fine-tuning of large model inferences as transmission content. The semantic parameters of large models exhibit characteristics like opaque underlying implementations and weak interpretability, thus enabling their use as an encryption method for data transmission. This communication paradigm can be applied in scenarios like intra-gateway transmission, and theoretically, it can be implemented using any large model as its foundation.</description>

      <title>From LLMs to MLLMs to Agents: A Survey of Emerging Paradigms in Jailbreak Attacks and Defenses within LLM Ecosystem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are rapidly evolving from single-modal systems to multimodal LLMs and intelligent agents, significantly expanding their capabilities while introducing increasingly severe security risks. This paper presents a systematic survey of the growing complexity of jailbreak attacks and corresponding defense mechanisms within the expanding LLM ecosystem. We first trace the developmental trajectory from LLMs to MLLMs and Agents, highlighting the core security challenges emerging at each stage. Next, we categorize mainstream jailbreak techniques from both the attack impact and visibility perspectives, and provide a comprehensive analysis of representative attack methods, related datasets, and evaluation metrics. On the defense side, we organize existing strategies based on response timing and technical approach, offering a structured understanding of their applicability and implementation. Furthermore, we identify key limitations in existing surveys, such as insufficient attention to agent-specific security issues, the absence of a clear taxonomy for hybrid jailbreak methods, a lack of detailed analysis of experimental setups, and outdated coverage of recent advancements. To address these limitations, we provide an updated synthesis of recent work and outline future research directions in areas such as dataset construction, evaluation framework optimization, and strategy generalization. Our study seeks to enhance the understanding of jailbreak mechanisms and facilitate the advancement of more resilient and adaptive defense strategies in the context of ever more capable LLMs.</description>

      <title>LLM vs. SAST: A Technical Analysis on Detecting Coding Bugs of GPT4-Advanced Data Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP), large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 have gained significant traction in diverse applications, including security vulnerability scanning. This paper investigates the efficacy of GPT-4 in identifying software vulnerabilities compared to traditional Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools. Drawing from an array of security mistakes, our analysis underscores the potent capabilities of GPT-4 in LLM-enhanced vulnerability scanning. We unveiled that GPT-4 (Advanced Data Analysis) outperforms SAST by an accuracy of 94% in detecting 32 types of exploitable vulnerabilities. This study also addresses the potential security concerns surrounding LLMs, emphasising the imperative of security by design/default and other security best practices for AI.</description>

      <title>Facility Location Problem under Local Differential Privacy without Super-set Assumption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce an adaptation of the facility location problem and analyze it within the framework of local differential privacy (LDP). Under this model, we ensure the privacy of client presence at specific locations. When n is the number of points, Gupta et al. established a lower bound of $\Omega(\sqrt{n})$ on the approximation ratio for any differentially private algorithm applied to the original facility location problem. As a result, subsequent works have adopted the super-set assumption, which may, however, compromise user privacy. We show that this lower bound does not apply to our adaptation by presenting an LDP algorithm that achieves a constant approximation ratio with a relatively small additive factor. Additionally, we provide experimental results demonstrating that our algorithm outperforms the straightforward approach on both synthetically generated and real-world datasets.</description>

      <title>RAS-Eval: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Security Evaluation of LLM Agents in Real-World Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid deployment of Large language model (LLM) agents in critical domains like healthcare and finance necessitates robust security frameworks. To address the absence of standardized evaluation benchmarks for these agents in dynamic environments, we introduce RAS-Eval, a comprehensive security benchmark supporting both simulated and real-world tool execution. RAS-Eval comprises 80 test cases and 3,802 attack tasks mapped to 11 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories, with tools implemented in JSON, LangGraph, and Model Context Protocol (MCP) formats. We evaluate 6 state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse scenarios, revealing significant vulnerabilities: attacks reduced agent task completion rates (TCR) by 36.78% on average and achieved an 85.65% success rate in academic settings. Notably, scaling laws held for security capabilities, with larger models outperforming smaller counterparts. Our findings expose critical risks in real-world agent deployments and provide a foundational framework for future security research. Code and data are available at https://github.com/lanzer-tree/RAS-Eval.</description>

      <title>Detecting Hardware Trojans in Microprocessors via Hardware Error Correction Code-based Modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Software-exploitable Hardware Trojans (HTs) enable attackers to execute unauthorized software or gain illicit access to privileged operations. This manuscript introduces a hardware-based methodology for detecting runtime HT activations using Error Correction Codes (ECCs) on a RISC-V microprocessor. Specifically, it focuses on HTs that inject malicious instructions, disrupting the normal execution flow by triggering unauthorized programs. To counter this threat, the manuscript introduces a Hardware Security Checker (HSC) leveraging Hamming Single Error Correction (HSEC) architectures for effective HT detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves a 100% detection rate for potential HT activations, with no false positives or undetected attacks. The implementation incurs minimal overhead, requiring only 72 #LUTs, 24 #FFs, and 0.5 #BRAM while maintaining the microprocessor's original operating frequency and introducing no additional time delay.</description>

      <title>Side-Channel Extraction of Dataflow AI Accelerator Hardware Parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dataflow neural network accelerators efficiently process AI tasks on FPGAs, with deployment simplified by ready-to-use frameworks and pre-trained models. However, this convenience makes them vulnerable to malicious actors seeking to reverse engineer valuable Intellectual Property (IP) through Side-Channel Attacks (SCA). This paper proposes a methodology to recover the hardware configuration of dataflow accelerators generated with the FINN framework. Through unsupervised dimensionality reduction, we reduce the computational overhead compared to the state-of-the-art, enabling lightweight classifiers to recover both folding and quantization parameters. We demonstrate an attack phase requiring only 337 ms to recover the hardware parameters with an accuracy of more than 95% and 421 ms to fully recover these parameters with an averaging of 4 traces for a FINN-based accelerator running a CNN, both using a random forest classifier on side-channel traces, even with the accelerator dataflow fully loaded. This approach offers a more realistic attack scenario than existing methods, and compared to SoA attacks based on tsfresh, our method requires 940x and 110x less time for preparation and attack phases, respectively, and gives better results even without averaging traces.</description>

      <title>An efficient construction of Raz's two-source randomness extractor with improved parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Randomness extractors are algorithms that distill weak random sources into near-perfect random numbers. Two-source extractors enable this distillation process by combining two independent weak random sources. Raz's extractor (STOC '05) was the first to achieve this in a setting where one source has linear min-entropy (i.e., proportional to its length), while the other has only logarithmic min-entropy in its length. However, Raz's original construction is impractical due to a polynomial computation time of at least degree 4. Our work solves this problem by presenting an improved version of Raz's extractor with quasi-linear computation time, as well as a new analytic theorem with reduced entropy requirements. We provide comprehensive analytical and numerical comparisons of our construction with others in the literature, and we derive strong and quantum-proof versions of our efficient Raz extractor. Additionally, we offer an easy-to-use, open-source code implementation of the extractor and a numerical parameter calculation module.</description>

      <title>deepSURF: Detecting Memory Safety Vulnerabilities in Rust Through Fuzzing LLM-Augmented Harnesses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Although Rust ensures memory safety by default, it also permits the use of unsafe code, which can introduce memory safety vulnerabilities if misused. Unfortunately, existing tools for detecting memory bugs in Rust typically exhibit limited detection capabilities, inadequately handle Rust-specific types, or rely heavily on manual intervention.
  To address these limitations, we present deepSURF, a tool that integrates static analysis with Large Language Model (LLM)-guided fuzzing harness generation to effectively identify memory safety vulnerabilities in Rust libraries, specifically targeting unsafe code. deepSURF introduces a novel approach for handling generics by substituting them with custom types and generating tailored implementations for the required traits, enabling the fuzzer to simulate user-defined behaviors within the fuzzed library. Additionally, deepSURF employs LLMs to augment fuzzing harnesses dynamically, facilitating exploration of complex API interactions and significantly increasing the likelihood of exposing memory safety vulnerabilities. We evaluated deepSURF on 27 real-world Rust crates, successfully rediscovering 20 known memory safety bugs and uncovering 6 previously unknown vulnerabilities, demonstrating clear improvements over state-of-the-art tools.</description>

      <title>PhishDebate: An LLM-Based Multi-Agent Framework for Phishing Website Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phishing websites continue to pose a significant cybersecurity threat, often leveraging deceptive structures, brand impersonation, and social engineering tactics to evade detection. While recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled improved phishing detection through contextual understanding, most existing approaches rely on single-agent classification facing the risks of hallucination and lack interpretability or robustness. To address these limitations, we propose PhishDebate, a modular multi-agent LLM-based debate framework for phishing website detection. PhishDebate employs four specialized agents to independently analyze different textual aspects of a webpage--URL structure, HTML composition, semantic content, and brand impersonation--under the coordination of a Moderator and a final Judge. Through structured debate and divergent thinking, the framework delivers more accurate and interpretable decisions. Extensive evaluations on commercial LLMs demonstrate that PhishDebate achieves 98.2% recall and 98.2% True Positive Rate (TPR) on a real-world phishing dataset, and outperforms single-agent and Chain of Thought (CoT) baselines. Additionally, its modular design allows agent-level configurability, enabling adaptation to varying resource and application requirements.</description>

Abstract: Currently, digital security mechanisms like Anomaly Detection Systems using Autoencoders (AE) show great potential for bypassing problems intrinsic to the data, such as data imbalance. Because AE use a non-trivial and nonstandardized separation threshold to classify the extracted reconstruction error, the definition of this threshold directly impacts the performance of the detection process. Thus, this work proposes the automatic definition of this threshold using some machine learning algorithms. For this, three algorithms were evaluated: the K-Nearst Neighbors, the K-Means and the Support Vector Machine.</description>

      <title>A theory of Lending Protocols in DeFi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lending protocols are one of the main applications of Decentralized Finance (DeFi), enabling crypto-assets loan markets with a total value estimated in the tens of billions of dollars. Unlike traditional lending systems, these protocols operate without relying on trusted authorities or off-chain enforcement mechanisms. To achieve key economic goals such as stability of the loan market, they devise instead trustless on-chain mechanisms, such as rewarding liquidators who repay the loans of under-collateralized borrowers by awarding them part of the borrower's collateral. The complexity of these incentive mechanisms, combined with their entanglement in low-level implementation details, makes it challenging to precisely assess the structural and economic properties of lending protocols, as well as to analyze user strategies and attacks. Crucially, since participation is open to anyone, any weaknesses in the incentive mechanism may give rise to unintended emergent behaviours, or even enable adversarial strategies aimed at making profits to the detriment of legit users, or at undermining the stability of the protocol. In this work, we propose a formal model of lending protocols that captures the essential features of mainstream platforms, enabling us to identify and prove key properties related to their economic and strategic dynamics.</description>

      <title>One-shot Face Sketch Synthesis in the Wild via Generative Diffusion Prior and Instruction Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15312v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Face sketch synthesis is a technique aimed at converting face photos into sketches. Existing face sketch synthesis research mainly relies on training with numerous photo-sketch sample pairs from existing datasets. However, these large-scale discriminative learning methods will have to face problems such as data scarcity and high human labor costs. Once the training data becomes scarce, their generative performance significantly degrades. In this paper, we propose a one-shot face sketch synthesis method based on diffusion models. We optimize text instructions on a diffusion model using face photo-sketch image pairs. Then, the instructions derived through gradient-based optimization are used for inference. To simulate real-world scenarios more accurately and evaluate method effectiveness more comprehensively, we introduce a new benchmark named One-shot Face Sketch Dataset (OS-Sketch). The benchmark consists of 400 pairs of face photo-sketch images, including sketches with different styles and photos with different backgrounds, ages, sexes, expressions, illumination, etc. For a solid out-of-distribution evaluation, we select only one pair of images for training at each time, with the rest used for inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method can convert various photos into realistic and highly consistent sketches in a one-shot context. Compared to other methods, our approach offers greater convenience and broader applicability. The dataset will be available at: https://github.com/HanWu3125/OS-Sketch</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Offensive Robot Cybersecurity introduces a groundbreaking approach by advocating for offensive security methods empowered by means of automation. It emphasizes the necessity of understanding attackers' tactics and identifying vulnerabilities in advance to develop effective defenses, thereby improving robots' security posture. This thesis leverages a decade of robotics experience, employing Machine Learning and Game Theory to streamline the vulnerability identification and exploitation process. Intrinsically, the thesis uncovers a profound connection between robotic architecture and cybersecurity, highlighting that the design and creation aspect of robotics deeply intertwines with its protection against attacks. This duality -- whereby the architecture that shapes robot behavior and capabilities also necessitates a defense mechanism through offensive and defensive cybersecurity strategies -- creates a unique equilibrium. Approaching cybersecurity with a dual perspective of defense and attack, rooted in an understanding of systems architecture, has been pivotal. Through comprehensive analysis, including ethical considerations, the development of security tools, and executing cyber attacks on robot software, hardware, and industry deployments, this thesis proposes a novel architecture for cybersecurity cognitive engines. These engines, powered by advanced game theory and machine learning, pave the way for autonomous offensive cybersecurity strategies for robots, marking a significant shift towards self-defending robotic systems. This research not only underscores the importance of offensive measures in enhancing robot cybersecurity but also sets the stage for future advancements where robots are not just resilient to cyber threats but are equipped to autonomously safeguard themselves.</description>

      <title>Enhancing One-run Privacy Auditing with Quantile Regression-Based Membership Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15349v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Differential privacy (DP) auditing aims to provide empirical lower bounds on the privacy guarantees of DP mechanisms like DP-SGD. While some existing techniques require many training runs that are prohibitively costly, recent work introduces one-run auditing approaches that effectively audit DP-SGD in white-box settings while still being computationally efficient. However, in the more practical black-box setting where gradients cannot be manipulated during training and only the last model iterate is observed, prior work shows that there is still a large gap between the empirical lower bounds and theoretical upper bounds. Consequently, in this work, we study how incorporating approaches for stronger membership inference attacks (MIA) can improve one-run auditing in the black-box setting. Evaluating on image classification models trained on CIFAR-10 with DP-SGD, we demonstrate that our proposed approach, which utilizes quantile regression for MIA, achieves tighter bounds while crucially maintaining the computational efficiency of one-run methods.</description>

Abstract: We study privacy leakage in the reasoning traces of large reasoning models used as personal agents. Unlike final outputs, reasoning traces are often assumed to be internal and safe. We challenge this assumption by showing that reasoning traces frequently contain sensitive user data, which can be extracted via prompt injections or accidentally leak into outputs. Through probing and agentic evaluations, we demonstrate that test-time compute approaches, particularly increased reasoning steps, amplify such leakage. While increasing the budget of those test-time compute approaches makes models more cautious in their final answers, it also leads them to reason more verbosely and leak more in their own thinking. This reveals a core tension: reasoning improves utility but enlarges the privacy attack surface. We argue that safety efforts must extend to the model's internal thinking, not just its outputs.</description>

      <title>A Novel Perturb-ability Score to Mitigate Evasion Adversarial Attacks on Flow-Based ML-NIDS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07448</link>

Abstract: As network security threats evolve, safeguarding flow-based Machine Learning (ML)-based Network Intrusion Detection Systems (NIDS) from evasion adversarial attacks is crucial. This paper introduces the notion of feature perturb-ability and presents a novel Perturb-ability Score (PS), which quantifies how susceptible NIDS features are to manipulation in the problem-space by an attacker. PS thereby identifies features structurally resistant to evasion attacks in flow-based ML-NIDS due to the semantics of network traffic fields, as these features are constrained by domain-specific limitations and correlations. Consequently, attempts to manipulate such features would likely either compromise the attack's malicious functionality, render the traffic invalid for processing, or potentially both outcomes simultaneously.
  We introduce and demonstrate the effectiveness of our PS-enabled defenses, PS-guided feature selection and PS-guided feature masking, in enhancing flow-based NIDS resilience. Experimental results across various ML-based NIDS models and public datasets show that discarding or masking highly manipulatable features (high-PS features) can maintain solid detection performance while significantly reducing vulnerability to evasion adversarial attacks. Our findings confirm that PS effectively identifies flow-based NIDS features susceptible to problem-space perturbations. This novel approach leverages problem-space NIDS domain constraints as lightweight universal defense mechanisms against evasion adversarial attacks targeting flow-based ML-NIDS.</description>

      <title>Assessing Privacy Compliance of Android Third-Party SDKs</title>

Abstract: Third-party Software Development Kits (SDKs) are widely adopted in Android app development, to effortlessly accelerate development pipelines and enhance app functionality. However, this convenience raises substantial concerns about unauthorized access to users' privacy-sensitive information, which could be further abused for illegitimate purposes like user tracking or monetization. Our study offers a targeted analysis of user privacy protection among Android third-party SDKs, filling a critical gap in the Android software supply chain. It focuses on two aspects of their privacy practices, including data exfiltration and behavior-policy compliance (or privacy compliance), utilizing techniques of taint analysis and large language models. It covers 158 widely-used SDKs from two key SDK release platforms, the official one and a large alternative one. From them, we identified 338 instances of privacy data exfiltration. On the privacy compliance, our study reveals that more than 30% of the examined SDKs fail to provide a privacy policy to disclose their data handling practices. Among those that provide privacy policies, 37% of them over-collect user data, and 88% falsely claim access to sensitive data. We revisit the latest versions of the SDKs after 12 months. Our analysis demonstrates a persistent lack of improvement in these concerning trends. Based on our findings, we propose three actionable recommendations to mitigate the privacy leakage risks and enhance privacy protection for Android users. Our research not only serves as an urgent call for industry attention but also provides crucial insights for future regulatory interventions.</description>

      <title>Blockchain-Enabled Variational Information Bottleneck for Data Extraction Based on Mutual Information in Internet of Vehicles</title>

Abstract: The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) network can address the issue of limited computing resources and data processing capabilities of individual vehicles, but it also brings the risk of privacy leakage to vehicle users. Applying blockchain technology can establish secure data links within the IoV, solving the problems of insufficient computing resources for each vehicle and the security of data transmission over the network. However, with the development of the IoV, the amount of data interaction between multiple vehicles and between vehicles and base stations, roadside units, etc., is continuously increasing. There is a need to further reduce the interaction volume, and intelligent data compression is key to solving this problem. The VIB technique facilitates the training of encoding and decoding models, substantially diminishing the volume of data that needs to be transmitted. This paper introduces an innovative approach that integrates blockchain with VIB, referred to as BVIB, designed to lighten computational workloads and reinforce the security of the network. We first construct a new network framework by separating the encoding and decoding networks to address the computational burden issue, and then propose a new algorithm to enhance the security of IoV networks. We also discuss the impact of the data extraction rate on system latency to determine the most suitable data extraction rate. An experimental framework combining Python and C++ has been established to substantiate the efficacy of our BVIB approach. Comprehensive simulation studies indicate that the BVIB consistently excels in comparison to alternative foundational methodologies.</description>

      <title>FLARE: Towards Universal Dataset Purification against Backdoor Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.19479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deep neural networks (DNNs) are susceptible to backdoor attacks, where adversaries poison datasets with adversary-specified triggers to implant hidden backdoors, enabling malicious manipulation of model predictions. Dataset purification serves as a proactive defense by removing malicious training samples to prevent backdoor injection at its source. We first reveal that the current advanced purification methods rely on a latent assumption that the backdoor connections between triggers and target labels in backdoor attacks are simpler to learn than the benign features. We demonstrate that this assumption, however, does not always hold, especially in all-to-all (A2A) and untargeted (UT) attacks. As a result, purification methods that analyze the separation between the poisoned and benign samples in the input-output space or the final hidden layer space are less effective. We observe that this separability is not confined to a single layer but varies across different hidden layers. Motivated by this understanding, we propose FLARE, a universal purification method to counter various backdoor attacks. FLARE aggregates abnormal activations from all hidden layers to construct representations for clustering. To enhance separation, FLARE develops an adaptive subspace selection algorithm to isolate the optimal space for dividing an entire dataset into two clusters. FLARE assesses the stability of each cluster and identifies the cluster with higher stability as poisoned. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of FLARE against 22 representative backdoor attacks, including all-to-one (A2O), all-to-all (A2A), and untargeted (UT) attacks, and its robustness to adaptive attacks. Codes are available at \href{https://github.com/THUYimingLi/BackdoorBox}{BackdoorBox} and \href{https://github.com/vtu81/backdoor-toolbox}{backdoor-toolbox}.</description>

      <title>Adversarially Robust Bloom Filters: Privacy, Reductions, and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15751v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Bloom filter is a space-efficient probabilistic data structure that represents a set $S$ of elements from a larger universe $U$. This efficiency comes with a trade-off, namely, it allows for a small chance of false positives. When you query the Bloom filter about an element x, the filter will respond 'Yes' if $x \in S$. If $x \notin S$, it may still respond 'Yes' with probability at most $\varepsilon$. We investigate the adversarial robustness and privacy of Bloom filters, addressing open problems across three prominent frameworks: the game-based model of Naor-Oved-Yogev (NOY), the simulator-based model of Filic et. al., and learning-augmented variants. We prove the first formal connection between the Filic and NOY models, showing that Filic correctness implies AB-test resilience. We resolve a longstanding open question by proving that PRF-backed Bloom filters fail the NOY model's stronger BP-test. Finally, we introduce the first private Bloom filters with differential privacy guarantees, including constructions applicable to learned Bloom filters. Our taxonomy organizes the space of robustness and privacy guarantees, clarifying relationships between models and constructions.</description>

      <title>Cross-Chain Arbitrage: The Next Frontier of MEV in Decentralized Finance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Decentralized finance (DeFi) markets spread across Layer-1 (L1) and Layer-2 (L2) blockchains rely on arbitrage to keep prices aligned. Today most price gaps are closed against centralized exchanges (CEXes), whose deep liquidity and fast execution make them the primary venue for price discovery. As trading volume migrates on-chain, cross-chain arbitrage between decentralized exchanges (DEXes) will become the canonical mechanism for price alignment. Yet, despite its importance to DeFi-and the on-chain transparency making real activity tractable in a way CEX-to-DEX arbitrage is not-existing research remains confined to conceptual overviews and hypothetical opportunity analyses.
  We study cross-chain arbitrage with a profit-cost model and a year-long measurement. The model shows that opportunity frequency, bridging time, and token depreciation determine whether inventory- or bridge-based execution is more profitable. Empirically, we analyze one year of transactions (September 2023 - August 2024) across nine blockchains and identify 242,535 executed arbitrages totaling 868.64 million USD volume. Activity clusters on Ethereum-centric L1-L2 pairs, grows 5.5x over the study period, and surges-higher volume, more trades, lower fees-after the Dencun upgrade (March 13, 2024). Most trades use pre-positioned inventory (66.96%) and settle in 9s, whereas bridge-based arbitrages take 242s, underscoring the latency cost of today's bridges. Market concentration is high: the five largest addresses execute more than half of all trades, and one alone captures almost 40% of daily volume post-Dencun. We conclude that cross-chain arbitrage fosters vertical integration, centralizing sequencing infrastructure and economic power and thereby exacerbating censorship, liveness, and finality risks; decentralizing block building and lowering entry barriers are critical to countering these threats.</description>

      <title>VeriLeaky: Navigating IP Protection vs Utility in Fine-Tuning for LLM-Driven Verilog Coding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.13116v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for coding, yet fine-tuning (FT) with curated data is essential for niche languages like Verilog. Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference. This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection?
  For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma. Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs. To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP. We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat. As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance. Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</description>

      <title>Version-level Third-Party Library Detection in Android Applications via Class Structural Similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Android applications (apps) integrate reusable and well-tested third-party libraries (TPLs) to enhance functionality and shorten development cycles. However, recent research reveals that TPLs have become the largest attack surface for Android apps, where the use of insecure TPLs can compromise both developer and user interests. To mitigate such threats, researchers have proposed various tools to detect TPLs used by apps, supporting further security analyses such as vulnerable TPLs identification. Although existing tools achieve notable library-level TPL detection performance in the presence of obfuscation, they struggle with version-level TPL detection due to a lack of sensitivity to differences between versions. This limitation results in a high version-level false positive rate, significantly increasing the manual workload for security analysts. To resolve this issue, we propose SAD, a TPL detection tool with high version-level detection performance. SAD generates a candidate app class list for each TPL class based on the feature of nodes in class dependency graphs (CDGs). It then identifies the unique corresponding app class for each TPL class by performing class matching based on the similarity of their class summaries. Finally, SAD identifies TPL versions by evaluating the structural similarity of the sub-graph formed by matched classes within the CDGs of the TPL and the app. Extensive evaluation on three datasets demonstrates the effectiveness of SAD and its components. SAD achieves F1 scores of 97.64% and 84.82% for library-level and version-level detection on obfuscated apps, respectively, surpassing existing state-of-the-art tools. The version-level false positives reported by the best tool is 1.61 times that of SAD. We further evaluate the degree to which TPLs identified by detection tools correspond to actual TPL classes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.01518v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing density of modern DRAM has heightened its vulnerability to Rowhammer attacks, which induce bit flips by repeatedly accessing specific memory rows. This paper presents an analysis of bit flip patterns generated by advanced Rowhammer techniques that bypass existing hardware defenses. First, we investigate the phenomenon of adjacent bit flips where two or more physically neighboring bits are corrupted simultaneously and demonstrate they occur with significantly higher frequency than previously documented. We also show that if multiple bits flip within a byte, we can probabilistically model the likelihood of flipped bits appearing adjacently. We also demonstrate that bit flips within a row will naturally cluster together likely due to the underlying physics of the attack. We then investigate two fault injection attacks enabled by multiple adjacent or nearby bit flips. First, we show how these correlated flips enable efficient cryptographic signature correction attacks, demonstrating how such flips could enable ECDSA private key recovery from OpenSSL implementations where single-bit approaches would be unfeasible. Second, we introduce a targeted attack against large language models by exploiting Rowhammer-induced corruptions in tokenizer dictionaries of GGUF model files. This attack effectively rewrites safety instructions in system prompts by swapping safety-critical tokens with benign alternatives, circumventing model guardrails while maintaining normal functionality in other contexts. Our experimental results across multiple DRAM configurations reveal that current memory protection schemes are inadequate against these sophisticated attack vectors, which can achieve their objectives with precise, minimal modifications rather than random corruption.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.03409v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Frontier AI models pose increasing risks to public safety and international security, creating a pressing need for AI developers to provide credible guarantees about their development activities without compromising proprietary information. We propose Flexible Hardware-Enabled Guarantees (flexHEG), a system integrated with AI accelerator hardware to enable verifiable claims about compute usage in AI development. The flexHEG system consists of two primary components: an auditable Guarantee Processor that monitors accelerator usage and verifies compliance with specified rules, and a Secure Enclosure that provides physical tamper protection. In this second report of a three part series, we analyze technical implementation options ranging from firmware modifications to custom hardware approaches, with focus on an "Interlock" design that provides the Guarantee Processor direct access to accelerator data paths. Our proposed architecture could support various guarantee types, from basic usage auditing to sophisticated automated verification. This work establishes technical foundations for hardware-based AI governance mechanisms that could address emerging regulatory and international security needs in frontier AI development.</description>

Abstract: The Bhatt Conjectures framework introduces rigorous, hierarchical benchmarks for evaluating AI reasoning and understanding, moving beyond pattern matching to assess representation invariance, robustness, and metacognitive self-awareness. The agentreasoning-sdk demonstrates practical implementation, revealing that current AI models struggle with complex reasoning tasks and highlighting the need for advanced evaluation protocols to distinguish genuine cognitive abilities from statistical inference. This comprehensive AI evaluation methodology establishes necessary-but-not-sufficient benchmark conditions for advancing artificial general intelligence research while maintaining academic search engine optimization standards through strategic keyword density optimization, technical terminology consistency, and cross-modal evaluation protocols.

      <title>Supervised Robustness-preserving Data-free Neural Network Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When deploying pre-trained neural network models in real-world applications, model consumers often encounter resource-constraint platforms such as mobile and smart devices. They typically use the pruning technique to reduce the size and complexity of the model, generating a lighter one with less resource consumption. Nonetheless, most existing pruning methods are proposed with the premise that the model after being pruned has a chance to be fine-tuned or even retrained based on the original training data. This may be unrealistic in practice, as the data controllers are often reluctant to provide their model consumers with the original data. In this work, we study the neural network pruning in the data-free context, aiming to yield lightweight models that are not only accurate in prediction but also robust against undesired inputs in open-world deployments. Considering the absence of the fine-tuning and retraining that can fix the mis-pruned units, we replace the traditional aggressive one-shot strategy with a conservative one that treats the pruning as a progressive process. We propose a pruning method based on stochastic optimization that uses robustness-related metrics to guide the pruning process. Our method is implemented as a Python program and evaluated with a series of experiments on diverse neural network models. The experimental results show that it significantly outperforms existing one-shot data-free pruning approaches in terms of robustness preservation and accuracy.</description>

      <title>On the Equivalence between Classical Position Verification and Certified Randomness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03982v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gate-based quantum computers hold enormous potential to accelerate classically intractable computational tasks. Random circuit sampling (RCS) is the only known task that has been able to be experimentally demonstrated using current-day NISQ devices. However, for a long time, it remained challenging to demonstrate the quantum utility of RCS on practical problems. Recently, leveraging RCS, an interactive protocol generating certified randomness was demonstrated using a trapped ion quantum computer, advancing the practical utility of near-term gate-based quantum computers. In this work, we establish a strong connection between certified randomness and another quantum computation classical communication primitive, classically verifiable position verification (CVPV), which circumvents the practical challenges that may arise from long-distance quantum communications. We provide a new generic compiler that can convert any single-round proof of quantumness based certified randomness protocol into a secure classical communication-based position verification scheme. Later, we extend our compiler to different types of multi-round protocols. Notably, our compiler can be applied to any multi-round certified randomness protocol that can be analyzed using the entropy accumulation theorem, making its applicability very general. Moreover, we show that CVPV is equivalent to a relaxed variant of certified randomness that we define. We instantiate each of our compilers using existing certified randomness protocols. In particular, building on the work of Aaronson and Hung (STOC '23), we give a NISQ-friendly instantiation based on RCS, which was experimentally demonstrated by Liu et al.. Hence, we show that CVPV is another application within reach of NISQ devices.</description>

      <title>Root Defence Strategies: Ensuring Safety of LLM at the Decoding Level</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06809v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated immense utility across various industries. However, as LLMs advance, the risk of harmful outputs increases due to incorrect or malicious instruction prompts. While current methods effectively address jailbreak risks, they share common limitations: 1) Judging harmful responses from the prefill-level lacks utilization of the model's decoding outputs, leading to relatively lower effectiveness and robustness. 2) Rejecting potentially harmful responses based on a single evaluation can significantly impair the model's helpfulness.This paper examines the LLMs' capability to recognize harmful outputs, revealing and quantifying their proficiency in assessing the danger of previous tokens. Motivated by pilot experiment results, we design a robust defense mechanism at the decoding level. Our novel decoder-oriented, step-by-step defense architecture corrects harmful queries directly rather than rejecting them outright. We introduce speculative decoding to enhance usability and facilitate deployment to boost secure decoding speed. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves model security without compromising reasoning speed. Notably, our method leverages the model's ability to discern hazardous information, maintaining its helpfulness compared to existing methods.</description>

      <title>Wolfpack Adversarial Attack for Robust Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.02844v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional robust methods in multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) often struggle against coordinated adversarial attacks in cooperative scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose the Wolfpack Adversarial Attack framework, inspired by wolf hunting strategies, which targets an initial agent and its assisting agents to disrupt cooperation. Additionally, we introduce the Wolfpack-Adversarial Learning for MARL (WALL) framework, which trains robust MARL policies to defend against the proposed Wolfpack attack by fostering systemwide collaboration. Experimental results underscore the devastating impact of the Wolfpack attack and the significant robustness improvements achieved by WALL. Our code is available at https://github.com/sunwoolee0504/WALL.</description>

      <title>Improved Regret in Stochastic Decision-Theoretic Online Learning under Differential Privacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.10997v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hu and Mehta (2024) posed an open problem: what is the optimal instance-dependent rate for the stochastic decision-theoretic online learning (with $K$ actions and $T$ rounds) under $\varepsilon$-differential privacy? Before, the best known upper bound and lower bound are $O\left(\frac{\log K}{\Delta_{\min}} + \frac{\log K\log T}{\varepsilon}\right)$ and $\Omega\left(\frac{\log K}{\Delta_{\min}} + \frac{\log K}{\varepsilon}\right)$ (where $\Delta_{\min}$ is the gap between the optimal and the second actions). In this paper, we partially address this open problem by having two new results. First, we provide an improved upper bound for this problem $O\left(\frac{\log K}{\Delta_{\min}} + \frac{\log^2K}{\varepsilon}\right)$, which is $T$-independent and only has a log dependency in $K$. Second, to further understand the gap, we introduce the \textit{deterministic setting}, a weaker setting of this open problem, where the received loss vector is deterministic. At this weaker setting, a direct application of the analysis and algorithms from the original setting still leads to an extra log factor. We conduct a novel analysis which proves upper and lower bounds that match at $\Theta(\frac{\log K}{\varepsilon})$.</description>

      <title>Think Twice before Adaptation: Improving Adaptability of DeepFake Detection via Online Test-Time Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18787v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Deepfake (DF) detectors face significant challenges when deployed in real-world environments, particularly when encountering test samples deviated from training data through either postprocessing manipulations or distribution shifts. We demonstrate postprocessing techniques can completely obscure generation artifacts presented in DF samples, leading to performance degradation of DF detectors. To address these challenges, we propose Think Twice before Adaptation (\texttt{T$^2$A}), a novel online test-time adaptation method that enhances the adaptability of detectors during inference without requiring access to source training data or labels. Our key idea is to enable the model to explore alternative options through an Uncertainty-aware Negative Learning objective rather than solely relying on its initial predictions as commonly seen in entropy minimization (EM)-based approaches. We also introduce an Uncertain Sample Prioritization strategy and Gradients Masking technique to improve the adaptation by focusing on important samples and model parameters. Our theoretical analysis demonstrates that the proposed negative learning objective exhibits complementary behavior to EM, facilitating better adaptation capability. Empirically, our method achieves state-of-the-art results compared to existing test-time adaptation (TTA) approaches and significantly enhances the resilience and generalization of DF detectors during inference.

      <title>Graph Neural Networks for Jamming Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph-based learning provides a powerful framework for modeling complex relational structures; however, its application within the domain of wireless security remains significantly underexplored. In this work, we introduce the first application of graph-based learning for jamming source localization, addressing the imminent threat of jamming attacks in wireless networks. Unlike geometric optimization techniques that struggle under environmental uncertainties and dense interference, we reformulate the localization as an inductive graph regression task. Our approach integrates structured node representations that encode local and global signal aggregation, ensuring spatial coherence and adaptive signal fusion. To enhance robustness, we incorporate an attention-based \ac{GNN} that adaptively refines neighborhood influence and introduces a confidence-guided estimation mechanism that dynamically balances learned predictions with domain-informed priors. We evaluate our approach under complex \ac{RF} environments with various sampling densities, network topologies, jammer characteristics, and signal propagation conditions, conducting comprehensive ablation studies on graph construction, feature selection, and pooling strategies. Results demonstrate that our novel graph-based learning framework significantly outperforms established localization baselines, particularly in challenging scenarios with sparse and obfuscated signal information.

      <title>Tech-ASan: Two-stage check for Address Sanitizer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05022v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Address Sanitizer (ASan) is a sharp weapon for detecting memory safety violations, including temporal and spatial errors hidden in C/C++ programs during execution. However, ASan incurs significant runtime overhead, which limits its efficiency in testing large software. The overhead mainly comes from sanitizer checks due to the frequent and expensive shadow memory access. Over the past decade, many methods have been developed to speed up ASan by eliminating and accelerating sanitizer checks, however, they either fail to adequately eliminate redundant checks or compromise detection capabilities. To address this issue, this paper presents Tech-ASan, a two-stage check based technique to accelerate ASan with safety assurance. First, we propose a novel two-stage check algorithm for ASan, which leverages magic value comparison to reduce most of the costly shadow memory accesses. Second, we design an efficient optimizer to eliminate redundant checks, which integrates a novel algorithm for removing checks in loops. Third, we implement Tech-ASan as a memory safety tool based on the LLVM compiler infrastructure. Our evaluation using the SPEC CPU2006 benchmark shows that Tech-ASan outperforms the state-of-the-art methods with 33.70% and 17.89% less runtime overhead than ASan and ASan--, respectively. Moreover, Tech-ASan detects 56 fewer false negative cases than ASan and ASan-- when testing on the Juliet Test Suite under the same redzone setting.</description>

      <title>Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA: A Bi-Phase Adversarial CAPTCHA Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10685</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10685v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the rapid advancements in deep learning, traditional CAPTCHA schemes are increasingly vulnerable to automated attacks powered by deep neural networks (DNNs). Existing adversarial attack methods often rely on original image characteristics, resulting in distortions that hinder human interpretation and limit applicability in scenarios lacking initial input images. To address these challenges, we propose the Unsourced Adversarial CAPTCHA (UAC), a novel framework generating high-fidelity adversarial examples guided by attacker-specified text prompts. Leveraging a Large Language Model (LLM), UAC enhances CAPTCHA diversity and supports both targeted and untargeted attacks. For targeted attacks, the EDICT method optimizes dual latent variables in a diffusion model for superior image quality. In untargeted attacks, especially for black-box scenarios, we introduce bi-path unsourced adversarial CAPTCHA (BP-UAC), a two-step optimization strategy employing multimodal gradients and bi-path optimization for efficient misclassification. Experiments show BP-UAC achieves high attack success rates across diverse systems, generating natural CAPTCHAs indistinguishable to humans and DNNs.</description>
