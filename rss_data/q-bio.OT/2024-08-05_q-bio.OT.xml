      <title>Prelude to a Compositional Systems Biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Composition is a powerful principle for systems biology, focused on the interfaces, interconnections, and orchestration of distributed processes. Whereas most systems biology models focus on the structure or dynamics of specific subsystems in controlled conditions, compositional systems biology aims to connect such models into integrative multiscale simulations. This emphasizes the space between models--a compositional perspective asks what variables should be exposed through a submodel's interface? How do coupled models connect and translate across scales? How can we connect domain-specific models across biological and physical research areas to drive the synthesis of new knowledge? What is required of software that integrates diverse datasets and submodels into unified multiscale simulations? How can the resulting integrative models be accessed, flexibly recombined into new forms, and iteratively refined by a community of researchers? This essay offers a high-level overview of the key components for compositional systems biology, including: 1) a conceptual framework and corresponding graphical framework to represent interfaces, composition patterns, and orchestration patterns; 2) standardized composition schemas that offer consistent formats for composable data types and models, fostering robust infrastructure for a registry of simulation modules that can be flexibly assembled; 3) a foundational set of biological templates--schemas for cellular and molecular interfaces, which can be filled with detailed submodels and datasets, and are designed to integrate knowledge that sheds light on the molecular emergence of cells; and 4) scientific collaboration facilitated by user-friendly interfaces for connecting researchers with datasets and models, and which allows a community of researchers to effectively build integrative multiscale models of cellular systems.</description>

      <title>A modular open-source software platform for BCI research with application in closed-loop deep brain stimulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01242v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces Dareplane, a modular and broad technology agnostic open source software platform for brain-computer interface research with an application focus on adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS). While the search for suitable biomarkers to inform aDBS has provided rich results over the last two decades, development of control strategies is not progressing at the same pace. One difficulty for investigating control approaches resides with the complex setups required for aDBS experiments. The Dareplane platform supports aDBS setups, and more generally brain computer interfaces, by providing a modular, technology-agnostic, and easy-to-implement software platform to make experimental setups more resilient and replicable. The key features of the platform are presented and the composition of modules into a full experimental setup is discussed in the context of a Python-based orchestration module. The performance of a typical experimental setup on Dareplane for aDBS is evaluated in three benchtop experiments, covering (a) an easy-to-replicate setup using an Arduino microcontroller, (b) a setup with hardware of an implantable pulse generator, and (c) a setup using an established and CE certified external neurostimulator. Benchmark results are presented for individual processing steps and full closed-loop processing. The results show that the microcontroller setup in (a) provides timing comparable to the realistic setups in (b) and (c). The Dareplane platform was successfully used in a total of 19 open-loop DBS sessions with externalized DBS and electrocorticography (ECoG) leads. In addition, the full technical feasibility of the platform in the aDBS context is demonstrated in a first closed-loop session with externalized leads on a patient with Parkinson's disease receiving DBS treatment.</description>
