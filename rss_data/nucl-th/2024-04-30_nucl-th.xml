      <title>Contribution to differential $\pi^0$ and $\gamma_\mathrm{dir}$ modification in small systems from color fluctuation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A major complication in the search for jet quenching in proton- or deuteron-nucleus collision systems is the presence of physical effects which influence the experimental determination of collision centrality in the presence of a hard process. For example, in the proton color fluctuation picture, protons with a large Bjorken-$x$ ($x \gtrsim 0.1$) parton interact more weakly with the nucleons in the nucleus, leading to a smaller (larger) than expected yield in large (small) activity events. A recent measurement by PHENIX compared the yield of neutral pion and direct photon production in $d$+Au collisions, under the argument that the photon yields correct for such biases, and the difference between the two species is thus attributable to final-state effects (i.e., jet quenching). The main finding suggests a significant degree of jet quenching for hard processes in small systems. In this paper, I argue that the particular photon and pion events selected by PHENIX arise from proton configurations with significantly different Bjorken-$x$ distributions, and thus are subject to different magnitudes of modification in the color fluctuation model. Using the results of a previous global analysis of RHIC and LHC data, I show that potentially all of the pion-to-photon difference in PHENIX data can be described by a proton color fluctuation picture at a quantitative level before any additional physics from final-state effects is required. This finding reconciles the interpretation of the PHENIX measurement with others at RHIC and LHC, which have found no observable evidence for jet quenching in small systems.</description>

      <title>Fission Fragment Yields Of $^{235}$U$(n_{th},f)$ Evaluated By The CCONE Code System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17728v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Fission fragment yield evaluations are one of the important nuclear data studies. Fission accompanies various physical observables such as prompt fission neutron, prompt fission gamma, and delayed-neutrons. When evaluating fission fragment yields, a study including correlations among those observables is essentially required. However, fission fragment yield data in the past JENDL libraries have been made by focusing only on experimental fragment yields, decay heats, and delayed neutron yields, and they have not been expanded into a wider range of fission observables. This is because the evaluation method adopted in the JENDL libraries could not study fission fragment yields and particle emissions from fragments simultaneously. To solve this problem, a calculation system with CCONE code is newly developed to estimate not only independent and cumulative fission fragment yields but also prompt fission neutron, prompt fission gamma, decay heats, and delayed-neutrons simultaneously. This system enables us to study a correlation between various fission observables. To determine lots of parameters in this system efficiently, a Gaussian process and a least square fitting are adopted. We tested the calculation system through a thermal neutron-induced fission on $^{235}$U. In this paper, we demonstrate the performance of the parameter search method and show that experimental fission fragment yield data and other observables resulting from fission are reproduced well by the new calculation system.</description>

      <title>Prolate-oblate shape transitions and O(6) symmetry in even-even nuclei: A theoretical overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prolate to oblate shape transitions have been predicted in an analytic way in the framework of the Interacting Boson Model (IBM), determining O(6) as the symmetry at the critical point. Parameter-independent predictions for prolate to oblate transitions in various regions on the nuclear chart have been made in the framework of the proxy-SU(3) and pseudo-SU(3) symmetries, corroborated by recent non-relativistic and relativistic mean field calculations along series of nuclear isotopes, with parameters fixed throughout, as well as by shell model calculations taking advantage of the quasi-SU(3) symmetry. Experimental evidence for regions of prolate to oblate shape transitions is in agreement with regions in which nuclei bearing the O(6) dynamical symmetry of the IBM have been identified, lying below major shell closures. In addition, gradual oblate to prolate transitions are seen when crossing major nuclear shell closures, in analogy to experimental observations in alkali clusters.</description>

      <title>Three-body analysis reveals the significant contribution of minor $^{5}$He $s$-wave component in $^{6}$Li$(p,2p)^{5}$He cross section</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: $^6$Li is usually treated as an $\alpha+p+n$ three-body system, and the validity of this picture is important for understanding $^6$Li reactions. The ($p$,$2p$) reaction is a powerful method to study the structure of valence nucleons in $^6$Li. Recently, the new experimental data of the $^{6}$Li($p$,$2p$)$^{5}$He reaction have been obtained and should be analyzed. We investigate the $^{6}$Li($p$,$2p$)$^{5}$He reaction using the $\alpha+p+n$ three-body wave function of $^6$Li and study the validity of this model. The $^6$Li wave function is used to obtain the relative wave function between $p$ and $^5$He. We combine the relative wave function with the distorted wave impulse approximation. Our results reproduce the experimental data of the triple differential cross section within about 10\% difference in the absolute values, and contributions from both $p$- and $s$-wave states of $^5$He in $^6$Li are found to be important. We can qualitatively understand the $^{6}$Li($p$,$2p$)$^{5}$He reaction by describing $^6$Li with the three-body model. Contribution from the $s$-wave component is important in reproducing the experimental data in the zero recoil-momentum region.</description>

      <title>Exploring system size dependence of jet modification in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18115v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, jet quenching in quark-gluon plasma (QGP) has been extensively studied, revealing important insights into the properties of the color deconfined nuclear matter. Over the past decade, there has been a surge of interest in the exploration of QGP droplets in small collision systems like $p$+$p$ or $p$+A collisions driven by the observation of collective flow phenomena. However, the absence of jet quenching, a key QGP signature, in these systems poses a puzzle. Understanding how jet quenching evolves with system size is crucial for uncovering the underlying physics. In this study, we employ the linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to investigate jet modification in $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru, $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr, and $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$ GeV. Our findings highlight the system size sensitivity exhibited by jet nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) and jet shape ($\rho$), contrasting to the relatively weak responses of jet mass ($M$), girth ($g$) and momentum dispersion ($p_\mathrm{T}{D}$) to system size variations. These results offer invaluable insights into the system size dependence of the QGP properties and to be validated experimentally at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>Implication of odd-even staggering in the charge radii of calcium isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18545v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the evidently observed odd-even staggering and the inverted parabolic-like shape of charge radii along calcium isotopic chain, the ground state properties of calcium isotopes are investigated by constraining the root-mean-square (rms) charge radii under the covariant energy density functionals with effective forces NL3 and PK1. In this work, the pairing correlations are tackled by solving the state-dependent Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer equations. The calculated results suggest that the binding energies obtained by constraint method have been reduced less than $0.1\%$. But for charge radii, the corresponding results deriving from NL3 and PK1 forces have been increased by about $1.0\%$ and $2.0\%$, respectively. This means that charge radius is a more sensitive quantity in the calibrated protocol. Meanwhile, it is found that the reproduced charge radii of calcium isotopes is attributed to the rather strong isospin dependence of effective potential. The odd-even oscillation behavior can also be presented in the neutron skin thickness and proton Fermi energy along calcium isotopic chain, but keep opposite trends with respect to the corresponding binding energy and charge radius. As encountered in charge radii, the weakening odd-even oscillation behavior is still emerged from the proton Fermi energies at the neutron numbers $N=20$ and $28$ as well, but not in binding energy and neutron skin thickness.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the development of collective flow in high energy proton proton collisions with a multiphase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the collective flow development in high energy proton proton (pp) collisions with a multiphase transport model (AMPT) based on PYTHIA8 initial conditions with a sub-nucleon structure. It is found that the PYTHIA8 based AMPT model can reasonably describe both the charged hadron productions and elliptic flow experimental data measured in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. By turning on the parton and hadron rescatterings in AMPT separately, we find that the observed collective flow in pp collisions is largely developed during the parton evolutions, while no significant flow effect can be generated with the pure hadronic rescatterings. It is also shown that the parton escape mechanism is important for describing both the magnitude of the two-particle cumulant and the sign of the four-particle cumulants. We emphasize that the strong mass ordering of the elliptic flow results from the coalescence process in the transport model can thus be regarded as unique evidence related to the creation of deconfined parton matter in high energy pp collisions.</description>

      <title>A three-parameter characterization of neutron stars' mass-radius relation and equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17647</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous models of neutron star (NS) equation of state (EoS) exist based on different superdense-matter physics approaches. Nevertheless, some NS properties show universal (EoS-independent) relations. Here, we propose a novel class of such universalities. Despite different physics inputs, a wide class of realistic nucleonic, hyperonic, and hybrid EoS models can be accurately described using only three parameters. For a given EoS, these are the mass and radius of the maximum-mass NS (or pressure and density in its center) and the radius of a half-maximum-mass star. With such a parametrization, we build universal analytic expressions for mass-radius and pressure-density relations. They form a semi-analytic mapping from the mass-radius relation to the EoS in NS cores (the so-called inverse Oppenheimer-Volkoff mapping). This mapping simplifies the process of inferring the EoS from observations of NS masses and radii. Applying it to current NS observations we set new limits on the high end of the EoS.</description>

      <title>The properties of $\phi(2170)$ and its three-body nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We summarize the results we obtained for the partial decay widths of $\phi(2170)$ into two-body final states formed by a $\bar K$ and a Kaonic resonance, like $K(1460)$, $K_1(1270)$, as well as to final states constituted by a $\phi$ and an $\eta/\eta^\prime$ mesons. The results obtained are compared with the values extracted from experimental data on the corresponding branching ratios, which were determined by the BESIII collaboration. A reasonable agreement is found, which together with the previous reproduction of the mass, width, and cross section for the process $e^+ e^-\to \phi f_0$ strongly indicates the molecular nature of $\phi(2170)$ as a $\phi K\bar K$ system.</description>

      <title>Detailed derivation of the $\mathbf{^3P_0}$ strong decay model applied to baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide an in-detail derivation through the $^3P_0$ pair creation model of the transition matrix for a baryon decaying into a meson-baryon system. The meson's analysis was conducted in Ref. [1] and we extend the same formalism to the baryon sector, focusing on the $\Delta(1232)\to \pi N$ strong decay width because all hadrons involved in the reaction are very well established, the two hadrons in the final state are stable, avoiding further analysis, all quarks are light and so equivalent, and the decay width of the process is relatively well measured. Taking advantage of a Gaussian expansion method for the hadron's radial wave functions, the expression of the invariant matrix element can be related with the mean-square radii of hadrons involved in the decay. We use their experimental measures in such a way that only the strength of the quark-antiquark pair creation from the vacuum is a free parameter. This is then taken from our previous study of strong decay widths in the meson sector, obtaining a quite compatible result with experiment for the calculated $\Delta(1232)\to \pi N$ decay width.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy can tell whether $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_{cs}(3985)$ are resonances or virtual states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There have been extended and heated discussions on the nature of the two exotic states, $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_{cs}(3985)$, particularly whether they are resonances or virtual states. We demonstrate for the first time that the femtoscopic technique can be used to unambiguously distinguish between such two scenarios. More concretely, we show that the $D^0D^{*-}$/$D^0D_s^{*-}$ correlation functions are significantly different in the high-momentum region, especially in small collision systems of the order of 1 fm, as produced in pp collisions at the LHC, which can unambiguously tell whether $Z_c(3900)$/$Z_{cs}(3985)$ is a resonant or a virtual state. For the $Z_{cs}(3985)$, the $D^0D_s^{*-}$ results at zero momentum are significantly different in the two scenarios. We hope all these discoveries can stimulate further experimental studies and help clarify the nature of the many exotic states discovered.</description>

Abstract: This paper introduces students and instructors to the use of Scilab for calculating phase shifts from phenomenological potentials in nuclear, atomic, and molecular scattering, beginning with a Riccati-type nonlinear differential equation derived from the time-independent Schr$\ddot{\text{o}}$dinger equation. For spherically symmetric potentials, this equation can be easily solved using Xcos, a Scilab toolbox. \cite{PRC}\cite{bobby} Scilab is open source software that is used for numerical computations and can be freely downloaded for Windows, Linux and Mac OS.\cite{scilab} Xcos is a Scilab toolbox dedicated to the modeling and simulation of hybrid dynamic systems \cite{rachna}.

      <title>Diffusion coefficient matrix for multiple conserved charges: a Kubo approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The strongly interacting matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions possesses several conserved quantum numbers, such as baryon number, strangeness, and electric charge. The diffusion process of these charges can be characterized by a diffusion matrix that describes the mutual influence of the diffusion of various charges. We derive the Kubo relations for evaluating diffusion coefficients as elements of a diffusion matrix. We further demonstrate that in the weak coupling limit, the diffusion matrix elements obtained through Kubo relations reduce to those obtained from kinetic theory with an appropriate identification of the relaxation times. We illustrate this evaluation in a toy model of two interacting scalar fields with two conserved charges.</description>

      <title>An unconventional deformation of the nonrelativistic spin-1/2 Fermi gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore a generalization of nonrelativistic fermionic statistics that interpolates between bosons and fermions, in which up to $K$ particles may occupy a single-particle state. We show that it can be mapped exactly to $K$ flavors of fermions with imaginary polarization. In particular, for $K\!=\!2$, we use such a mapping to derive the virial coefficients and relate them to those of conventional spin-1/2 fermions in an exact fashion. We also use the mapping to derive next-to-leading-order perturbative results for the pressure equation of state. Our results indicate that the $K\!=\!2$ particles are more strongly coupled than conventional spin-$1/2$ fermions, as measured by the interaction effects on the virial expansion and on the pressure equation of state. In the regime set by the unitary limit, the proposed $K\!=\!2$ deformation represents a universal many-body system whose properties remain largely unknown. In particular, the system can be expected to become superfluid at a critical temperature $T_c$ higher than that of the unitary limit. We suggest it may be possible to realize this system experimentally by engineering a polarized coupling to an electrostatic potential. Finally, we show that the $K\!=\!2$ system does not display a sign problem for determinantal Monte Carlo calculations, which indicates that $T_c$ can at least in principle be calculated with conventional methods.</description>

Abstract: The rich phenomenology of quantum many-body systems such as atomic nuclei is complex to interpret. Often, the behaviour (e.g. evolution with the number of constituents) of measurable/observable quantities such as binding or excitation energies can be best understood on the basis of a simplified picture involving auxiliary quantities that are not observable, i.e. whose values vary with parameters that are internal to the theoretical construction (contrarily to measurable/observable quantities). While being useful, the simplified interpretation is thus theoretical-scheme-dependent. This applies, in particular, to the so-called single-nucleon shell structure based on auxiliary effective single-particle energies (ESPEs). In this context, the present work aims at (i) recalling the way to compute ESPEs out of solutions of many-body Schr\"odinger's equation, (ii) illustrating the use of ESPEs within the frame of state-of-the-art ab initio calculations to interpret the outcome of a recent nuclear experiment and (iii) demonstrating the impact of several alterations to the computation of ESPEs. While the chosen alterations constitute approximations within the ab initio scheme, they are built-in when employing other theoretical constructs at play in nuclear physics. The present considerations are thus meant to empirically illustrate variations that can be expected between ESPEs computed within different (equally valid) theoretical schemes.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transitions in the cores of neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05637v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I explore various scenarios for the phase transition within neutron-star matter. I do so by generating large model-agnostic ensemble using Gaussian Processes, both with and without explicit inclusion of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). The ensemble is conditioned with state-of-the-art astrophysical and theoretical inputs in a fully Bayesian approach. I study how the current data affect the posterior probability of the location and the strength of FOPT. I find that the previously observed peak structure of the sound speed remains stable against inclusion of FOPTs. While the current data cannot differentiate between a smooth crossover and a first-order phase transition, 95% of the total evidence consists of equations of state with some form of phase changes, such as FOPT occurring within or terminating the stable branch of neutron stars, or an indication of a crossover to quark matter.</description>

      <title>Emerging Spherical-like spectra for the description of the normal states of $^{108-120}$Cd in the SU3-IBM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08198v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spherical nucleus puzzle implies that the phonon excitation of a spherical shape should be questioned and refuted. For understanding this spherical-like $\gamma$-soft mode newly found experimentally, a possible answer was proposed recently in the SU3-IBM. In this paper, the evolutions of the normal states in $^{108-120}$Cd are investigated and compared with the experimental results. For better explaining the nearly zero B(E2) values between the $0_{2}^{+}$ state and the $2_{1}^{+}$ state, except for the SU(3) second-order and third-order Casimir operators, other SU(3) higher-order interactions are also considered in detail. It can be found that the results of theoretical fitting and experimental data agree well under very simple parameter selection. The spherical-like spectra really exist. The deficiency may come from the lack of configuration mixing. The realistic spectra characteristics are found and it predicts the electric quadrupole moment of the $2_{1}^{+}$ state for $^{118,120}$Cd.</description>

      <title>Hypernuclear constraints on the existence and lifetime of a deeply bound $H$ dibaryon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12801v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study to what extent the unique observation of $\Lambda\Lambda$ hypernuclei by their weak decay into known $\Lambda$ hypernuclei, with lifetimes of order 10$^{-10}$ s, rules out the existence of a deeply bound doubly-strange (${\cal S}$=$-$2) $H$ dibaryon. Treating ${_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{~~6}}{\rm He}$ (the Nagara emulsion event) in a realistic $\Lambda-\Lambda-{^4}$He three-body model, we find that the ${_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{~~6}}{\rm He}\to H + {^4{\rm He}}$ strong-interaction lifetime increases beyond 10$^{-10}$ s for $m_H &lt; m_{\Lambda}+m_n$, about 176 MeV below the $\Lambda\Lambda$ threshold, so that such a deeply bound $H$ is not in conflict with hypernuclear data. Constrained by $\Lambda$ hypernuclear $\Delta{\cal S}$=1 nonmesonic weak-interaction decay rates, we follow EFT methods to evaluate the $\Delta{\cal S}$=2 $H\to nn$ weak-decay lifetime of $H$ in the mass range $2m_n \lesssim m_H &lt; m_{\Lambda}+m_n$. The resulting $H$ lifetime is of order 10$^5$ s, many orders of magnitude shorter than required to qualify for a dark-matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Parton Distributions from Boosted Fields in the Coulomb Gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14960v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to calculate parton distribution functions (PDFs) from lattice correlations of boosted quarks and gluons in the Coulomb gauge. Compared to the widely used gauge-invariant Wilson-line operators, these correlations greatly simplify the renormalization thanks to the absence of linear power divergence. Besides, they enable access to larger off-axis momenta under preserved 3D rotational symmetry, as well as enhanced long-range precision that facilitates the Fourier transform. We verify the factorization formula that relates this new observable to the quark PDF at one-loop order in perturbation theory. Moreover, through a lattice calculation of the pion valence quark PDF, we demonstrate the aforementioned advantage and features of the Coulomb gauge correlation and show that it yields consistent result with the gauge-invariant method. This opens the door to a more efficient way to calculate parton physics on the lattice.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03389v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider thermodynamics of the Universe within a quasiparticle approach where the collective dynamics of a system is governed by the thermal mass of the constituents. The spacetime dependence of this thermal mass leads to a negative contribution to the pressure and a positive contribution to the energy density, similar to the effect due to dark energy. We propose a mechanism based on thermodynamic arguments to quantify this contribution from the thermal vacuum of the system. For a sufficiently large spacetime variation of the thermal mass, the effective pressure can become negative and could mimic a dark energy equation of state. We validate our framework using results from renormalizable interacting scalar field theory and demonstrate an application on QCD axion.</description>

Abstract: Dipole toroidal modes appear in many fields of physics. In nuclei, such a mode was predicted more than 50 years ago, but clear experimental evidence was lacking so far. Using a combination of high-resolution inelastic scattering experiments with photons, electrons and protons, we identify for the first time candidates for toroidal dipole excitations in the nucleus $^{58}$Ni and demonstrate that transverse electron scattering form factors represent a relevant experimental observable to prove their nature.</description>

      <title>Cost of inferred nuclear parameters towards the f-mode dynamical tide in binary neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16561v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational Wave (GW) observations from Neutron Stars (NS) in a binary system provide an excellent scenario to constrain the nuclear parameters. The investigation of Pratten et al. (2022) has shown that the ignorance of f-mode dynamical tidal correction in the GW waveform model of the binary neutron star (BNS) system can lead to substantial bias in the measurement of NS properties and NS equations of state (EOS). In this work, we investigate the bias in the nuclear parameters resulting from the ignorance of dynamical tidal correction. In addition, this work demonstrates the sensitivity of the nuclear parameters and the estimated constraints on them from future GW observations. We infer the nuclear parameters from GW observations by describing the NS matter within the relativistic mean field model. For a population of GW events, we notice that the ignorance of dynamical tide predicts a lower median for nucleon effective mass ($m^*$) by $\sim6\%$ compared to the scenario when dynamical tidal correction is considered. Whereas at a 90\% credible interval(CI), $m^*$ gets constrained up to $\sim 5\%$ and $\sim 3\%$ in A+ (the LIGO-Virgo detectors with a sensitivity of 5th observing run) and Cosmic Explorer (CE) respectively. We also discuss the resulting constraints on all other nuclear parameters, including compressibility, symmetry energy, and slope of symmetry energy, considering an ensemble of GW events. We do not notice any significant impact in analyzing nuclear parameters other than $m^*$ due to the ignorance of f-mode dynamical tides.</description>

      <title>Solving the left-hand cut problem in lattice QCD: $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ from finite volume energy levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.01930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.01930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a novel effective-field-theory-based approach for extracting two-body scattering information from finite volume energies, serving as an alternative to L\"uscher's method. By explicitly incorporating one-pion exchange, we overcome the challenging left-hand cut problem in L\"uscher's method and can handle finite volume energy levels both below and above the left-hand cut. Applied to the lattice data for $DD^*$ scattering at a pion mass of 280 MeV, as an illustrative example, our results reveal the significant impact of the one-pion exchange on P-wave and S-wave phase shifts. The pole position of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ state, extracted from the finite-volume energy levels at this pion mass while taking into account left-hand cut effects, range corrections and partial-wave mixing, is consistent with a near-threshold resonance. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that two-body scattering information can be reliably extracted from lattice spectra including the left-hand cut.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Neutron Star $f-$mode Oscillations in General Relativity with Spectral Representation of Nuclear Equations of State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quasinormal $f-$mode oscillations in neutron star(NS) interiors within the linearized General Relativistic formalism. We utilize approximately 9000 nuclear Equations of State (EOS) using spectral representation techniques, incorporating constraints on nuclear saturation properties, chiral Effective Field Theory ($\chi$EFT) for pure neutron matter, and perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics (pQCD) for densities pertinent to NS cores. The median values of f-mode frequency, $\nu_f$ (damping time, $\tau_f$) for NS with masses ranging from 1.4 - 2.0 $M_\odot$ lie between 1.80 - 2.20 kHz (0.13 - 0.22 s) for our entire EOS set. Our study reveals a weak correlation between $f-$mode frequencies and individual nuclear saturation properties, prompting the necessity for more intricate methodologies to unveil multi-parameter relationships. We observe a robust linear relationship between the radii and $f-$mode frequencies for different NS masses. Leveraging this correlation alongside NICER observations of PSR J0740+6620 and PSR J0030+0451, we establish constraints that exhibit partial and minimal overlap for observational data from Riley et al. and Miller et al. respectively with our nucleonic EOS dataset. Moreover, NICER data aligns closely with radius and frequency values for a few hadron-quark hybrid EOS models. This indicates the need to consider additional exotic particles such as deconfined quarks at suprasaturation densities. We conclude that future observations of the radius or $f-$mode frequency for more than one NS mass, particularly at the extremes of viable NS mass scale, would either rule out nucleon-only EOS or provide definitive evidence in its favour.</description>

      <title>Population of tetraneutron continuum in reactions of $^{8}$He on deuterium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.17354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.17354v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Search for the population of the low-energy continuum of tetraneutron system was performed for the $^2$H($^8$He,$^6$Li)$^4n$ and $^2$H($^8$He,$^3$He)$^7$H$\rightarrow ^3$H+$^4n$ reactions. Evidence for a hump in the $^4n$ continuum at $3.5 \pm 0.7$ and $3.2 \pm 0.8$ MeV, respectively, was observed in both reactions. The observed statistics is quite low (6 and up to 40 events) corresponding to very low cross sections of few microbarns or tens of microbarns. The background conditions for the $^2$H($^8$He,$^6$Li)$^4n$ reaction are shown to be good, favoring the physical nature of the observed events. The $^2$H($^8$He,$^3$He)$^7$H$\rightarrow ^3$H+$^4n$ process transforms to the $^2$H($^8$He,$^6$Li$^{\ast})^4n$ reaction in the limit of the highest $^7$H decay energies. The population of the low-energy region in the $^{4}$n spectrum is found to be perfectly correlated with the population of the lowest $^{6}$Li states in the $^{3}$He+$^{3}$H continuum. Theoretical calculations of $^{8}$He in a five-body $\alpha$+$4n$ and of $^{4}$n in a four-body hyperspherical models are presented. The $^{8}$He wave function is shown to contain strong specific correlations, which may give rise to very low-energy structures in tetraneutron continuum in extreme-peripheral reaction scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbative renormalization provides the bedrock of understanding quantum field theories. In this work, I point out an alternative way of renormalizing quantum field theories, which is naturally encountered and well known for the case of large N scalar field theories. In terms of bare parameters, this non-perturbative alternative renormalization differs qualitatively from its perturbative cousin: in the continuum limit, the bare coupling constant goes to zero instead of infinity, and there is no wave-function counterterm. Despite these differences, the resulting n-point functions of the theory are finite. I provide explicit results for alternative renormalization for the O(N) model and QCD with $N_f=12$ flavors in 3+1 dimensions.</description>

      <title>Three-body scattering area for particles with infinite or zero scattering length in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.02202v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the asymptotic expansions of the wave function of three particles having equal mass with finite-range interactions and infinite or zero two-dimensional scattering length colliding at zero energy and zero orbital angular momentum, from which a three-body parameter $D$ is defined. The dimension of $D$ is length squared, and we call $D$ three-body scattering area. We find that the ground state energy per particle of a zero-temperature dilute Bose gas with these interactions is approximately $\frac{\hbar^2 D }{6m}\rho^2$, where $\rho$ is the number density of the bosons, $m$ is the mass of each boson, and $\hbar$ is Planck's constant over $2\pi$. Such a Bose gas is stable at $D\geq 0$ in the thermodynamic limit, and metastable at $D&lt;0$ in the harmonic trap if the number of bosons is less than $N_{cr}\approx 3.6413 \sqrt{\frac{\hbar}{m\omega |D|}}$, where $\omega$ is the angular frequency of the harmonic trap. If the two-body interaction supports bound states, $D$ typically acquires a negative imaginary part, and we find the relation between this imaginary part and the amplitudes of the pair-boson production processes. We derive a formula for the three-body recombination rate constant of the many-boson system in terms of the imaginary part of $D$.</description>

Abstract: The masses of $^{84}$Br, $^{105}$Mo, $^{115,119,121}$Pd, $^{122}$Ag, $^{127,129}$In, $^{132}$Sb and their respective isomeric states have been measured with the JYFLTRAP Penning trap mass spectrometer using the phase-imaging ion-cyclotron-resonance technique. The excitation energies of the isomeric states in $^{132}$Sb and $^{119}$Pd were experimentally determined for the first time, while for $^{84}$Br, $^{115}$Pd and $^{127,129}$In, the precision of the mass values was substantially improved. In $^{105}$Mo and $^{121}$Pd there were no signs of a long-lived isomeric state. The ground-state measurements of $^{119}$Pd and $^{122}$Ag indicated that both are significantly more bound than the literature values. For $^{122}$Ag, there was no indication of a proposed third long-lived state. The results for the $N=49$ nucleus $^{84}$Br and isomers close to doubly magic $^{132}$Sn have been compared to the shell-model and the microscopic quasiparticle-phonon model calculations.</description>
