      <title>Analytic weak-signal approximation of the Bayes factor for continuous gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We generalize the targeted $\mathcal{B}$-statistic for continuous gravitational waves by modeling the $h_0$-prior as a half-Gaussian distribution with scale parameter $H$. This approach retains analytic tractability for two of the four amplitude marginalization integrals and recovers the standard $\mathcal{B}$-statistic in the strong-signal limit ($H\rightarrow\infty$). By Taylor-expanding the weak-signal regime ($H\rightarrow0$), the new prior enables fully analytic amplitude marginalization, resulting in a simple, explicit statistic that is as computationally efficient as the maximum-likelihood $\mathcal{F}$-statistic, but significantly more robust. Numerical tests show that for day-long coherent searches, the weak-signal Bayes factor achieves sensitivities comparable to the $\mathcal{F}$-statistic, though marginally lower than the standard $\mathcal{B}$-statistic (and the Bero-Whelan approximation). In semi-coherent searches over short (compared to a day) segments, this approximation matches or outperforms the weighted dominant-response $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{ABw}}$-statistic and returns to the sensitivity of the (weighted) $\mathcal{F}_{\mathrm{w}}$-statistic for longer segments. Overall the new Bayes-factor approximation demonstrates state-of-the-art or improved sensitivity across a wide range of segment lengths we tested (from 900s to 10days).</description>

      <title>Black hole accretion of scalar clouds with spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spontaneous scalarization of black holes typically occurs through the condensation of a scalar field, with the field evolving from a $U(1)$-symmetric phase into a symmetry-breaking one with lower energy. We show that there exist symmetry-breaking phases which are themselves unstable to the formation of an additional scalar condensate, or `cloud', which is partly accreted into the black hole. By studying the fully nonlinear dynamical evolution of the process, we find that symmetry breaking causes the accretion channels of scalar clouds to be non-degenerate, favoring a dominant channel for evolution. Additionally, the final states form a characteristic energy band due to varying amounts of radiation emitted by clouds in different channels.</description>

      <title>Variational inference for correlated gravitational wave detector network noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and LISA generate long multivariate time series, which pose significant challenges in spectral density estimation due to a number of overlapping signals as well as the presence of correlated noise. Addressing both issues is crucial for accurately interpreting the signals detected by these instruments. This paper presents an application of a variational inference spectral density estimation method specifically tailored for dealing with correlated noise in the data. It is flexible in that it does not rely on any specific parametric form for the multivariate spectral density. The method employs a blocked Whittle likelihood approximation for stationary time series and utilizes the Cholesky decomposition of the inverse spectral density matrix to ensure a positive definite estimator. A discounted regularized horseshoe prior is applied to the spline coefficients of each Cholesky factor, and the posterior distribution is computed using a stochastic gradient variational Bayes approach. This method is particularly effective in addressing correlated noise, a significant challenge in the analysis of multivariate data from co-located detectors. The method is demonstrated by analyzing 2000 seconds of simulated Einstein Telescope noise, which shows its ability to produce accurate spectral density estimates and quantify coherence between time series components. This makes it a powerful tool for analyzing correlated noise in gravitational wave data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational orbital Hall effect of vortex light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Analogous to the gravitational spin Hall effect (SHE), light possessing the intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM) is expected to exhibit ray trajectories deviating from null geodesics when propagating through a gravitational field and we term this phenomenon the gravitational orbital Hall effect (OHE). In our text, we utilize the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin approximation to study the ray dynamics of the vortex light in arbitrary curved spacetimes. We start by taking the WKB method to the field action of the optical system and finally obtain the effective ray equations. At large but finite frequencies, the corrections beyond the geodesic equation matters. We also find that these effective equations are the same in form as those for the polarized light, highlighting the consistency between the gravitational OHE and the gravitational SHE. Particularly, we obtain physical quantities within extended geometrical optics, including the Berry connection and the Berry phase, demonstrating their identity as the source of the gravitational OHE. Finally, we derive the equivalent ray equations of vortex light in an inhomogeneous medium and successfully simulate the gravitational OHE in microstructured optical waveguides numerically.</description>

      <title>Exploring Nonlinear Electrodynamics Theories: Shadows of Regular Black Holes and Horizonless Ultra-Compact Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Einstein-Maxwell theory with nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) fields, the singularity problem in general relativity is potentially resolved, leading to regular black hole solutions. In NED theories, photons follow null geodesics of an effective geometry that differs from the spacetime geometry itself. This raises an important question: Do NED fields produce unique observational signatures in the electromagnetic spectrum that can test regular black holes and NED theories? We analyze the shadows of two NED-charged regular black holes and their horizonless ultracompact objects (HUCOs) under two accretion models, comparing them with Schwarzschild black holes, focusing on shadow size, central brightness depression, and photon ring characteristics. Our results identify distinctive NED signatures that could be observable by the EHT, providing empirical evidence of NED fields and potentially ruling out previously considered viable candidates for astrophysical black holes models based on shadow measurements. Notably, NED-charged HUCOs generally exhibit only one $\textit{unstable}$ photon ring, thus avoiding the dynamical instability associated with stable photon rings and challenging the idea that objects with photon rings must be black holes.</description>

      <title>Petrov types, separability and generalized photon surfaces of supergravity black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The vacuum and electrovacuum Einstein equations for spacetimes with two commuting Killing vectors can be solved by indirect methods of integrable systems. But if, in addition, the spacetime admits an irreducible Killing tensor and the corresponding Klein-Gordon equation is separable, they can be integrated directly by separation of variables, as shown by Carter in 1968. We generalize this approach to supergravity and derive a metric ansatz that ensures the above properties for Petrov-type $I$. Our derivation is based on the Benenti-Francavilla ansatz for metrics admitting two commuting Killing vectors and an irreducible Killing tensor. We find additional constraints that guarantee the existence of two shear-free null geodesic congruences and the separability of the Klein-Gordon equation. The resulting class of metrics belongs to a certain sector of Petrov type $I$, called $I_B$, whose algebraically special subsector contains only type $D$. For this class, a direct integration of the supergravity equations seems possible. We also show that these spacetimes admit a general description of the generalized photon and massive particle surfaces recently introduced in connection with black hole shadows.</description>

      <title>Problematic systematics in neutron-star merger simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave instruments are expected to constrain the equation of state of dense nuclear matter by observing binaries involving neutron stars. We highlight a problematic systematic error in finite-temperature merger simulations, where shock heating associated with the neutron-star surface gives rise to elevated temperatures. We demonstrate the severe implications of this artificial heating by computing static and dynamical tidal parameters for neutron stars immersed in simulation temperature profiles. The induced systematic errors must be addressed if we want to build robust gravitational-wave signal models for neutron-star, or indeed neutron star-black hole, binaries.</description>

      <title>No Pulsar Timing Noise from Brownian Motion of the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It was recently claimed (arXiv:2405.05410 [gr-qc]) that evidence for a stochastic gravitational wave background observed by pulsar timing arrays can be attributed instead to random perturbations of the Sun's motion by transiting asteroids. I show that that this would lead to a large dipole component accompanying a much smaller quadrupolar perturbation of pulsar timing signals, which would not be confused with a gravitational wave signal. Such an anomalous dipole would have been detected and identified as a spurious background by the PTA collaborations, if it existed.</description>

      <title>Hunting Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter in Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10617v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A very pressing question in contemporary physics is the identity of Dark Matter (DM), and one that has not been answered affirmatively to any degree so far. Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are one of the most well-motivated DM candidates. Light enough PBHs have been constrained by either the non-detection of their Hawking radiation itself, or by the non-observation of any measurable effects of this radiation on astrophysical and cosmological observables. We constrain the PBH density by their Hawking radiation effect on the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature evolution. We use the latest deductions of IGM temperature from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations. We put constraints on the fraction of PBH DM with masses $5 \times 10^{15}$ g - $10^{17}$ g separately for spinning and non-spinning BHs. We derive constraints by dealing with the heating effects of the astrophysical reionization of the IGM in two ways. In one way, we completely neglect this heating due to astrophysical sources, thus giving us weaker constraints, but completely robust to the reionization history of the universe. In the second way, we utilise some modelling of the ionization and temperature history, and use it to derive more stringent constraints. We find that for non-spinning PBHs of mass $10^{16}$ g, the current measurements can constrain the PBH-density to be $\lesssim$ 0.1% of the total DM. We find that these constraints from the latest Lyman-$\alpha$ forest temperature measurements are competitive, and hence provide a new observable to probe the nature of PBH DM. The systematics affecting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements are different from other constraining observations, and thus this is a complementary probe.</description>

      <title>On the classical limit of the (sub)$^{n}$-leading soft graviton theorems in $D = 4$ without deflection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12898v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tree-level gravitational amplitudes satisfy an infinite hierarchy of soft factorization theorems. The existence of these theorems has been recently linked with the existence of an infinite tower of asymptotic symmetries. In this paper, we analyze the relevance of the soft graviton theorems beyond sub-leading order in the context of classical gravitational scattering in four dimensions. More in detail, we show that the infinite impact parameter limit of the late-time gravitational field emitted during a classical scattering can be derived using these factorization theorems. The classical field obtained in this (infinite impact parameter) regime has an expansion in the frequency of the detector where the modes scale as $\omega^{n}\log{\omega}$ with a vanishing memory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12989v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently claimed (arXiv:2409.09081v1 [astro-ph.HE]) that accretion of ordinary matter on black holes of mass $(6\times 10^{14}-4\times10^{19})\,$g would be inhibited by quantum mechanical effects, namely the de Broglie wavelength of the electron being larger than the Schwarzschild radius. However the conclusion is based on considering accretion of a single atom over the age of the Universe. There is no suppression of the accretion rate per atom on such black holes.</description>

      <title>Stars or gas? Constraining the hardening processes of massive black-hole binaries with LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13011v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive black-hole binaries will be the loudest sources detectable by LISA. These systems are predicted to form during the hierarchical assembly of cosmic structures and coalesce by interacting with the surrounding environment. The hardening phase of their orbit is driven by either stars or gas and encodes distinctive features into the binary black holes that can potentially be reconstructed with gravitational-wave observations. We present a Bayesian framework to assess the likelihood of massive mergers being hardened by either gaseous or stellar interactions. We use state-of-the-art astrophysical models tracking the cosmological evolution of massive black-hole binaries and construct a large number of simulated catalogs of sources detectable by LISA. From these, we select a representative catalog and run both parameter estimation assuming a realistic LISA response as well model comparison capturing selection effects. Our results suggest that, at least within the context of the adopted models, future LISA observations can confidently constrain whether stars or gas are responsible for the binary hardening. We stress that accurate astrophysical modeling of the black-hole spins and the inclusion of subdominant emission modes in the adopted signal might be crucial to avoid systematic biases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.13399v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the null test of cosmic accelerated expansion by using the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements released by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, and we find that the latest BAO data alone can provide strong model-independent evidence for the existence of accelerated expansion in the Universe. Using Gaussian Process reconstruction, we derive the deceleration parameter $q(z)$ from the BAO data, revealing that accelerated expansion persisted until $z \lesssim 0.833$. By further incorporating data from Cosmic Chronometers and 6 expansion rate measured by type Ia supernovae, we find that accelerated expansion continued until $z \lesssim 0.417$.</description>

      <title>Constant roll and non-Gaussian tail in light of logarithmic duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The curvature perturbation in a model of constant-roll (CR) inflation is interpreted in view of the logarithmic duality discovered in Ref. [1] according to the $\delta N$ formalism. We confirm that the critical value $\beta:=\ddot{\varphi}/(H\dot{\varphi})=-3/2$ determining whether the CR condition is stable or not is understood as the point at which the dual solutions, i.e., the attractor and non-attractor solutions of the field equation, are interchanged. For the attractor-solution domination, the curvature perturbation in the CR model is given by a simple logarithmic mapping of a Gaussian random field, which can realise both the exponential tail (i.e., the single exponential decay) and the Gumbel-distribution-like tail (i.e., the double exponential decay) of the probability density function, depending on the value of $\beta$. Such a tail behaviour is important for, e.g., the estimation of the primordial black hole abundance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.06215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend previous efforts to quantify the entanglement generated in Hawking's evaporation process by including rotation and thermal environments (e.g. the cosmic microwave background). Both extensions are needed to describe real black holes in our universe. Leveraging techniques from Gaussian quantum information, we find that the black hole's ergoregion is an active source of quantum entanglement and that thermal environments drastically degrade entanglement generation. Our predictions are suitable to be tested in the lab using analogue platforms and also provide tools to assess the fate of quantum information for black holes in more generic settings.</description>

      <title>Emergence of squeezed coherent states in Kaluza-Klein cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05058v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a propagating scalar field on Kaluza-Klein-type cosmological background. It is shown that this geometrical description of the Universe resembles - from a Hamiltonian standpoint - a damped harmonic oscillator with mass and frequency, both time-dependents. In this scenario, we construct the squeezed coherent states (SCSs) for the quantized scalar field by employing the invariant operator method of Lewis-Riesenfeld (non-Hermitian) in a non-unitary approach. The non-classicality of SCSs has been discussed by examining the quadrature squeezing properties from the uncertainty principle. Moreover, we compute the probability density, which allows us to investigate whether SCSs can be used to seek traces of extra dimensions. We then analyze the effects of the existence of supplementary space on cosmological particle production in SCSs by considering different cosmological eras.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass-ratio inspirals in ultra-light dark matter</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.06767v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous works have argued that future gravitational-wave detectors will be able to probe the properties of astrophysical environments where binary coalesce, including accretion disks, but also dark matter structures. Most analyses have resorted to a Newtonian modelling of the environmental effects, which are not suited to study extreme-mass-ratio inspirals immersed in structures of ultra-light bosons. In this letter, we use relativistic perturbation theory to consistently study these systems in spherical symmetry. We compute the flux of scalar particles and the rate at which orbital energy (and angular momentum) is dissipated via gravitational radiation and depletion of scalars, i.e. dynamical friction. Our results suggest that the Laser Inteferometer Space Antenna will be able to probe ultra-light dark matter structures in the Galaxy by tracking the phase of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals.</description>

      <title>Observational features of reflection asymmetric black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.07055v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kerr spacetime is symmetric with respect to a well-defined equatorial plane. When testing the equatorial reflection symmetry of an isolated black hole, one is at the same time testing the Kerr hypothesis in General Relativity. In this work, we investigate the possible observational features when a Keplerian disk is surrounding a rotating black hole without reflection symmetry. When such symmetry is broken, generically, the photon trajectories around the black hole and the Keplerian orbits on the accretion disk are distorted vertically away from the equatorial plane by an amount that depends on their distance to the black hole. In the reflection asymmetric spacetime we are considering, these two kinds of orbits are distorted in opposite directions. Interestingly, while the size and shape of black hole shadows closely resemble those of Kerr black holes, distinct observational characteristics can emerge in the disk image and emission line profiles. When observing the disk edge-on, a pronounced concave shape may appear along its innermost edge on the incoming side. Furthermore, distinctive horn-like features might be observed on the spectral line profile at the blue-shifted side. These special features can serve as compelling indicators of the reflection asymmetry present in rotating black holes.</description>

      <title>Squeezing the quantum noise of a gravitational-wavedetector below the standard quantum limit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14569v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision measurements of space and time, like those made by the detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), are often confronted with fundamental limitations imposed by quantum mechanics. The Heisenberg uncertainty principle dictates that the position and momentum of an object cannot both be precisely measured, giving rise to an apparent limitation called the Standard Quantum Limit (SQL). Reducing quantum noise below the SQL in gravitational-wave detectors, where photons are used to continuously measure the positions of freely falling mirrors, has been an active area of research for decades. Here we show how the LIGO A+ upgrade reduced the detectors' quantum noise below the SQL by up to 3 dB while achieving a broadband sensitivity improvement, more than two decades after this possibility was first presented.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics and kinetics of state switching for the asymptotically flat black hole in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09151v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the thermodynamics and the kinetics of state switching for the asymptotically flat black hole enclosed by a cavity can be studied in terms of the free energy landscape formalism. The generalized free energy for the black hole enclosed by a cavity in the canonical ensemble is derived by using the York's approach, where the temperature on the cavity and the charges inside the cavity are kept as the fixed parameters. By quantifying the corresponding free energy landscape, we obtain the phase diagrams for the black hole in cavity, which reveal a Hawking-Page type transition for the uncharged black hole and a Van der Waals type transition for the charged black hole. We further assume that the dynamics of black hole state switching is mutually determined by the gradient force and the stochastic force arising from the free energy landscape and the thermal noises respectively. We then derive a recurrence relation for the $n$-momentum of the first passage time distribution function, which enables the calculation of the kinetic times characterized by the mean first passage time and its relative fluctuation. Our analysis illustrates that the kinetics of black hole state switching is determined by the ensemble temperature and the barrier height on the free energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Dirac fermions in a spinning conical G\"odel-type spacetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11334v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we determine the relativistic and nonrelativistic energy levels for Dirac fermions in a spinning conical G\"odel-type spacetime in $(2+1)$-dimensions, where we work with the curved Dirac equation in polar coordinates and we use the tetrads formalism. Solving a second-order differential equation for the two components of the Dirac spinor, we obtain a generalized Laguerre equation, and the relativistic energy levels of the fermion and antifermion, where such levels are quantized in terms of the radial and total magnetic quantum numbers $n$ and $m_j$, and explicitly depends on the spin parameter $s$ (describes the ``spin''), spinorial parameter $u$ (describes the two components of the spinor), curvature and rotation parameters $\alpha$ and $\beta$ (describes the conical curvature and the angular momentum of the spinning cosmic string), and on the vorticity parameter $\Omega$ (describes the G\"odel-type spacetime). In particular, the quantization is a direct result of the existence of $\Omega$ (i.e. $\Omega$ acts as a kind of ``external field or potential''). We see that for $m_j&gt;0$, the energy levels do not depend on $s$ and $u$; however, depend on $n$, $m_j$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$. In this case, $\alpha$ breaks the degeneracy of the energy levels and such levels can increase infinitely in the limit $\frac{4\Omega\beta}{\alpha}\to 1$. Already for $m_j&lt;0$, we see that the energy levels depends on $s$, $u$ and $n$; however, it no longer depends on $m_j$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$. In this case, it is as if the fermion ``lives only in a flat G\"odel-type spacetime''. Besides, we also study the low-energy or nonrelativistic limit of the system. In both cases (relativistic and nonrelativistic), we graphically analyze the behavior of energy levels as a function of $\Omega$, $\alpha$, and $\beta$ for three different values of $n$ (ground state and the first two excited states).</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Schwarzschild solutions in $f(R)$ extension of general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the question of how to build a class of $f(R)$ extensions of General Relativity which are compatible with solar system experiments, without making any preliminary assumption on the properties of $f$. The aim is reached by perturbatively solving the modified Einstein equations around a Schwarzschild background and retrieving a posteriori the corresponding $f(R)$. This turns out to be non analytical in $R=0$ and should be intended as the leading correction to the Einstein-Hilbert action in the low curvature limit. The parameters characterizing the $f(R)$ class are then set by constraining the corrections to four different local tests with the observations. The result is a class of $f(R)$ theories built up from a purely bottom-up approach and compatible with the local tests. At a more general level, this result can help constraining exact $f(R)$ models working in Cosmology, since it provides the correct local limit. Further developments and possible extensions of the approach to Cosmology are also discussed.</description>

We choose the first-order non-conservative Z4 formulation of the Einstein equations, which has a built-in cleaning procedure that accounts for the Einstein constraints and that has already shown its ability in keeping stationary solutions stable over long timescales. Upon the introduction of auxiliary variables, the vacuum Einstein equations in first order form constitute a ...</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01673v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Previous studies have shown that an Unruh-DeWitt (UDW) detector, when coupled linearly to a massless scalar field and permitted to fall radially into certain black holes, will exhibit non-monotonicity in its transition properties near the horizon. Specifically, the transition probability of a detector freely falling into a (3+1)-dimensional Schawrzschild black hole, when considering the Unruh and Hartle-Hawking vacuum states, was shown to possess a local extremum at horizon crossing [K.K. Ng et al., New J. Phys. 24 (2022) 103018]. The transition rate of a detector falling into a static (2+1)-dimensional Ba\~nados-Teitelboim-Zanelli (BTZ) black hole, for the Hartle-Hawking state, was also found to have multiple local extrema near the horizon under certain parameter settings [M.R. Preciado-Rivas et al., arXiv:2402.14908v1]. These discoveries are of interest, as they suggest that the event horizon of a black hole may be distinguishable to a local probe when QFT effects are included. In this paper, we explore the problem of a UDW detector falling freely into a rotating BTZ black hole. We numerically compute the detector's transition rate for different values of black hole mass, black hole angular momentum, detector energy gap, and field boundary conditions at infinity. Our results lead to a more generalized description of the behaviour of particle detectors in BTZ black hole spacetime, from which the previous non-rotating BTZ case can be retrieved in the limit as angular momentum vanishes.</description>

Abstract: Investigations into Hawking radiation often assume a black hole model featuring an event horizon, despite the growing consensus that such causal structures may not exist in nature. While this assumption is not crucial for deriving the local properties of radiation at future null infinity, it plays a significant role in discussions about Hawking partners -- the field modes that purify Hawking radiation. This article aims to explore the definition and fate of Hawking partners in black hole scenarios where semiclassical mass loss due to Hawking radiation is considered. Our analysis avoids the assumption of event horizons and instead focuses on collapse processes that feature a trapped region bounded by a dynamical horizon. We derive the form of the partners, accounting for the effects of back-scattering. Furthermore, using these results and mild assumptions, we find that Hawking partners cannot "leak" out of the dynamical horizon to partially purify the Hawking radiation in the regime where general relativity coexists semiclassically with quantum field theory. This finding emphasizes the necessity for new physics, such as quantum gravity, to resolve the final fate of information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04750v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There is ongoing interest in the nonmetricity formulation of gravity. The nonlinear extension of the theory, called $f(Q)$ gravity, has recently been proposed and offers a promising avenue for addressing some of the long-standing challenges in cosmology and fundamental physics. A number of solutions have already been found that have confirmed the usefulness of the theory for astrophysics and cosmology. Motivated by earlier work on G\"odel-type spacetimes we investigate whether $f(Q)$ gravity admits such cosmological solutions, which entail causality violation. In the coincident gauge, which is shown to be a legitimate gauge because the connection field equations are satisfied, we find that G\"odel-type metrics are allowed by this modified gravity theory for any function $f(Q)$. Noncausal and causal solutions exist depending on the matter content. For a perfect fluid, out of all G\"odel-type metrics only G\"odel's original model is allowed in $f(Q)$ gravity, implying violation of causality. The requirement that energy conditions be obeyed by the fluid leads to mild restrictions on $f(Q)$. For a massless scalar field in the presence of a cosmological constant, there are causal solutions for any reasonable function $f(Q)$.</description>

Abstract: We consider accelerating black holes in four-dimensional anti-de Sitter spacetime and investigate the extremality relations by examining perturbative corrections to both the entropy of black holes and their extremality bounds. It is shown that the so-called Goon and Penco (univeral) relation is also valid for accelerating black holes. Furthermore, it is found that an appropriate matching condition is necessary between the perturbation parameter of the relation with the perturbative correction to such black holes, and the parameter with information about the conical deficits on the north and south poles with the cosmic string tensions in order to satisfy the extremality relations. This result indicates that the extremality (univeral) relation of a class of accelerating black holes holds exhibit behavior similar to the Weak Gravity Conjecture.</description>

Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing occurs when photons pass through the vicinity of a black hole. We investigate this phenomenon in the context of a gravitational-wave event, specifically when a black hole is settling into its final state. The deflection angle of photons mimics the ringdown pattern of the gravitational wave at intermediate times. At late times it has an inverse cubic dependence on observation time. The deviation angle increases exponentially as photons approach the photon ring orbit, reflecting its unstable nature. Our findings are directly applicable to imaging scenarios involving stars against the background of compact binaries, or circumbinary accretion disks, particularly during the merger of two black holes.</description>

      <title>A contextual analysis of the early work of Andrzej Trautman and Ivor Robinson on equations of motion and gravitational radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.03753</link>
      <description>arXiv:1910.03753v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a series of papers published in the course of his dissertation work in the mid 1950's, Andrzej Trautman drew upon the slow motion approximation developed by his advisor Infeld, the general covariance based strong conservation laws enunciated by Bergmann and Goldberg, the Riemann tensor attributes explored by Goldberg and related geodesic deviation exploited by Pirani, the permissible metric discontinuities identified by Lichnerowicz, O'Brien and Synge, and finally Petrov's classification of vacuum spacetimes. With several significant additions he produced a comprehensive overview of the state of research in equations of motion and gravitational waves that was presented in a widely cited series of lectures at King's College, London, in 1958. Fundamental new contributions were the formulation of boundary conditions representing outgoing gravitational radiation the deduction of its Petrov type, a covariant expression for null wave fronts, and a derivation of the correct mass loss formula due to radiation emission. Ivor Robinson had already in 1956 developed a bi-vector based technique that had resulted in his rediscovery of exact plane gravitational wave solutions of Einstein's equations. He was the first to characterize shear-free null geodesic congruences. He and Trautman met in London in 1958, and there resulted a long-term collaboration whose initial fruits were the Robinson-Trautman metric, examples of which were exact spherical gravitational waves.</description>

      <title>General relativistic Lagrangian continuum theories -- Part I: reduced variational principles and junction conditions for hydrodynamics and elasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.06560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.06560v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a Lagrangian variational framework for general relativistic continuum theories that permits the development of the process of Lagrangian reduction by symmetry in the relativistic context. Starting with a continuum version of the Hamilton principle for the relativistic particle, we deduce two classes of reduced variational principles that are associated to either spacetime covariance, which is an axiom of the continuum theory, or material covariance, which is related to particular properties of the system such as isotropy. The covariance hypotheses and the Lagrangian reduction process are efficiently formulated by making explicit the dependence of the theory on given material and spacetime tensor fields that are transported by the world-tube of the continuum via the push-forward and pull-back operations. It is shown that the variational formulation, when augmented with the Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) boundary terms, also yields the Israel-Darmois junction conditions between the solution at the interior of the relativistic continua and the solution describing the gravity field produced outside from it. The expression of the first variation of the GHY term with respect to the hypersurface involves some extensions of previous results that we also derive in the paper. We consider in details the application of the variational framework to relativistic fluids and relativistic elasticity. For the latter case, our setting also allows to clarify the relation between formulations of relativistic elasticity based on the relativistic right Cauchy-Green tensor or on the relativistic Cauchy deformation tensor. The setting developed here will be further exploited for modelling purpose in subsequent parts of the paper.</description>

      <title>Integrated perturbation theory for cosmological tensor fields. III. Projection effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.13304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.13304v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integrated perturbation theory (iPT) is a set of methods in nonlinear perturbation theory for the structure formation in the Universe. In Papers I and II [arXiv:2210.10435, arXiv:2210.11085], the basic formalism and technical methods of the iPT for cosmological tensor fields are developed, generalizing the corresponding theory for scalar fields. In previous papers, methods to predict statistical quantities, such as power spectra, correlation functions, etc., of three-dimensional tensor fields are developed based on the iPT. However, observations of tensors, such as angular momenta and shapes of galaxies, etc., are only possible after the three-dimensional tensors are projected onto the two-dimensional sky. In this paper, power spectra and correlation functions of projected two-dimensional tensors are related to those of original three-dimensional tensors, so that one can make predictions for the observable statistics of projected tensor fields from the iPT. The relations are consistently represented on the basis of irreducible decomposition of both two- and three-dimensional tensors.</description>

      <title>Loop corrections versus marginal deformation in celestial holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02743v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Four-dimensional all-loop amplitudes in QED and gravity exhibit universal Infrared (IR) singularities with a factorization structure. This structure is governed by tree amplitudes and a universal IR-divergent factor representing the exchange of soft particles between external lines. This letter offers a precise dual interpretation of these universal IR-divergent factors within celestial holography. Considering the tree amplitude as the foundation of the celestial conformal field theory (CCFT), these universal factors correspond to marginal deformations with a \textit{double-current} construction in the CCFT. Remarkably, a novel geometric representation of these deformations through topological gauging provides an exact description of transitions within bulk vacuum moduli spaces which extends the celestial holography beyond the perturbative level. Our findings establish a concrete dictionary for celestial holography and offer a holographic lens to understand loop corrections in scattering amplitudes.</description>

      <title>A search for Planet Nine with small spacecraft:Three-body, post-Newtonian, non-gravitational, planetary and Kuiper Belt effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11863</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11863v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A hypothetical gravitating body in the outer Solar System, the so-called Planet Nine, was proposed to explain the unexpected clustering of the Kuiper Belt Objects. As it has not been observed via telescopes, it was conjectured to be a primordial black hole (of the size of a quince) that could be gravitationally detected by laser-launching or solar sailing many small spacecraft. Here, we study various aspects affecting such a search for Planet Nine. Our basic observable is the angular displacement in the trajectory of a small spacecraft which will be mainly affected by the gravity of Planet Nine, augmented with several other 3-body, non-gravitational, post-Newtonian, planetary, and Kuiper Belt effects. First, we calculate the effect of the Sun in the framework of the circular restricted three-body problem of the Sun--Planet Nine-spacecraft for the two particular initial conditions. Then, we study the effects of Kuiper Belt and outer planets, namely Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, as well as non-gravitational perturbations such as magnetic and drag forces exerted by the interstellar medium; and the solar radiation pressure. In addition, we investigate the post-Newtonian general relativistic effects such as the frame-dragging, Schwarzschild effect, and geodetic precession on the spacecraft trajectory. We show that the leading order angular displacement is due to the solar radiation pressure for the lower spacecraft velocities, and the drag force for the higher spacecraft velocities. Among the general relativistic effects, the frame-dragging has the smallest effect; and the Schwarzschild effect due to Sun has the largest effect. However, none of the general relativistic effects produces a meaningful contribution to the detection.</description>

      <title>Analytic bounds on late-time axion-scalar cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The cosmological dynamics of multiple scalar/pseudoscalar fields are difficult to solve, especially when the field-space metric is curved. This presents a challenge in determining whether a given model can support cosmic acceleration, without solving for the on-shell solution. In this work, we present bounds on late-time FLRW-cosmologies in classes of theories that involve arbitrary numbers of scalar and pseudoscalar fields coupled both kinetically (leading to a curved field space metric) and through scalar potentials. Such bounds are proven analytically, independently of initial conditions, with no approximation in the field equations and without referring to explicit solutions. Besides their broad applications to cosmological model building, our bounds can be applied to studying asymptotic cosmologies of certain classes of string compactifications.</description>

      <title>Graviton reggeization and high energy gravitational scattering of scalar particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19067v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we consider a high energy scattering of free scalar particles through a gravitational field. The one particle t-channel amplitude of the scattering in this limit is governed by reggeized graviton. Therefore, we discuss an appearance of the reggeized gravitons in the framework of Einstein-Hilbert gravity and consider Lipatov's effective action for the reggeized gravitons. We calculate the trajectory of the corresponding $t$-channel amplitude in the framework and thereafter define the leading order amplitude of scattering of two massive scalar particles. An impact factor of the interaction of scalar particle with the reggeized gravitons is also calculated and possible applications of the approach are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>Four dimensional Riemannian general relativity as a spontaneous symmetry breaking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04704</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper $4$ dimensional Riemannian (or Euclidean) vacuum general relativity is recovered from a phase transition by spontaneous symmetry breaking within a quantum field theory (all in the sense of the operator algebraic approach to quantum field theory) provided by the unique ${\rm II}_1$ hyperfinite factor von Neumann algebra. The formal temperature of this phase transition is $T=\frac{1}{2}T_{\rm Planck}\approx7.06\times 10^{31}{\rm K}$. (For an extended abstract see the text.)</description>
