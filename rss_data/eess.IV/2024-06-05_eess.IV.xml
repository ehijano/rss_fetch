      <title>An Enhanced Encoder-Decoder Network Architecture for Reducing Information Loss in Image Semantic Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The traditional SegNet architecture commonly encounters significant information loss during the sampling process, which detrimentally affects its accuracy in image semantic segmentation tasks. To counter this challenge, we introduce an innovative encoder-decoder network structure enhanced with residual connections. Our approach employs a multi-residual connection strategy designed to preserve the intricate details across various image scales more effectively, thus minimizing the information loss inherent to down-sampling procedures. Additionally, to enhance the convergence rate of network training and mitigate sample imbalance issues, we have devised a modified cross-entropy loss function incorporating a balancing factor. This modification optimizes the distribution between positive and negative samples, thus improving the efficiency of model training. Experimental evaluations of our model demonstrate a substantial reduction in information loss and improved accuracy in semantic segmentation. Notably, our proposed network architecture demonstrates a substantial improvement in the finely annotated mean Intersection over Union (mIoU) on the dataset compared to the conventional SegNet. The proposed network structure not only reduces operational costs by decreasing manual inspection needs but also scales up the deployment of AI-driven image analysis across different sectors.</description>

      <title>Dual-Stream Attention Network for Hyperspectral Image Unmixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01644v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) contains abundant spatial and spectral information, making it highly valuable for unmixing. In this paper, we propose a Dual-Stream Attention Network (DSANet) for HSI unmixing. The endmembers and abundance of a pixel in HSI have high correlations with its adjacent pixels. Therefore, we adopt a "many to one" strategy to estimate the abundance of the central pixel. In addition, we adopt multiview spectral method, dividing spectral bands into multiple partitions with low correlations to estimate abundances. To aggregate the estimated abundances for complementary from the two branches, we design a cross-fusion attention network to enhance valuable information. Extensive experiments have been conducted on two real datasets, which demonstrate the effectiveness of our DSANet.</description>

      <title>Video Coding with Cross-Component Sample Offset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Beyond the exploration of traditional spatial, temporal and subjective visual signal redundancy in image and video compression, recent research has focused on leveraging cross-color component redundancy to enhance coding efficiency. Cross-component coding approaches are motivated by the statistical correlations among different color components, such as those in the Y'CbCr color space, where luma (Y) color component typically exhibits finer details than chroma (Cb/Cr) color components. Inspired by previous cross-component coding algorithms, this paper introduces a novel in-loop filtering approach named Cross-Component Sample Offset (CCSO). CCSO utilizes co-located and neighboring luma samples to generate correction signals for both luma and chroma reconstructed samples. It is a multiplication-free, non-linear mapping process implemented using a look-up-table. The input to the mapping is a group of reconstructed luma samples, and the output is an offset value applied on the center luma or co-located chroma sample. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed CCSO can be applied to both image and video coding, resulting in improved coding efficiency and visual quality. The method has been adopted into an experimental next-generation video codec beyond AV1 developed by the Alliance for Open Media (AOMedia), achieving significant objective coding gains up to 3.5\,\% and 1.8\,\% for PSNR and VMAF quality metrics, respectively, under random access configuration. Additionally, CCSO notably improves the subjective visual quality.</description>

      <title>Choroidal Vessel Segmentation on Indocyanine Green Angiography Images via Human-in-the-Loop Labeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Human-in-the-loop (HITL) strategy has been recently introduced into the field of medical image processing. Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) stands as a well-established examination for visualizing choroidal vasculature and detecting chorioretinal diseases. However, the intricate nature of choroidal vascular networks makes large-scale manual segmentation of ICGA images challenging. Thus, the study aims to develop a high-precision choroidal vessel segmentation model with limited labor using HITL framework. We utilized a multi-source ICGA dataset, including 55 degree view and ultra-widefield ICGA (UWF-ICGA) images for model development. The choroidal vessel network was pre-segmented by a pre-trained vessel segmentation model, and then manually modified by two ophthalmologists. Choroidal vascular diameter, density, complexity, tortuosity, and branching angle were automatically quantified based on the segmentation. We finally conducted four cycles of HITL. One hundred and fifty 55 degree view ICGA images were used for the first three cycles (50 images per cycle), and twenty UWF-ICGA images for the last cycle. The average time needed to manually correct a pre-segmented ICGA image per cycle reduced from 20 minutes to 1 minute. High segmentation accuracy has been achieved on both 55 degree view ICGA and UWF-ICGA images. Additionally, the multi-dimensional choroidal vascular parameters were significantly associated with various chorioretinal diseases. Our study not only demonstrated the feasibility of the HITL strategy in improving segmentation performance with reduced manual labeling, but also innovatively introduced several risk predictors for choroidal abnormalities.</description>

      <title>Multi-target stain normalization for histology slides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional staining normalization approaches, e.g. Macenko, typically rely on the choice of a single representative reference image, which may not adequately account for the diverse staining patterns of datasets collected in practical scenarios. In this study, we introduce a novel approach that leverages multiple reference images to enhance robustness against stain variation. Our method is parameter-free and can be adopted in existing computational pathology pipelines with no significant changes. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method through experiments using a deep-learning pipeline for automatic nuclei segmentation on colorectal images. Our results show that by leveraging multiple reference images, better results can be achieved when generalizing to external data, where the staining can widely differ from the training set.</description>

      <title>IterMask2: Iterative Unsupervised Anomaly Segmentation via Spatial and Frequency Masking for Brain Lesions in MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unsupervised anomaly segmentation approaches to pathology segmentation train a model on images of healthy subjects, that they define as the 'normal' data distribution. At inference, they aim to segment any pathologies in new images as 'anomalies', as they exhibit patterns that deviate from those in 'normal' training data. Prevailing methods follow the 'corrupt-and-reconstruct' paradigm. They intentionally corrupt an input image, reconstruct it to follow the learned 'normal' distribution, and subsequently segment anomalies based on reconstruction error. Corrupting an input image, however, inevitably leads to suboptimal reconstruction even of normal regions, causing false positives. To alleviate this, we propose a novel iterative spatial mask-refining strategy IterMask2. We iteratively mask areas of the image, reconstruct them, and update the mask based on reconstruction error. This iterative process progressively adds information about areas that are confidently normal as per the model. The increasing content guides reconstruction of nearby masked areas, improving reconstruction of normal tissue under these areas, reducing false positives. We also use high-frequency image content as an auxiliary input to provide additional structural information for masked areas. This further improves reconstruction error of normal in comparison to anomalous areas, facilitating segmentation of the latter. We conduct experiments on several brain lesion datasets and demonstrate effectiveness of our method. Code is available at: https://github.com/ZiyunLiang/IterMasks2</description>

      <title>Inpainting Pathology in Lumbar Spine MRI with Latent Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Data driven models for automated diagnosis in radiology suffer from insufficient and imbalanced datasets due to low representation of pathology in a population and the cost of expert annotations. Datasets can be bolstered through data augmentation. However, even when utilizing a full suite of transformations during model training, typical data augmentations do not address variations in human anatomy. An alternative direction is to synthesize data using generative models, which can potentially craft datasets with specific attributes. While this holds promise, commonly used generative models such as Generative Adversarial Networks may inadvertently produce anatomically inaccurate features. On the other hand, diffusion models, which offer greater stability, tend to memorize training data, raising concerns about privacy and generative diversity. Alternatively, inpainting has the potential to augment data through directly inserting pathology in medical images. However, this approach introduces a new challenge: accurately merging the generated pathological features with the surrounding anatomical context. While inpainting is a well established method for addressing simple lesions, its application to pathologies that involve complex structural changes remains relatively unexplored. We propose an efficient method for inpainting pathological features onto healthy anatomy in MRI through voxelwise noise scheduling in a latent diffusion model. We evaluate the method's ability to insert disc herniation and central canal stenosis in lumbar spine sagittal T2 MRI, and it achieves superior Frechet Inception Distance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>Fairness Evolution in Continual Learning for Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep Learning (DL) has made significant strides in various medical applications in recent years, achieving remarkable results. In the field of medical imaging, DL models can assist doctors in disease diagnosis by classifying pathologies in Chest X-ray images. However, training on new data to expand model capabilities and adapt to distribution shifts is a notable challenge these models face. Continual Learning (CL) has emerged as a solution to this challenge, enabling models to adapt to new data while retaining knowledge gained from previous experiences. Previous studies have analyzed the behavior of CL strategies in medical imaging regarding classification performance. However, when considering models that interact with sensitive information, such as in the medical domain, it is imperative to disaggregate the performance of socially salient groups. Indeed, DL algorithms can exhibit biases against certain sub-populations, leading to discrepancies in predictive performance across different groups identified by sensitive attributes such as age, race/ethnicity, sex/gender, and socioeconomic status. In this study, we go beyond the typical assessment of classification performance in CL and study bias evolution over successive tasks with domain-specific fairness metrics. Specifically, we evaluate the CL strategies using the well-known CheXpert (CXP) and ChestX-ray14 (NIH) datasets. We consider a class incremental scenario of five tasks with 12 pathologies. We evaluate the Replay, Learning without Forgetting (LwF), LwF Replay, and Pseudo-Label strategies. LwF and Pseudo-Label exhibit optimal classification performance, but when including fairness metrics in the evaluation, it is clear that Pseudo-Label is less biased. For this reason, this strategy should be preferred when considering real-world scenarios in which it is crucial to consider the fairness of the model.</description>

      <title>ReLUs Are Sufficient for Learning Implicit Neural Representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the growing theoretical understanding of neural networks that employ the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) as their activation function, we revisit the use of ReLU activation functions for learning implicit neural representations (INRs). Inspired by second order B-spline wavelets, we incorporate a set of simple constraints to the ReLU neurons in each layer of a deep neural network (DNN) to remedy the spectral bias. This in turn enables its use for various INR tasks. Empirically, we demonstrate that, contrary to popular belief, one can learn state-of-the-art INRs based on a DNN composed of only ReLU neurons. Next, by leveraging recent theoretical works which characterize the kinds of functions ReLU neural networks learn, we provide a way to quantify the regularity of the learned function. This offers a principled approach to selecting the hyperparameters in INR architectures. We substantiate our claims through experiments in signal representation, super resolution, and computed tomography, demonstrating the versatility and effectiveness of our method. The code for all experiments can be found at https://github.com/joeshenouda/relu-inrs.</description>

      <title>Enhancing predictive imaging biomarker discovery through treatment effect analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.02534v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Identifying predictive biomarkers, which forecast individual treatment effectiveness, is crucial for personalized medicine and informs decision-making across diverse disciplines. These biomarkers are extracted from pre-treatment data, often within randomized controlled trials, and have to be distinguished from prognostic biomarkers, which are independent of treatment assignment. Our study focuses on the discovery of predictive imaging biomarkers, aiming to leverage pre-treatment images to unveil new causal relationships. Previous approaches relied on labor-intensive handcrafted or manually derived features, which may introduce biases. In response, we present a new task of discovering predictive imaging biomarkers directly from the pre-treatment images to learn relevant image features. We propose an evaluation protocol for this task to assess a model's ability to identify predictive imaging biomarkers and differentiate them from prognostic ones. It employs statistical testing and a comprehensive analysis of image feature attribution. We explore the suitability of deep learning models originally designed for estimating the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) for this task, which previously have been primarily assessed for the precision of CATE estimation, overlooking the evaluation of imaging biomarker discovery. Our proof-of-concept analysis demonstrates promising results in discovering and validating predictive imaging biomarkers from synthetic outcomes and real-world image datasets.</description>

      <title>QuST: QuPath Extension for Integrative Whole Slide Image and Spatial Transcriptomics Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, various technologies have been introduced into digital pathology, including artificial intelligence (AI) driven methods, in both areas of pathological whole slide image (WSI) analysis and spatial transcriptomics (ST) analysis. AI-driven WSI analysis utilizes the power of deep learning (DL), expands the field of view for histopathological image analysis. On the other hand, ST bridges the gap between tissue spatial analysis and biological signals, offering the possibility to understand the spatial biology. However, a major bottleneck in DL-based WSI analysis is the preparation of training patterns, as hematoxylin \&amp; eosin (H\&amp;E) staining does not provide direct biological evidence, such as gene expression, for determining the category of a biological component. On the other hand, as of now, the resolution in ST is far beyond that of WSI, resulting the challenge of further spatial analysis. Although various WSI analysis tools, including QuPath, have cited the use of WSI analysis tools in the context of ST analysis, its usage is primarily focused on initial image analysis, with other tools being utilized for more detailed transcriptomic analysis. As a result, the information hidden beneath WSI has not yet been fully utilized to support ST analysis.
  To bridge this gap, we introduce QuST, a QuPath extension designed to bridge the gap between H\&amp;E WSI and ST analyzing tasks. In this paper, we highlight the importance of integrating DL-based WSI analysis and ST analysis in understanding disease biology and the challenges in integrating these modalities due to differences in data formats and analytical methods. The QuST source code is hosted on GitHub and documentation is available at https://github.com/huangch/qust.</description>

      <title>DDGS-CT: Direction-Disentangled Gaussian Splatting for Realistic Volume Rendering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.02518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digitally reconstructed radiographs (DRRs) are simulated 2D X-ray images generated from 3D CT volumes, widely used in preoperative settings but limited in intraoperative applications due to computational bottlenecks, especially for accurate but heavy physics-based Monte Carlo methods. While analytical DRR renderers offer greater efficiency, they overlook anisotropic X-ray image formation phenomena, such as Compton scattering. We present a novel approach that marries realistic physics-inspired X-ray simulation with efficient, differentiable DRR generation using 3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS). Our direction-disentangled 3DGS (DDGS) method separates the radiosity contribution into isotropic and direction-dependent components, approximating complex anisotropic interactions without intricate runtime simulations. Additionally, we adapt the 3DGS initialization to account for tomography data properties, enhancing accuracy and efficiency. Our method outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in image accuracy. Furthermore, our DDGS shows promise for intraoperative applications and inverse problems such as pose registration, delivering superior registration accuracy and runtime performance compared to analytical DRR methods.</description>

      <title>Towards Arbitrary-Scale Histopathology Image Super-resolution: An Efficient Dual-branch Framework via Implicit Self-texture Enhancement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-quality whole-slide scanners are expensive, complex, and time-consuming, thus limiting the acquisition and utilization of high-resolution pathology whole-slide images in daily clinical work. Deep learning-based single-image super-resolution techniques are an effective way to solve this problem by synthesizing high-resolution images from low-resolution ones. However, the existing super-resolution models applied in pathology images can only work in fixed integer magnifications, significantly decreasing their applicability. Though methods based on implicit neural representation have shown promising results in arbitrary-scale super-resolution of natural images, applying them directly to pathology images is inadequate because they have unique fine-grained image textures different from natural images. Thus, we propose an Implicit Self-Texture Enhancement-based dual-branch framework (ISTE) for arbitrary-scale super-resolution of pathology images to address this challenge. ISTE contains a pixel learning branch and a texture learning branch, which first learn pixel features and texture features, respectively. Then, we design a two-stage texture enhancement strategy to fuse the features from the two branches to obtain the super-resolution results, where the first stage is feature-based texture enhancement, and the second stage is spatial-domain-based texture enhancement. Extensive experiments on three public datasets show that ISTE outperforms existing fixed-scale and arbitrary-scale algorithms at multiple magnifications and helps to improve downstream task performance. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to achieve arbitrary-scale super-resolution in pathology images. Codes will be available.</description>

      <title>Fast Decision Boundary based Out-of-Distribution Detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11536v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient and effective Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is essential for the safe deployment of AI systems. Existing feature space methods, while effective, often incur significant computational overhead due to their reliance on auxiliary models built from training features. In this paper, we propose a computationally-efficient OOD detector without using auxiliary models while still leveraging the rich information embedded in the feature space. Specifically, we detect OOD samples based on their feature distances to decision boundaries. To minimize computational cost, we introduce an efficient closed-form estimation, analytically proven to tightly lower bound the distance. Based on our estimation, we discover that In-Distribution (ID) features tend to be further from decision boundaries than OOD features. Additionally, ID and OOD samples are better separated when compared at equal deviation levels from the mean of training features. By regularizing the distances to decision boundaries based on feature deviation from the mean, we develop a hyperparameter-free, auxiliary model-free OOD detector.

      <title>Dreaming of Electrical Waves: Generative Modeling of Cardiac Excitation Waves using Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.14830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.14830v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Electrical waves in the heart form rotating spiral or scroll waves during life-threatening arrhythmias such as atrial or ventricular fibrillation. The wave dynamics are typically modeled using coupled partial differential equations, which describe reaction-diffusion dynamics in excitable media. More recently, data-driven generative modeling has emerged as an alternative to generate spatio-temporal patterns in physical and biological systems. Here, we explore denoising diffusion probabilistic models for the generative modeling of electrical wave patterns in cardiac tissue. We trained diffusion models with simulated electrical wave patterns to be able to generate such wave patterns in unconditional and conditional generation tasks. For instance, we explored the diffusion-based i) parameter-specific generation, ii) evolution and iii) inpainting of spiral wave dynamics, including reconstructing three-dimensional scroll wave dynamics from superficial two-dimensional measurements. Further, we generated arbitrarily shaped bi-ventricular geometries and simultaneously initiated scroll wave patterns inside these geometries using diffusion. We characterized and compared the diffusion-generated solutions to solutions obtained with corresponding biophysical models and found that diffusion models learn to replicate spiral and scroll waves dynamics so well that they could be used for data-driven modeling of excitation waves in cardiac tissue. For instance, an ensemble of diffusion-generated spiral wave dynamics exhibits similar self-termination statistics as the corresponding ensemble simulated with a biophysical model. However, we also found that diffusion models {produce artifacts if training data is lacking, e.g. during self-termination,} and `hallucinate' wave patterns when insufficiently constrained.</description>

      <title>Transferable and Principled Efficiency for Open-Vocabulary Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07448v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent success of pre-trained foundation vision-language models makes Open-Vocabulary Segmentation (OVS) possible. Despite the promising performance, this approach introduces heavy computational overheads for two challenges: 1) large model sizes of the backbone; 2) expensive costs during the fine-tuning. These challenges hinder this OVS strategy from being widely applicable and affordable in real-world scenarios. Although traditional methods such as model compression and efficient fine-tuning can address these challenges, they often rely on heuristics. This means that their solutions cannot be easily transferred and necessitate re-training on different models, which comes at a cost. In the context of efficient OVS, we target achieving performance that is comparable to or even better than prior OVS works based on large vision-language foundation models, by utilizing smaller models that incur lower training costs. The core strategy is to make our efficiency principled and thus seamlessly transferable from one OVS framework to others without further customization. Comprehensive experiments on diverse OVS benchmarks demonstrate our superior trade-off between segmentation accuracy and computation costs over previous works.

      <title>Long-term usage of the off-grid photovoltaic system with lithium-ion battery-based energy storage system on high mountains: A case study in Payiun Lodge on Mt. Jade in Taiwan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04225v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Energy supply on high mountains remains an open issue since grid connection is unavailable. In the past, diesel generators with lead-acid battery energy storage systems (ESSs) are applied in most cases. Recently, photovoltaic (PV) system with lithium-ion (Li-ion) battery ESS is an appropriate method for solving this problem in a greener way. In 2016, an off-grid PV system with Li-ion battery ESS has been installed in Paiyun Lodge on Mt. Jade (the highest lodge in Taiwan). After operation for more than 7 years, the aging problem of the whole electric power system becomes a critical issue for long-term usage. In this work, a method is established for analyzing the massive energy data (over 7 million rows) and estimating the health of the Li-ion battery system, such as daily operation patterns as well as C-rate, temperature, and accumulated energy distributions. The accomplished electric power improvement project dealing with the power system aging is reported. Based on the long-term usage experience, a simple cost analysis model between lead-acid and Li-ion battery systems is built, explaining that the expensive Li-ion batteries can compete with the cheap lead-acid batteries for long-term usage on high mountains. This case study provides engineers and researchers a fundamental understanding of the long-term usage of off-grid PV ESSs and engineering on high mountains.</description>

      <title>MagicBathyNet: A Multimodal Remote Sensing Dataset for Bathymetry Prediction and Pixel-based Classification in Shallow Waters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.15477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate, detailed, and high-frequent bathymetry, coupled with complex semantic content, is crucial for the undermapped shallow seabed areas facing intense climatological and anthropogenic pressures. Current methods exploiting remote sensing images to derive bathymetry or seabed classes mainly exploit non-open data. This lack of openly accessible benchmark archives prevents the wider use of deep learning methods in such applications. To address this issue, in this paper we present the MagicBathyNet, which is a benchmark dataset made up of image patches of Sentinel2, SPOT-6 and aerial imagery, bathymetry in raster format and annotations of seabed classes. MagicBathyNet is then exploited to benchmark state-of-the-art methods in learning-based bathymetry and pixel-based classification. Dataset, pre-trained weights, and code are publicly available at www.magicbathy.eu/magicbathynet.html.</description>

      <title>Looks Too Good To Be True: An Information-Theoretic Analysis of Hallucinations in Generative Restoration Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.16475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The pursuit of high perceptual quality in image restoration has driven the development of revolutionary generative models, capable of producing results often visually indistinguishable from real data. However, as their perceptual quality continues to improve, these models also exhibit a growing tendency to generate hallucinations - realistic-looking details that do not exist in the ground truth images. The presence of hallucinations introduces uncertainty regarding the reliability of the models' predictions, raising major concerns about their practical application. In this paper, we employ information-theory tools to investigate this phenomenon, revealing a fundamental tradeoff between uncertainty and perception. We rigorously analyze the relationship between these two factors, proving that the global minimal uncertainty in generative models grows in tandem with perception. In particular, we define the inherent uncertainty of the restoration problem and show that attaining perfect perceptual quality entails at least twice this uncertainty. Additionally, we establish a relation between mean squared-error distortion, uncertainty and perception, through which we prove the aforementioned uncertainly-perception tradeoff induces the well-known perception-distortion tradeoff. This work uncovers fundamental limitations of generative models in achieving both high perceptual quality and reliable predictions for image restoration. We demonstrate our theoretical findings through an analysis of single image super-resolution algorithms. Our work aims to raise awareness among practitioners about this inherent tradeoff, empowering them to make informed decisions and potentially prioritize safety over perceptual performance.</description>

      <title>An Image Segmentation Model with Transformed Total Variation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00571</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00571v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on transformed $\ell_1$ regularization, transformed total variation (TTV) has robust image recovery that is competitive with other nonconvex total variation (TV) regularizers, such as TV$^p$, $0&lt;p&lt;1$. Inspired by its performance, we propose a TTV-regularized Mumford--Shah model with fuzzy membership function for image segmentation. To solve it, we design an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) algorithm that utilizes the transformed $\ell_1$ proximal operator. Numerical experiments demonstrate that using TTV is more effective than classical TV and other nonconvex TV variants in image segmentation.</description>
