      <title>Simulation of single diffraction dissociation in resonance region at LHC energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A comprehensive review of the single diffraction dissociation duality-based model at low missing masses have been presented. The distinguishing feature of the model is the nonlinear Regge proton trajectory used to account for the resonances contributions to the cross-sections. It helps classify and understand the spectrum of excited states of proton and their decays, providing insights into the internal structure and dynamics of particles. The behavior of the differential cross-section in the resonance region at small missing masses $M_x$ is investiaged. The model parameters are refined in the light of new experimental data.</description>

      <title>Solar Model Independent Constraints on the Sterile Neutrino Interpretation of the Gallium Anomaly</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16840v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a global analysis of most up-to-date solar neutrino data and KamLAND reactor antineutrino data in the framework of the 3+1 sterile neutrino mixing scenario (invoked to explain the results of the Gallium source experiments) with the aim of quantifying the dependence of the (in)compatibility of the required mixing with assumptions on the initial fluxes. The analysis of solar data is performed in two alternative ways: using the flux predicted by the latest standard solar models, and in a model independent approach where the solar fluxes are also determined by the fit. The dependence on the normalization of the capture rate in the solar Gallium experiments is also quantified. Similarly, in the KamLAND analysis we consider both the case where the reactor flux normalization is assumed to be known \textit{a priori}, as well as a normalization free case which relies solely on available neutrino data. Using a parameter goodness of fit test, we find that in most cases the compatibility between Gallium and solar+KamLAND data only occur at the $3\sigma$ level or higher. We also discuss the implications of enforcing better compatibility by tweaking the mechanism for the energy production in the Sun.</description>

      <title>Tidal Resonance in Binary Neutron Star Inspirals: A High-Precision Study in Numerical Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16850</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16850v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the tidal resonance of the fundamental ($f$-)mode in spinning neutron stars, robustly tracing the onset of the excitation to its saturation, using numerical relativity for the first time. We performed long-term ($\approx15$~orbits) fully relativistic simulations of a merger of two highly and retrogradely spinning neutron stars. The resonance window of the $f$-mode is extended by self-interaction, and the nonlinear resonance continues up to the final plunging phase. We observe that the quasi-circular orbit is maintained throughout since the dissipation of orbit motion due to the resonance is coherent with that due to gravitational waves. The $f$-mode resonance causes a variation in the stellar spin of $\gtrsim6.3\%$ in the linear regime and much more as $\sim33\%$ during the later nonlinear regime. At the merger, a phase shift of $\lesssim40$~radians is rendered in the gravitational waveform as a consequence of the angular momentum and energy transfers into the neutron star oscillations.</description>

      <title>Constraining neutrino charges at beam experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16859v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new method to constrain neutrino charges at neutrino beam experiments. Uncharged in the Standard Model, evidence for a neutrino electric charge would be a smoking gun for new physics, shedding light on the Dirac or Majorana nature of neutrinos, and giving insight into the origin of charge quantisation. We find that using the most sensitive magnetometers available, existing beam experiments could constrain neutrino charges $|q_{\nu}| \lesssim 10^{-12}$, in units of the electron charge, whilst future upgrades could strengthen these bounds significantly. We also discuss electromagnetic dipole moments and show that our proposal is highly sensitive to new long-range forces.</description>

      <title>Comparable Dark Matter and Baryon energy densities from Dark Grand Unification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a theory of $SU(9)$ dark grand unification, where dark matter consists of asymmetric dark baryons from the $Sp(4)_D$ dark QCD sector. By unifying the dark color gauge group with the Standard Model gauge group, the asymmetry generation in both sectors originates from a common process that preserves a $U(1)_{D-(B-L)}$ symmetry, resulting in comparable number densities. Furthermore, thanks to dark grand unification, the $Sp(4)_D$ dark QCD sector shares a similar matter content with the QCD sector, leading to comparable running of the gauge couplings from the scale as high as $10^{15}$ GeV. This predicts a dark color confinement scale and thus dark baryon masses around the GeV scale, comparable to visible baryon masses. Together with the similar number densities, the model provides a natural explanation for the observed ratio between the energy densities of dark matter and baryon, $\rho_D/\rho_B\approx 5$. The model also features some novel phenomenology, including a flavored dark sector with chimera dark baryons and GeV-scale dark $\rho$ mesons.</description>

      <title>Exploring soft anomalous dimensions for $1/Q$ power corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we study, via analytical methods, $1/Q$ non-perturbative power corrections to event shape mean values, addressing in particular the question of their interplay with soft perturbative emissions. Specifically we point out that energy-ordered soft perturbative emissions that precede a non-perturbative emission, give rise to terms of the form $\frac{1}{Q} \left (\alpha_s \ln \frac{Q}{\Lambda} \right)^n$. While such terms are formally higher order in the strong coupling, their form suggests that they can numerically compete with the leading $1/Q$ term while also modifying the $Q$ dependence of the result. The resummation of such power-suppressed but logarithmically enhanced terms lends an anomalous dimension to the leading $1/Q$ power correction. In order to argue for the presence of such an anomalous dimension, we formulate a method to compute the first order in $\alpha_s$ correction for the mean values of the thrust $1-T$ and $C$-parameter observables. We comment on our findings in light of the standard picture of universality of $1/Q$ power corrections for event shape variables and implications for phenomenology.</description>

      <title>A New Herwig7 Underlying Event Tune: from RHIC to LHC Energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16897v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present parameter sets corresponding to new underlying event tunes for the Herwig7.3 Monte Carlo event generator. The existing Herwig tunes are in good agreement with LHC data, however, they are not typically designed for center-of-mass energies below $\sqrt{s}=300$ GeV. The tunes presented in this study can describe mid-rapidity data collected at the nominal RHIC energy of $\sqrt{s }=200$ GeV, as well as higher center-of-mass energies utilized by experiments elsewhere, such as the LHC. The base "New Haven" tune is developed by fitting minimum-bias simulations of proton-proton collisions to mid-rapidity identified hadron and jet data from the STAR experiment. The "Nashville" tune includes a separate set of parameters developed by tuning to Tevatron proton-antiproton data at $\sqrt{s}=300$, $900$ and $1960$ GeV from CDF, and LHC proton-proton measurements from CMS at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV, in addition to the STAR measurements. Both new tunes demonstrate significant improvements over the recommended default tune currently included in the latest version of Herwig for minimum bias production. As such, we advocate using these tunes for future simulation studies at mid-rapidity by the experimental collaborations at RHIC (STAR and sPHENIX) and the LHC (ATLAS, ALICE, CMS).</description>

      <title>The pole inflation from non-compact isometry in Weyl gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16944v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose the microscopic origin of the pole inflation from the scalar fields of non-compact isometry in Weyl gravity. We show that the $SO(1,N)$ isometry in the field space in combination with the Weyl symmetry relates the form of the non-minimal couplings to the one of the potential in the Jordan frame, as required for the pole inflation. In the presence of an explicit breaking of the $SO(1,N)$ symmetry in the coefficient of the potential, we realize the pole inflation near the pole of the inflaton kinetic term. Applying the general form of the Weyl invariant Lagrangian to both the Higgs pole inflation and the PQ pole inflation, we find that there is one parameter family of the solutions for the pole inflation, depending on the overall coefficient of the Weyl covariant derivatives for scalar fields. The same coefficient not only makes the predictions of the pole inflation varying, being compatible with the Planck data, but also determines the mass of the Weyl gauge field. We also show that the isocurvature perturbations of the axion can be suppressed sufficiently in the case of the PQ pole inflation, due to a large effective axion decay constant during inflation.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Explosions as Probes of New Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The final stage of black hole evaporation is a potent probe of physics beyond the Standard Model: Hawking-Bekenstein radiation may be affected by quantum gravity "memory burden effects", or by the presence of "dark", beyond-the-Standard-Model degrees of freedom in ways that are testable with high-energy gamma-ray observations. We argue that information on either scenario can best be inferred from measurements of the evaporation's lightcurve and by correlating observations at complementary energies. We offer several new analytical insights in how such observations map on the fundamental properties of the evaporating black holes and of the possible exotic particles they can evaporate into.</description>

      <title>Non-extensive Hard Thermal Loop Resummation and Its Applications: Analysis in Zero and Finite Magnetic Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of non-extensive statistics on the hard thermal loop (HTL) resummation technique is investigated, in the absence and presence of a magnetic field. By utilizing the non-extensive bare propagators in real-time formalism of finite temperature field theory, we determine the non-extensive deformations of both HTL gluon self-energies and resummed gluon propagators at the one-loop order. We observe that the introduction of non-extensivity results in distinct shifts in the Debye masses for the retarded and symmetric gluon self-energies. Applying the non-extensive modified resummed gluon propagators to the dielectric permittivity of a quark-gluon plasma, we compute the static heavy quark potential, which incorporates both short-range Yukawa and long-range string-like interactions between heavy quarks and the QGP medium. The real part of the potential exhibits increased screening as the non-extensive parameter $q$ ($q \geq 1$) increases, resulting in a reduction of binding energies for heavy quarkonia. Notably, at a fixed separation distance, the slope of the real part of the potential with respect to $q$ is steeper in the pure thermal case than in the presence of a magnetic field. Furthermore, including non-extensivity enhances the magnitude of the imaginary part of the potential, suggesting a broadening of the decay widths for heavy quarkonia. Based on these observations, we estimate the melting temperatures of heavy quarkonia. Our results indicate that non-extensivity significantly reduces the melting temperatures of heavy quarkonia, leading to their earlier dissociation, whereas the magnetic field tends to mitigate this dissociation process.</description>

      <title>Determination of the binding and $KD$ probability of the $D^{*}_{s0}(2317)$ from the $(\bar{D}\bar K)^-$ mass distributions in $\Lambda_{b}\to \Lambda_{c} (\bar{D}\bar K)^-$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $\Lambda_{b}\to\Lambda_{c}\bar{D}^{0}K^{-}$ and $\Lambda_{b}\to \Lambda_{c}D^{-}\bar{K}^{0}$ reactions which proceed via a Cabibbo and $N_c$ favored process of external emission, and we determine the $\bar{D}^{0}K^{-}$ and $D^{-}\bar{K}^{0}$ mass distributions close to the $\bar{D} \bar{K}$ threshold. For this, we use the tree level contribution plus the rescattering of the meson-meson components, using the extension of the local hidden gauge approach to the charm sector that produces the $D^*_{s0}(2317)$ resonance. We observe a large enhancement of the mass distributions close to threshold due to the presence of this resonance below threshold. Next we undertake the inverse problem of extracting the maximum information on the interaction of the $\bar{D} \bar{K}$ channels from these distributions, and using the resampling method we find that from these data one can obtain precise values of the scattering lengths and effective ranges, the existence of an $I=0$ bound state with a precision of about $4 \;\rm MeV$ in the mass, plus the $\bar{D} \bar{K}$ molecular probability of this state with reasonable precision. Given the fact that the $\Lambda_{b}\to\Lambda_{c}\bar{D}^{0}K^{-}$ reaction is already measured by the LHCb collaboration, it is expected that in the next runs with more statistics of the reaction, these mass distributions can be measured with precision and the method proposed here can be used to determine the nature of the $D^*_{s0}(2317)$, which is still an issue of debate.</description>

      <title>Effect of chiral imbalance on the electrical conductivity of hot and dense quark matter using Green-Kubo Method within the 2-flavour gauged NJL model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electrical conductivity of hot and dense quark matter is calculated using the 2-flavour gauged Nambu-Jona--Lasinio (NJL) model in the presence of a chiral imbalance quantified in terms of a chiral chemical potential (CCP). To this end, the in-medium spectral function corresponding to the vector current correlator is evaluated employing the real time formulation of finite temperature field theory. Taking the long wavelength limit of the spectral function we extract the electrical conductivity using the Green-Kubo relation. The thermal widths of the quarks/antiquarks that appear in the expression of electrical conductivity are calculated by considering the $2\to2$ scattering in the NJL model. The scattering amplitudes containing the polarization functions of the mesonic modes in the scalar and pseudoscalar channels are also evaluated by considering finite value of CCP. We find that the ratio of electrical conductivity to temperature has significant dependence on CCP especially in the low temperature region.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetic radiation from scalar and axion fields: distinguishability and detectability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the characteristics of electromagnetic (EM) radiation associated with scalar and axion field oscillations in different background field setups. Because the scalar field and axion field have different parity and couple with the EM field in different forms, the EM signals generated by the scalar and axion can be used to distinguish them. More interestingly, resonance effects amplify the difference between the two fields and consequent EM signal strength, which helps us distinguish and detect them in future observations.</description>

      <title>$B_{(s)} \to S(a_0(1450), K_0^*(1430), f_0(1500))$ helicity form factors within the QCD light-cone sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17228v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the helicity form factors (HFFs) of the $B_{(s)}$-meson decay into a scalar meson with a mass larger than 1~GeV, {\it i.e.,} $B \to a_0(1450)$, $B_{(s)} \to K_0^*(1430)$ and $B_{s} \to f_0(1500)$ by using light-cone sum rules approach. We take the standard currents for correlation functions. To enhance the precision of our calculations, we incorporate the next-to-leading order (NLO) corrections and retain the scalar meson twist-3 light-cone distribution amplitudes. Furthermore, we extend the HFFs to the entire physical $q^2$ region employing a simplified $z$-series expansion. At the point of $q^2=1\rm{~GeV^2}$, all NLO contributions to the HFFs are negative, with the maximum contribution around $25\%$. Then, as applications of these HFFs, we analyze the differential decay widths, branching ratios, and lepton polarization asymmetries for the semi-leptonic $B_{(s)} \to S \ell \bar{\nu}_\ell$, FCNC $B_{(s)} \to S \ell \bar{\ell}$ and rare $B_{(s)} \to S \nu \bar{\nu}$ decays. Our results are consistent with existing studies within uncertainties. The current data still suffer from large uncertainties and need to be measured more precisely, which can lead to a better understanding of the fundamental properties of light scalar mesons.</description>

      <title>Missing matter in galaxies as a neutrino mixing effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that, in the framework of quantum field theory in curved spacetime, the semiclassical energy-momentum tensor of the neutrino flavor vacuum fulfills the equation of state of dust and cold dark matter. We consider spherically symmetric spacetimes, and we demonstrate that, within the weak field approximation, the flavor vacuum contributes as a Yukawa correction to the Newtonian potential. This corrected potential may account for the flat rotation curves of spiral galaxies. In this perspective, neutrino mixing could contribute to dark matter</description>

      <title>Using $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ to constrain preferred axion model dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preferred axion models are minimal realizations of the Peccei-Quinn solution to the strong CP problem while providing a dark matter candidate. These models invoke new heavy quarks that interact strongly with the Standard Model bringing them into thermal equilibrium in the early Universe. We show that for a number of these models, the heavy quarks will decay after axions have decoupled from the Standard Model thermal bath. As a consequence, any axion products in the decay form a component of dark radiation. This provides the potential to differentiate between preferred axion models through measurements of the number of relativistic degrees of freedom. The most sensitive of which comes from the Planck collaboration's measurements of the Cosmic Microwave Background. We find that existing constraints allow us to rule out regions of parameter space for 40% of preferred axion models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gauge singlet right-handed neutrinos are one of the essential fields in neutrino mass models that explain tiny masses of active neutrinos. We consider the effective field theory of the Standard Model extended with these fields under the assumption that neutrinos are Dirac particles. In this framework, we provide a comprehensive study for the phenomenological consequences of various dimension six interactions employing various high and low energy observables such as the $pp\to\ell^\pm+\not{E}_T$, $pp\to j+\not{E}_T$, decays of proton, meson, tau and top, as well as the cosmological parameter $N_{\rm eff}$.</description>

      <title>Dissociation and regeneration of charmonia within microscopic Langevin simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a classical model to study the formation of charmonia, as well as dissociation and regeneration processes of heavy-quark bound states in the quark gluon plasma using Langevin simulations. The charm and anticharm quarks are described as Brownian particles in the background medium of light quarks and gluons and interact among them over a Coulomb-like screened potential to form bound states, which can dissociate again due to interactions with the medium. Box simulations at fixed temperature and volume are used to verify that the system reaches the expected thermal distribution in the equilibrium limit and to test bound state properties. The medium evolution is then parametrized by a boost-invariant fireball. In this configuration, the elliptic flow of charm and anticharm quarks as well as of charmonia is studied at RHIC and LHC energies.</description>

      <title>Impact of Scalar NSI on Spatial and Temporal Correlations in Neutrino Oscillations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutrino oscillation experiments are gradually approaching an era of precision, where subleading effects can also be tested. One such subleading effect is Non-Standard Interactions (NSI), which can play a crucial role in neutrino oscillations. Various works have typically discussed vector NSI in the context of quantum correlations. Recently, there have been improvements in the bounds on scalar NSI as well. In light of these developments, we aim to examine the impact of scalar NSI on quantum correlation measures. To analyze this impact, we are considering the strongest measure of quantum correlation, i.e., non-locality. Our study will encompass both spatial and temporal non-locality measures.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-scalar Higgs decay to three parton amplitudes at NNLO to higher orders in dimensional regulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17611v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present for the first time the second-order corrections of pseudo-scalar($A$) Higgs decay to three parton to higher orders in the dimensional regulator. We compute the one and two-loop amplitudes for processes, $A\to ggg$ and $A\to q\bar{q}g$ in the effective theory framework. With suitable crossing of the external momenta, these calculations are well-suited for predicting the differential distribution of pseudo-scalar Higgs in association with a jet at hadron colliders, up to next-to-next-to-leading order (NNLO) in the strong coupling constant. These results expanded to higher orders in dimensional regulator will contribute to the full three loop cross section. We implement the finite pieces of the amplitudes in a numerical code which can be used with any Monte Carlo phase space generator.</description>

      <title>Chiral-odd generalized parton distributions in the large-$N_{c}$ limit of QCD: Spin-flavor structure, polynomiality, sum rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17634v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the nonperturbative properties of the nucleon's chiral-odd generalized parton distributions (transversity GPDs) in the large-$N_c$ limit of QCD. This includes the parametric ordering of the spin-flavor components, the polynomiality property of the moments, and the sum rules connecting the GPDs with the tensor form factors. A multipole expansion in the transverse momentum transfer is used to enumerate and interpret the structures in the nucleon matrix element of the chiral-odd partonic operator, including monopole, dipole and quadrupole terms. The $1/N_c$ expansion of the GPDs is performed using the abstract mean-field picture of baryons in the large-$N_c$ limit and its symmetries. We derive a large-$N_c$ relation between the flavor-nonsinglet GPDs $E_T^{u-d}$ and $\tilde H_T^{u-d}$ and test it with recent lattice QCD results. We show that the polynomiality property and sum rules of the GPDs are fulfilled with the restricted realization of translational and rotational invariance in the mean-field picture. The results provide a basis for the phenomenological analysis of chiral-odd GPDs and hard exclusive processes in the large-$N_c$ limit, and for calculations in specific dynamical models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.16604v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solitons in relativistic field theories are not necessarily topologically charged. In particular, non-topological solitons -- known as Q-balls -- arise naturally in nonlinear field theories endowed with attractive interactions and internal symmetries. Even without stabilizing internal symmetries, quasi-solitons known as oscillons, which are long-lived, can also exist. Both Q-balls and oscillons have significant applications in cosmology and particle physics. This review is an updated account of the intriguing properties and dynamics of these non-topological solitons and quasi-solitons, as well as their important roles in early-universe scenarios and particle physics models.</description>

      <title>Symmetries in high-temperature lattice QCD with (u, d, s, c, b) optimal domain-wall quarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spatial $z$-correlators of meson operators in $N_f=2+1+1+1$ lattice QCD with optimal domain-wall quarks are studied for eight temperatures in the range of 325-3250 MeV. The meson operators include a complete set of Dirac bilinears (scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial vector, tensor vector, and axial-tensor vector), and each for ten flavor combinations ($\bar u d$, $\bar u s$, $\bar s s$, $\bar u c$, $\bar s c$, $\bar u b$, $\bar s b$, $\bar c c$, $\bar c b$, $\bar b b$). We first observe the hierarchical restoration of chiral symmetry in QCD with $(u, d, s, c, b)$ quarks, from $SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R \times U(1)_A $ to $SU(3)_L \times SU(3)_R \times U(1)_A $, then to $SU(4)_L \times SU(4)_R \times U(1)_A $, and finally to $SU(5)_L \times SU(5)_R \times U(1)_A $, as the temperature is increased successively. Moreover, we study the emergence of the $SU(2)_{CS}$ chiral-spin symmetry, and compare the temperature windows for light and heavy vector mesons, and find that the temperature windows are dominated by the vector mesons of $\bar u b$ and $\bar s b$.</description>

      <title>Inflation with an Anomalyon and Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study inflation in a recently proposed gravitational effective field theory describing the trace anomaly. The theory requires an additional scalar which is massless in the early universe. This scalar -- referenced as an anomalyon -- couples to the familiar matter and radiation through the gauge field trace anomaly. We derive a class of cosmological solutions that deviate from the standard inflationary ones only slightly, in spite of the fact that the anomalyon has a sizable time dependent background. On the other hand, the scalar cosmological perturbations in this theory are different from the conventional inflationary perturbations. The inflaton and anomalyon perturbations mix, and one of the diagonal combinations gives the standard nearly scale-invariant adiabatic spectrum, while the other combination has a blue power spectrum at short distance scales. We argue that this blue spectrum can lead to the formation of primordial black holes (PBHs) at distance scales much shorter than the ones tested in CMB observations. The resulting PBHs can be heavy enough to survive to the present day universe. For natural values of the parameters involved the PBHs would constitute only a tiny fraction of the dark matter, but with fine-tunings perhaps all of dark matter could be accounted by them. We also show that the theory predicts primordial gravitational waves which are almost identical to the standard inflationary ones.</description>

      <title>Tensor global symmetries and the Stueckelberg mechanism for tensor fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the concept of tensor global symmetries, featuring conserved currents of mixed symmetry and higher spin Nambu-Goldstone bosons. We develop a Stueckelberg mechanism for mixed symmetry tensor fields at the linearized level, focusing on the massive graviton, the massive $(2,1)$ Curtright field and the massive $(2,2)$ field. Counting degrees of freedom, we identify the set of fields that necessarily appear in the gauge invariant Stueckelberg action in each case. These fields transform under shift symmetries and they are a vector and a scalar in the first case, a graviton, a Kalb-Ramond field and a vector in the second case and a Curtright field and a graviton in the third case. The analysis results in gauge invariant and fully conserved currents of mixed symmetry for the corresponding gauge theories, which are linked to their tensor global symmetries and they can be minimally coupled to suitable background fields. Viewing the graviton and the Kalb-Ramond field as Nambu-Goldstone bosons for constant symmetric and antisymmetric shift symmetries, we use a nonminimal coupling to uncover a 't Hooft anomaly in linearized gravity.</description>

      <title>Off-shell minimal form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16941v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study off-shell n-particle form factors of half-BPS operators built from n complex scalar fields at the two-loop order in the planar maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (sYM). These are known as minimal form factors. We construct their representation as a sum of independent scalar Feynman integrals relying on two complementary techniques. First, by going to the Coulomb branch of the theory by employing the spontaneous symmetry breaking which induces masses, but only for external particles while retaining masslessness for virtual states propagating in quantum loops. For a low number of external legs, this entails an uplift of massless integrands to their massive counterparts. Second, utilizing the N=1 superspace formulation of the N=4 sYM and performing algebra of covariant derivatives off-shell. Both techniques provide identical results. These form factors are then studied in the near-mass-shell limit with the off-shellness regularizing emerging infrared divergences. We observe their exponentiation and confirm the octagon anomalous dimension, not the cusp, as the coefficient of the Sudakov double logarithmic behavior. By subtracting these singularities and defining a finite remainder, we verified that its symbol is identical to the one found a decade ago in the conformal case. Beyond-the-symbol contributions are different in the two cases, however.</description>

      <title>Black Holes from Fermi Ball Collapse</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fermi balls are non-topological solitons that can naturally form in an early universe containing a dark sector with heavy fermions and an attractive interaction mediated by a light scalar field. We compute the Fermi ball mass and radius scaling relations when the potential of the scalar field $\varphi$ has a non-negligible quartic coupling $\lambda\varphi^4$. The resulting Fermi balls reach `saturation' very rapidly, even when their radius is much smaller than the effective Yukawa force range. These objects can therefore grow by mergers or by accretion of ambient dark fermions, until they become so dense that they fall within their Schwarzschild radius and collapse to black holes. This setup, therefore, provides an example of a rather natural and economical dark sector scenario for the formation of primordial black holes.</description>

      <title>Analytical modeling of the one-dimensional power spectrum of 21-cm forest based on a halo model method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 21-cm forest, composed of spectral absorption features from high-redshift background radio sources, provides a unique probe for studying small-scale structures during the epoch of reionization. It is particularly sensitive to detecting small-scale structures and early heating processes. Despite the rich information contained in the 21-cm forest signal, the complexity of directly modeling the signal has led to a lack of effective analytical models. However, the one-dimensional (1D) power spectrum of the 21-cm forest contains valuable information about the matter power spectrum, making analytical modeling feasible. This work employs an analytical modeling approach based on the halo model, which links the distribution of matter to dark matter halos, allowing for effective predictions of cosmic structure formation and its impact on the 21-cm signal. By considering various parameter scenarios within the halo model framework, particularly different dark matter particle masses and varying levels of cosmic heating, we can capture the complexities of small-scale structures and make the 1D power spectrum modeling applicable across a wide range of parameters. This method not only enhances our understanding of the 21-cm forest signal but also provides theoretical support for future observational data. Observing the 21-cm forest with large radio telescopes, such as the Square Kilometre Array, is anticipated to enable simultaneous exploration of dark matter properties and the heating history of the early universe.</description>

Abstract: The existence of the ultracompact object XTE J1814-338, with an inferred mass and radius of $M$ = 1.21 $\pm$ 0.05 $M_\odot$ and R = 7.0 $\pm$ 0.4 km, presents a great challenge for the theory of neutron stars. Within this context, we revisit the theory of dark-matter-admixed neutron stars and infer the physical properties of this compact object, such as the Fermi momentum of dark matter necessary to compress the star at such low radius, its equation of state, speed of sound, and some macroscopic properties, such as the inertia moment and the dimensionless tidal parameter. We also compare the physical properties of the XTE J1814-338 with other pulsars, such as the canonical 1.4 M$_\odot$, the PSR J0740 + 6620, and the HESS J1731-347.</description>

      <title>Probing vector gravitational atom with eccentric intermediate mass-ratio inspirals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.17247v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultralight bosons, proposed as candidates for dark matter, are predicted by various new physics models. In the presence of bosons with suitable masses, superradiant (SR) instability can naturally transform a spinning black hole (BH) into a gravitational atom (GA). Here we study the dynamics of intermediate mass-ratio inspirals (IMRIs) around a GA formed by ultralight vector field saturated in its SR ground state. We employ a perturbative model at the leading Newtonian order to consistently account for both the conservative effect of cloud gravity and the dissipative effect of cloud ionization. We find the cloud can make a sizable negative contribution to the secular periastron precession at binary separations comparable to the gravitational Bohr radius. Meanwhile, the backreaction of ionization could significantly accelerate the process of orbital decay and circularization. Considering reasonably small vector boson masses, we investigate the adiabatic orbital evolution and gravitational waveforms of eccentric inspirals. The results indicate that vector GAs might be detectable through observations of low-frequency IMRIs by future space-based gravitational-wave detectors, such as LISA and Taiji.</description>

      <title>Interplay of magnetic field and chemical potential induced anisotropy and frame dependent chaos of a $Q\bar{Q}$ pair in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the role of both magnetic field and chemical potential on the emergence of chaotic dynamics in the QCD confining string from the holographic principle. An earlier developed bottom-up model of Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity, which mimics QCD features quite well, is used. The qualitative information about the chaos is obtained using the Poincar\'{e} sections and Lyapunov exponents. Our results depend quite strongly on the frame we consider in the analysis. In the string frame, the chemical potential and the magnetic field suppress the chaotic dynamics in both parallel and perpendicular orientations of the string with respect to the magnetic field. Meanwhile, in the Einstein frame, the magnetic field suppresses/enhances the chaotic dynamics when the string is orientated perpendicular/parallel to the magnetic field, while the chemical potential enhances the chaotic dynamics for both orientations. We further analyse the MSS bound in the parameter space of the model and find it to be always satisfied in both frames.</description>

      <title>The general property of the tensor gravitational memory effect in theories of gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17318v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, it is shown that based on the linear analysis, as long as a theory of gravity is diffeomorphism invariant and possesses the tensor degrees of freedom propagating at a constant, isotropic speed without dispersion, its asymptotic symmetry group of an isolated system contains the (extended/generalized) Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group. The tensor gravitational wave induces the displacement, spin and center-of-mass memory effects. They depend on the asymptotic shear tensor. The displacement memory effect is the vacuum transition and parameterized by a supertranslation transformation. All of these hold even when the Lorentz symmetry is broken by a special timelike direction.</description>

Abstract: I present a recap of a fully analytical calculation of the Euclidean action for a self-interacting scalar field with a quartic potential, in the thin-wall approximation.

      <description>arXiv:2411.17609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The axion were proposed as a result to a solution to the Strong CP Problem in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) and is now considered a leading candidate for dark matter. Direct axion dark matter detection experiments are challenging due to the axion's weak interaction with electromagnetism. Recent work has suggested the possibility of an enhancement of astrophysical axion-to-photon decay through parametric resonance. We explore here the feasibility of using parametric resonance to enhance the signal in direct axion-like particle dark matter detectors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02461v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Extrapolating the Standard Model Higgs potential at high energies, we study the barrier between the electroweak and Planck scale minima. The barrier arises by taking the central values of the relevant experimental inputs, that is the strong coupling constant and the top quark and Higgs masses. We then extend the Standard Model by including a non-minimal coupling to gravity, and explore the phenomenology of the Higgs inflation model. We point out that even configurations that would be metastable in the Standard Model, become viable for inflation if the non-minimal coupling is large enough to flatten the Higgs potential at field values below the barrier; we find that the required value of the non-minimal coupling is smaller than the one needed for the conventional Higgs inflation scenario (which relies on a stable Standard Model Higgs potential, without any barrier); in addition, values of the top mass which are slightly larger than those required in the conventional scenario are allowed.</description>

      <title>Holographic Energy Correlators for Confining Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a holographic calculation of energy correlators in a simple model of confinement based on a warped extra dimension with an IR brane. For small distances we reproduce the constant correlators of a strongly-coupled conformal field theory, while for large distances the effects of confinement dominate and the correlators decay exponentially. We find exact shockwave solutions to the Einstein equations in the presence of the IR brane, hence avoiding the need for a perturbative expansion in terms of Witten diagrams. While some of the expected qualitative features of energy correlators in quantum chromodynamics (QCD) are reproduced, our crude model of confinement does not capture the effects of asymptotic freedom nor exhibit jetty behavior. We expect that our method can also be applied to more realistic models of confinement incorporating asymptotic freedom, which should fix some of the deviations from QCD.</description>

      <title>Dark sterile neutrinos on a linear seesaw of neutrino masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06223v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sterile neutrinos as source of mass and flavor mixing of active neutrinos as well as genesis of dark matter (DM) and matter-antimatter asymmetry have gained special interest. Here we study the case of the Standard Model (SM) extended with three right-handed (RH) neutrinos and a dark sector with two extra sterile neutrinos, odd under a discrete $Z_2$ symmetry. The RH neutrinos are responsible for producing baryon asymmetry via high-scale unflavored leptogenesis. They are superheavy and their abundance at the electroweak broken stage is vanishingly small, so that they have no impact on phenomenology at low energies. The two dark neutrinos generate the tiny mass of two active neutrinos through a mechanism similar to the minimal linear seesaw, and saturate the relic abundance as freeze-in DM coming mainly from decays of SM weak-gauge bosons via active-dark neutrino mixing. The absence of the dark Majorana mass terms in the dark linear seesaw is explained by invoking a hidden symmetry, the so-called presymmetry, and the DM candidate appears in the form of a quasi-Dirac neutrino. The $Z_2$ symmetry is broken in the dark neutrino sector, but exact in the realm of RH neutrinos. The required coupling weakness for the freeze-in DM neutrino is related to a very small breach of the unitarity of the active neutrino mixing matrix. We show how phenomenological constraints on the production and decay of the DM neutrino imply an upper bound around 1 MeV for its mass and unitarity up to $\mathcal{O}(10^{-7})$ for the mixing matrix.</description>

Abstract: The first model-independent sensitivity to CPT violation in the top-quark sector is extracted from ATLAS and CMS measurements of the top and antitop kinematical mass difference.

      <description>arXiv:2405.13524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the usage of equivariant neural networks in the search for violations of the charge-parity ($\textit{CP}$) symmetry in particle interactions at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. We design neural networks that take as inputs kinematic information of recorded events and that transform equivariantly under the a symmetry group related to the $\textit{CP}$ transformation. We show that this algorithm allows to define observables reflecting the properties of the $\textit{CP}$ symmetry, showcasing its performance in several reference processes in top quark and electroweak physics. Imposing equivariance as an inductive bias in the algorithm improves the numerical convergence properties with respect to other methods that do not rely on equivariance and allows to construct optimal observables that significantly improve the state-of-the-art methodology in the searches considered.</description>

Abstract: In this study, we aim to explore the potential for generating events related to dark matter (DM) in conjunction with a neutral heavy gauge boson (Z$^{\prime}$) decaying leptonically during proton-proton collisions at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). These collisions occur at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 14 TeV, with a high integrated luminosity equivalent to 1000 fb$^{-1}$. Our analysis involves interpreting the outcomes through Monte Carlo simulation of the effective field theory (EFT) framework. If no new physics is detected, we establish constraints on various parameters within the EFT context, such as the scenario cutoff scale ($\Lambda$) and the Z$^{\prime}$ mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07623v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matching conditions are universal ingredients that describe how fragmentation functions change when heavy-flavour thresholds are crossed during the factorisation scale evolution. They are the last missing piece for a consistent description of observables with identified final-state hadrons at next-to-next-to leading order accuracy in quantum chromodynamics. We present an analytical form of the matching condition for light-flavour to hadron fragmentation function at next-to-next-to leading order. The derivation is performed by extending the formalism employed in the extraction of the next-to leading order matching conditions to the subsequent order, making use of $e^+e^-$ annihilation cross sections. We obtain the first non-trivial heavy-quark effect in the light-quark fragmentation functions and provide results in Mellin space.</description>

Abstract: We present a novel simulation of a strongly interacting dark sector also known as the Hidden Valley scenarios using angular ordered showers and the cluster hadronisation model in Herwig 7. We discuss the basics of this implementation and the scale hierarchies underpinning the simulation. With the help of a few benchmarks, we show the effect of variation of dark sector parameters on thrust and angularities within the dark sector, and study correlation functions, which can be helpful for understanding the angular structure of these events. Finally we comment on the uncertainties introduced due to lack of knowledge of hadronisation parameters within the dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Inflation models with Peccei-Quinn symmetry and axion kinetic misalignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a consistent framework with the $U(1)$ Peccei-Quinn (PQ) symmetry for obtaining the initial condition for axion kinetic misalignment from inflation. We introduce a PQ complex scalar field and an extra Higgs doublet, which are conformally coupled to gravity, and three right-handed neutrinos for the seesaw mechanism. In the DFSZ type scenarios for the axion, we obtain the PQ anomalies from the Standard Model quarks carrying nonzero PQ charges in some of two Higgs doublet models, solving the strong CP problem by the QCD potential for the axion. Assuming that the PQ symmetry is explicitly violated in the scalar potential by quantum gravity effects, we show that a sufficiently large initial axion velocity can be obtained at the end inflation while avoiding the axion quality problem. As inflation is driven by the radial distance from the origin in the space of scalar fields close to the pole of the kinetic terms in the Einstein frame, we obtain successful inflationary predictions and set the initial axion velocity at the end of inflation. Focusing on the pure PQ inflation with a small running quartic coupling for the PQ field, we discuss the post-inflationary dynamics for the inflaton and the axion. As a result, we show that a sufficiently high reheating temperature, can be obtained dominantly from the Higgs-portal couplings to the PQ field, while being consistent with axion kinetic misalignment, the stability for the Higgs fields during inflation and the non-restoration of the PQ symmetry after reheating.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.01167v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The potential of the dark matter direct detection experiments to provide independent measurements on solar neutrino fluxes in the Standard Model and in the presence of the light mediators is studied in this work. We also present the sensitivity of direct detection experiments on light mediators with solar neutrinos. We find that the sensitivities on $^8$B and pp neutrino fluxes can reach $\pm10\%$ with improved backgrounds and systematic uncertainties and they can be further pushed to $\pm3\%$ with a increased exposure. The constraints on light mediators can reach $\mathcal{O}(10^{-6})$ for the masses of scalar and vector mediators below 10 MeV. However, the presence of scalar or vector mediators could lead to shifts in the best fit value of $^8$B fluxes, which will increase the challenges in the precise measurements of solar neutrino fluxes with direct detection experiments.</description>

      <title>Machine learning tagged boosted dark photon: A signature of fermionic portal matter at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use machine learning techniques to identify a boosted dark photon jet as a signature of a heavy vector-like fermionic portal matter (PM) connecting the visible and the dark sectors. In this work, the fermionic PM which mixes only with the standard model (SM) third generation up-type quark, dominantly decays to a top quark and dark photon pair. The dark photon then $promptly$ decays to a pair of standard model fermions via the gauge kinetic mixing. We have analyzed two different final states, namely, (i) exactly one tagged dark photon and exactly one tagged top quark jet, and (ii) at least two tagged dark photons and at least one tagged top quark jet at the 13 and 14 TeV LHC center of mass energies. Both these final states receive significant contributions from the pair and single production processes of the top partner. The rich event topology of the signal processes, $i.e.$, the presence of a boosted dark photon and top quark jet pair, along with the fact that the invariant mass of the system corresponds to the mass of the top partner, help us to significantly suppress the potential SM backgrounds. We have shown that one can set a $2\sigma$ exclusion limit of $2.6$ TeV on the top partner mass with $\sin\theta_L=0.1$ and assuming $100\%$ branching ratio of the top partner in the exactly one tagged dark photon and exactly one tagged top quark jet final state at the 14 TeV LHC center of mass energy assuming 300 fb$^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity.</description>

      <title>Determination of the strong coupling constant and the Collins-Soper kernel from the energy-energy correlator in $e^+e^-$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21435v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have conducted the first simultaneous global fit of the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$ and the Collins-Soper (CS) kernel using the energy-energy correlators (EEC) of $e^{+} e^{-}$ collisions in the back-to-back limit. This analysis, based on the transverse-momentum-dependent (TMD) factorization of EEC at next-to-next-to-next-to-leading logarithmic ($\rm{N}^{3} \rm{LL}$) accuracy, yields $\alpha_s$ consistent with the world average. We have tested two different parametrizations for the non-perturbative CS kernel and found both to align with results obtained from lattice QCD and fits on semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering and Drell-Yan process.</description>

      <title>Properties of the tensor state $bc\overline{b}\overline{c}$</title>

Abstract: Spectroscopic parameters and decays of the exotic tensor meson $T$ with content $bc \overline{b}\overline{c}$ are explored in the context of the diquark-antidiquark model. We treat it as a state built of axial-vector diquark $b^{T}C\gamma _{\mu }c$ and antidiquark $\overline{b}\gamma _{\nu }C \overline{c}^{T}$, where $C$ is the charge conjugation matrix. The mass $m$ and current coupling $\Lambda$ of this tetraquark are extracted from two-point sum rules. Our result for $m=(12.70 \pm 0.09)~\mathrm{GeV}$ proves that $T$ is unstable against strong dissociations to two-meson final states. Its dominant decay channels are processes $T \to J/\psi \Upsilon $, $ \eta_{b}\eta _{c}$, and $B_{c}^{(\ast) +}B_{c}^{(\ast) -}$. Kinematically allowed transformations of $T$ include also decays $T\rightarrow D^{(\ast )+}D^{(\ast )-}$ and $D^{(\ast )0}\overline{D}^{(\ast )0}$, which are generated by $b\overline{b}$ annihilation inside of $T$. The full width of $ T $ is estimated by considering all of these channels. Their partial widths are calculated by invoking methods of three-point sum rule approach which are required to evaluate strong couplings at corresponding tetraquark-meson-meson vertices. Our predictions for the mass and width $ \Gamma_{T}=(117.4 \pm 15.9)~ \mathrm{MeV} $ of the tensor state $T$ provide useful information for experimental studies of fully heavy four-quark exotic structures.</description>

      <title>Enhancing generalization in high energy physics using white-box adversarial attacks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Machine learning is becoming increasingly popular in the context of particle physics. Supervised learning, which uses labeled Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, remains one of the most widely used methods for discriminating signals beyond the Standard Model. However, this paper suggests that supervised models may depend excessively on artifacts and approximations from Monte Carlo simulations, potentially limiting their ability to generalize well to real data. This study aims to enhance the generalization properties of supervised models by reducing the sharpness of local minima. It reviews the application of four distinct white-box adversarial attacks in the context of classifying Higgs boson decay signals. The attacks are divided into weight space attacks, and feature space attacks. To study and quantify the sharpness of different local minima this paper presents two analysis methods: gradient ascent and reduced Hessian eigenvalue analysis. The results show that white-box adversarial attacks significantly improve generalization performance, albeit with increased computational complexity.</description>

      <title>Scalar and tensor meson dominance and gravitational form factors of the pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10354v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the recent MIT lattice data for the gravitational form factors (GFFs) of the pion which extend up to $Q^2= 2~{\rm GeV}^2$ for $m_\pi=170$~MeV~\cite{Hackett:2023nkr}. We show that simple monopole fits comply with the old idea of meson dominance. We use Chiral Perturbation theory ($\chi$PT) to next-to-leading order (NLO) to transform the MIT data to the physical world with $m_\pi=140~$MeV and find that the spin-0 GFF is effectively saturated with the $f_0(600)$ and the spin-2 with the $f_2(1270)$, with monopole masses $m_\sigma= 630(60)$~MeV and $m_{f_2}= 1270(40)$~MeV. We determine in passing the chiral low energy constants (LECs) from the MIT lattice data alone \[ 10^3 \cdot L_{11} (m_\rho^2)=1.06(15) \, , \qquad 10^3 \cdot L_{12} (m_\rho^2)= -2.2(1) \, , \qquad 10^3 \cdot L_{13} (m_\rho^2) = -0.7(1.1). \] which agree in sign and order of magnitude % to be compared with the original estimates by Donoghue and Leutwyler. The corresponding D-term (druck) has the value $ D(0) = -0.95(3) $. We also analyze the sum rules based on perturbative QCD (pQCD) that imply that the corresponding spectral functions are not positive definite. We show that these sum rules are strongly violated in a variety of $\pi\pi-K \bar K$ coupled channel Omn\`es-Muskhelishvili calculations. This is not mended by the inclusion of the pQCD tail, suggesting the need for an extra negative spectral strength. Using a simple model implementing all sum rules, we find the expected onset of pQCD at very high momenta.</description>

      <title>Kaon Distribution Functions from Empirical Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15376v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using available information from Drell-Yan data on pion and kaon structure functions, an approach is described which enables the development of pointwise profiles for all pion and kaon parton distribution functions (DFs) without reference to theories of hadron structure. The key steps are construction of structure-function-constrained probability-weighted ensembles of valence DF replicas and use of an evolution scheme for parton DFs that is all-orders exact. The DFs obtained express qualitatively sound features of light-meson structure, e.g., the effects of Higgs boson couplings into QCD and the size of heavy-quark momentum fractions in light hadrons. In order to improve the results, additional and more precise data on the $u$-quark-in-kaon, $u^K$, to $u$-quark-in-pion, $u^\pi$, DF ratio would be necessary. Of greater value would be extraction of $u^K$ alone, thereby avoiding inference from the ratio: currently, the data-based form of $u^K$ is materially influenced by results for $u^\pi$.</description>

      <title>Extreme mass-ratio inspirals into black holes surrounded by scalar clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.16093v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study extreme mass-ratio binary systems in which a stellar mass compact object spirals into a supermassive black hole surrounded by a scalar cloud. Scalar clouds can form through superradiant instabilities of massive scalar fields around spinning black holes and can also serve as a proxy for dark matter halos. Our framework is fully relativistic and assumes that the impact of the cloud on the geometry can be treated perturbatively. As a proof of concept, here we consider a point particle in circular, equatorial motion around a non-spinning black hole surrounded either by a spherically symmetric or a dipolar non-axisymmetric scalar cloud, but the framework can in principle be generalized to generic black hole spins and scalar cloud geometries. We compute the leading-order power lost by the point particle due to scalar radiation and show that, in some regimes, it can dominate over gravitational-wave emission. We confirm the presence of striking signatures due to the presence of a scalar cloud that had been predicted using Newtonian approximations, such as resonances that can give rise to sinking and floating orbits, as well as "sharp features" in the power lost by the particle at given orbital radii. Finally, for a spherically symmetric scalar cloud, we also compute the leading-order corrections to the black-hole geometry and to the gravitational-wave energy flux, focusing only on axial metric perturbations for the latter. We find that, for non-compact clouds, the corrections to the (axial) gravitational-wave fluxes at high frequencies can be understood in terms of a gravitational-redshift effect, in agreement with previous works.</description>

      <title>Strong CP problem in the quantum rotor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent studies have claimed that the strong $CP$ problem does not occur in QCD, proposing a new order of limits in volume and topological sectors when studying observables on the lattice. In order to shed light on this issue, we study the effect of the topological $\theta$-term on a simple quantum mechanical rotor that allows a lattice description. The topological susceptibility and the $\theta$-dependence of the energy spectrum are both computed using local lattice correlation functions. The sign problem is overcome by considering Taylor expansions in $\theta$ exploiting automatic differentiation methods for Monte Carlo processes. Our findings confirm the conventional wisdom on the strong $CP$ problem.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Dirac spectrum from chiral symmetry restoration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03546v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I derive constraints on the Dirac spectrum in the chirally symmetric phase of a gauge theory with two massless fermion flavors. Using only general properties of correlation functions of scalar and pseudoscalar bilinears, I prove that in the chiral limit of vanishing fermion mass $m$ the corresponding susceptibilities and all their derivatives with respect to $m^2$ must be finite. I then use the resulting spectral constraints to show that effective breaking of the anomalous $\mathrm{U}(1)_A$ symmetry is allowed in the $\mathrm{SU}(2)_A$ symmetric phase in the chiral limit, and leads to distinctive spectral features: (i) the spectral density must develop a singular $O(m^4)/\lambda$ peak as $m\to 0$, (ii) the two-point eigenvalue correlator of near-zero modes must be singular, and (iii) near-zero modes cannot be localized. Moreover, in the symmetric phase the topological charge distribution must be indistinguishable from that of an ideal gas of instantons and anti-instantons of vanishing density, to leading order in $m$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study radius stabilization in the Randall-Sundrum model without assuming any unnaturally large stabilizing scalar potential parameter at the boundary branes ($\gamma$) by the frequently used superpotential method. Employing a perturbative expansion in $1/\gamma^2$ and the backreaction parameter, we obtain approximate analytical expressions for the radion mass and wavefunction. We validate them through a dedicated numerical analysis, which solves the linearized coupled scalar and metric field equations exactly. It is observed that the radion mass decreases with decreasing $\gamma$. Below a critical value of $\gamma$, the radion becomes tachyonic, suggesting destabilization of the extra dimension. We also address the issue of non-Hermiticity of the differential operator that determines the radion and Kaluza-Klein (KK) mode wavefunctions in the finite $\gamma$ limit. It is accomplished by finding an explicit form of the general scalar product that re-establishes the orthogonality in the KK decomposition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.12303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate a tree-level equivalence between four distinct infrared objects in $(d+2)$-dimensional abelian gauge theories. These are ($i$) the large gauge charge $Q_\varepsilon$ where the function $\varepsilon$ on the sphere parameterizing large gauge transformations is identified with the Goldstone mode $\theta$ of spontaneously broken large gauge symmetry; ($ii$) the soft effective action that captures the dynamics of the soft and Goldstone modes; ($iii$) the edge mode action with Neumann boundary conditions; and ($iv$) the Wilson line dressing of a scattering amplitude, including a novel dressing for soft photons, which have local charge distributions despite having vanishing global charge. The promotion of the large gauge parameter to the dynamical Goldstone and the novel dressing of soft gauge particles give rise to intriguing possibilities for the future study of infrared dynamics of gauge theories and gravity.</description>

      <title>Observational prospects of self-interacting scalar superradiance with next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04304v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current- and next-generation gravitational-wave observatories may reveal new, ultralight bosons. Through the superradiance process, these theoretical particle candidates can form clouds around astrophysical black holes and result in detectable gravitational-wave radiation. In the absence of detections, constraints$-$contingent on astrophysical assumptions$-$have been derived using LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data on boson masses. However, the searches for ultralight scalars to date have not adequately considered self-interactions between particles. Self-interactions that significantly alter superradiance dynamics are generically present for many scalar models, including axion-like dark matter candidates and string axions. We implement the most complete treatment of particle self-interactions available to determine the gravitational-wave signatures expected from superradiant scalar clouds and revisit the constraints obtained in a past gravitational-wave search targeting the black hole in Cygnus X-1. We also project the reach of next-generation gravitational-wave observatories to scalar particle parameter space in the mass-coupling plane. We find that while proposed observatories have insufficient reach to self-interactions that can halt black hole spin-down, next-generation observatories are essential for expanding the search beyond gravitational parameter space and can reach a mass and interaction scale of $\sim 10^{-13}-10^{-12}$ eV/c$^2$ and $\gtrsim 10^{17}$ GeV, respectively.</description>

Abstract: We discuss non-invertible symmetries in toroidal compactifications of higher dimensional Yang-Mills theory with magnetic fluxes, which can be regarded as an effective action of type IIB string theory with magnetized D-branes. Specifically, we derive fusion rules of discrete isometry operators, which are invariant under the $\mathbb{Z}_N$ orbifold twist. It turns out that degenerate chiral zero-modes non-trivially transform under the non-invertible symmetries in the context of quantum mechanics. Hence, non-invertible symmetries correspond to flavor symmetries of chiral zero modes and determine their flavor structure. We explicitly show the representations and selection rules of chiral zero modes on their wave functions. These zero modes may correspond to generations of quarks and leptons in four-dimensional low-energy effective field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The tidal Love numbers of self-gravitating compact objects describe their response to external tidal perturbations, such as those from a companion in a binary system, offering valuable insights into their internal structure. For static tidal fields, asymptotically flat black holes in vacuum exhibit vanishing Love numbers in general relativity, even though this property is sensitive to the presence of an external environment. In this work we study the tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks, showing that the Love numbers could be large enough to mask any effect of modified gravity and to intrinsically limit tidal tests of black-hole mimickers. Furthermore, we investigate the measurability of the tidal parameters with next-generation gravitational wave experiments, like LISA and Einstein Telescope. Our findings suggest that these parameters could be measured with high precision, providing a powerful tool to probe the environment around coalescing binary systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we construct Yang-Mills theory in the $\kappa$-space-time. We derive Yang-Mills equations in the $\kappa$-deformed space-time, valid up to first order in the deformation parameter $a$, using the generalisation of Feynman's approach. We first derive the $\kappa$-deformed Wong's equation and using it, in the Jacobi identity involving velocities and coordinates of $\kappa$-deformed space-time, we derive the $\kappa$-deformed homogeneous Yang-Mills equations. We then construct the Lagrangian for Yang-Mills theory in $\kappa$-deformed space-time and show that it is invariant under SU(N) transformation. We also derive the expression for the force experienced by an isospin-carrying particle in the presence of Yang-Mills field in the $\kappa$-space-time.</description>
