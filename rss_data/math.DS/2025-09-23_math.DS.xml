      <title>Off Critical Zeros Contradict Contraction in the Dynamical Reformulation of the Riemann Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the dynamical reformulation of the Riemann Hypothesis initiated in [1]. The framework is built from an integer map in which composites advance by pi(m) and primes retreat by their prime gap, producing trajectories whose contraction properties encode the distribution of primes. In this setting, RH is equivalent to the persistence of contraction inequalities for trajectory-based error functionals E(X), E~(X) across multiplicative scales.
  In the present paper we prove that if zeta(s) has a zero off the critical line Re(s)=1/2, then the Landau--Littlewood Omega-theorem forces oscillations of size x^beta in psi(x)-x. A window-capture lemma shows that these oscillations are inherited by the composite-only window suprema Esup(X), and hence by E(X), producing lower bounds that contradict contraction. Thus any off--critical zero is incompatible with contraction.
  Headline result. Part I introduced the dynamical system and showed that RH is equivalent to the persistence of contraction inequalities. Part II proves that off--critical zeros force oscillations in psi(x)-x that inevitably violate contraction. Taken together, these two steps close the circle: contraction characterizes RH, and off--critical zeros contradict contraction. Hence every nontrivial zero of zeta(s) lies on the critical line. In particular, the Riemann Hypothesis holds.
  More generally, the present result shows that whenever contraction holds, the critical line is forced as the only location of nontrivial zeros. In this sense, the critical line is not merely the conjectured locus of zeros, but the equilibrium point singled out by contraction itself.</description>

      <title>Representation of solutions to continuous and discrete first-order linear matrix equations with pure delay involving nonpermutable matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16845v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a unified treatment of first-order linear matrix equations (FLMEs) with pure delay in both continuous and discrete time, under the general setting of noncommutative coefficient matrices. In the continuous-time framework, we consider delayed matrix differential equations of the form
  \[
  \dot{X}(\vartheta) = A_0 X(\vartheta-\sigma) + X(\vartheta-\sigma) A_1 + G(\vartheta), \quad \vartheta \geq 0,
  \]
  where \(A_0, A_1 \in \mathbb{R}^{d \times d}\) satisfy \(A_0 A_1 \neq A_1 A_0\), \(G(\vartheta)\) is a prescribed matrix function, and \(\sigma &gt;0\) denotes the delay. We derive explicit representations of the solution for initial data \(X(\vartheta) = \Psi(\vartheta)\), \(\vartheta \in [-\sigma,0]\), highlighting the structural impact of noncommutativity.
  For the discrete-time analogue, the system
  \[
  \Delta X(u) = A_0 X(u-m) + X(u-m) A_1 + G(u)
  \]
  is analyzed using recursively defined auxiliary matrices \(Q_u\) and a fundamental matrix function \(Z(u)\), yielding closed-form solutions for both homogeneous and non-homogeneous cases. These results extend classical representations for commutative systems to the noncommutative setting. Collectively, continuous and discrete analyzes provide a comprehensive framework for understanding delayed linear matrix dynamics, with potential applications in control theory, signal processing, and iterative learning.</description>

      <title>Ledrappier-Young entropy formula for $C^1$ diffeomorphisms with dominated splitting Part 1: Unstable entropy formula and invariance principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16981v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the unstable entropy of $C^1$ diffeomorphisms with dominated splittings. Our main result shows that when the zero Lyapunov exponent has multiplicity one, the center direction contributes no entropy, and the unstable entropy coincides with the metric entropy. This extends the celebrated work of Ledrappier-Young [18] for $C^2$ diffeomorphisms to the $C^1$ setting under these assumptions. In particular, our results apply to $C^1$ diffeomorphisms away from homoclinic tangencies due to [20].
  As consequences, we obtain several applications at $C^1$ regularity. The Avila-Viana invariance principle [7, 33] holds when the center is one-dimensional. Results on measures of maximal entropy due to Hertz-Hertz-Tahzibi-Ures [25], Tahzibi-Yang [33]}, and Ures-Viana-Yang-Yang [34, 35] also remain valid for $C^1$ diffeomorphisms.</description>

      <title>Chaotic Boltzmann's Billiard Systems at positive energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper deals with the so-called Boltzmann billiard, that is, a billiard subjected to a central force of the type $V(r)=-\alpha/r-\beta/r^2$, $\alpha$ and $\beta$ being positive constants, and with a straight reflection table. In the particular case of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ positive, we prove the presence of a symbolic dynamics, and hence of positive topological entropy, at positive energy and for $\beta$ sufficiently small.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the ways minimal sets of flows in $S^3$ may be embedded. We prove that given any $C^2$ flow on $S^3$ with positive entropy, there is an uncountable collection of topologically distinct minimal sets $\mathcal{M}$ such that for each $M\in \mathcal{M}$ there are infinitely many embedded copies of $M$ in the flow, each copy with a distinct knot type, thus extending work of Franks and Williams for periodic orbits.</description>

      <title>Generalized comparison principle for contact Hamilton-Jacobi equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we discuss all the possible pairs $(u,c)\in C(M,\mathbb R)\times\mathbb R$ solving (in the sense of viscosity) the contact Hamilton-Jacobi equation \[ H (x, d_xu, u) = c,\quad x\in M \] of which $M$ is a closed manifold and the continuous Hamiltonian $H: (x,p,u)\in T^*M\times\mathbb R\rightarrow\mathbb R$ is convex, coercive in $p$ but merely non-decreasing in $u$. Firstly, we propose a comparison principle for solutions by using the dynamical information of Mather measures. We then describe the structure of $\mathfrak C$ containing all the $c\in\mathbb R$ makes previous equation solvable. We also propose examples to verify the optimality of our approach.</description>

      <title>Residual fertility and delay in sterile insect population dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17519</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17519v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sterile insect technique controls mosquito-borne diseases such as malaria, dengue, and yellow fever through either eradication or depressing the associated vector population. We formulate a three-dimensional delayed mosquito population suppression model with a saturated release rate to explore the interactive dynamics between wild, sterile, and non-sterile mosquitoes, focusing on the delay and residual fertility in the interactive dynamics among insects. We investigate the stability of the positive equilibrium and derive the Hopf bifurcation conditions. We establish the stability conditions for the positive equilibrium and examine how the time delay ($\tau$) and residual fertility affect the non-sterile insects' dynamics. Below the critical values of the delay, the system remains stable, while beyond that, the Hopf bifurcation is guaranteed under certain circumstances. However, analysis shows a clear band of non-sterile insect population values as residual fertility varies within a very narrow range. This suggests that within this interval, the system exhibits sensitive dependence on the fertility parameter, likely due to underlying nonlinear dynamics. Numerical simulations are presented to support our analytical results, followed by a brief discussion of the findings.</description>

Abstract: We study the dynamics of multidimensional contracted rotations and address a problem posed by Y. Bugeaud and J-P. Conze in \textit{Acta Arithmetica} in 1999. More precisely, we show that if $A$ is an invertible linear contraction of $\mathbb{R}^d$, then the map $f: [0,1)^d\to [0,1)^d$ defined by $f(x) = Ax +b\,\,(\textrm{mod}\,\mathbb{Z}^d)$ is asymptotically periodic for Lebesgue almost all $b\in\mathbb{R}^d$.</description>

      <title>Stabilizability and lower spectral radius for linear switched systems with singular matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17799v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the stabilizability of linear discrete-time switched systems with singular matrices, focusing on the spectral radius in this context. A new lower bound of the stabilizability radius is proposed, which is applicable to any matrix set. Based on this lower bound, more relationships between the stabilizability radius and joint spectral subradius are established. Detailed analysis of the stabilizability radius of a special kind of two-dimensional switched system, consisting of a singular matrix and a rotation matrix, is presented. The Hausdorff dimensions of the parameter sets such that the stabilizability radius of these systems equals a constant are also presented. Other properties of switched systems with singular matrices are also discussed along with examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16362v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review and propose to use of associated dynamical system to explore the phase transition phenomena in $p$-adic statistical mechanics setting, by means of the renormalization techniques. Main focus of the paper is the $p$-adic $\lambda$-model on the Cayley tree. We study generalized $p$-adic quasi Gibbs measures for the $\lambda$-model. These measures associate recurrence equations that determine dynamical systems for the model. A main point is to verify and confirm that the indicated predictions from a dynamical system point of view are indeed true.</description>

      <title>Non-isentropic cavity flow for the multi-d compressible Euler system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16435v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously construct non-isentropic and self-similar multi-d Euler flows in which a central cavity (vacuum region) collapses. While isentropic flows of this type have been analyzed earlier by Hunter \cite{hun_60} and others, the non-isentropic setting introduces additional complications, in particular with respect to the behavior along the fluid-vacuum interface. The flows we construct satisfy the physical boundary conditions: the interface is a material surface along which the pressure vanishes, and it propagates with a non-vanishing and finite acceleration until collapse.
  We introduce a number of algebraic conditions on the parameters in the problem (spatial dimension, adiabatic index, similarity parameters). With these conditions satisfied, a simple argument based on trapping regions for the associated similarity ODEs yields the existence of non-isentropic cavity flows. We finally verify that the conditions are all met for several physically relevant cases in both two and three dimensions.</description>

      <title>Robot Conga: A Leader-Follower Walking Approach to Sequential Path Following in Multi-Agent Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coordinated path following in multi-agent systems is a key challenge in robotics, with applications in automated logistics, surveillance, and collaborative exploration. Traditional formation control techniques often rely on time-parameterized trajectories and path integrals, which can result in synchronization issues and rigid behavior. In this work, we address the problem of sequential path following, where agents maintain fixed spatial separation along a common trajectory, guided by a leader under centralized control. We introduce Robot Conga, a leader-follower control strategy that updates each agent's desired state based on the leader's spatial displacement rather than time, assuming access to a global position reference, an assumption valid in indoor environments equipped with motion capture, vision-based tracking, or UWB localization systems. The algorithm was validated in simulation using both TurtleBot3 and quadruped (Laikago) robots. Results demonstrate accurate trajectory tracking, stable inter-agent spacing, and fast convergence, with all agents aligning within 250 time steps (approx. 0.25 seconds) in the quadruped case, and almost instantaneously in the TurtleBot3 implementation.</description>

      <title>Safe Guaranteed Dynamics Exploration with Probabilistic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16650v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ensuring both optimality and safety is critical for the real-world deployment of agents, but becomes particularly challenging when the system dynamics are unknown. To address this problem, we introduce a notion of maximum safe dynamics learning via sufficient exploration in the space of safe policies. We propose a $\textit{pessimistically}$ safe framework that $\textit{optimistically}$ explores informative states and, despite not reaching them due to model uncertainty, ensures continuous online learning of dynamics. The framework achieves first-of-its-kind results: learning the dynamics model sufficiently $-$ up to an arbitrary small tolerance (subject to noise) $-$ in a finite time, while ensuring provably safe operation throughout with high probability and without requiring resets. Building on this, we propose an algorithm to maximize rewards while learning the dynamics $\textit{only to the extent needed}$ to achieve close-to-optimal performance. Unlike typical reinforcement learning (RL) methods, our approach operates online in a non-episodic setting and ensures safety throughout the learning process. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in challenging domains such as autonomous car racing and drone navigation under aerodynamic effects $-$ scenarios where safety is critical and accurate modeling is difficult.</description>

      <title>Existence proofs of traveling wave solutions on an infinite strip for the suspension bridge equation and proof of orbital stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16693v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a computer-assisted approach for constructively proving the existence of traveling wave solutions of the suspension bridge equation on the infinite strip $\Omega = \mathbb{R} \times (-d_2,d_2)$. Using a meticulous Fourier analysis, we derive a quantifiable approximate inverse $\mathbb{A}$ for the Jacobian $D\mathbb{F}(\bar{u})$ of the PDE at an approximate traveling wave solution $\bar{u}$. Such approximate objects are obtained thanks to Fourier coefficients sequences and operators, arising from Fourier series expansions on a rectangle $\Omega_0 = (-d_1,d_1) \times (-d_2,d_2)$. In particular, the challenging exponential nonlinearity of the equation is tackled using a rigorous control of the aliasing error when computing related Fourier coefficients. This allows to establish a Newton-Kantorovich approach, from which the existence of a true traveling wave solution of the PDE can be proven in a vicinity of $\bar{u}$. We successfully apply such a methodology in the case of the suspension bridge equation and prove the existence of multiple traveling wave solutions on $\Omega$. Finally, given a proven solution $\tilde{u}$, a Fourier series approximation on $\Omega_0$ allows us to accurately enclose the spectrum of $D\mathbb{F}(\tilde{u})$. Such a tight control provides the number of negative eigenvalues, which in turns, allows to conclude about the orbital (in)stability of $\tilde{u}$.</description>

Abstract: Motivated by Open Problem 17 in Damanik-Fillman's manuscript , we study the decay rate of limit-periodic approximation such that ballistic transport persists in the limit-periodic setting. We show an exponential decay rate, roughly $\|\mathscr{J}-\mathscr{J}_{q_n}\|\sim e^{-\eta q_n}$, is sufficient. This improves on earlier results of Fillman arXiv:1603.01173</description>

      <title>An extension of the Floquet-Bloch theory to nilpotent groups and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16848v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a generalized Floquet-Bloch theory for discrete torsion-free nilpotent groups by exploiting their Malcev completions. Our main result is a branching formula that relates finite-dimensional representations of a discrete nilpotent lattice to infinite-dimensional unitary representations of its simply connected nilpotent Lie group. This generalization enables to extend the following two classical asymptotic problems (i) a Chebotarev density analogue for prime closed geodesics on compact negatively curved manifolds with nilpotent covers, and (ii) long time asymptotic expansions of heat kernels on such coverings to the nilpotent setting.
  As a by-product, we derive a semi-classical expansion for the Harper operator, presenting an alternative to mathematical justification of Wilkinson's formula by Helffer-Sj\"ostrand.
  We conclude by proposing several avenues for future work: extensions to general hyperbolic flows and noncompact manifolds (in particular knot complements and related quasi-morphisms), connections to modified Riemann-Hilbert problems and opers. Furthermore, we give a brief comment on asymptotic behavior of knot invariants and infinite extensions in number theory.</description>

      <title>Boundary Feller-Dynkin processes associated with Laguerre processes and Pickrell diffusions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17045</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct a Feller-Dynkin boundary process by applying the method of intertwiners to the coherent family, introduced in our previous work, of Laguerre processes with a fixed parameter. The corresponding boundary process is computed explicitly, and it turns out to be a deterministic dynamical system. Since the Pickrell diffusions that leave the Pickrell measure invariant are coherent with respect to the same projective system, we also obtain the stochastic boundary process associated with the coherent family of Pickrell diffusions.</description>

      <title>Reachability-based Approach to Point-to-Point Steering Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a reachability-based approach to finite-time transition problem of nonlinear systems between two stationary points (i.e., the point-to-point steering problem). When the target state is reachable, we prove that a solution can always be constructed by concatenation of two Pontraygin extremals. This allows to formulate the problem as a two-point boundary value problem (TPBVP) of extremals, where the solution existence to the formulated TPBVP is equivalent to that of the original problem. The theoretical developments are applied to curves with prescribed curvature bounds in R3, thereby extending the recent works on Dubins car to dimension three. We prove that to construct a curvature-bounded path in R3 with prescribed length and boundary conditions, it suffices to consider the trajectories that are concatenations of CSC, CCC, their subsegments, and H, where C denotes a circular arc with maximum curvature, S a straight line segment, and H a certain class of helicoidal arcs with constant curvature. Numerical demonstrations are conducted on a nonlinear dynamics example, and on curvature-bounded paths in R2 and R3.</description>

      <title>Delay compensation of multi-input distinct delay nonlinear systems via neural operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we present the first stability results for approximate predictors in multi-input non-linear systems with distinct actuation delays. We show that if the predictor approximation satisfies a uniform (in time) error bound, semi-global practical stability is correspondingly achieved. For such approximators, the required uniform error bound depends on the desired region of attraction and the number of control inputs in the system. The result is achieved through transforming the delay into a transport PDE and conducting analysis on the coupled ODE-PDE cascade. To highlight the viability of such error bounds, we demonstrate our results on a class of approximators - neural operators - showcasing sufficiency for satisfying such a universal bound both theoretically and in simulation on a mobile robot experiment.</description>

      <title>Data-efficient Kernel Methods for Learning Hamiltonian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17154</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17154v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hamiltonian dynamics describe a wide range of physical systems. As such, data-driven simulations of Hamiltonian systems are important for many scientific and engineering problems. In this work, we propose kernel-based methods for identifying and forecasting Hamiltonian systems directly from data. We present two approaches: a two-step method that reconstructs trajectories before learning the Hamiltonian, and a one-step method that jointly infers both. Across several benchmark systems, including mass-spring dynamics, a nonlinear pendulum, and the Henon-Heiles system, we demonstrate that our framework achieves accurate, data-efficient predictions and outperforms two-step kernel-based baselines, particularly in scarce-data regimes, while preserving the conservation properties of Hamiltonian dynamics. Moreover, our methodology provides theoretical a priori error estimates, ensuring reliability of the learned models. We also provide a more general, problem-agnostic numerical framework that goes beyond Hamiltonian systems and can be used for data-driven learning of arbitrary dynamical systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17821v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a probabilistic proof of the mean-field limit and propagation of chaos of a classical N-particle system in two dimensions with Coulomb interaction force of the form $f^N(q)=\pm\frac{q}{|q|^2}$ and $N$-dependent cut-off at $|q|&gt;N^{-2}$. In particular, for typical initial data, we show convergence of the Newtonian trajectories to the characteristics of the Vlasov-Poisson system. The proof is based on a Gronwall estimate for the maximal distance between the exact microscopic dynamics and the approximate mean-field dynamics. Thus our result leads to a derivation of the Vlasov-Poisson equation from the microscopic $N$-particle dynamics with force term arbitrary close to the physically relevant Coulomb force.</description>

      <title>Polynomial actions of rings of integers of global fields and quasirandomness of Paley-type graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.17868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to undertake an in-depth study of the phenomenon behind the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem, which, in its modern form due to Kamae and Mend\`es-France, states that if $E$ is a set of integers with positive density and $P$ is an intersective polynomial, then there are distinct elements $x, y \in E$ such that $x - y = P(n)$ for some some $n$.
  In this paper, we identify an algebraic framework (rings of integers of global fields) for Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy-type theorems. One of our main results establishes necessary and sufficient conditions for a polynomial to satisfy the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over the ring of integers of a global field, providing an extension of the result of Kamae and Mend\`es-France.
  The Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy phenomenon goes beyond infinite rings and has interesting additional aspects in finite rings. As an example, classical exponential sum estimates can be used to show that large subsets of finite fields contain the asymptotically ``correct'' number of pairs $(x,y)$ whose difference is a square. In previous work, the class of polynomials satisfying this strong form of the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over finite fields was classified. In the present paper, we establish asymptotic results characterizing sequences of finite principal ideal rings that produce ``correct'' statistics in the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem and show that these families are much more general than finite fields.
  As an application of our enhanced forms of the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over finite rings, we produce new families of examples of quasirandom graphs of algebraic origin. The production of these new examples hinges on a two-way connection between asymptotic total ergodicity -- the phenomenon responsible for enhanced versions of the Furstenberg--S\'ark\"ozy theorem over finite fields and rings -- and quasirandomness.</description>

      <title>Fractal failures of Ratner rigidity in higher rank geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ratner's theorem shows that in a locally symmetric space of noncompact type and finite volume, every immersed totally geodesic subspace of noncompact type is topologically rigid: its closure is an immersed submanifold.
  We construct the first explicit higher-rank, infinite-volume examples in which this rigidity fails, via floating geodesic planes. Specifically, we exhibit a Zariski-dense Hitchin surface group $\Gamma&lt;\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})$ such that $\Gamma\backslash \mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{R})/ \mathrm{SO}(3)$ contains a sequence of immersed floating geodesic planes with fractal closures whose Hausdorff dimensions, non-integral, accumulate at $2$. Moreover, $\Gamma$ can be chosen inside $\mathrm{SL}_3(\mathbb{Z})$.
  Our method uses Goldman's bulging deformations, but in higher rank new difficulties arise: unlike in rank one, where geodesics orthogonal to a hyperplane always diverge, here one must analyze the collective behavior of entire families of parallel geodesics inside flats under bulging, a phenomenon intrinsic to higher rank.</description>

Abstract: We provide a David extension result for circle homeomorphisms conjugating two dynamical systems such that parabolic periodic points go to parabolic periodic points, but hyperbolic points can go to parabolics as well. We use this result, in particular, to prove the existence of a new class of welding homeomorphisms, to establish an explicit dynamical connection between critically fixed anti-rational maps and kissing reflection groups, to show conformal removability of the Julia sets of geometrically finite polynomials and of the limit sets of necklace reflection groups, to produce matings of anti-polynomials and necklace reflection groups, and to give a new proof of the existence of Suffridge polynomials (extremal points in certain spaces of univalent maps).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.13258v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aims of this paper are to answer several conjectures and questions about multiplier spectrum of rational maps and to give new proofs of several rigidity theorems in complex dynamics, by combining tools from complex and non-archimedean dynamics.
  A remarkable theorem due to McMullen asserts that aside from the flexible Latt\`es family, the multiplier spectrum of periodic points determines the conjugacy class of rational maps up to finitely many choices. The proof relies on Thurston's rigidity theorem for post-critically finite maps, in which Teichm\"uller theory is an essential tool. We will give a new proof of McMullen's theorem without using quasiconformal maps or Teichm\"uller theory.
  We show that aside from the flexible Latt\`es family, the length spectrum of periodic points determines the conjugacy class of rational maps up to finitely many choices. This generalizes the aforementioned McMullen's theorem. We will also prove a rigidity theorem for marked length spectrum. Similar ideas also yield a simple proof of a rigidity theorem due to Zdunik.
  We show that a rational map is exceptional if and only if one of the following holds (i) the multipliers of periodic points are contained in the integer ring of an imaginary quadratic field; (ii) all but finitely many periodic points have the same Lyapunov exponent. This solves two conjectures of Milnor.</description>

Abstract: We prove a purely Borel/measureless version of Dowker's ratio ergodic theorem, from which we derive a strengthening of Dowker's original theorem with a precise identification of the limit of local ergodic ratios. This is done by implementing the pointwise tiling idea of [Tse18] in the more complex setting of continuum-to-one Borel transformations. Along the way, we establish a vanishing markers lemma for these transformations, which generalizes its well-known counterpart for invertible transformations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.01715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Wandering Fatou components were recently constructed by Astorg et al for higher-dimensional holomorphic maps on projective spaces. Their examples are polynomial skew products with a parabolic invariant line. In this paper, we study this wandering domain problem for polynomial skew product $f$ with an attracting invariant line $L$ (which is the more common case). We show that if $f$ is unicritical (in the sense that the critical curve has a unique transversal intersection with $L$), then every Fatou component of $f$ in the basin of $L$ is an extension of a one-dimensional Fatou component of $f|_L$. As a corollary, there is no wandering Fatou component. We will also discuss the multicritical case under additional assumptions.</description>

Abstract: We find criteria ensuring that a local (holomorphic, real analytic, $C^1$) homeomorphism between the Julia sets of two given rational functions comes from an algebraic correspondence. For example, we show that if there is a local $C^1$-symmetry between the maximal entropy measures of two rational functions, then probably up to a complex conjugation, the two rational functions are dynamically related by an algebraic correspondence. The holomorphic case of our criterion will play an important role in the authors' upcoming proof of the Dynamical Andr\'e-Oort conjecture for curves.</description>

A celebrated theorem of McMullen asserts that aside from the well-understood flexible Latt\`es family, the multiplier spectrum morphism is quasi-finite. In this paper, we strengthen McMullen's theorem by showing that the multiplier spectrum morphism is generically injective. This answers a question of McMullen and Poonen.</description>

Abstract: In the modal analysis and control of nonlinear dynamical systems, the participation factors of state variables with respect to a critical or selected mode serve as a pivotal tool for simplifying stability studies by focusing on a subset of highly influential state variables. For linear systems, the participation factors of state variables regarding a mode are uniquely determined by the mode's composition and shape, defined by the system's left and right eigenvectors, respectively. However, the uniqueness of other types of participation factors necessitates further investigation. This paper establishes a sufficient condition for the uniqueness of nonlinear participation factors and five other variants of participation factors, accounting for uncertain scaling factors in a mode's shape and composition. These scaling factors arise from variations in the selection of physical units or the value ranges of state variables when analyzing and controlling real-world dynamical systems. Understanding the sufficient condition of the uniqueness is therefore crucial for the correct application of participation factors in practical scenarios. Additionally, the paper explores the relationship between perturbation magnitudes in state variables and the selection of optimal scaling factors.</description>

      <title>GN-SINDy: Greedy Sampling Neural Network in Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08613v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The sparse identification of nonlinear dynamical systems (SINDy) is a data-driven technique employed for uncovering and representing the fundamental dynamics of intricate systems based on observational data. However, a primary obstacle in the discovery of models for nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs) lies in addressing the challenges posed by the curse of dimensionality and large datasets. Consequently, the strategic selection of the most informative samples within a given dataset plays a crucial role in reducing computational costs and enhancing the effectiveness of SINDy-based algorithms. To this aim, we employ a greedy sampling approach to the snapshot matrix of a PDE to obtain its valuable samples, which are suitable to train a deep neural network (DNN) in a SINDy framework. SINDy based algorithms often consist of a data collection unit, constructing a dictionary of basis functions, computing the time derivative, and solving a sparse identification problem which ends to regularised least squares minimization. In this paper, we extend the results of a SINDy based deep learning model discovery (DeePyMoD) approach by integrating greedy sampling technique in its data collection unit and new sparsity promoting algorithms in the least squares minimization unit. In this regard we introduce the greedy sampling neural network in sparse identification of nonlinear partial differential equations (GN-SINDy) which blends a greedy sampling method, the DNN, and the SINDy algorithm. In the implementation phase, to show the effectiveness of GN-SINDy, we compare its results with DeePyMoD by using a Python package that is prepared for this purpose on numerous PDE discovery</description>

      <title>Pensive billiards, point vortices, and the silver ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03279v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a new class of plane billiards - the `pensive billiard' - in which the billiard ball travels along the boundary for some distance depending on the incidence angle before reflecting, while preserving the billiard rule of equality of the angles of incidence and reflection. This generalizes so called `puck billiards' proposed by M.Bialy, as well as a `vortex billiard', i.e. the motion of a point vortex dipole in 2D hydrodynamics on domains with boundary. We prove the variational origin and invariance of a symplectic structure for pensive billiards, as well as study their properties including conditions for a twist map, the existence of periodic orbits, etc. We also demonstrate the appearance of both the golden and silver ratios in the corresponding hydrodynamical vortex setting. Finally, we introduce and describe basic properties of pensive outer billiards.</description>

      <title>How many points converge to a heteroclinic network in an aperiodic way?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11383v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Homoclinic and heteroclinic connections can form cycles and networks in phase space, which organize global phenomena in dynamical systems. On the one hand, stability notions for (omni)cycles give insight into how many initial conditions approach the network along a single given (omni)cycle. On the other hand, the term switching is used to describe situations where there are trajectories that follow any possible sequence of heteroclinic connections along the network. Here we give a notion of asymptotic stability for general sequences along a network of homoclinic and heteroclinic connections. We show that there cannot be uncountably many aperiodic sequences that attract a set with nontrivial measure. Finally, we discuss examples where one may or may not expect aperiodic convergence towards a network and conclude with some open questions.</description>

      <title>Classification of global attractors for $\mathbb{S}^1$-equivariant parabolic equations: a survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10051v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We survey the global dynamics of semiflows generated by scalar semilinear parabolic equations which are $\mathbb{SO}(2)$ equivariant under spatial shifts of $x\in \mathbb{S}^1=\mathbb{R}/2\pi\mathbb{Z}$, i.e. $$ u_t = u_{xx} + f(u,u_x),\qquad x\in \mathbb{S}^1.$$ For dissipative $C^2$ nonlinearities $f$, the semiflow possesses a compact global attractor $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ which we call Sturm attractor. The Sturm attractor $\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ decomposes as $$ \mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}=\mathcal{E}\cup\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P}\cup\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}\cup\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P},$$ where $\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P}$ denotes heteroclinic orbits between distinct elements of spatially homogeneous equilibria $\mathcal{E}$, rigidly rotating waves $\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}$ and, as their non-rotating counterparts, frozen waves $\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P}$. We therefore represent $\mathcal{A}^\mathcal{P}$ by its connection graph $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$, with vertices in $\mathcal{E},\mathcal{F}^\mathcal{P},\mathcal{R}^\mathcal{P}$ and edges $\mathcal{H}^\mathcal{P}$. Under mild hyperbolicity assumptions, the directed graphs $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$ are finite and transitive. For illustration, we enumerate all 21 connection graphs $\mathcal{C}^\mathcal{P}$ with up to seven vertices. The result uses a lap signature of period maps associated to integrable versions of the steady state ODE of our PDE.
  As an example, we freeze and reconstruct the connection graph of the Vas tulip attractor, known from delay differential equations, in our PDE setting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.12941v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study degenerate singular points of planar vector fields inside a (degenerated) flow-box. These kind of singularities are called fake saddles and their linear parts are always zero. We characterize fake saddles with non-zero second order jet and we give the first term of an uniform asymptotic expansion of the Poincar\'e map between two transverse sections to their corresponding singular fiber, determining its stability.</description>

      <title>Boundedness of solutions of the first-order linear multidimensional difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14842v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the boundedness of solutions of the first order linear difference equation of the form $x_{n+1} = Ax_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ where $A$ is a square matrix with complex entries, sequence $\{y_{n}\}_{n\geq 1}$ and initial value $x_1$ are supposed to be known. Firstly, we discuss the one-dimensional case of this equation $x_{n+1} = ax_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ where $a$ is a complex number. In particular, we obtain the sufficient conditions for boundedness or unboundedness of the solutions in case $|a|=1$(the critical case) by considering the exponential sums of the forms $\sum y_{n}e(n\varphi)$ and $\sum e(f(n))$.
  Then we proceed to the investigation of the equation in the multidimensional case and reduce our problem to analysis of the spectrum and Jordan cells of matrix $A$. The problem is especially interesting when spectrum of $A$ contains eigenvalues $\lambda$ with $|\lambda|=1$. At the end of the article we obtain a theorem that reveals the connection between equations $x_{n+1} = ax_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ with $|a|=1$ and $x_{n+1} = Jx_{n} + y_{n}, \; n \geq 1$ with $J$ being a Jordan cell of an eigenvalue $\lambda$, $|\lambda|=1$.</description>

      <title>On the set of normalized dilatations of fully-punctured pseudo-Anosov maps</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.10245v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We improve the bound on the number of tetrahedra in the veering triangulation of a fully-punctured pseudo-Anosov mapping torus in terms of the normalized dilatation. When the mapping torus has only one boundary component, we can improve the bound further. Together with the author's work with Hironaka in the case when the mapping torus has at least two boundary components, this allows us to understand small elements of the set $\mathcal{D}$ of normalized dilatations of fully-punctured pseudo-Anosov maps using computational means. In particular, we certify that the minimum element of $\mathcal{D}$ is $\mu^2$ and the minimum accumulation point of $\mathcal{D}$ is $\mu^4$, where $\mu$ is the golden ratio.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A pair $(A,\mathbf{b})$ of a real $m\times n$ matrix $A$ and $\mathbf{b}\in\mathbb{R}^m$ is said to be $\textit{infinitely badly approximable}$ if \[ \liminf_{\mathbf{q}\in\mathbb{Z}^n, \|\mathbf{q}\|\to\infty} \|\mathbf{q}\|^{\frac{n}{m}}\|A\mathbf{q}-\mathbf{b}\|_{\mathbb{Z}} =\infty, \] where $\|\cdot\|_\mathbb{Z}$ denotes the distance from the nearest integer vector. In this article, we introduce a novel concept of singularity for $(A,\mathbf{b})$ and characterize the infinitely badly approximable property by this singular property. As an application, we compute the Hausdorff dimension of the infinitely badly approximable set. We also discuss dynamical interpretations on the space of grids in $\mathbb{R}^{m+n}$.</description>

      <title>Dynamical thermalization, Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, vortexes and wave collapse in quantum chaos fibers and fluid of light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06534</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06534v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fr\"ohlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. We describe also the time evolution during the process of relaxation to the thermal state and the time dependence of quantum von Neumann and classical Boltzmann entropies during this process. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity. System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.</description>
