      <title>A Unifying Approach for the Pricing of Debt Securities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06303</link>

Abstract: We propose a unifying framework for the pricing of debt securities under general time-inhomogeneous short-rate diffusion processes. The pricing of bonds, bond options, callable/putable bonds, and convertible bonds (CBs) are covered. Using continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) approximation, we obtain closed-form matrix expressions to approximate the price of bonds and bond options under general one-dimensional short-rate processes. A simple and efficient algorithm is also developed to price callable/putable debts. The availability of a closed-form expression for the price of zero-coupon bonds allows for the perfect fit of the approximated model to the current market term structure of interest rates, regardless of the complexity of the underlying diffusion process selected. We further consider the pricing of CBs under general bi-dimensional time-inhomogeneous diffusion processes to model equity and short-rate dynamics. Credit risk is also incorporated into the model using the approach of Tsiveriotis and Fernandes (1998). Based on a two-layer CTMC method, an efficient algorithm is developed to approximate the price of convertible bonds. When conversion is only allowed at maturity, a closed-form matrix expression is obtained. Numerical experiments show the accuracy and efficiency of the method across a wide range of model parameters and short-rate models.</description>

      <title>Multi-Task Dynamic Pricing in Credit Market with Contextual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamic pricing problem faced by a broker that buys and sells a large number of financial securities in the credit market, such as corporate bonds, government bonds, loans, and other credit-related securities. One challenge in pricing these securities is their infrequent trading, which leads to insufficient data for individual pricing. However, many of these securities share structural features that can be utilized. Building on this, we propose a multi-task dynamic pricing framework that leverages these shared structures across securities, enhancing pricing accuracy through learning.
  In our framework, a security is fully characterized by a $d$ dimensional contextual/feature vector. The customer will buy (sell) the security from the broker if the broker quotes a price lower (higher) than that of the competitors. We assume a linear contextual model for the competitor's pricing, with unknown parameters a priori. The parameters for pricing different securities may or may not be similar to each other. The firm's objective is to minimize the expected regret, namely, the expected revenue loss against a clairvoyant policy which has the knowledge of the parameters of the competitor's pricing model. We show that the regret of our policy is better than both the policy that treats each security individually and the policy that treats all securities as the same. Moreover, the regret is bounded by $\tilde{O} ( \delta_{\max} \sqrt{T M d} + M d ) $, where $M$ is the number of securities and $\delta_{\max}$ characterizes the overall dissimilarity across securities in the basket.</description>
