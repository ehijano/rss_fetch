      <title>A search for baryogenesis and dark matter in $B^+ \to \Lambda_c^+ + {\rm invisible}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06950v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A mechanism of baryogenesis and dark matter production via $B$-meson oscillations and decays has recently been proposed to explain the observed dark matter abundance and matter-antimatter asymmetry in the universe. This mechanism introduces a light dark sector particle ($\psi_D$) with a non-zero baryonic charge. We present a search for this new state in $B^+ \to \Lambda_c^+ \, \psi_D$ decays using data collected at the $\Upsilon(4S)$ resonance by the BABAR detector at SLAC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $431.0 \rm{~fb}^{-1}$. The search leverages the full reconstruction of the $B^-$ meson in $\Upsilon(4S) \to B^+B^-$ decays, accompanied by the reconstruction of a $\Lambda_c^+$, to infer the presence of $\psi_D$. No significant signal is observed, and limits on the $B^+ \to \Lambda_c^+ \, \psi_D$ branching fraction are set at the level of $1.6 \times 10^{-4}$ for $0.94 &lt; m_{\psi_D} &lt; 2.99$ GeV. These results set strong constraints on the parameter space allowed by $B$-meson baryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Truncation orders, external constraints, and the determination of $|V_{cb}|$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a model selection framework for the extraction of the CKM matrix element $|V_{cb}|$ from exclusive $B \to D^* l \nu$ decays. By framing the truncation of the Boyd-Grinstein-Lebed (BGL) parameterization as a model selection task, we apply the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to choose the optimal truncation order. We demonstrate the performance of our approach through a comprehensive toy study, comparing it to the Nested Hypothesis Test (NHT) method used in previous analyses. Our results show that the AIC-based approach produces unbiased estimates of $|V_{cb}|$, albeit with some issues of undercoverage. We further investigate the impact of unitarity constraints and explore model averaging using the Global AIC (gAIC) approach, which produced unbiased results with correct coverage properties. Our findings suggest that model selection techniques based on information criteria and model averaging offer a promising path towards more reliable $|V_{cb}|$ determinations.</description>

      <title>Exploring $ \Lambda{\text-} $ and $ \Xi{\text -}$triton correlation functions in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07295</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07295v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, $ \Lambda{\text -} $triton(t) momentum correlation functions, to be measured in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, are explored.
  Mainly, STAR detector acquired data for Au+Au collisions at $ \sqrt{s_{NN}} =3 $ GeV provides an opportunity to explore the $ \Lambda t $ correlation function.
  A Kurihara's isle-type and spin-averaged $ \Lambda t $ potential is employed.
  The strengths of $\Lambda t$ potential is tuned in a such way to reproduce the experimental ground state energy of $_{\Lambda}^{4}H$ $ \left(\Lambda+t\right) $.
  Since the new measurements by the STAR Collaboration present a significant
  increase in the $\Lambda$ binding energy of the hypertriton and $_{\Lambda}^{4}H$ hypernuclei,
  I investigate the sensitivity of correlation function by strengthen the $\Lambda t$ potential. Besides, even though there is no experimental data on the $ \Xi{\text -} $triton interaction yet, an estimate of its momentum correlation functions by taking $ \Xi{\text -} $triton potential from the literature is given.</description>

      <title>Confronting the broken phase N2HDM with Higgs Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The broken phase of the Next-to two-Higgs-doublet model (N2HDM) constitutes an archetype of extended Higgs sectors. In the presence of a softly-broken $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry throughout the scalar and Yukawa sectors, as the additional gauge singlet field does not interact with fermions, the model admits four variants of Yukawa interactions between the doublets and Standard Model fermions. We confront each type with experimental Higgs Data, especially from CMS and ATLAS detectors at the LHC. Interfacing the models with the state-of-the-art package $\mathtt{HiggsTools}$, we perform a statistical $\chi^2$ analysis to determine the best-fit points and exclusion limits at the $95\%$ and $68\%$ C.L., and identify SM-like Higgs measurements that affect each type the most. We further analyze the exclusion bounds on the additional Higgs bosons at the $95\%$ C.L., paying special attention to searches of hypothetical non-SM Higgs resonances decaying into a pair of bosons or fermions. We show regions where the additional Higgs bosons do not satisfy the narrow-width approximation utilized in most experimental searches.</description>

      <title>Implementation and investigation of electron-nucleus scattering in NEUT neutrino event generator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding nuclear effects is essential for improving the sensitivity of neutrino oscillation measurements. Validating nuclear models solely through neutrino scattering data is challenging due to limited statistics and the broad energy spectrum of neutrinos. In contrast, electron scattering experiments provide abundant high-precision data with various monochromatic energies and angles. Since both neutrinos and electrons interact via electroweak interactions, the same nuclear models can be applied to simulate both interactions. Thus, high-precision electron scattering data is essential for validating the nuclear models used in neutrino experiments. To enable this, the author has newly implemented electron scattering in the \texttt{NEUT} neutrino event generator, covering two interaction modes: quasielastic (QE) and single pion production. \texttt{NEUT} predictions of QE agree well with numerical calculations, supporting the validity of this implementation. From comparisons with \texttt{NEUT} predictions and inclusive electron scattering data, the momentum-dependent binding energy correction is derived, corresponding to effects beyond the plane wave impulse approximation. The impact of this correction on neutrino interactions is also evaluated. Significant differences in charged lepton kinematics are observed, with approximately 20\,MeV of peak shift in the reconstructed neutrino energy distribution, which is important for accurately measuring neutrino oscillation parameters. It is expected to serve as a foundation for future discussions on electron scattering using \texttt{NEUT}.</description>

      <title>Search for a resonance decaying into a scalar particle and a Higgs boson in the final state with two bottom quarks and two photons in proton-proton collisions at a center of mass energy of 13 TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for the resonant production of a heavy scalar $X$ decaying into a Higgs boson and a new lighter scalar $S$, through the process $X \to S(\to bb) H(\to \gamma\gamma)$, where the two photons are consistent with the Higgs boson decay, is performed. The search is conducted using an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The search is performed over the mass range 170 $\leq$ $m_{X}$ $\leq$ 1000 GeV and 15 $\leq$ $m_{S}$ $\leq$ 500 GeV. Parameterised neural networks are used to enhance the signal purity and to achieve continuous sensitivity in a domain of the ($m_{X}$, $m_{S}$) plane. No significant excess above the expected background is found and 95% CL upper limits are set on the cross section times branching ratio, ranging from 39 fb to 0.09 fb. The largest deviation from the background-only expectation occurs for ($m_{X}$, $m_{S}$) = (575, 200) GeV with a local (global) significance of 3.5 (2.0) standard deviations.</description>

      <title>Search for $CP$ violation in D$^0$ $\to$ K$^0_\mathrm{S}$K$^0_\mathrm{S}$ decays in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search is reported for charge-parity $CP$ violation in D$^0$ $\to$ K$^0_\mathrm{S}$K$^0_\mathrm{S}$ decays, using data collected in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV recorded by the CMS experiment in 2018. The analysis uses a dedicated data set that corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 41.6 fb$^{-1}$, which consists of about 10 billion events containing a pair of b hadrons, nearly all of which decay to charm hadrons. The flavor of the neutral D meson is determined by the pion charge in the reconstructed decays D$^{*+}$ $\to$ D$^0\pi^+$ and D$^{*-}$ $\to$ D$^0\pi^-$. The $CP$ asymmetry in D$^0$ $\to$ K$^0_\mathrm{S}$K$^0_\mathrm{S}$ is measured to be $A_{CP}$(K$^0_\mathrm{S}$K$^0_\mathrm{S}$) = (6.2 $\pm$ 3.0 $\pm$ 0.2 $\pm$ 0.8)%, where the three uncertainties represent the statistical uncertainty, the systematic uncertainty, and the uncertainty in the measurement of the $CP$ asymmetry in the D$^0$ $\to$ K$^0_\mathrm{S}\pi^+\pi^-$ decay. This is the first $CP$ asymmetry measurement by CMS in the charm sector as well as the first to utilize a fully hadronic final state.</description>

      <title>A search for $R$-parity violating supersymmetric decays of the top squark to a $b$-jet and a lepton in $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV $pp$ collisions with the ATLAS detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search is presented for direct pair production of the stop, the supersymmetric partner of the top quark, in a decay through an $R$-parity violating coupling to a charged lepton and a $b$-quark. The dataset corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a center-of-mass energy of $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV collected between 2015 and 2018 by the ATLAS detector at the LHC. The final state has two charged leptons (electrons or muons) and two $b$-jets. The results of the search are interpreted in the context of a Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with an additional $B-L$ gauge symmetry that is spontaneously broken. No significant excess is observed over the Standard Model background and exclusion limits on stop pair production are set at 95% confidence level. The corresponding lower limits on the stop mass for 100% branching ratios to a $b$-quark and an electron, muon, or tau-lepton are 1.9 TeV, 1.8 TeV and 800 GeV, respectively, extending the reach of previous LHC searches.</description>

      <title>Measurement of boosted Higgs bosons produced via vector boson fusion or gluon fusion in the H $\to$ $\mathrm{b\bar{b}}$ decay mode using LHC proton-proton collision data at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A measurement is performed of Higgs bosons produced with high transverse momentum ($p_\mathrm{T}$) via vector boson or gluon fusion in proton-proton collisions. The result is based on a data set with a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV collected in 2016-2018 with the CMS detector at the LHC and corresponds to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The decay of a high-$p_\mathrm{T}$ Higgs boson to a boosted bottom quark-antiquark pair is selected using large-radius jets and employing jet substructure and heavy-flavor taggers based on machine learning techniques. Independent regions targeting the vector boson and gluon fusion mechanisms are defined based on the topology of two quark-initiated jets with large pseudorapidity separation. The signal strengths for both processes are extracted simultaneously by performing a maximum likelihood fit to data in the large-radius jet mass distribution. The observed signal strengths relative to the standard model expectation are 4.9 $^{+1.9}_{-1.6}$ and 1.6 $^{+1.7}_{-1.5}$ for the vector boson and gluon fusion mechanisms, respectively. A differential cross section measurement is also reported in the simplified template cross section framework.</description>

Abstract: A combination of searches for singly and doubly charged Higgs bosons, $H^{\pm}$ and $H^{\pm\pm}$, produced via vector-boson fusion is performed using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected with the ATLAS detector during Run 2 of the Large Hadron Collider. Searches targeting decays to massive vector bosons in leptonic final states (electrons or muons) are considered. New constraints are reported on the production cross-section times branching fraction for charged Higgs boson masses between 200 GeV and 3000 GeV. The results are interpreted in the context of the Georgi-Machacek model for which the most stringent constraints to date are set for the masses considered in the combination.</description>

      <title>Study of neutron production for 360 GeV cosmic muons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04169v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The China Jinping underground Laboratory (CJPL) is an excellent location for studying solar, terrestrial, and supernova neutrinos due to its 2400-meter vertical rock overburden. Its unparalleled depth gives an opportunity to investigate the cosmic-ray muons with exceptionally high average energy at $\sim360$ GeV. This paper details a study of muon-related backgrounds based on 1178 days of data collected by the 1-ton prototype neutrino detector used for the Jinping Neutrino Experiment (JNE) since 2017. The apparent effects for the leakage of muons' secondary particles due to detector's finite size on the measured neutron yield are first discussed in detail. The analysis of 493 cosmic-ray muon candidates and $13.6\pm5.7$ cosmogenic neutron candidates, along with a thorough evaluation of detection efficiency and uncertainties, gives a muon flux of $(3.56\pm0.16_{\mathrm{stat.}}\pm0.10_{\mathrm{syst.}})\times10^{-10}~\mathrm{cm}^{-2}\mathrm{s^{-1}}$ and a cosmogenic neutron yield of $(3.37\pm 1.41_{\mathrm{stat.}}\pm 0.31_{\mathrm{syst.}}) \times 10^{-4}~\mathrm{\mu}^{-1} \mathrm{g}^{-1} \mathrm{cm}^{2}$ in LAB-based liquid scintillator.</description>

      <title>A universal implementation of radiative effects in neutrino event generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05736v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Due to the similarities between electron-nucleus ($eA$) and neutrino-nucleus scattering ($\nu A$), $eA$ data can contribute key information to improve cross-section modeling in $eA$ and hence in $\nu A$ event generators. However, to compare data and generated events, either the data must be radiatively corrected or radiative effects need to be included in the event generators. We implemented a universal radiative corrections program that can be used with all reaction mechanisms and any $eA$ event generator. Our program includes real photon radiation by the incident and scattered electrons, and virtual photon exchange and photon vacuum polarization diagrams. It uses the ``extended peaking" approximation for electron radiation and neglects charged hadron radiation. This method, validated with GENIE, can also be extended to simulate $\nu A$ radiative effects. This work facilitates data-event-generator comparisons used to improve $\nu A$ event generators for the next-generation of neutrino experiments.</description>

Abstract: Inclusive cross-sections for top-quark pair production in association with charm quarks are measured with proton-proton collision data at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$, collected with the ATLAS experiment at the LHC between 2015 and 2018. The measurements are performed by requiring one or two charged leptons (electrons and muons), two $b$-tagged jets, and at least one additional jet in the final state. A custom flavor-tagging algorithm is employed for the simultaneous identification of $b$-jets and $c$-jets. In a fiducial phase space that replicates the acceptance of the ATLAS detector, the cross-sections for $t\bar{t}+ {\geq} 2c$ and $t\bar{t}+1c$ production are measured to be $1.28^{+0.27}_{-0.24}\;\text{pb}$ and $6.4^{+1.0}_{-0.9}\;\text{pb}$, respectively. The measurements are primarily limited by uncertainties in the modeling of inclusive $t\bar{t}$ and $t\bar{t}+b\bar{b}$ production, in the calibration of the flavor-tagging algorithm, and by data statistics. Cross-section predictions from various $t\bar{t}$ simulations are largely consistent with the measured cross-section values, though all underpredict the observed values by 0.5 to 2.0 standard deviations. In a phase-space volume without requirements on the $t\bar{t}$ decay products and the jet multiplicity, the cross-section ratios of $t\bar{t}+ {\geq} 2c$ and $t\bar{t}+1c$ to total $t\bar{t}+\text{jets}$ production are determined to be $(1.23 \pm 0.25) \%$ and $(8.8 \pm 1.3) \%$.</description>

      <title>First search for atmospheric millicharged particles with the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on a search for millicharged particles (mCPs) produced in cosmic ray proton atmospheric interactions using data collected during the first science run of the LUX-ZEPLIN experiment. The mCPs produced by two processes -- meson decay and proton bremsstrahlung -- are considered in this study. This search utilized a novel signature unique to liquid xenon (LXe) time projection chambers (TPCs), allowing sensitivity to mCPs with masses ranging from 10 to 1000 MeV/c$^2$ and fractional charges between 0.001 and 0.02 of the electron charge e. With an exposure of 60 live days and a 5.5 tonne fiducial mass, we observed no significant excess over background. This represents the first experimental search for atmospheric mCPs and the first search for mCPs using an underground LXe experiment.</description>

      <title>Quantum anomaly detection in the latent space of proton collision events at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10780v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The ongoing quest to discover new phenomena at the LHC necessitates the continuous development of algorithms and technologies. Established approaches like machine learning, along with emerging technologies such as quantum computing show promise in the enhancement of experimental capabilities. In this work, we propose a strategy for anomaly detection tasks at the LHC based on unsupervised quantum machine learning, and demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying new phenomena. The designed quantum models, an unsupervised kernel machine and two clustering algorithms, are trained to detect new-physics events using a latent representation of LHC data, generated by an autoencoder designed to accommodate current quantum hardware limitations on problem size. For kernel-based anomaly detection, we implement an instance of the model on a quantum computer, and we identify a regime where it significantly outperforms its classical counterparts. We show that the observed performance enhancement is related to the quantum resources utilised by the model.</description>

Abstract: Quantum machine learning provides a fundamentally different approach to analyzing data. However, many interesting datasets are too complex for currently available quantum computers. Present quantum machine learning applications usually diminish this complexity by reducing the dimensionality of the data, e.g., via auto-encoders, before passing it through the quantum models. Here, we design a classical-quantum paradigm that unifies the dimensionality reduction task with a quantum classification model into a single architecture: the guided quantum compression model. We exemplify how this architecture outperforms conventional quantum machine learning approaches on a challenging binary classification problem: identifying the Higgs boson in proton-proton collisions at the LHC. Furthermore, the guided quantum compression model shows better performance compared to the deep learning benchmark when using solely the kinematic variables in our dataset.</description>

Abstract: The study of antinuclei in cosmic rays provides a unique opportunity to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. Antinuclei in our Galaxy may stem either from annihilation or decay of dark matter, or from collisions of cosmic rays with the interstellar medium, which constitute the background of indirect dark matter searches. Understanding the formation mechanism of (anti)nuclei is crucial for setting limits on their production in space. Coalescence models, which describe the formation of light nuclei from final-state interaction of nucleons, have been widely employed in high-energy collisions. In this work, we introduce ToMCCA (Toy Monte Carlo Coalescence Afterburner), which allows for detailed studies of the nuclear formation processes without the overload of general-purpose event generators. ToMCCA contains parameterizations of the multiplicity dependence of the transverse momentum distributions of protons and of the baryon-emitting source size, extracted from ALICE measurements in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5 - 13$ TeV, as well as of the event multiplicity distributions, taken from the EPOS event generator. ToMCCA provides predictions of the deuteron transverse momentum distributions, with an agreement of $\sim5\%$ with the experimental data. The results of ToMCCA show that the coalescence mechanism in pp collisions depends only on the event multiplicity rather than on the collision system or its energy. This allows the model to be utilized for predictions at lower center-of-mass collision energies, which are the most relevant for the production of antinuclei from processes related to dark matter. This model can also be extended to heavier nuclei as long as the target nucleus wave function and its Wigner function are known.</description>

      <title>Revisiting Reactor Anti-Neutrino 5 MeV Bump with $^{13}$C Neutral-Current Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08724v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we comprehensively examine the potential of neutrino-nucleus neutral current interactions with $^{13}$C to determine the origin of the 5-MeV bump in reactor antineutrino spectra observed through the inverse beta decay (IBD) process. This anomaly may be due to new physics, reactor antineutrino flux inaccuracies, or IBD systematics. The primary signal is the 3.685 MeV photon released during the de-excitation of $^{13}$C$^*$ to its ground state, detectable in various liquid scintillator detectors. This interaction is most common for reactor antineutrinos within the energy range of the 5-MeV bump, providing unique sensitivity to its origins. Remarkably, we confirm the powerfulness of our proposal by completely ruling out a new physics scenario explaining the bump from the existing NEOS data. The main systematic challenge in distinguishing flux models is the accuracy of cross section measurements; thus, minimizing these uncertainties is essential. Hence, we explore the potential of current and forthcoming experiments, including solar neutrino studies at JUNO, pion and muon decay-at-rest experiments at OscSNS, and isotope decay-at-rest studies at Yemilab, to obtain precise cross section measurements. Additionally, we propose a novel method to track the time evolution of reactor isotopes by analyzing the $^{13}$C signal. This technique yields critical insights into the contributions of $^{235}$U and $^{239}$Pu to the observed bump, acting as a robust tool to differentiate between flux models and explore new physics explanations for the 5-MeV bump.</description>

      <title>Investigation of kaonic atom optical potential by the high precision data of kaonic $^3$He and $^4$He atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate kaonic atom states based on the latest high precision data of the $2p$ states of the kaonic atoms in $^3$He and $^4$He (J-PARC E62). We consider the phenomenological form for the optical potential proportional to the nuclear density distributions and determine the potential parameters by the latest data. We find two sets of potential parameters for each of $K^--^3$He and $K^--^4$He that reproduce the data. We then extract the potential parameters consistent with the data of $^3$He and $^4$He atoms simultaneously. Using the potential, we investigate the structure of the kaonic atoms and kaonic nuclei for various nuclei up to Sn. We also report the optical potential parameters suited for the global description of the atomic data, the possible strong isospin dependence of the potential, and the different strength of the data of $K^--^3$He and $K^--^4$He in the restrictions on the potential parameters. In addition, we find that the study of the $1s$ states of the kaonic helium atom is very interesting as a next step, and the determination of the orbital angular momenta of the kaonic nuclear states is helpful for the unified understandings of the atomic and nuclear bound states of kaon because of the mutual influence between the atomic and the nuclear states of kaon with the same orbital angular momentum.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05955v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The polarizabilities of light pseudoscalar mesons can be extracted from differential cross sections for Compton scattering near threshold. While this has been accomplished for charged pions employing Primakoff reactions, a corresponding measurement for kaons will be affected by the presence of the $K^*(892)$ resonance not too far from threshold. We propose a method to extend the energy range serviceable for this purpose by reconstructing the $K^*(892)$ contribution model-independently from its $K\pi$ intermediate state, using dispersion theory. We point out that, in contrast to the charged-pion analog, there is likely no strong hierarchy between sum and difference of electric and magnetic dipole polarizabilities; we discuss the sensitivity to disentangling both by improved experimental angular coverage.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, the nonfactorizable photonic corrections to the effective four-fermion vertex for the $\overline{B}$ ${\to}$ $D^{({\ast})}$ $+$ ${\ell}^{-}$ $+$ $\bar{\nu}_{\ell}$ decays are considered at the quark level within SM, where ${\ell}$ $=$ $e$, ${\mu}$ and ${\tau}$. It is found that the QED corrections are closely related with the mass of the charged lepton. The QED contributions will enhance branching ratios, which results in the slight reduction of ratios $R(D^{(\ast)})$ and the relationship $R(D^{(\ast)})_{e}$ $&lt;$ $R(D^{(\ast)})_{\mu}$.</description>

      <title>Model independent bounds on heavy sterile neutrinos from the angular distribution of $\mathbf{B\to D^*\ell\nu}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11945v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study the bounds that can be inferred on New Physics couplings to heavy sterile neutrinos $N$ from the recent measurements performed by the Belle collaboration of the angular analysis of $B\to D^*\ell\bar\nu_\ell$ decays, with $\ell=e,\mu$. Indeed, a sterile neutrino $N$ may lead to competing $B\to D^*\ell\bar N$ decays and Belle might have measured an incoherent sum of these two independent channels. After reviewing the theoretical formalism required to describe this phenomenon in full generality, we first perform a bump hunt in the $M_{\rm miss}^2$ Belle distribution to search for evidences of an additional massive neutrino. We found in such a way a small hint at $M_{\rm miss}^2 \sim (350\ {\rm MeV})^2$. However, the Belle angular analysis is sensitive to $N$ masses up to $\mathcal{O}$(50 MeV), preventing us to further inspect this hint. Nevertheless, we study the potential impact of this additional channel in the allowed mass range on the measured angular distributions and extract model-independent bounds on the new-physics couplings which could mediate such an interaction. In particular, in the mass window here inspected, we obtain the most stringent bounds for vector and left-handed scalar operators to date.</description>

      <title>Constraining Jet Quenching in Heavy-Ion Collisions with Bayesian Inference</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.14552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Jet suppression and modification is a hallmark feature of heavy-ion collisions. This can be attributed to an accumulated set of effects, including radiative and elastic energy loss and reabsorption of thermalized energy within the jet cone, which are encoded in a quenching weight, determining the probability distribution for a shift of the $p_T$ (energy loss). We perform a data-driven analysis, based on Bayesian inference, to extract information about the energy-loss distribution experienced by propagating jets using generic and flexible parametrizations. We first establish the consistency between different data-sets and, thereby, provide evidence for the universality of the quark/gluon quenching weights for different observables. Furthermore, we extract that the color dependence of energy loss is slightly bigger than what expected from Casimir scaling, pointing to the importance of multi-parton quenching within high-$p_T$ jets at the LHC.</description>

Abstract: For decades, researchers have developed task-specific models to address scientific challenges across diverse disciplines. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have shown enormous capabilities in handling general tasks; however, these models encounter difficulties in addressing real-world scientific problems, particularly in domains involving large-scale numerical data analysis, such as experimental high energy physics. This limitation is primarily due to BPE tokenization's inefficacy with numerical data. In this paper, we propose a task-agnostic architecture, BBT-Neutron, which employs a binary tokenization method to facilitate pretraining on a mixture of textual and large-scale numerical experimental data. We demonstrate the application of BBT-Neutron to Jet Origin Identification (JoI), a critical categorization challenge in high-energy physics that distinguishes jets originating from various quarks or gluons. Our results indicate that BBT-Neutron achieves comparable performance to state-of-the-art task-specific JoI models. Furthermore, we examine the scaling behavior of BBT-Neutron's performance with increasing data volume, suggesting the potential for BBT-Neutron to serve as a foundational model for particle physics data analysis, with possible extensions to a broad spectrum of scientific computing applications for Big Science experiments, industrial manufacturing and spacial computing.
