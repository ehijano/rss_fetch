      <title>easyCHEM: A Python package for calculating chemical equilibrium abundances in exoplanet atmospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For modeling the spectra of exoplanets one must know their atmospheric composition. This is necessary because the abundance of molecules, atoms, ions and condensates is needed to construct the total cross-section for the interaction between electro-magnetic radiation and matter. In addition, when solving for the temperature structure of an atmosphere the so-called adiabatic temperature gradient must be known, which describes the pressure-temperature dependence in convectively unstable regions well. Depending on the planetary properties, the composition and adiabatic gradients may be well described by equilibrium chemistry, which means that chemical reactions occur faster than any other relevant processes in the atmosphere, such as mixing. What is more, the equilibrium assumption often serves as a useful starting point for non-equilibrium calculations. Efficient and easy-to-use codes for determining equilibrium abundances are therefore needed. Here we report on our easyCHEM Python package that calculates atmospheric compositions and adiabatic temperature gradients in chemical equilibrium for any user-specified elemental composition.</description>

      <title>CCAT: LED Mapping and Characterization of the 280 GHz TiN KID Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prime-Cam, one of the primary instruments for the Fred Young Submillimeter Telescope (FYST) developed by the CCAT Collaboration, will house up to seven instrument modules, with the first operating at 280 GHz. Each module will include three arrays of superconducting microwave kinetic inductance detectors (KIDs). The first KID array fabricated for the 280 GHz module uses titanium-nitride (TiN) as the superconducting material and has 3,456 individual detectors, while the other two arrays use aluminum. This paper presents the design and laboratory characterization of the 280 GHz TiN array, which is cooled below its critical temperature to ~0.1 K and read out over six RF feedlines. LED mapping, a technique for matching the measured resonant frequency of a detector to its physical position, was performed on the array so that the results can be used to lithographically trim the KID capacitors and increase the yield of the array by reducing frequency collisions. We present the methods and results of LED mapping the 280 GHz TiN KID array before deployment on FYST.</description>

      <title>Unfolding X-ray Spectral Data: Conditions and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present conditions for which X-ray spectra can be ``unfolded'' to present accurate representation of the true source spectra. The method we use to unfold the data is implemented in the \textit{Interactive Spectral Interpretation Software} \citep{Houck2000} and distinguishes itself as being model-independent. We find that this method of unfolding makes accurate representations of the true source spectra (1) The detector is high-resolution and (2) The spectrum is not steeply sloped. These criteria are not simple conditions that give concrete determinations; each detector and spectrum must be judged individually. We find that both grating and imaging detectors can be unfolded with minimal distortions as compared to both continuum and local spectral features; the latter CCD detectors being much more energy dependent. We also provide example use cases for unfolding in the context of current generation X-ray observatories and important caveats.</description>

      <title>Flow Matching for Atmospheric Retrieval of Exoplanets: Where Reliability meets Adaptive Noise Levels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inferring atmospheric properties of exoplanets from observed spectra is key to understanding their formation, evolution, and habitability. Since traditional Bayesian approaches to atmospheric retrieval (e.g., nested sampling) are computationally expensive, a growing number of machine learning (ML) methods such as neural posterior estimation (NPE) have been proposed. We seek to make ML-based atmospheric retrieval (1) more reliable and accurate with verified results, and (2) more flexible with respect to the underlying neural networks and the choice of the assumed noise models. First, we adopt flow matching posterior estimation (FMPE) as a new ML approach to atmospheric retrieval. FMPE maintains many advantages of NPE, but provides greater architectural flexibility and scalability. Second, we use importance sampling (IS) to verify and correct ML results, and to compute an estimate of the Bayesian evidence. Third, we condition our ML models on the assumed noise level of a spectrum (i.e., error bars), thus making them adaptable to different noise models. Both our noise level-conditional FMPE and NPE models perform on par with nested sampling across a range of noise levels when tested on simulated data. FMPE trains about 3 times faster than NPE and yields higher IS efficiencies. IS successfully corrects inaccurate ML results, identifies model failures via low efficiencies, and provides accurate estimates of the Bayesian evidence. FMPE is a powerful alternative to NPE for fast, amortized, and parallelizable atmospheric retrieval. IS can verify results, thus helping to build confidence in ML-based approaches, while also facilitating model comparison via the evidence ratio. Noise level conditioning allows design studies for future instruments to be scaled up, for example, in terms of the range of signal-to-noise ratios.</description>

      <title>Laboratory characterisation bench for high precision astrometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High precision differential astrometry assesses the positions, distances, and motions of celestial objects in relation to the stars. The focal plane of such space telescope must be calibrated with a precision down to the level of 1e-5 pixel in order to be able to detect Earth-like planets in the close vicinity of the Sun. The presented characterization bench is designed to improve the technology readiness level for the following key points: calibration of new detectors with a high number of pixels and correcting the field distortion using stars in the field of view. The first aim of the project concentrates on the characterization of a 46 megapixels sensor from PYXALIS, to assess its typical parameters using an integrating sphere. The next objective intends to map the intra and extra pixel quantum yield of the detector with a precision of 1e-5 pixels and investigate the evolution of the pixel geometry in response to environment fluctuations. To conduct these tests, an optical bench is designed with an LCD screen and a doublet, used as a source that allows directing light to specific groups of pixels. Interferometric calibration of the detector pixel centroid position will be achieved using fibers that illuminate the detector with Young's fringes. To characterize the distortion of the detector, a diaphragm will produce adjustable optical aberrations to be corrected and therefore change the source sensor positional relationship. The final step involves the simulation of a star's field, which will be imaged on the detector to assess optical quality.</description>

      <title>Kilometer-baseline interferometry: science drivers for the next generation instrument</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrared interferometry has seen a revolution over the last few years. The advent of GRAVITY+ is about to enable high-contrast observations, all-sky coverage and faint science up to K=21, with the implementation on 8m-class telescope of extreme adaptive optics, wide-field observations, and soon laser guide stars, following a long-term vision of technological and infrastructure development at VLTI. This major progress in sensitivity lift a fundamental limitation of infrared interferometry, namely the brightness temperature achievable with this technique down to milli-arcsecond resolution imaging. This change of paradigm is a crucial element for the expansion of current arrays to a facility up to one to ten kilometer baselines. Micro-arcsecond scales imaging in the infrared on thermal objects, reaching the highest angular resolution possible even compared to VLBI, could offer a unique window in observational astronomy for the next generation instrument.</description>

      <title>Infrared photometry with InGaAs detectors: First light with SPECULOOS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the photometric performance of SPIRIT, a ground-based near-infrared InGaAs CMOS-based instrument (1280 by 1024 pixels, 12 micron pitch), using on-sky results from the SPECULOOS-Southern Observatory during 2022 - 2023. SPIRIT was specifically designed to optimise time-series photometric precision for observing late M and L type stars. To achieve this, a custom wide-pass filter (0.81 - 1.33 microns, zYJ ) was used, which was also designed to minimise the effects of atmospheric precipitable water vapour (PWV) variability on differential photometry. Additionally, SPIRIT was designed to be maintenance-free by eliminating the need for liquid nitrogen for cooling. We compared SPIRIT's performance with a deeply-depleted (2048 by 2048 pixels, 13.5 micron pitch) CCD-based instrument (using an I+z' filter, 0.7 - 1.1 microns) through simultaneous observations. For L type stars and cooler, SPIRIT exhibited better photometric noise performance compared to the CCD-based instrument. The custom filter also significantly minimised red noise in the observed light curves typically introduced by atmospheric PWV variability. In SPIRIT observations, the detector's read noise was the dominant limitation, although in some cases, we were limited by the lack of comparison stars.</description>

      <title>Semi-supervised Spectral Classification of DESI White Dwarfs by Dimensionality Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a new generation of large-sky spectroscopic surveys comes online, the enormous data volume poses unprecedented challenges in classifying spectra. Modern unsupervised techniques have the power to group spectra based on their dominant features, circumventing the complete reliance on training data suffered by supervised methods. We outline the use of dimensionality reduction to generate a 2D map of the structure of an intermediate-resolution spectroscopic dataset. This technique efficiently separates white dwarfs of different spectral classes in the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument's Early Data Release (DESI EDR), identifying spectral features that had been missed even by visual classification. By focusing the method on particular spectral regions, we identify white dwarfs with helium features at 90 per cent recall, and cataclysmic variables at 100 per cent recall, illustrating rapid selection of low-contamination samples from spectroscopic surveys. We also demonstrate the use of dimensionality reduction in a supervised manner, outlining a procedure to classify any white dwarf spectrum in comparison with those in the DESI EDR. With upcoming surveys promising tens of millions of spectra, our work highlights the potential for semi-supervised techniques as an efficient means of classification and dataset visualisation.</description>

      <title>Inferring the Morphology of the Galactic Center Excess with Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21367v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Descriptions of the Galactic Center using Fermi gamma-ray data have so far modeled the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) as a template with fixed spatial morphology or as a linear combination of such templates. Although these templates are informed by various physical expectations, the morphology of the excess is a priori unknown. For the first time, we describe the GCE using a flexible, non-parametric machine learning model -- the Gaussian process (GP). We assess our model's performance on synthetic data, demonstrating that the model can recover the templates used to generate the data. We then fit the \Fermi data with our model in a single energy bin from 2-20 GeV (leaving a spectral GP analysis of the GCE for future work) using a variety of template models of diffuse gamma-ray emission to quantify our fits' systematic uncertainties associated with diffuse emission modeling. We interpret our best-fit GP in terms of GCE templates consisting of an NFW squared template and a bulge component to determine which bulge models can best describe the fitted GP and to what extent the best-fit GP is described better by an NFW squared template versus a bulge template. The best-fit GP contains morphological features that are typically not associated with traditional GCE studies. These include a localized bright source at around $(\ell,b) = (20^{\circ}, 0^{\circ})$ and a diagonal arm extending Northwest from the Galactic Center. In spite of these novel features, the fitted GP is explained best by a template-based model consisting of the bulge presented in Coleman et al. (2020) and a squared NFW component. Our results suggest that the physical interpretation of the GCE in terms of stellar bulge and NFW-like components is highly sensitive to the assumed morphologies, background models, and the region of the sky used for inference.</description>

      <title>MANTA-Ray: Supercharging Speeds for Calculating the Optical Properties of Fractal Aggregates in the Long-Wavelength Limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Correctly modelling the absorptive properties of dust and haze particles is of great importance for determining the abundance of solid matter within protoplanetary disks and planetary atmospheres. Rigorous analyses such as the discrete dipole approximation (DDA) can be used to obtain accurate absorption cross-sections, but these require significant computing time and are often impractical to use in models. A simple analytical equation exists for spherical particles in the long-wavelength limit (where the wavelength is much larger than the size of the dust particle), but we demonstrate that this can significantly underestimate the absorption. This effect is found to depend strongly on refractive index, with values of m = 1 + 11i corresponding to an underestimate in absorption by a factor of 1,000. Here we present MANTA-Ray (Modified Absorption of Non-spherical Tiny Aggregates in the RAYleigh regime): a simple model that can calculate absorption efficiencies within 10-20% of the values predicted by DDA, but 10^(13) times faster. MANTA-Ray is very versatile and works for any wavelength and particle size in the long wavelength regime. It is also very flexible with regards to particle shape, and can correctly model structures ranging from long linear chains to tight compact clusters, composed of any material with refractive index 1+0.01i &lt; m &lt; 11+11i. The packaged model is provided as publicly-available code for use by the astrophysical community.</description>

      <title>Influence of Modeling Assumptions on the Inferred Dynamical State of Resonant Systems: A Case Study of the HD 45364 System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary systems exhibiting mean-motion resonances (MMRs) offer unique opportunities to study the imprint of disk-induced migration on the orbital architectures of planetary systems. The HD 45364 system, discovered via the radial velocity (RV) method to host two giant planets in a 3:2 MMR, has been the subject of several studies attempting to reconstruct the system's orbital migration history based on its present-day resonant configuration. Recently, Li et al. (2022) called into question the system's residence in the 3:2 MMR based on a revised orbital solution derived from an expanded set of RV observations that extend the time baseline of the original discovery data by over a decade. However, we show that inferences about the planets' dynamical state with respect to the 3:2 MMR are sensitive to the particular prior assumptions adopted in the orbital modeling. Using $N$-body dynamical models, we show that orbital solutions constrained to reside deep in the 3:2 MMR fit the RV data with a similar quality to unconstrained orbital solutions. We conclude that the RV observations of HD 45364 are consistent with orbital configurations produced by smooth migration and resonance capture. We further show that past convergent orbital migration can reproduce the system's present-day orbital configuration provided that the ratio of migration to eccentricity damping timescales, $K$, was in the range $10\lesssim K \lesssim 175$. We also find that dynamical interactions in the system can break the usual mass-inclination degeneracy inherent to Keplerian models of RV observations and constrain the planets' absolute masses to within a factor of $\sim2$.</description>

      <title>Analysing one- and two-bit data to reduce memory requirements for F-statistic-based gravitational wave searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21540v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Searches for continuous-wave gravitational radiation in data collected by modern long-baseline interferometers, such as the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO), the Virgo interferometer and the Kamioka Gravitational Wave Detector (KAGRA), can be memory intensive. A digitisation scheme is described that reduces the 64-bit interferometer output to a one- or two-bit data stream while minimising distortion and achieving considerable reduction in storage and input/output cost. For the representative example of the coherent, maximum-likelihood matched filter known as the F-statistic, it is found using Monte-Carlo simulations that the injected signal only needs to be ~24 per cent stronger (for one-bit data) and ~6.4 per cent stronger (for two bit data with optimal thresholds) than a 64-bit signal in order to be detected with 90 per cent probability in Gaussian noise. The foregoing percentages do not change significantly when the signal frequency decreases secularly, or when the noise statistics are not Gaussian, as verified with LIGO Science Run 6 data.</description>

      <title>Near Earth stream decoherence revisited: the limits of orbital similarity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. Orbital similarity measures, such as the D-values, have been extensively used in meteor science to identify meteoroid streams and associate meteorite falls with near-Earth objects (NEOs). However, the chaotic nature of near-Earth space challenges the long-term reliability of these measures for stream identification, and the increasing size of our fireball, meteorite fall, and NEO databases make random associations more common. Despite this, many researchers erroneously continue to use orbital similarity beyond its inherent limits.
  Aims. We aim to assess the statistical significance of using orbital similarity measures for identifying streams of meteoroids or asteroids and explore the implications of chaotic dynamics on the long-term coherence of these streams.
  Conclusions. The rapid decoherence of meteoroid streams and the chaotic dynamics of near-Earth orbits suggest that no reported stream or NEO associations of meteorites or fireballs are statistically significant according to orbital discriminates. Many are likely coincidental rather than indicative of a true physical link. However, several statistically significant clusters found within the NEO population are consistent with a tidal disruption formation. This contrast and lack of statistically significant associations amongst the impact datasets is likely due to the fireball databases being 2 orders of magnitude smaller than the NEO database and the higher intrinsic uncertainties of fireball observation derived orbits.</description>

      <title>Merging L-shaped resonator with Michelson configuration for kilohertz gravitational-wave detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Detection of gravitational waves in kilohertz frequency range is crucial for understanding the physical processes of binary neutron star mergers. In Ref. [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 021019 (2023)], a new interferometric configuration has been proposed, employing an L-shaped optical resonant cavity as arm cavity. This alteration enhances the detector's response to kHz signals. However, the departure from conventional Michelson configuration necessitates a redesign of its sensing and control scheme, which is currently under study. In this article, we propose replacing linear arm cavities in the conventional Michelson by the L-shaped resonator. This hybrid configuration features an enhanced response at kHz while retaining the same sensing and control scheme as the Michelson setup. At the conceptual level, it exhibits higher sensitivity in the 2-4 kHz range compared to existing configurations.</description>

      <title>Capivara: A Spectral-based Segmentation Method for IFU Data Cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.21962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present capivara, a fast and scalable multi-decomposition package designed to study astrophysical properties within distinct structural components of galaxies. Our spectro-decomposition code for analyzing integral field unit (IFU) data enables a more holistic approach, moving beyond conventional radial gradients and the bulge-plus-disk dichotomy. It facilitates comprehensive comparisons of integrated stellar ages and metallicities across various galactic structures. Our classification method naturally identifies outliers and organizes the different pixels based on their dominant spectral features. The algorithm leverages the scalability and GPU acceleration of Torch, outputting both a one-dimensional spectrum and a full data cube for each galaxy component, without relying on Voronoi binning. We demonstrate the capabilities of our approach using a sample of galaxies from the MaNGA survey, processing the resulting data cubes with the starlight spectral fitting code to derive both stellar population and ionized gas properties of the galaxy components. Our method effectively groups regions with similar spectral properties in both the continuum and emission lines. By aggregating the spectra of these regions, we enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of our analysis while significantly speeding up computations by reducing the number of spectra processed simultaneously. capivara will be freely available on GitHub.</description>

      <title>First Detection of Molecular Gas in the Giant Low Surface Brightness Galaxy Malin 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.22230v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: After over three decades of unsuccessful attempts, we report the first detection of molecular gas emission in Malin 1, the largest spiral galaxy observed to date, and one of the most iconic giant low surface brightness galaxies. Using ALMA, we detect significant $^{12}$CO(J=1-0) emission in the galaxy's central region and tentatively identify CO emission across three regions on the disc. These observations allow for a better estimate of the H$_2$ mass and molecular gas mass surface density, both of which are remarkably low given the galaxy's scale. By integrating data on its HI mass, we derive a very low molecular-to-atomic gas mass ratio. Overall, our results highlight the minimal presence of molecular gas in Malin 1, contrasting sharply with its extensive, homogeneous atomic gas reservoir. For the first time, we position Malin 1 on the Kennicutt-Schmidt (K-S) diagram, where it falls below the main sequence for normal spirals, consistent with previous upper limits but now with more accurate figures. These findings are crucial for constraining our understanding of star formation processes in environments characterized by extremely low molecular gas densities and for refining models of galaxy formation, thereby improving predictions concerning the formation, evolution, and distribution of these giant, elusive galaxies.</description>

      <title>Integration of storage endpoints into a Rucio data lake, as an activity to prototype a SKA Regional Centres Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07524</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.07524v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Square Kilometre Array (SKA) infrastructure will consist of two radio telescopes that will be the most sensitive telescopes on Earth. The SKA community will have to process and manage near exascale data, which will be a technical challenge for the coming years. In this respect, the SKA Global Network of Regional Centres plays a key role in data distribution and management. The SRCNet will provide distributed computing and data storage capacity, as well as other important services for the network. Within the SRCNet, several teams have been set up for the research, design and development of 5 prototypes. One of these prototypes is related to data management and distribution, where a data lake has been deployed using Rucio. In this paper we focus on the tasks performed by several of the teams to deploy new storage endpoints within the SKAO data lake. In particular, we will describe the steps and deployment instructions for the services required to provide the Rucio data lake with a new Rucio Storage Element based on StoRM and WebDAV within the Spanish SRC prototype.</description>

      <title>Data-Space Validation of High-Dimensional Models by Comparing Sample Quantiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00930v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a simple method for assessing the predictive performance of high-dimensional models directly in data space when only samples are available. Our approach is to compare the quantiles of observables predicted by a model to those of the observables themselves. In cases where the dimensionality of the observables is large (e.g. multiband galaxy photometry), we advocate that the comparison is made after projection onto a set of principal axes to reduce the dimensionality. We demonstrate our method on a series of two-dimensional examples. We then apply it to results from a state-of-the-art generative model for galaxy photometry (pop-cosmos; arXiv:2402.00935) that generates predictions of colors and magnitudes by forward simulating from a 16-dimensional distribution of physical parameters represented by a score-based diffusion model. We validate the predictive performance of this model directly in a space of nine broadband colors. Although motivated by this specific example, we expect that the techniques we present will be broadly useful for evaluating the performance of flexible, non-parametric population models of this kind, and other settings where two sets of samples are to be compared.</description>
