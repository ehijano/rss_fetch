      <title>Round-Preserving Asymptotic Compression of Prior-Free Interactive Protocols</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a close relationship between the communication complexity and information complexity of communication problems, as demonstrated by results such as Shannon's noiseless source coding theorem, and the Slepian-Wolf theorem. Here, we study this relationship in the prior-free and interactive setting, where we provide an alternate proof for the result of Braverman [SIAM Review, vol. 59, no. 4, 2017], that the amortized communication complexity of simulating a prior-free interactive communication protocol, is equal to its prior-free information cost. While this is a known result, our approach addresses the need for a more natural proof of it. We also improve on the result by achieving round preservation, and using a bounded quantity of shared randomness. We do this by showing that the communicating parties can produce a reliable estimate of the joint type, or empirical distribution, of their inputs. This estimate is then used in our protocol for the prior-free reverse Shannon theorem with side information at the receiver. These results are then generalized to the interactive setting to obtain our main result.</description>

      <title>Loss-Complexity Landscape and Model Structure Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13543v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a framework for dualizing the Kolmogorov structure function $h_x(\alpha)$, which then allows using computable complexity proxies. We establish a mathematical analogy between information-theoretic constructs and statistical mechanics, introducing a suitable partition function and free energy functional. We explicitly prove the Legendre-Fenchel duality between the structure function and free energy, showing detailed balance of the Metropolis kernel, and interpret acceptance probabilities as information-theoretic scattering amplitudes. A susceptibility-like variance of model complexity is shown to peak precisely at loss-complexity trade-offs interpreted as phase transitions. Practical experiments with linear and tree-based regression models verify these theoretical predictions, explicitly demonstrating the interplay between the model complexity, generalization, and overfitting threshold.</description>

      <title>Efficient Decoding of Double-circulant and Wozencraft Codes from Square-root Errors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13548v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present efficient decoding algorithms from square-root errors for two known families of double-circulant codes: A construction based on Sidon sets (Bhargava, Taveres, and Shiva, \emph{IEEE IT 74}; Calderbank, \emph{IEEE IT 83}; Guruswami and Li, \emph{IEEE IT 2025}), and a construction based on cyclic codes (Chen, Peterson, and Weldon, \emph{Information and Control 1969}). We further observe that the work of Guruswami and Li implicitly gives a transformation from double-circulant codes of certain block lengths to Wozencraft codes which preserves that distance of the codes, and we show that this transformation also preserves efficiency of decoding. By instantiating this transformation with the first family of double-circulant codes based on Sidon sets, we obtain an explicit construction of a Wozencraft code that is efficiently decodable from square-root errors. We also discuss limitations on instantiating this transformation with the second family of double-circulant codes based on cyclic codes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.13689v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sparse block interleaver division multiple access (SB-IDMA) is a recently introduced unsourced multiple access protocol that aims to improve the performance of the grant-free two-step random access transmission protocol of the 3GPP 5G New Radio standard. We introduced a density evolution analysis of the successive interference cancellation receiver of SB-IDMA, providing a theoretical characterization of its performance.</description>

      <title>Asymptotically Optimal Codes Correcting One Substring Edit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The substring edit error is the operation of replacing a substring $u$ of $x$ with another string $v$, where the lengths of $u$ and $v$ are bounded by a given constant $k$. It encompasses localized insertions, deletions, and substitutions within a window. Codes correcting one substring edit have redundancy at least $\log n+k$. In this paper, we construct codes correcting one substring edit with redundancy $\log n+O(\log \log n)$, which is asymptotically optimal.</description>

      <title>Secretive Hotplug Coded Caching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13961v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider a coded caching model called \textit{hotplug coded caching}, in which some users are offline during the delivery phase. The concept of Hotplug Placement Delivery Arrays (HpPDAs) for hotplug coded caching systems has been introduced in the literature, and two classes of HpPDAs are known. In this paper, we consider a secrecy constraint in hotplug coded caching setup, where users should not learn anything about any file from their cache content, and active users should not gain any information about files other than their demanded file from either their cache content or the server transmissions. We propose two secretive schemes for the two classes of HpPDAs and compare them with a baseline scheme, which is a secretive scheme using PDAs for the classical coded caching setup and can be trivially adapted for the hotplug coded caching setup. We numerically show that our schemes outperform the baseline scheme in certain memory regions.</description>

      <title>Bounds and Constructions of High-Memory Spatially-Coupled Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we apply the Clique Lov\'asz Local Lemma to provide sufficient conditions on memory and lifting degree for removing certain harmful combinatorial structures in spatially-coupled (SC) codes that negatively impact decoding performance. Additionally, we present, for the first time, a constructive algorithm based on the Moser-Tardos algorithm that ensures predictable performance. Furthermore, leveraging the properties of LLL-distribution and M-T-distribution, we establish the dependencies among the harmful structures during the construction process. We provide upper bounds on the probability change of remaining harmful structures after eliminating some of them. In particular, the elimination of 4-cycles increases the probability of 6-cycles becoming active by at most a factor of $e^{8/3}$.</description>

      <title>Error Correcting Codes for Segmented Burst-Deletion Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.14070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study segmented burst-deletion channels motivated by the observation that synchronization errors commonly occur in a bursty manner in real-world settings. In this channel model, transmitted sequences are implicitly divided into non-overlapping segments, each of which may experience at most one burst of deletions. In this paper, we develop error correction codes for segmented burst-deletion channels over arbitrary alphabets under the assumption that each segment may contain only one burst of t-deletions. The main idea is to encode the input subsequence corresponding to each segment using existing one-burst deletion codes, with additional constraints that enable the decoder to identify segment boundaries during the decoding process from the received sequence. The resulting codes achieve redundancy that scales as O(log b), where b is the length of each segment.</description>

      <title>From Firms to Computation: AI Governance and the Evolution of Institutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The integration of agential artificial intelligence into socioeconomic systems requires us to reexamine the evolutionary processes that describe changes in our economic institutions. This article synthesizes three frameworks: multi-level selection theory, Aoki's view of firms as computational processes, and Ostrom's design principles for robust institutions. We develop a framework where selection operates concurrently across organizational levels, firms implement distributed inference via game-theoretic architectures, and Ostrom-style rules evolve as alignment mechanisms that address AI-related risks. This synthesis yields a multi-level Price equation expressed over nested games, providing quantitative metrics for how selection and governance co-determine economic outcomes. We examine connections to Acemoglu's work on inclusive institutions, analyze how institutional structures shape AI deployment, and demonstrate the framework's explanatory power via case studies. We conclude by proposing a set of design principles that operationalize alignment between humans and AI across institutional layers, enabling scalable, adaptive, and inclusive governance of agential AI systems. We conclude with practical policy recommendations and further research to extend these principles into real-world implementation.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Covert Capacity with Sub-Exponential Random Slot Selection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of covert communication with random slot selection over binary-input Discrete Memoryless Channels and Additive White Gaussian Noise channels, in which a transmitter attempts to reliably communicate with a legitimate receiver while simultaneously maintaining covertness with respect to an eavesdropper. Covertness refers to the inability of the eavesdropper to distinguish the transmission of a message from the absence of communication, modeled by the transmission of a fixed channel input. Random slot selection refers to the transmitter's ability to send a codeword in a time slot with known boundaries selected uniformly at random among a predetermined number of slots. Our main contribution is to develop bounds for the information-theoretic limit of communication in this model, called the covert capacity, when the number of time slots scales sub-exponentially with the codeword length. Our upper and lower bounds for the covert capacity are within a multiplicative factor of $\sqrt{2}$ independent of the channel. This result partially fills a characterization gap between the covert capacity without random slot selection and the covert capacity with random selection among an exponential number of slots in the codeword length. Our key technical contributions consist of i) a tight upper bound for the relative entropy characterizing the effect of random slot selection on the covertness constraint in our achievability proof; ii) a careful converse analysis to characterize the maximum allowable weight or power of codewords to meet the covertness constraint. Our results suggest that, unlike the case without random slot selection, the choice of covertness metric does not change the covert capacity in the presence of random slot selection.</description>

      <title>Identification over Affine Poisson Channels: Application to Molecular Mixture Communication Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11569v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identification capacity has been established as a relevant performance metric for various goal-/task-oriented applications, where the receiver may be interested in only a particular message that represents an event or a task. For example, in olfactory molecular communications (MCs), odors or pheromones, which are often a mixture of various molecule types, may signal nearby danger, food, or a mate. In this paper, we examine the identification capacity with deterministic encoder for the discrete affine Poisson channel which can be used to model MC systems with molecule counting receivers. We establish lower and upper bounds on the identification capacity in terms of features of the affinity matrix between the released molecules and receptors at the receiver. As a key finding, we show that even when the number of receptor types scales sub-linearly in the number of molecule types $N,$ the number of reliably identifiable messages can grow super-exponentially with the rank of the affinity matrix, $T,$ i.e., $\sim 2^{(T \log T)R},$ where $R$ denotes the coding rate. We further derive lower and upper bounds on $R,$ and show that the proposed capacity theorem includes several known results in the literature as its special cases.</description>

      <title>Capacity and PAPR Analysis for MIMO Faster-than-Nyquist Signaling with High Acceleration Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15366</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15366v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Faster-than-Nyquist (FTN) signaling is a non-orthogonal transmission technique offering a promising solution for future generations of communications. This paper studies the capacity of FTN signaling in multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels for high acceleration factors. In our previous study [1], we found the capacity for MIMO FTN channels if the acceleration factor is larger than a certain threshold, which depends on the bandwidth of the pulse shape used. In this paper, we extend the capacity analysis to acceleration factors smaller than this mentioned threshold. In addition to capacity, we conduct peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) analysis and simulation for MIMO FTN for varying acceleration factors for both Gaussian and QPSK symbol sets. Our analysis reveals important insights about transmission power and received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) variation in FTN. As the acceleration factor approaches 0, if the transmission power is fixed, the received SNR diminishes, or if the received SNR is fixed, PAPR at the transmitter explodes.</description>

      <title>Beamforming Design for Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA)-Based MIMO Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00181v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An efficient beamforming design is proposed for continuous aperture array (CAPA)-based point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA)-MIMO systems, whose optimal beamforming can be obtained using singular-value decomposition, CAPA-MIMO systems require solving the eigendecomposition of a Hermitian kernel operator, which is computationally prohibitive. To address this challenge, an explicit closed-form expression for the achievable rate of CAPA-MIMO systems is first derived as a function of the continuous transmit beamformer. Subsequently, an iterative weighted minimum mean-squared error (WMMSE) algorithm is proposed, directly addressing the CAPA-MIMO beamforming optimization without discretization approximation. Closed-form updates for each iteration of the WMMSE algorithm are derived via the calculus of variations (CoV) method. For low-complexity implementation, an equivalent matrix-based iterative solution is introduced using Gauss-Legendre quadrature. Our numerical results demonstrate that 1) CAPA-MIMO achieves substantial performance gain over the SPDA-MIMO, 2) the proposed WMMSE algorithm enhances performance while significantly reducing computational complexity compared to state-of-the-art Fourier-based approaches, and 3) the proposed WMMSE algorithm enables practical realization of parallel, non-interfering transmissions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.15204v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a new soft-input soft-output decoder called soft-output from covered space (SOCS) decoder. It estimates the a posteriori reliability based on the space explored by a list decoder, i.e., the set of vectors for which the list decoder knows whether they are codewords. This approach enables a more accurate calculation of the a posteriori reliability and results in gains of up to 0.25$\,$dB for turbo product decoding with SOCS compared to Chase-Pyndiah decoding.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Max-Min Fair Resource Optimization Algorithm for Rate-Splitting Multiple Access</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04201v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The max-min fairness (MMF) problem in rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) is known to be challenging due to its non-convex and non-smooth nature, as well as the coupled beamforming and common rate variables. Conventional algorithms to address this problem often incur high computational complexity or degraded MMF rate performance. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose a novel optimization algorithm named extragradient-fractional programming (EG-FP) to address the MMF problem of downlink RSMA. The proposed algorithm first leverages FP to transform the original problem into a block-wise convex problem. For the subproblem of precoding block, we show that its Lagrangian dual is equivalent to a variational inequality problem, which is then solved using an extragradient-based algorithm. Additionally, we discover the optimal beamforming structure of the problem and based on which, we introduce a low-dimensional EG-FP algorithm with computational complexity independent of the number of transmit antennas. This feature is especially beneficial in scenarios with a large number of transmit antennas. The proposed algorithms are then extended to handle imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT). Numerical results demonstrate that the MMF rate achieved by our proposed algorithms closely matches that of the conventional successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm and significantly outperforms other baseline schemes. Remarkably, the average CPU time of the proposed algorithms is less than 10\% of the runtime required by the SCA algorithm, showing the efficiency and scalability of the proposed algorithms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15817v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A major open problem in computational complexity is the existence of a one-way function, namely a function from strings to strings which is computationally easy to compute but hard to invert. Levin (2023) formulated the notion of one-way functions from reals (infinite bit-sequences) to reals in terms of computability, and asked whether partial computable one-way functions exist. We give a strong positive answer using the hardness of the halting problem and exhibiting a total computable one-way function.</description>

      <title>Entropy Loss: An Interpretability Amplifier of 3D Object Detection Network for Intelligent Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the increasing complexity of the traffic environment, the significance of safety perception in intelligent driving is intensifying. Traditional methods in the field of intelligent driving perception rely on deep learning, which suffers from limited interpretability, often described as a "black box." This paper introduces a novel type of loss function, termed "Entropy Loss," along with an innovative training strategy. Entropy Loss is formulated based on the functionality of feature compression networks within the perception model. Drawing inspiration from communication systems, the information transmission process in a feature compression network is expected to demonstrate steady changes in information volume and a continuous decrease in information entropy. By modeling network layer outputs as continuous random variables, we construct a probabilistic model that quantifies changes in information volume. Entropy Loss is then derived based on these expectations, guiding the update of network parameters to enhance network interpretability. Our experiments indicate that the Entropy Loss training strategy accelerates the training process. Utilizing the same 60 training epochs, the accuracy of 3D object detection models using Entropy Loss on the KITTI test set improved by up to 4.47\% compared to models without Entropy Loss, underscoring the method's efficacy. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/yhbcode000/Eloss-Interpretability.</description>

      <title>Gradient Descent Finds Over-Parameterized Neural Networks with Sharp Generalization for Nonparametric Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02904v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study nonparametric regression by an over-parameterized two-layer neural network trained by gradient descent (GD) in this paper. We show that, if the neural network is trained by GD with early stopping, then the trained network renders a sharp rate of the nonparametric regression risk of $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_n^2)$, which is the same rate as that for the classical kernel regression trained by GD with early stopping, where $\epsilon_n$ is the critical population rate of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) associated with the network and $n$ is the size of the training data. It is remarked that our result does not require distributional assumptions about the covariate as long as the covariate is bounded, in a strong contrast with many existing results which rely on specific distributions of the covariates such as the spherical uniform data distribution or distributions satisfying certain restrictive conditions. The rate $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_n^2)$ is known to be minimax optimal for specific cases, such as the case that the NTK has a polynomial eigenvalue decay rate which happens under certain distributional assumptions on the covariates. Our result formally fills the gap between training a classical kernel regression model and training an over-parameterized but finite-width neural network by GD for nonparametric regression without distributional assumptions on the bounded covariate. We also provide confirmative answers to certain open questions or address particular concerns in the literature of training over-parameterized neural networks by GD with early stopping for nonparametric regression, including the characterization of the stopping time, the lower bound for the network width, and the constant learning rate used in GD.</description>

      <title>Entropy functionals and equilibrium states in mixed quantum-classical dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18587v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The computational challenges posed by many-particle quantum systems are often overcome by mixed quantum-classical (MQC) models in which certain degrees of freedom are treated as classical while others are retained as quantum. One of the fundamental questions raised by this hybrid picture involves the characterization of the information associated to MQC systems. Based on the theory of dynamical invariants in Hamiltonian systems, here we propose a family of hybrid entropy functionals that consistently specialize to the usual R\'enyi and Shannon entropies. Upon considering the MQC Ehrenfest model for the dynamics of quantum and classical probabilities, we apply the hybrid Shannon entropy to characterize equilibrium configurations for simple Hamiltonians. The present construction also applies beyond Ehrenfest dynamics.</description>

      <title>Zak-OTFS with Spread Carrier Waveforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08079v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation is a communication framework that parameterizes the wireless channel in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, where the parameters map directly to physical attributes of the scatterers that comprise the scattering environment. As a consequence, the channel can be efficiently acquired and equalized. The Zak-OTFS carrier is a pulse in the DD domain, and the Zak transform converts it to a pulse train modulated by a tone (pulsone) in the time domain. The pulsone waveform is localized rather than spread, and it suffers from high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR). We describe how to transform the orthonormal basis of Zak-OTFS pulsones into an orthonormal basis of spread carrier waveforms with low PAPR (only $6.58$ dB) that support communication in the presence of mobility and delay spread. This transformation is realized by a unitary transform based on the discrete affine Fourier transform. Unlike other spread modulations that achieve low PAPR by spreading information across a wider bandwidth (thus reducing the spectral efficiency), the proposed spread carrier-based Zak-OTFS achieves full spectral efficiency like pulsone-based Zak-OTFS, with $5.6$ dB lower PAPR per basis element. We demonstrate uncoded bit error rate (BER) similar to pulsone-based Zak-OTFS, and improved BER performance over competing methods based on OFDM and OTFS in high mobility &amp; delay spread environments.</description>

      <title>Efficient Online Random Sampling via Randomness Recycling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.18879v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: ``Randomness recycling'' is a powerful algorithmic technique for reusing a fraction of the random information consumed by a probabilistic algorithm to reduce its entropy requirements. This article presents a family of randomness recycling algorithms for efficiently sampling a sequence $X_1, X_2, X_3, \dots$ of discrete random variables whose joint distribution follows an arbitrary stochastic process. We develop randomness recycling techniques to reduce the entropy cost of a variety of prominent sampling algorithms, which include uniform sampling, inverse transform sampling, lookup-table sampling, alias sampling, and discrete distribution generating (DDG) tree sampling. Our method achieves an expected amortized entropy cost of $H(X_1,\dots,X_k)/k + \varepsilon$ input bits per output sample using $O(\log(1/\varepsilon))$ space as $k\to\infty$, which is arbitrarily close to the optimal Shannon entropy rate of $H(X_1,\dots,X_k)/k$ bits per sample. The combination of space, time, and entropy properties of our method improves upon the Knuth and Yao entropy-optimal algorithm and Han and Hoshi interval algorithm for sampling a discrete random sequence.
  On the empirical side, we show that randomness recycling enables state-of-the-art runtime performance on the Fisher-Yates shuffle when using a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator; and it can also speed up discrete Gaussian samplers. Accompanying the manuscript is a performant software library in the C programming language that uses randomness recycling to accelerate several existing algorithms for random sampling.</description>

      <title>Precoded Zak-OTFS for Per-Carrier Equalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.09894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.09894v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Zak-OTFS (orthogonal time frequency space) modulation the carrier waveform is a pulse in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, formally a quasi-periodic localized function with specific periods along delay and Doppler. When the channel delay spread is less than the delay period, and the channel Doppler spread is less than the Doppler period, the response to a single Zak-OTFS carrier provides an image of the scattering environment and can be used to predict the effective channel at all other carriers. The image of the scattering environment changes slowly, making it possible to employ precoding at the transmitter. Precoding techniques were developed more than thirty years ago for wireline modem channels (V.34 standard) defined by linear convolution where a pulse in the time domain (TD) is used to probe the one-dimensional partial response channel. The action of a doubly spread channel on Zak-OTFS modulation determines a two-dimensional partial response channel defined by twisted convolution, and we develop a novel precoding technique for this channel. The proposed precoder leads to separate equalization of each DD carrier which has significantly lower complexity than joint equalization of all carriers. Further, the effective precoded channel results in non-interfering DD carriers which significantly reduces the overhead of guard carriers separating data and pilot carriers, which improves the spectral efficiency significantly.</description>

      <title>Differential Communication in Channels with Mobility and Delay Spread using Zak-OTFS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Zak-transform based orthogonal time frequency space (Zak-OTFS) is a delay-Doppler (DD) domain modulation scheme in which the signal processing is carried out in the DD domain. The channel when viewed in the DD domain is predictable. However, even with Zak-OTFS, pilots need to be sent periodically, albeit at a lower rate. In this paper, we propose a differential communication scheme for Zak-OTFS systems that alleviates the need for periodic pilot transmission. Towards this, we analytically show that the detected data can be used as a pilot and that the channel estimate obtained from the detected data can enable further detection enabling the "differential" aspect of the communication. Specifically, we leverage the prediction capability of the DD channel in Zak-OTFS to use the channel estimate (obtained from detected data symbols treated as pilots) in the previous instant to detect data in the next instant and propagate this forward. The advantages are two fold. First, it allows the data symbols to enjoy higher energy since the energy that would otherwise be required for pilot symbols can also be allocated to data symbols. Second, it allows for full spectral efficiency compared to point or embedded pilots. Comparison with the full spectral efficiency achieving spread pilot scheme shows that the proposed method achieves better bit-error rate at lower complexity.</description>
