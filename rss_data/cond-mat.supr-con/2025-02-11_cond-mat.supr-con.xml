      <title>Superconducting Properties of the Titanium-Based Oxides Compounds: A Review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05481</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, the superconductivity of novel layered materials, titanium-based pnictide oxides, was discovered. Due to the properties of possessing both cuprate and iron-based superconductors, these compounds have attracted the interest of researchers. Titanium pnictide oxides were reported to have CDW or SDW anomalies, theoretical calculations indicate that this DW behavior originates from the Ti2O layer. These compounds which have Ti2O layers provide a basis for studying the relationship between superconductivity and DW behavior. Superconductivity and DW behavior are two different electronic behaviors that typically compete with each other, but sometimes coexist. The relationship between them has always been a focus of condensed matter physics research. Through in-depth research on titanium-based superconductors, it may help us explain the unconventional superconducting transition phenomena present in iron-based superconductors. In this review, we introduce the latest research on titanium pnictide oxides and the electronic properties of these novel superconductors.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a superconductor electrons form pairs despite the Coulomb repulsion as a result of an effective attractive interaction mediated by, for example phonons. In the present paper DeGennes' description of the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction is adopted for the effective interaction. This model is generalized by including the elastic response of the charge-compensating background and the BCS gap equation is solved for the resulting effective electron-electron interaction. It is demonstrated that the superconducting critical temperature becomes strongly enhanced when the material is tuned close to a structural instability.</description>

      <title>Higgs-mode-induced instability and kinetic inductance in strongly dc-biased dirty-limit superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A perturbative ac field superposed on a dc bias ($J_b$) is known to excite the Higgs mode in superconductors. The dirty limit, where disorder enhances the Higgs resonance, provides an ideal setting for this study and is also relevant to many superconducting devices operating under strong dc biases. In this paper, we derive a general formula for the complex conductivity of disordered superconductors under an arbitrary dc bias using the Keldysh-Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity. This formula is relatively simple, making it more accessible to a broader research community. Our analysis reveals that in a strongly dc-biased dirty-limit superconductor, the Higgs mode induces an instability in the homogeneous superflow within a specific frequency window, making the high-current-carrying state vulnerable to ac perturbations. This instability, which occurs exclusively in the ${\rm ac} \parallel {\rm dc}$ configuration, leads to a non-monotonic dependence of kinetic inductance on frequency and bias strength. By carefully tuning the dc bias and the frequency of the ac perturbation, the kinetic inductance can be enhanced by nearly two orders of magnitude. In the weak dc bias regime, our formula recovers the well-known quadratic dependence, $L_k \propto 1+ C(J_b/J_{\rm dp})^2$, with coefficients $C=0.409$ for ${\rm ac} \parallel {\rm dc}$ and $C=0.136$ for ${\rm ac} \perp {\rm dc}$, where $J_{\rm dp}$ is the equilibrium depairing current density. These findings establish a robust theoretical framework for dc-biased superconducting systems and suggest that Higgs mode physics could be exploited in the design and optimization of superconducting detectors. Moreover, they may lead to a yet-to-be-explored detector concept based on Higgs mode physics.</description>

      <title>Tailoring the normal and superconducting state properties of ternary scandium tellurides, Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ ($M = $ Fe, Ru and Ir) through chemical substitution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pursuit of a unifying theory for non-BCS superconductivity has faced significant challenges. One approach to overcome such challenges is to perform systematic investigations into superconductors containing \textit{d}-electron metals in order to elucidate their underlying mechanisms. Recently, the Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = d-electron metal) family has emerged as a unique series of isostructural compounds exhibiting superconductivity across a range of $3d$, $4d$, and $5d$ electron systems. In this study, we employ muon spin rotation, neutron diffraction, and magnetisation techniques to probe the normal and superconducting states at a microscopic level. Our findings reveal extremely dilute superfluid densities that correlate with the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$). Additionally, we identify high-temperature normal-state transitions that are inversely correlated with $T_\mathrm{c}$. Notably, in Sc$_6$FeTe$_2$, the superconducting pairing symmetry is most likely characterised by two nodeless gaps, one of which closes as electron correlations diminish in the Ru and Ir Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ compounds. These results classify the Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ compounds ($M$ = Fe, Ru, Ir) as unconventional bulk superconductors, where the normal-state transitions and superconducting properties are governed by the interplay between electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling of the d-electron metal.</description>

      <title>Odd-parity superconductivity underpinned by antiferromagnetism in heavy fermion metal YbRh$_2$Si$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Topological superconductors are essential elements of the periodic table of topological quantum matter. However, the relevant odd-parity spin-triplet superconductors are rare. We report high-resolution measurements of the complex electrical impedance of YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ down to 0.4 mK, that reveal the presence of several superconducting states, suppressed differently by magnetic field, both Pauli-limited and beyond the Pauli limit. Superconductivity is abruptly switched off at the critical field of the primary antiferromagnetic order. The onset of electro-nuclear spin density wave order enhances the superconductivity, which we account for by the simultaneous formation of a spin-triplet pair density wave. Together these observations provide compelling evidence for odd-parity superconductivity, and its underpinning by antiferromagnetism, and allow us to identify the topological helical state.</description>

      <title>Theoretical Predictions of MB5N5: Atom-Stuffed Boronitride Clathrate Cages Derived from the High-Pressure Superhydride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates 180 MX5Y5 (X, Y = B, C, or N) clathrate-like structures derived from MH10 superhydrides using high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT) geometry optimizations and phonon calculations. A wide variety of electropositive and electronegative encapsulated atoms were considered. From all of the studied systems only 31 MB5N5 phases were found to be dynamically stable at ambient pressure. The highest 1-atmosphere superconducting critical transition temperature was predicted for FB5N5. However, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that all of the identified superconducting phases decompose by 300~K at 1~atm, while only nine semiconducting phases remained thermally stable. Our findings underscore the critical role of kinetic and thermal stability in predicting viable superconductors. The electronic structure of the MB5N5 compounds were rationalized in terms of electron donating and withdrawing intercalants, and machine-learning based predictions of their mechanical properties were compared with those of an empty boronitride cage.</description>

      <title>Emulating Novel Topological Phases with Ultracold Fermions in Optical Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a feasible scheme utilizing the Floquet engineering platform with ultracold atoms in optical lattices to emulate both pair-hopping processes and singlet/triplet pairing interactions, aiming to simulate and control novel topologically nontrivial phases. Our large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal three distinct topological regimes: (i) a Majorana-enabled spin-density-wave (MS) phase characterized by exponentially localized edge charges, non-local single-fermion edge correlations, a doubly degenerate entanglement spectrum; (ii) a $z$-axis polarized triplet superconducting (TS) phase manifesting fractionalized edge spin; and (iii) a novel x-directional triplet superconducting (XTS) phase exhibiting fractional edge spins along the $x$-direction and non-local single-particle edge correlations, merging characteristics of the edge states from both MS and TS phases. Therefore, our work establishes a versatile framework for exploring exotic quantum phases and non-Abelian edge states in number-conserving systems.</description>

      <title>Electrostatic field-driven supercurrent suppression in ionic-gated metallic Josephson nanotransistors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2107.00935v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown the possibility of tuning the transport properties of metallic nanosized superconductors through a gate voltage. These results renewed the longstanding debate on the interaction between electrostatic fields and superconductivity. Indeed, different works suggested competing mechanisms as the cause of the effect: an unconventional electric field-effect or quasiparticle injection. Here, we provide conclusive evidence for the electrostatic-field-driven control of the supercurrent in metallic nanosized superconductors, by realizing ionic-gated superconducting field-effect nanotransistors (ISFETs) where electron injection is impossible. Our Nb ISFETs show giant suppression of the superconducting critical current of up to 45%. Moreover, the bipolar supercurrent suppression observed in different ISFETs, together with invariant critical temperature and normal-state resistance, also excludes conventional charge accumulation/depletion. Therefore, the microscopic explanation of this effect calls upon a novel theory able to describe the nontrivial interaction of static electric fields with conventional superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Kondo $s$-$d$ exchange in the CuO$_2$ plane as the long sought interaction determining $T_c$ in cuprates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.18235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.18235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The well-known Pavarini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 047003 (2001)] correlation between the critical temperature $T_{c,\,\mathrm{max}}$ and the shape of the Fermi contour of the optimally hole-doped cuprates is explained within the framework of the BCS theory with Kondo exchange interaction incorporated as a pairing mechanism. The strong influence of the relative position of the Cu4$s$ level with respect to the Cu3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ level on the critical temperature $T_c$ reveals why the $s$-$d$ hybridization of the conduction band is so important. This hybridization is proportional to the $s$-$d$ exchange scattering amplitude between the conduction electrons -- the mechanism of d-wave pairing in the CuO$_2$ plane. In other words the Kondo interaction considered as a pairing mechanism in the CuO$_2$ plane gives a natural explanation of the correlation between the critical temperature and the shape of the Fermi contour. We have a hint that possibly the long sought pairing mechanism has possibly been found and the Kondo exchange interaction as a property of strongly correlated quantum matter deserves further attention in the physics of layered cuprates.</description>

      <title>Correlation between the strength of low-temperature T-linear normal-state resistivity and $T_{\rm c}$ in overdoped electron-doped cuprate superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.12414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The recently observed an intimate link between the nature of the strange metallic normal-state and superconductivity in the overdoped electron-doped cuprate superconductors is calling for an explanation. Here the intrinsic correlation between the strength of the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ in the overdoped electron-doped cuprate superconductors is studied within the framework of the kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity. On the one hand, the main ingredient is identified into a electron pairing mechanism involving the spin excitation, and then $T_{\rm c}$ has a dome-like shape doping dependence with the maximal $T_{\rm c}$ that occurs at around the optimal electron doping. On the other hand, in the normal-state above $T_{\rm c}$, the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity in the overdoped regime arises from the momentum relaxation due to the electron umklapp scattering mediated by the same spin excitation. This same spin excitation that governs both the electron umklapp scattering responsible for the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and electron pairing responsible for superconductivity naturally generates a correlation between the strength of the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and $T_{\rm c}$ in the overdoped regime.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic constraint on $T_c$ for unconventional superconductivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07128v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Can room temperature superconductivity be achieved in correlated materials under ambient pressure? Our answer to this billion-dollar question is probably no, at least for realistic models within the current theoretical framework. This is shown by our systematic simulations on the pairing instability of some effective models for two-dimensional superconductivity. For a square lattice model with nearest-neighbour pairing, we find a plaquette state formed of weakly-connected $2\times2$ blocks for sufficiently large pairing interaction. The superconductivity is suppressed on both sides away from its melting quantum critical point. Thus, the magnitude of $T_c$ is constrained by the plaquette state for the $d$-wave superconductivity, in resemblance of other competing orders. We then extend our simulations to a variety of effective models covering nearest-neighbour or onsite pairings, single layer or two-layer structures, intralayer or interlayer pairings, and find an intrinsic maximum of the ratio $T_c/J\approx 0.04-0.07$, where $J$ is the pairing interaction. Comparison with existing experiments supports this constraint in cuprate, iron-based, nickelate, and heavy fermion superconductors, despite that these compounds are so complicated well beyond our simplified models. As a result, the known families of unconventional superconductivity, possibly except the infinite-layer nickelates, seem to almost exhaust their potentials in reaching the maximal $T_c$ allowed by their respective $J$, while achieving room temperature superconductor would require a much larger $J$ beyond 400-700 meV, which seems unrealistic in existing correlated materials and hence demands novel pairing mechanisms. The agreement also implies some deep underlying principles of the constraint that urge for a more rigorous theoretical understanding.</description>
