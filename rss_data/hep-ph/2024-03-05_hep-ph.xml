      <title>Two-loop contributions of axion-like particles to electromagnetic and chromomagnetic form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axions and axion-like particles emerge in many models for physics beyond the Standard Model. Thus, they have gained increasing research interest in both experimental and theoretical physics apart from their original proposition as a solution to the strong $CP$-problem. Among other aspects it has recently been shown that ALPs can potentially provide a solution to the long-lasting discrepancy between theory and experiment of the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon. Provided that the ALP has flavor-violating couplings to leptons, they can also mediate flavor-violating decays like $\mu\to e\gamma$. Both processes are mediated through related form factors that we compute to two-loop order. We further show numerical implications of our calculations and how they might affect constraints on ALP couplings derived from experiments.</description>

      <title>An exciting hint towards the solution of the neutron lifetime puzzle?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00914v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the neutron lifetime puzzle, a discrepancy between beam and bottle measurements of the weak neutron decay. Since both types of measurements are realized at different times after the nuclear production of free neutrons, we argue that the existence of an excited state could be responsible for the different lifetimes. We elaborate on the required properties of such a state and construct a concrete toy model with several of the required characteristics.</description>

      <title>Heavy neutral lepton search and $\mu \to e \gamma$ constraints in case of type-I seesaw</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00983v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Within type-I seesaw mechanism it is possible to have large (order one) light-heavy neutrino mixing even in case of low right-handed neutrino mass scale (of the order of GeV). This implies large lepton flavor violation. As example we consider the process $\mu \to e \gamma$ that can have a branching up to $10^{-8}$ within type-I seesaw (in contrast with the tiny value $10^{-54}$ expected). Such an enhancing of lepton flavor violation can be used to constraint the parameter space of long lived particle experiments.</description>

      <title>Strangeness plus-one ($S=+1$) resonance-state $P^{+*}_0$ via $K^+n\to K^{*0}p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our current study, we delve into the peak-like structure observed during the reaction process of $K^+n\to K^{0}p$ at approximately $\sqrt{s}\sim2.5$ GeV. Our focus centers on exploring the potential $S=+1$ resonance $P^{+*}_0\equiv P^*_0$ as an excited state within the extended vector-meson and baryon ($VB$) antidecuplet. To achieve this aim, we employ the effective Lagrangian method in conjunction with the $(u,t)$-channel Regge approach, operating within the tree-level Born approximation. We thoroughly examine various spin-parity quantum numbers for the resonance, resulting in a compelling description of the data, where $M_{P^*_0}\approx2.5$ GeV and $\Gamma_{P^*_0}\approx100$ MeV. Furthermore, we propose an experimental technique to amplify the signal-to-noise ratio ($S/N$) for accurately measuring the resonance. Notably, our findings reveal that background interference diminishes significantly within the $K^*$ forward-scattering region in the center-of-mass frame when the $K^*$ is perpendicularly polarized to the reaction plane. Additionally, we explore the recoil-proton spin asymmetry to definitively determine the spin and parity of the resonance. This study stands to serve as a valuable reference for designing experimental setups aimed at investigating and comprehending exotic phenomena in QCD. Specifically, our insights will inform future J-PARC experiments, particularly those employing higher kaon beam energies.</description>

      <title>Study of identified particle production as a function of transverse event activity classifier, $S_{T}$ in p$-$p collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A new observable, $S_{T}$, is introduced in terms of the sum of the transverse momentum of charged particles ($\sum_{i} p_{T_{i}}$ ) produced in proton proton (p$-$p) collisions at LHC energies to probe the underlying events (UE). The UE are defined as those aspects of proton-proton collisions that are not attributed to the primary hard scattering process, but rather to the accompanying interactions of the rest of the proton. The conventional approach of studying underlying events is usually carried out by defining topological regions with respect to the leading particle in an event. The transverse region is generally sensitive to UE and various classifiers have been used to discriminate the extent of UE activity regions. The production of identified particles like $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, p , $K_{S}^{0}$, and $\Lambda^{0}$ are studied in different ranges of transverse activity classifier in p$-$p collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13 $ TeV using pQCD inspired PYTHIA 8 event generator. A comparative analysis of the identified particle spectra, mean multiplicity and mean transverse momentum has been carried out with respect to $S_{T}$ and the performance of this new observable is gauged by comparing the results with previously defined $R_{T}$ observable.</description>

      <title>Analyzing the transport coefficients and observables of a rotating QGP medium in kinetic theory framework with a novel approach to the collision integral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work, we have studied how the rotation of the QGP medium affects the transport coefficients and observables in heavy ion collisions. For the noncentral collisions, although most of the angular momentum gets carried away by the spectators, there still remains a finite angular momentum with a finite range of angular velocity, which thus incites rotation in the produced matter. As a result, various properties of the QGP medium are likely to be modulated by the rotation. We have calculated the transport coefficients and observables, such as electrical conductivity, thermal conductivity, Knudsen number, elliptic flow, specific heat at constant pressure, specific heat at constant volume, trace anomaly, thermal diffusion constant and isothermal compressibility using the kinetic theory to see the effect of rotation on them. In particular, we have used the novel relaxation time approximation for the collision integral in the relativistic Boltzmann transport equation to derive the transport coefficients and compared them with their values in the relaxation time approximation within the kinetic theory approach in conjunction with the finite angular velocity. We have found that the angular velocity plays an important role and enhances the flow of charge and heat in the medium. Further, as compared to the relaxation time approximation, the electrical and thermal conductivities have smaller values in the novel relaxation time approximation and these differences between the conductivities in the said approximations are more pronounced at high temperature than at low temperature. Furthermore, all the aforesaid observables are found to be sensitive to the rotation of the QGP medium.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Phase Transition in Singlet Extensions of The Standard Model with Dimension-Six Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The significance of the electroweak phase transition is undeniable, and although initially it was believed that it was second-order, it is now believed that it is a first-order transition. However, it is not a strong first-order phase transition in the context of the Standard Model and the remedy to this issue is to use the Higgs portal and directly couple the Higgs to a hidden scalar sector. This can result in a strong electroweak phase transition, while the couplings to a hidden scalar are constrained by several phenomenological constraints, such as the sphaleron rate criterion and the branching ratio of the Higgs to invisible channels. In this work, we consider the standard singlet extensions of the Standard Model, including dimension-six non-renormalizable operators that couple a real singlet scalar field with the Higgs doublet. As a result, we examine the effects of those Higgs-singlet couplings on the electroweak phase transition. The effective theory, where the non-renormalizable couplings originate from, is considered to be active beyond 15$\,$TeV. As we show, the Universe experiences a two-step electroweak phase transition, a primary phase transition in the singlet sector at a high temperature, and then a subsequent first-order phase transition from the singlet vacuum to the electroweak vacuum. The singlet's phase transition can either be second-order or first-order, depending on the singlet mass and its couplings to the Higgs. In particular, we show that the dimension-six operator assists in generating a strong electroweak phase transition in regions of the parameter space that were excluded in the previous singlet extensions of the Standard Model. This is further apparent for low singlet masses \(m_S &lt; m_H/2\) which are rarely taken into account in the literature due to the invisible branching ratio of the Higgs boson.</description>

      <title>MeV gamma rays from Q-ball decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the supersymmetric Q balls which decay at present and find that they create a distinctive spectrum of gamma rays at around O(10) MeV. The charge of the Q ball is lepton numbers in order for the lifetime to be as long as the present age of the universe, and the main decay products are light leptons. However, as the charge of the Q ball decreases, the decay channel into pions becomes kinematically allowed towards the end of the decay, and the pions are produced at rest. Immediately, $\pi^0$ decays into two photons with the energy of 67.5 MeV, half the pion mass, which exhibits a unique emission line. In addition, $\pi^\pm$ decay into $\mu^\pm$, which further decay with emitting internal bremsstrahlung, whose spectrum has a sharp cutoff at $\sim$50 MeV. If the observations would find these peculiar features of the gamma-ray spectrum in the future, it could be a smoking gun of the supersymmetric Q-ball decay at present.</description>

      <title>Production of $X_b$ via radiative transition of $\Upsilon(10753)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the radiative transitions between the $\Upsilon(10753)$, the $S$-$D$ mixed state of the $\Upsilon(4S)$ and $\Upsilon_1(3\,{}^3D_1)$, and the $X_b$, the heavy quark flavor symmetry counterpart of the $X(3782)$ in the bottomonium sector. The radiative transition was assumed to occur through the intermediate bottom mesons, including $P$-wave $B_1^{(\prime)}$ mesons as well as the $S$-wave $B^{(*)}$ ones. The consideration of the $B_1^{(\prime)}$ mesons leads to the couplings to be in $S$-wave, and hence enhances the contributions of the intermediate meson loops. The radiative decay width for the $\Upsilon(10753)\to\gamma X_b$ is predicted to be order of $10~\mathrm{keV}$, corresponding to a branching fraction of $10^{-4}$. Based on the theoretical results, we strongly suggest to search for the $X_b$ in the $e^+e^-\to\gamma X_b$ with $X_b\to\pi\pi\chi_{b1}$ near $\sqrt{s}=10.754~\mathrm{GeV}$, and it is hoped that the calculations here could be tested by the future Belle II experiments.</description>

      <title>Elliptic anisotropy of open-charm hadron in p--Pb collisions at LHC energies from parton scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The elliptic azimuthal anisotropy coefficient ($v_{2}$) of open-charm hadron at midrapidity ($|\eta&lt;1|$) was studied in p--Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}}=$ 8.16 TeV using a multi-phase transport model (AMPT). By implementing an additional heavy quark--antiquark pair production trigger in the AMPT, we obtained a simultaneously description of the $p_{\mathrm{T}}$ spectrum and $v_{2}$ of $D^{0}$ meson. Then the predictions for the $v_{2}$ of charm hadrons including $D^{+}$, $D_{s}^{+}$ and $\Lambda_{c}^{+}$ in p--Pb collisions are provided for the first time. We found that the $v_{2}$ of open-charm hadron follows the number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling in high-multiplicity p--Pb collisions, and is significantly affected by the parton scattering process. These findings further demonstrate the importance of partonic degrees of freedom in small collision systems for heavy flavors, and provide referential value for future measurements of azimuthal anisotropy at the LHC energies.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the relic density of asymmetric dark matter with long-range interactions is affected by the Sommerfeld enhancement. The annihilation cross section of asymmetric dark matter is enhanced due to the Sommerfeld effect. It results the relic density is decreased. Using the Planck date, the constraints on the asymmetry factor and coupling required to attain the observed dark matter density are obtained. We derive the upper bounds on the mass for asymmetric dark matter in s-wave and p-wave annihilation cases.</description>

      <title>Extranatural Warped Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether inflation in the early universe can be induced by an extra component of a five-dimensional ${\rm U(1)}$ gauge field in the Randall-Sundrum warped spacetime or not. We show that an effective potential obtained by quantum corrections can act as an inflaton potential by finding parameter regions consistent with Planck 2018 results. In our model, fields involved in inflation obey a different type of boundary condition from that of the visible particles, and a surviving Wilson line phase can play a specific role for physics beyond the standard model.</description>

      <title>Identify the new state $Y(3872)$ as the P-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The BESIII Collaboration recently observed a new charmonium-like vector state $Y(3872)$ in $e^+e^-\rightarrow D\bar{D}$, which should be the first P-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ molecular resonance. The experimental and theoretical identification of the P-wave dimeson state holds paramount importance in enhancing our comprehension of the non-perturbative QCD and few-body physics. Its existence is firmly established in a unified meson-exchange model which simultaneously depicts the features of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$, $Z_c(3900)$ and $T_{cc}(3875)$. This scenario can be directly examined in the $e^+e^-\rightarrow D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ cross section to see whether a resonance exists at the threshold. The credibility of the investigations is also ensured by the fact that the P-wave interaction dominantly arises from the well-known long-range pion exchange. Additionally, the existence of the P-wave resonance only depends on the interaction strength and is less sensitive to the potential shapes. We extensively calculate all systems up to P-wave with various quantum numbers and predict a dense population of the $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ and $DD^*$ states, where the S-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ state with $I^G (J^{PC})=0^- (1^{+-})$, P-wave $D\bar{D}^*/\bar{D}D^*$ state with $I^G(J^{PC})=0^+(0^{-+})$, and P-wave $DD^*$ state with $I(J^P)=0(0^-)$ are more likely to be observed in experiments.</description>

      <title>Dark matter semi-annihilation for inert scalar multiplets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01729v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter semi-annihilation is a process through which two dark matter candidates annihilate to a single dark matter particle and a non-dark matter particle. Such processes are common when the symmetry stabilizing the dark matter differs from $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and can lead to qualitatively different phenomenology. In this work, we study the viability of semi-annihilation models including one or two inert multiplets. For one multiplet, we show that there does not exist any viable model in which semi-annihilation is efficient. For two multiplets, semi-annihilation can be efficient, but the number of viable and technically natural models is limited. We then perform a detailed study of the most promising model, showing that the correct relic abundance can be obtained for a wide range of masses.</description>

      <title>The rotation effect on the deconfinement phase transition in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01814v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The impact of rotation on the deconfinement phase transition under the EM system of the soft and the hard wall models in holographic QCD is studied in this paper. The metric by cylindrical coordinates with rotation is introduced into the system to calculate the Hawking temperature. The first holographic study on the influence of the radius of a homogeneous rotating system on the phase diagram is proposed. It is found that the phase transition temperature hardly changes with the rotation angular velocity for a small rotation radius. Only with a larger rotation radius can the change in rotational angular velocity significantly alter the phase transition temperature. The phase transition temperature decreases rapidly with the increase of rotation angular velocity as the rotation radius increases.</description>

      <title>Charged particle multiplicity fluctuation in $A-A$ collisions at RHIC and LHC energies using Angantyr model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Event-by-event fluctuations of the charged particle multiplicity are studied for a wide range of centralities for Au$-$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 200 GeV,
  Pb$-$Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 2.76 TeV and 5.02 TeV using the Pythia 8 Angantyr model. The centrality dependence of $\omega_{ch}$ observable, which quantifies the fluctuations in terms of scaled variance is studied for different pseudorapidity ranges and has been compared with those obtained from a simple participant superposition model. The $\omega_{ch}$ was found to be lower than the expectations from the participant model. The estimate would act like a baseline for current and future measurements of event-by-event fluctuations in the charged particle multiplicities in systems at LHC energies where no de-confined medium of quarks and gluons are formed.</description>

      <title>Double-mixing CP violation in $B$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a long-overlooked CP violation observable, termed double-mixing CP violation, which arises from the interference between two neutral meson oscillating paths involved in a decay chain. The double-mixing CP violation is beneficial for the precise test of the Standard Model CKM mechanism, as it offers the potential to extract weak phases without pollution from strong dynamics. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the double-mixing CP violation, we perform phenomenological analyses on the cascade decays of the $B^0_d$ and $B^0_s$ mesons. Our results show that the double-mixing CP violation can be very significant in certain decay channels, such as $B^0_s \to \rho^0 K \to \rho^0(\pi^-\ell^+\nu_\ell)$. In addition, we employ the decay process $B^0_d \to D^0 K \to (K^-\pi^+)(\pi\ell\nu)$ to demonstrate that the involved strong and weak phases can be directly determined from the experimental data without any theoretical inputs.</description>

      <title>Examining the critical phenomenon of pion parton distribution: Insights from the Moment Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01937</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01937v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A recent study by Wang {\it et al.}(arXiv:2309.01417) proposed a novel connection between the nature of the parton distribution function (PDF) and the characteristics of its moments. In this study, we apply these findings to analyze the evolution of the pion valence quark PDF, garnering valuable qualitative insights. Firstly, we validate the non-negativity and continuity of the PDF across a wide range of scales, indicating the logical consistency of our chosen evolution scheme. Subsequently, we examine the unimodality of both the PDF and its transformed counterpart, the xPDF, i.e., the parton distribution function multiplied by the momentum fraction. We observe a smooth evolution of the peak position of the xPDF towards the small-$x$ region with increasing scale, while intriguingly, the PDF undergoes a phase of bimodal competition as the energy scale evolves.</description>

      <title>Single charged Higgs pair production in exclusive processes at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The production of a single charged Higgs boson pair by photon - photon interactions in $pp$ collisions at the LHC is investigated in this exploratory study. We focus on the exclusive production, which is characterized by intact protons and two - rapidity gaps in the final state, and assume the type - I two - Higgs - doublet model, which still allows a light charged Higgs. Assuming the leptonic $H^{\pm}\rightarrow [\tau\nu_{\tau}]$ decay mode, we derive predictions for the transverse momentum, rapidity and invariant mass distributions of the $\tau^+ \tau^-$ pair for different values of the charged Higgs mass. The contributions of different background processes are also estimated. Our results indicate that the contribution of the exclusive $H^+ H^-$ production for the $[\tau^{+}\nu_{\tau}][\tau^{-} \nu_{\tau}]$ final state is non - negligible and can, in principle, be used to searching for a light charged Higgs.</description>

      <title>A Global View of the EDM Landscape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Permanent electric dipole moments (EDMs) are sensitive probes of the symmetry structure of elementary particles, which in turn is closely tied to the baryon asymmetry in the universe. A meaningful interpretation framework for EDM measurements has to be based on effective quantum field theory. We interpret the measurements performed to date in terms of a hadronic-scale Lagrangian, using the SFitter global analysis framework. We find that part of this Lagrangian is constrained very well, while some of the parameters suffer from too few high-precision measurements. Theory uncertainties lead to weaker model constraints, but can be controlled within the global analysis.</description>

      <title>Constraints from the Neutron EDM on Subleading Effective Operators for Direct Dark Matter Searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02083v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interactions between Dark Matter (DM) and nucleons relevant for direct search experiments can be organised in a model independent manner using a Galiliean invariant, non--relativistic effective field theory (NREFT). Here one expands the interactions in powers of the momentum transfer $\vec{q}$ and DM velocity $\vec{v}$. This approach generates many operators. The potentially most important subleading operators are odd under $T$, and can thus only be present in a theory with $CP$ violating interactions. We consider two such operators, called $\mathcal{O}_{10}$ and $\mathcal{O}_{11}$ in the literature, in simplified models with neutral spin$-0$ mediators; the couplings are chosen such that the coefficient of the leading spin independent (SI) operator, which survives for $\vec{v} \rightarrow 0$, vanishes at tree level. However, it is generically induced at the next order in perturbation theory. We perform a numerical comparison of the number of scattering events between interactions involving the $T-$odd operators and the corresponding loop induced SI contributions. We find that for ''maximal'' $CP$ violation the former can dominate over the latter. However, in two of the three models we consider, an electric dipole moment of the neutron (nEDM) is induced at two--loop order. We find that the experimental bound on the nEDM typically leads to undetectably small rates induced by ${\mathcal O}_{10}$. On the other hand, the model leading to a nonvanishing coefficient of ${\mathcal O}_{11}$ does not induce an nEDM.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Angular Correlation of $J/\psi$ Plus Jet Production at the EIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By investigating the soft gluon radiation in the $J/\psi$ plus jet photoproduction at the electron-ion collider (EIC), we demonstrate that the azimuthal angular correlations between the leading jet and heavy quarkonium provide a unique probe to the production mechanism of the latter. In particular, a significant $\cos(\phi)$ asymmetry is found for the color-singlet channel, whereas it vanishes or has an opposite sign for color-octet production, depending on the jet transverse momentum. Numerical results of $\cos(\phi)$ and $\cos(2\phi)$ asymmetries employing both the color-singlet model and the nonrelativistic QCD approach are presented for typical kinematics at the future EIC.</description>

      <title>The $Z_b$ states as the mixture of the molecular and diquark-anti-diquark components within the effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we reconsider the states $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$ by investigating the presence of diquark-anti-diquark components as well as the hadronic molecule components in the framework of effective field theory. The different masses of pseudoscalar mesons such as $\pi^{0}$, $\eta_{8}$, and $\eta_{0}$, as well as vector mesons like $\rho^{0}$ and $\omega$ violate the OZI rule that is well depicted under the $[U(3)_L\otimes U(3)_R]_{global}\otimes [U(3)_V]_{local}$ symmetry. To account for the contribution of intermediate bosons of heavy masses within the OBE model, we introduce an exponential form factor instead of the commonly used monopole form factor in the past. By solving the coupled-channel Schr\"{o}dinger equation with the Gaussian expansion method, our numerical results indicate that the $Z_b(10610)$ and $Z_b(10650)$ states can be explained as hadronic molecules slightly mixing with diquark-anti-diquark states.</description>

Abstract: In this study, the spectroscopic parameters of the exotic molecular states composed of mesons containing two heavy quarks (scalar-axial and pseudoscalar-axial meson combinations) are investigated within QCD sum rules. Our findings reveal that the molecular states containing charm quarks do not form bound states, whereas the states with b-quarks can form the exotic molecular states. This observation has significant implications for understanding the structure of these exotic states.</description>

      <title>Perturbative QCD meets phase quenching: The pressure of cold Quark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonperturbative inequalities constrain the pressure of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) with its phase-quenched version, a Sign-Problem-free theory amenable to lattice treatment. In the perturbative regime with a small QCD coupling constant $\alpha_s$, one of these inequalities manifests as an $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference between the phase-quenched and QCD pressures at large baryon chemical potential $\mu_\text{B}$. In this work, we generalize state-of-the-art algorithmic techniques in vacuum quantum field theory to address large-scale multiloop computations at finite chemical potential. Using this approach, we evaluate this $O(\alpha_s^3)$ difference and show that it is a gauge-independent and small positive number compared to the known perturbative coefficients at this order. This implies that phase-quenched lattice simulations can provide a complementary nonperturbative method for accurately determining the pressure of cold and dense quark matter at $O(\alpha_s^3)$.</description>

      <title>Analytic continuations and numerical evaluation of the Appell $F_1$, $F_3$, Lauricella $F_D^{(3)}$ and Lauricella-Saran $F_S^{(3)}$ and their Application to Feynman Integrals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present our investigation of the study of two variable hypergeometric series, namely Appell $F_{1}$ and $F_{3}$ series, and obtain a comprehensive list of its analytic continuations enough to cover the whole real $(x,y)$ plane, except on their singular loci. We also derive analytic continuations of their 3-variable generalization, the Lauricella $F_{D}^{(3)}$ series and the Lauricella-Saran $F_{S}^{(3)}$ series, leveraging the analytic continuations of $F_{1}$ and $F_{3}$, which ensures that the whole real $(x,y,z)$ space is covered, except on the singular loci of these functions. While these studies are motivated by the frequent occurrence of these multivariable hypergeometric functions in Feynman integral evaluation, they can also be used whenever they appear in other branches of mathematical physics. To facilitate their practical use, we provide four packages: $\texttt{AppellF1.wl}$, $\texttt{AppellF3.wl}$, $\texttt{LauricellaFD.wl}$, and $\texttt{LauricellaSaranFS.wl}$ in $\textit{MATHEMATICA}$. These packages are applicable for generic as well as non-generic values of parameters, keeping in mind their utilities in the evaluation of the Feynman integrals. We explicitly present various physical applications of these packages in the context of Feynman integral evaluation and compare the results using other means as well. Various $\textit{MATHEMATICA}$ notebooks demonstrating different numerical results are also provided along with this paper.</description>

      <title>The $U$-Matrix geometrical model for multi-particle production in high-energy hadronic collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inspired by the picture portraying the KNO scaling violation as an extension of the geometrical scaling violation, the current study proposes a phenomenological model for multi-particle production in hadron collisions based on the geometrical approach and using the $U$-Matrix unitarization scheme of the scattering amplitude. The model has been fine-tuned and all parameters have been derived from optimal fits to various hadronic multiplicity distributions data in $p + p(\bar{p})$ collisions across a broad range of energies. The results have revealed that our model furnishes a reasonable description of diverse multiplicity distributions at various energies. Besides, they have demonstrated a pronounced violation of the geometrical scaling, which eventually resulted in a significant violation of the KNO scaling. The study has also analyzed the higher-order moments of the multiplicity distribution. We have observed an unexpected overestimation of the fluctuations and correlations between final state particles with increasing energy, particularly above LHC energy. It is claimed that this overestimation is due to statistical fluctuations embedded in the $U$-matrix scheme. The findings of this study have shed light on the key role of the $U$-matrix scheme in the impact of collision geometry on multi-particle production processes at high energy.</description>

      <title>On the study of new proxies for second order cumulants of conserved charges in heavy-ion collisions with EPOS4</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proxies for cumulants of baryon number $B$, electric charge $Q$ and strangeness $S$ are usually measured in heavy-ion collisions via moments of net-number distribution of given hadronic species. Since these cumulants of conserved charges are expected to be sensitive to the existence of a critical point in the phase diagram of nuclear matter, it is crucial to ensure that the proxies used as substitutes are as close to them as possible. Hence, we use the EPOS4 framework to generate Au+Au collisions at several collision energies of the RHIC Beam Energy Scan. We compute $2^\text{nd}$ order net-cumulants of $\pi$, $K$ and $p$, for which experimental data has been published, as well as the corresponding conserved charge cumulants. We then compare them with proxies, defined in previous lattice QCD and Hadron Resonance Gas model studies, which are shown to reproduce more accurately their associated conserved charge cumulants. We investigate the impact of hadronic re-scatterings occurring in the late evolution of the system on these quantities, as well as the amount of signal actually originating from the bulk medium which endures a phase transition.</description>

      <title>A New Determination of the Millisecond Pulsar Gamma-Ray Luminosity Function and Implications for the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.00978v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It has been suggested that the Galactic Center Gamma-Ray Excess (GCE) could be produced by a large number of centrally-located millisecond pulsars. The fact that no such pulsar population has been detected implies that these sources must be very faint and very numerous. In this study, we use the contents of Fermi's recently released Third Pulsar Catalog (3PC) to measure the luminosity function of the millisecond pulsars in the Milky Way's Disk. We find that this source population exhibits a luminosity function with a mean gamma-ray luminosity of $\langle L_\gamma \rangle \sim 6 \times 10^{32}$ erg/s (integrated above 0.1 GeV). If the GCE were generated by millisecond pulsars with the same luminosity function, we find that $\sim$ 20 such sources from the Inner Galaxy population should have already been detected by Fermi and included in the 3PC. Given the lack of such observed sources, we exclude the hypothesis that the GCE is generated by pulsars with the same luminosity function as those in the Galactic Disk with a significance of $3.4\sigma$. We conclude that either less than 39% of the GCE is generated by pulsars, or that the millisecond pulsars in the Inner Galaxy are at least 5 times less luminous on average than those found in the Galactic Disk.</description>

      <title>Bulk-local dS$_3$ holography: the Matter with $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01040v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an algorithm which builds a concrete dual for large-radius 3d de Sitter with a timelike York boundary for both gravity and bulk effective fields. This generalizes the solvable $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ deformation, whose finite real spectrum accounts for the refined Gibbons-Hawking entropy as a microstate count while reproducing the radial static patch geometry. The required generalization to produce approximately local boundary conditions for bulk quantum fields requires a scheme for defining double-trace operators dual to deformed boundary conditions to realize the finite timelike boundary, valid at finite N. By starting with a small stint of a pure $T\bar T$ trajectory, the theory becomes finite, enabling well-defined subtractions to define the double-trace deformation so as to match the large-N prescription of Hartman, Kruthoff, Shaghoulian, and Tajdini to good approximation. We incorporate the matter effecting an uplift from negative to positive cosmological constant, and analyze the effect of matter on the energy spectrum of the theory arising from time-dependent bulk excitations. This validates the cosmic horizon $dS_3$ microstate count for large-radius $dS_3$ holography, embedding $T\bar T+\Lambda_2$ concretely into a larger theory consistent with bulk locality for matter fields. We comment briefly on potential upgrades to four dimensions and other future directions.</description>

Abstract: Loop-suppressed penguin $b\to s$ transitions are sensitive to heavy New Physics particles propagating inside the loops. Thanks to the large sample sizes from the LHC, we are able to perform multidimensional angular analyses that are sensitive to interferences between the Standard Model and New Physics terms. This article surveys the latest results, primarily from LHCb, on $b\to s\mu^+\mu^-$ electroweak and $b\to s\gamma$ radiative penguins.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the lattice QCD simulation with the 2+1+1 flavor full QCD ensembles using near-physical quark masses and different spatial sizes $L$, at $a\sim$ 0.055 fm. The results suggest that spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking is effectively restored at $L\le 1.0$ fm, while the gap between the nucleon and pion masses remains.</description>

      <title>An analytical approximation of the evolution of the primordial curvature perturbation in the ultraslow-roll inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01416v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic inflation can enter an ultraslow-roll (USR) stage, if there is a plateau on the inflaton potential. During this stage, the primordial curvature perturbation ${\mathcal R}_k$ and its power spectrum ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ can be remarkably enhanced on small scales. In this work, an analytical approximation is provided to systematically study the evolution of ${\mathcal R}_k$ in the USR inflation. We first discuss the asymptotic solutions of the moduli and arguments of ${\mathcal R}_k$ and its time derivative ${\mathcal R}_{k,N}$ on the sub- and super-horizon scales separately and find that all these solutions have simple exponential forms. Then, ${\mathcal R}_k$ on five typical scales are investigated in order. Our analytical approximation predicts that ${\mathcal R}_k$ first revolves around the origin in the complex plane, but if it crosses the horizon around the start of the USR stage, there appears a subsequent linear evolution towards or away from the origin. This behavior naturally explains the shape of ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ from the sharp dip to the peak and matches the numerical results perfectly. Moreover, the minimum of ${\mathcal P}_{\mathcal R}$ is exactly proved to be nonvanishing. Our analytical approximation will help the model building in primordial black hole and gravitational wave physics.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetry in Dynamical Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.01837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore generalized symmetry in the context of nonlinear dynamical gravity. Our basic strategy is to transcribe known results from Yang-Mills theory directly to gravity via the tetrad formalism, which recasts general relativity as a gauge theory of the local Lorentz group. By analogy, we deduce that gravity exhibits a one-form symmetry implemented by an operator $U_\alpha$ labeled by a center element $\alpha$ of the Lorentz group and associated with a certain area measured in Planck units. The corresponding charged line operator $W_\rho$ is the holonomy in a spin representation $\rho$, which is the gravitational analog of a Wilson loop. The topological linking of $U_\alpha$ and $W_\rho$ has an elegant physical interpretation from classical gravitation: the former materializes an exotic chiral cosmic string defect whose quantized conical deficit angle is measured by the latter. We verify this claim explicitly in an AdS-Schwarzschild black hole background. Notably, our conclusions imply that the standard model exhibits a new symmetry of nature at scales below the lightest neutrino mass. More generally, the absence of global symmetries in quantum gravity suggests that the gravitational one-form symmetry is either gauged or explicitly broken. The latter mandates the existence of fermions. Finally, we comment on generalizations to magnetic higher-form or higher-group gravitational symmetries.</description>

      <title>Relativistic corrections to energy spectrum of hydrogen due to the full one-photon-exchange interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we estimate the relativistic corrections to the energy spectrum of hydrogen resulting from the full one-photon-exchange interaction using a highly precise numerical method. In the frame of the effective Schrodinger-like equation, which is derived exactly from the Bethe-Salpeter equation in quantum electrodynamics, we express the effective potential corresponding to the full one-photon-exchange interaction in terms of eight scalar functions. Unlike the usual calculations performed in the references, where the effective potential is expanded in terms of momenta order by order, we retain the exact momentum dependence in the effective potential to estimate its corrections to the energy spectrum of hydrogen using a highly precise numerical method. We also use the same numerical method to double-check the results in the non-relativistic case to ensure accuracy. We discuss the comparison of the numerical results with those obtained using the usual bound-state perturbative theory. Our calculations suggest that it is possible to accurately account for all the relativistic contributions using this method. It would be interesting to extent these calculations to positronium, muonic hydrogen, and cases involving nuclear structure and radiative corrections.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.07467v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the electroweak phase transition in the real-singlet extension of the Standard Model at two-loop level, building upon existing one-loop studies. We calculate the effective potential in the high-temperature approximation and detail the required resummations at two-loop order. In typical strong-transition scenarios, we find deviations of order $20\% - 50\%$ from one-loop results in transition strength and critical temperature for both one- and two-step phase transitions. For extremely strong transitions, the discrepancy with one-loop predictions is even larger, presumably due to sizable scalar couplings in the tree-level potential. Along the way, we obtain a dimensionally-reduced effective theory applicable for non-perturbative lattice studies of the model.</description>

      <title>Quantum Coherence of Critical Unstable Two-Level Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2212.06031v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study in detail the dynamics of unstable two-level quantum systems by adopting the Bloch-sphere formalism of qubits. By employing the Bloch-vector representation for such unstable qubit systems, we identify a novel class of critical scenarios in which the so-called energy-level and decay-width vectors, ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf\Gamma}$, are orthogonal to one another, and the parameter $r = |{\bf \Gamma}|/(2|{\bf E}|)$ is less than 1. Most remarkably, we find that critical unstable qubit systems exhibit atypical behaviours like coherence--decoherence oscillations when analysed in an appropriately defined co-decaying frame of the system. In the same frame, a unit Bloch vector ${\bf b}$ describing a pure critical qubit will sweep out unequal areas during equal intervals of time, while rotating about the vector ${\bf E}$. These phenomena emerge beyond the usual oscillatory pattern due to the energy-level difference of the two-level quantum system. Interestingly enough, we observe that these new features will persist even for quasi-critical scenarios, in which the vectors ${\bf E}$ and ${\bf\Gamma}$ are not perfectly orthogonal to each other. Applications of our results to quantum information and to unstable meson--antimeson and other systems are discussed.</description>

Abstract: The effective Reggeon-Reggeon-gluon vertex, known as Lipatov vertex, is the key ingredient that allows to develop the BFKL approach in QCD. Within the next-to-leading logarithmic approximation, it is sufficient to know its one-loop corrections, in dimensional regularization ($D=4+2\epsilon$), up to the constant term in the $\epsilon$-expansion. In the next-to-next-to-leading approximation, however, the one-loop Lipatov vertex is needed up to the order $\epsilon^2$. In this paper we present the expression for this vertex in dimensional regularization up to the required accuracy.</description>

      <title>$\gamma Z$-Exchange Contributions in Low-Energy Parity-Violating $ep$ Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.01813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, the $\gamma Z$-exchange contributions in the low-energy elastic parity-violating $ep$ scattering are discussed with the approximation $m_e=0$. By expanding the $\gamma pp$ and $Zpp$ interactions on the momentum of photon and considering both the leading-order and the next-to-leading order interactions, we calculate the amplitudes of the $\gamma Z$-exchange diagrams. After performing the loop integral, we expand the results in the low energy limit, and obtain the analytic expressions for the amplitudes. Numerical comparisons show that the analytic expressions are very close to the full results over a large region. We investigate the power behaviors of these contributions and find that some are enhanced by a kinematic factor in the low energy limit. Additionally, in some cases, the imaginary parts of the contributions from the next-to-leading-order interactions are at the same order as those from the leading-order interactions. Furthermore, the corresponding contributions to the physical observable quantity $A_{\textrm{PV}}$ are also discussed. Combining all the properties together, we conclude that these analytic expressions describe the leading-order contributions of all $\gamma Z$-exchange helicity amplitudes in the region with $\alpha_e\ll Q/M_N\sim \delta/M_N^2\ll 1$, where $\alpha_{e}$ is the fine structure constant, $M_N$ is the mass of proton, $Q$ and $\delta$ are the small quantities related to the momentum transfer and the center-of-mass energy.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we calculate the average equation of state for the oscillating inflaton field of the simplest $\alpha$-attractor E-model. We show that the average equation of state can be solved analytically. We discover that when $\alpha$ is small, the average equation of state of the oscillating inflaton field approaches that of a cosmological constant. This is the phenomenon of oscillating inflation.</description>

Abstract: We extend the framework of analyzing the 2HDM in its orbit space to study the one-loop effective potential before and after electroweak symmetry breaking. In this framework, we present a comprehensive analysis of global symmetries of the one-loop thermal effective potential in the 2HDM, demonstrating when the global symmetries of the tree-level 2HDM potential are broken by loop contributions. By introducing light-cone coordinates and generalizing the bilinear notation around the vacuum, we present a geometric view of the scalar mass matrix and on-shell renormalization conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.16991v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of neutrino oscillations and masses motivates the extension of the standard model with right handed neutrinos, leading to heavy neutrino states possibly in the electroweak scale, which could be impacted by new high-scale weakly coupled physics. A systematic tool for studying these interactions is the neutrino-extended standard model effective field theory $\nu$SMEFT. In this work we study the prospects of the future LHeC electron-proton collider to discover or constrain the $\nu$SMEFT interactions, performing the first dedicated and realistic analysis of the well known lepton-trijet signals, both for the lepton flavor violating $p ~ e^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{-} + 3 \mathrm{j}$ (LFV) and the lepton number violating $p ~ e^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{+} + 3 \mathrm{j}$ (LNV) channels, for HNLs masses in the electroweak scale range: $100 ~\rm GeV \leq m_N \leq 500 ~\rm GeV$. The obtained sensitivity prospects show that the LHeC with $100 ~\rm fb^{-1}$ luminosity could be able to probe the scenario of a heavy $N$ and constrain the effective couplings to a region of the parameter space as tight as the bounds that are currently considered for the $\mathcal{O}(10)$GeV scale masses, with effective couplings of $\mathcal{O}(10^{-1})$ for NP scale $\Lambda=1 \rm TeV$.</description>

Abstract: Measurements of $b \rightarrow s \mu^+ \mu^-$ transitions indicate that there may be a new physics field coupling to di-muon pairs associated with the $b$ to $s$ flavour transition. Including the 2022 LHCb reanalysis of $R_K$ and $R_{K^\ast}$, one infers that there may also be associated new physics in $b\rightarrow e^+ e^-$ transitions. Here, we examine the extent of the statistical preference for $Z^\prime$ models coupling to di-electron pairs taking into account the relevant constraints, in particular from experiments at LEP-2. We identify an anomaly-free set of models which interpolates between the $Z^\prime$ not coupling to electrons at all, to one in which there is an equal $Z^\prime$ coupling to muons and electrons (but where in all models in the set, the $Z^\prime$ boson can mediate $b\rightarrow \mu^+ \mu^-$ transitions). A $3B_3-L_e-2L_\mu$ model provides a close-to-optimal fit to the pertinent measurements along the line of interpolation. We have (re-)calculated predictions for the relevant LEP-2 observables in terms of dimension-6 SMEFT operators and put them into the ${\tt flavio2.3.3}$ computer program, so that they are available for global fits.</description>

      <title>Corrections to the Forward Limit Dispersion Relations for $\gamma Z$-Exchange Contributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.16294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The weak charge of the proton $Q_{\textrm{w}}$ is one of the most fundamental quantities in physics. It can be determined by measuring the parity asymmetry $A_{\textrm{PV}}$ in elastic $ep$ scattering, where the $\gamma Z$-exchange contributions are crucial. For the past fifteen years, dispersion relations (DRs) in the forward limit have been widely used as a model-independent method to estimate these contributions. In this work, we study corrections to these forward-limit DRs. We first estimate these corrections using pointlike interactions as an illustrative example. We then estimate the $\gamma Z$-exchange contributions for the upcoming P2 experiment through both direct calculation and the forward-limit DRs, within the framework of low-energy effective interactions. The results indicate that the correction to the forward-limit DR for $\Box_{\gamma Z}^{V}$ is around 47\% for the upcoming P2 experiment, which will significantly modify the extracted value of $Q_{\textrm{w}}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08577v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the possibility to detect cosmic light dark matter (DM), i.e., axions and dark photons, of mass $\sim 10^{-6}$ eV and $\sim 10^{-4}$ eV, by magnetic excitation in a magnet with strong hyperfine interaction. In particular, we consider a canted anti-ferromagnet, MnCO$_3$, as a concrete candidate material. With spin transfer between nuclear and electron spins allowed by the hyperfine interaction, nuclear spins become naturally highly polarized due to an effective (electron-spin-induced) magnetic field, and have long-range interactions with each other. The collective precession of nuclear spins, i.e., a nuclear magnon, can be generated by the DM field through the nucleon-DM interaction, while they are also sensitive to the electron-DM interaction through the electron-nuclear spin mixing. Compared with conventional nuclear-spin precession experiments, this system as a DM sensor is sensitive to higher frequency needing only a small static magnetic field applied. The system also has collective precession of electron spins, mixed with nuclear spins, as the additional channels that can be used for DM probes. We estimate the sensitivity under appropriate readout setups such as an inductive pick-up loop associated with an LC resonant circuit, or a photon cavity with a photon counting device. We show that this method covers an unexplored parameter region of light bosonic DM.</description>

Abstract: Ultralight bosons near rotating black holes can grow significantly via superradiant energy extraction, potentially reaching field values close to the Planck scale, thereby turning black holes into effective transducers for these fields. The interaction between a boson field and fermions can initiate a parametric production of fermions, potentially halting the exponential growth and leading to a saturated state of the boson cloud. This dynamic offers a framework for establishing limits on boson-neutrino interactions, which have traditionally been restricted by neutrino self-interaction considerations. At the saturation phase, boson clouds have the capacity to propel neutrinos to TeV-scale energies, generating fluxes that surpass atmospheric neutrino fluxes from nearby black holes. This mechanism extends to dark sector fermions, leading to the generation of boosted dark matter. These fluxes open novel avenues for observation through high-energy neutrino detectors like IceCube, as well as through dark matter direct detection, by directing observational efforts towards targeted black holes.</description>

      <title>$A_{5}$ symmetry and deviation from Golden Ratio mixing with charged lepton flavor violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A neutrino mass model that can satisfy the exact golden ratio mixing is constructed using $A_{5}$ discrete symmetry group. The deviation from the golden ratio mixing is studied by considering the contribution from the charged lepton sector in a linear seesaw framework. A definite pattern of charged lepton mass matrix predicted by the model controls the leptonic mixing angles. By taking the observed $\theta_{13}$ as the input value, we can obtain the values of all the mixing angles and Dirac CP-violating phase within the current experimental bounds.
  The model predicts that only the normal neutrino mass ordering is consistent with the current oscillation data. We also study the charged lepton flavor violation (cLFV) process such as $\mu \rightarrow e +\gamma$ and $\tau \rightarrow e +\gamma$ and neutrinoless double beta decay parameter $m_{\beta \beta}$. The present neutrino mass model can explain the current and future sensitivity of the cLFV processes and the present sensitivity of neutrinoless double beta decay parameter when the masses of quasi-Dirac neutrinos are in the TeV range.</description>

      <title>Azimuthal Anisotropy at high transverse momentum in $p$-$p$ and $p$-$A$ collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.14702v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that the initial transverse momentum distribution of unpolarized and polarized partons within unpolarized nucleons, both with and without the anisotropy of unpolarized hadrons produced in the fragmentation of outgoing partons, could lead to the observed azimuthal anisotropy of high transverse momentum (high-$p_T$) hadrons produced in high energy proton-proton ($p$-$p$) or proton-ion ($p$-$A$) collisions. Including simple Gaussian forms for transverse momentum dependent parton distribution functions (PDF) and fragmentation functions, and assuming an $A^{1/3}$ enhancement of a PDF in $p$-$Pb$ collisions, we show that the observed anisotropy, with \emph{no modification} to the angle integrated spectra ($R_{pA}=1$) for 5~GeV~$\lesssim p_T\lesssim 50$~GeV, can be straightforwardly understood as arising from a few processes dominated by gluon-gluon to gluon-gluon scattering.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02509v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Precision measurements of antineutrino elastic scattering on hydrogen from future neutrino experiments offer a unique opportunity to access the low-energy structure of protons and neutrons. We discuss the determination of the nucleon axial-vector form factor and radius from antineutrino interactions on hydrogen that can be collected at the future Long-Baseline Neutrino Facility, and study the sources of theoretical and experimental uncertainties. The projected accuracy would improve existing measurements by $1$ order of magnitude and be competitive with contemporary lattice-QCD determinations, potentially helping to resolve the corresponding tension with measurements from (anti)neutrino elastic scattering on deuterium. We find that the current knowledge of the nucleon vector form factors could be one of the dominant sources of uncertainty. We also evaluate the constraints that can be simultaneously obtained on the absolute $\bar \nu_\mu$ flux normalization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.11066v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the cross-sections of diffractive single hadron photo- or electroproduction with large $p_T$, on a nucleon or a nucleus in the shockwave formalism. We use the hybrid formalism mixing collinear factorization with high energy small-$x$ factorization with the impact factors computed at next-to-leading order accuracy. We prove the cancellation of divergence and we determine the finite parts of the differential cross-sections. We work in general kinematics such that both photoproduction and leptoproduction are considered. The results can be used to detect saturation effects, at both the future EIC or already at LHC, using Ultra-Peripheral Collisions.</description>

      <title>The study on the multiplicity dependence of ridge behavior in $pp$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV at the LHC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.02913v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-range near-side ridge phenomenon in two-particle correlation is crucial for understanding the motion of partons after high-energy heavy-ion collisions. While it has been well explained by the hydrodynamic flow effect of the quark-gluon plasma (QGP) in heavy-ion collisions, the recent observation of the ridge structure in small systems has led to debates about the applicability of hydrodynamic models to explain the phenomenon since the collisions in small systems could not be sufficient to produce the medium required by the QGP matter. The Momentum Kick Model (MKM), on the other hand, explains the long-range near-side ridge phenomenon by the kinematic process; the high-momentum jet particles collide with medium partons, transfer their momentum to them (called the ``kick" process), and induce collective motion of the kicked-partons resulting in the ridge phenomenon. This MKM has successfully described the ridge structure in heavy-ion collisions at the RHIC. Furthermore, since the ridge phenomenon in small systems is prominent in high-multiplicity events, the MKM with multiplicity dependence (MKMwM) has been studied in $pp$ collisions at the LHC using a relationship between the number of kicked-partons and the multiplicity through an impact parameter. In this research, we extend the previous study with more recent experimental data-driven parameters and apply them to the new measurements that have a wider multiplicity range with $p_T$ and $\Delta\Phi$ bins at the LHC. Simultaneously, we not only provide a theoretical basis for the ridge behavior from the new measurements but also predict the ridge structure at the energies scheduled by the LHC in the upcoming Run 3 experiments.</description>

      <title>Flipped SU(5): unification, proton decay, fermion masses and gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study supersymmetric (SUSY) flipped $SU(5)\times U(1)$ unification, focussing on its predictions for proton decay, fermion masses and gravitational waves. We performed a two-loop renormalisation group analysis and showed that the SUSY flipped $SU(5)$ model predicts a high GUT scale $M_{\rm GUT} &gt; 10^{16}$ GeV. We also investigated the restrictions on the $M_{B-L}$ scale which is associated with the $U(1)_{\chi}$ breaking scale. We found that the $M_{B-L}$ scale can vary in a broad region with negligible or little effect on the value of $M_{\rm GUT}$. Proton decay in this model is induced by dimension-6 operators only. The dimension-5 operator induced by SUSY contribution is suppressed due to the missing partner mechanism. We found that the partial decay width $p \to \pi^0 e^+$ is high suppressed, being at least one order of magnitude lower than the future Hyper-K sensitivity. We also studied fermion (including neutrino) masses and mixings which can also influence proton decay. We presented two scenarios of flavour textures to check the consistency of the results with fermion masses and mixing. The $B-L$ gauge breaking leads to the generation of cosmic strings. The $B-L$ scale here is not constrained by gauge coupling unification. If this scale is very close that of GUT breaking, strings can be unstable due to the decay to monopole-antimonople pair. Such metastable strings can be used to explain the NANOGrav signals of stochastic gravitational wave background, which may be interpreted here as resulting from the decay of metastable cosmic strings.</description>

      <title>Multiple soft-photon emission at next-to-leading power to all orders</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.17612v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper derives a next-to-leading power (NLP) soft theorem for multi-photon emission to all orders in the electromagnetic coupling constant, generalising the leading-power theorem of Yennie, Frautschi, and Suura. Working in the QED version of heavy-quark effective theory, multi-emission amplitudes are shown to reduce to single- and double-radiation contributions only. Single soft-photon emission, in turn, is described by the recent all-order extension of the Low-Burnett-Kroll theorem, where the tree-level formula is supplemented with a one-loop exact soft function. The same approach is used in this article to prove that the genuine double-emission contribution is tree-level exact. As a validation and a first non-trivial application of the multi-photon theorem, the real-real-virtual electron-line corrections to muon-electron scattering are calculated at NLP in the soft limit.</description>

      <title>$M_{W_R}$ dependence of leptogenesis in Minimal Left-Right Symmetric Model with different strengths of Type-II seesaw mass</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.00822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Left Right Symmetric Model (LRSM) being an extension of the Standard model of particle physics incorporates within itself Type-I and Type-II seesaw mass terms naturally. Both the mass terms can have significant amount of contribution to the resulting light neutrino mass within the model and hence on the different phenomenology associated within. In this paper, we have thoroughly analyzed and discussed the implications of specifying different weightages to the type-I and type-II mass terms and also the study has been carried out for different values of $M_{W_R}$ which is mass of the right-handed gauge boson. This paper also gives a deeper insight into the new physics contributions of Neutrinoless Double Beta Decay $(0\nu\beta\beta)$ and their variations with the net baryon asymmetry arising out of the model. Therefore, the main objective of the present paper rests on investigating the implications of imposing different weightage to the type-I and type-II seesaw terms and different values of $M_{W_R}$ on the new physics contributions of $0\nu\beta\beta$ and net baryon asymmetry arising out as a result of resonant leptogenesis. LRSM in this work has been realized using modular group of level 3, $\Gamma(3)$ which is isomorphic to non-abelian discrete symmetry group $A_4$, the advantage being the non-requirement of flavons within the model and hence maintaining the minimality of the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.05553v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss recent progress concerning the resummation of large logarithms at next-to-leading power (NLP) in scattering processes such as Drell-Yan and deep inelastic scattering near threshold, and thrust in the two-jet limit. We start by reviewing the approach based on soft-collinear effective field theory and show that the standard factorization into short distance coefficients, collinear and soft functions at NLP leads in general to the appearance of endpoint divergences, which prevent the naive application of resummation techniques based on the renormalization group. Taking thrust as a case study, we then show that these singularities are indeed an artifact of the effective theory, and discuss how they can be removed to recover a finite factorization theorem and achieve resummation at NLP, at LL accuracy. Last, we discuss recent work concerning the calculation of all collinear and soft functions necessary to reproduce Drell-Yan near threshold up to NNLO in perturbation theory. This calculation provides useful data to extend resummation at NLP beyond LL accuracy.</description>

      <title>Global analysis of CP-violation in atoms, molecules and role of medium-heavy systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Detection of parity (P) and time-reversal (T) symmetry-odd electric dipole moments (EDMs) within currently achievable resolution would evidence physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Via the CPT-theorem, which includes charge conjugation (C), such low-energy searches complement high-energy physics experiments that probe CP-violation up to the TeV scale. Heavy-elemental atoms and molecules are considered to be among the most promising candidates for a first direct detection of P,T-violation due to enhancement effects that increase steeply with increasing nuclear charge number $Z$. However, different P,T-odd sources on the subatomic level can contribute to molecular or atomic EDMs, which are target of measurements, and this complicates obtaining rigorous bounds on P,T-violation on a fundamental level. Consequently, several experiments of complementary sensitivity to these individual P,T-odd sources are required for this purpose. Herein, a simply-applicable qualitative model is developed for global analysis of the P,T-odd parameter space from an electronic-structure theory perspective. Rules of thumb are derived for the choice of atoms and molecules in terms of their angular momenta and nuclear charge number. Contrary to naive expectations from $Z$-scaling laws, it is demonstrated that medium-heavy molecules with $Z\leq54$ can be of great value to tighten global bounds on P,T-violating parameters, in particular, if the number of complementary experiments increases. The model is confirmed by explicit density functional theory calculations of all relevant P,T-odd electronic structure parameters in systems that were used in past experiments or are of current interest for future experiments, respectively: the atoms Xe, Cs, Yb, Hg, Tl, Ra, Fr and the molecules CaOH, SrOH, YO, CdH, BaF, YbF, YbOH, HfF$^+$, WC, TlF, PbO, RaF, ThO, ThF$^+$ and PaF$^{3+}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.12322v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we put forward a connection between the self-interacting dark matter and the Dirac nature of neutrinos. Our exploration involves a $Z_4 \otimes Z_4'$ discrete symmetry, wherein the Dirac neutrino mass is produced through a type-I seesaw mechanism. This symmetry not only contributes to the generation of the Dirac neutrino mass but also facilitates the realization of self-interacting dark matter with a light mediator that can alleviate small-scale anomalies of the $\Lambda {\rm CDM}$ while being consistent with the latter at large scales, as suggested by astrophysical observations. Thus the stability of the DM and Dirac nature of neutrinos are shown to stem from the same underlying symmetry. The model also features additional relativistic degrees of freedom $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ of either thermal or non-thermal origin, within the reach of cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment providing a complementary probe in addition to the detection prospects of DM.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.00669v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we analyze the electromagnetic form factors of the vector heavy-light mesons to the pseudoscalar heavy-light mesons in the framework of three-point QCD sum rules, where the contributions of vacuum condensate terms $\langle\overline{q}q\rangle$, $\langle\overline{q}g_{s}\sigma Gq\rangle$, $\langle g_{s}^{2}G^{2}\rangle$, $\langle f^{3}G^{3}\rangle$ and $\langle\overline{q}q\rangle\langle g_{s}^{2}G^{2}\rangle$ are considered. With these results, we also obtain the radiative decay widths of the vector heavy-light mesons and then compare our results with those of other collaboration's. The final results about the radiative decay widths are $\Gamma(D^{*0}\to D^{0}\gamma)=1.74^{+0.40}_{-0.37}$ keV, $\Gamma(D^{*+}\to D^{+}\gamma)=0.17^{+0.08}_{-0.07}$ keV, $\Gamma(D_{s}^{*}\to D_{s}\gamma)=0.029^{+0.009}_{-0.008}$ keV, $\Gamma(B^{*0}\to B^{0}\gamma)=0.018^{+0.006}_{-0.005}$ keV, $\Gamma(B^{*+}\to B^{+}\gamma)=0.015^{+0.007}_{-0.007}$ keV and $\Gamma(B^{*}_{s}\to B_{s}\gamma)=0.016^{+0.003}_{-0.005}$ keV.</description>

Abstract: Inspired by the recent BESIII measurement of the decay asymmetry and the phase shift between $S$- and $P$-wave amplitudes in the decay $\Lambda_c^+\to \Xi^0K^+$, we perform a global fit to the experimental data of charmed baryon decays based on the topological diagrammatic approach (TDA) which has the advantage that it is more intuitive and easier to implement model calculations. The measured branching fractions and decay asymmetries are well accommodated in TDA except for three modes, in particular, the predicted ${\cal B}(\Xi_c^0\to \Xi^-\pi^+)=(2.83\pm0.10)\%$ is larger than its current value. The predicted magnitudes of $S$- and $P$-wave amplitudes and their phase shifts are presented for measured and yet-measured modes which can be tested in forthcoming experiments.</description>

Abstract: We study one-loop contributions to semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering in the target fragmentation region for a polarized lepton beam and nucleon target. Complete one-loop results at leading twist are derived, with a particular focus on the gluonic channel. It shows that four structure functions are generated uniquely by the gluon fracture functions starting at one-loop. Additionally, we obtain two structure functions associated with the longitudinal polarization of the virtual photon, and they are contributed by both gluon and quark channels. By combining existing twist-3 results, all eighteen structure functions for the studied process are predicted in terms of fracture functions convoluted with perturbative coefficient functions.</description>

      <title>Probing the inverse moment of $B_s$-meson distribution amplitude via $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16737v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse moment of the $B_s$-meson light-cone distribution amplitude (LCDA), denoted as $\lambda_{B_s}$ and defined within the heavy quark effective theory, through the calculation of $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors. The presence of the $s$-quark inside the $B_s$-meson dictates a notable departure of approximately $20\%$ in the $\lambda_{B_s}$ value compared to the non-strange case $\lambda_{B_q}$, as computed within the QCD sum rule approach, albeit with significant uncertainty. First, we compute the decay constant of the $\eta_s$-meson utilizing two-point sum rules while retaining finite $s$-quark mass contributions. Next, we constrain the parameter $\lambda_{B_s}$ by calculating $B_s \to \eta_s$ form factors within the light-cone sum rule approach, using $B_s$-meson LCDAs, and leveraging Lattice QCD estimates at zero momentum transfer from the HPQCD collaboration. Our findings yield $\lambda_{B_s}$ = 480 $\pm$ 92 MeV when expressing the $B_s$-meson LCDAs in the Exponential model, consistent with previous QCD sum rule estimate yet exhibiting a 1.5-fold improvement in uncertainty. Furthermore, we compare the form factor predictions, based on the extracted $\lambda_{B_s}$ value, with earlier analyses for other channels such as $B_s \to D_s$ and $B_s \to K$.</description>

      <title>Beauty-charm Meson Family with Coupled Channel Effects and Their Strong Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18898v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We systematically study the mass spectra and their two-body hadronic decays of the beauty-charm meson family considering the coupled channel effects. Our results can good explain the observed $B_c$ meson spectrum and the prediction of the mass spectrum for unobserved beauty-charm mesons can be tested in future experiments. For the coupled channel components, we predicted the $1S$ state in beauty-charm meson family is about $4\%$, while the $2S$, $1P$, $2P$, $1D$, and $2D$ states are about $14\%$, $10\%$, $33\%$, and $17\%$ respectively. For the $3S$, $2P$ and $2D$ states, the strong decay is allowed, The two-body hadronic decay widths of the $3^1S_0$, $3^3S_1$, $2^3P_2$ states are about 110 MeV, 69 MeV, and 3 MeV, respectively. While the two-body decay widths of the $2^3D_1$, $2D$, $2D^\prime$, and $2^3D_2$ states are 60 MeV, 149 MeV, 65 MeV, and 72 MeV, respectively.</description>

      <title>The SAGEX Review on Scattering Amplitudes, Chapter 2: An Invitation to Color-Kinematics Duality and the Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.13013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.13013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advances in scattering amplitudes have exposed previously-hidden color-kinematics and double-copy structures in theories ranging from gauge and gravity theories to effective field theories such as chiral perturbation theory and the Born-Infeld model. These novel structures both simplify higher-order calculations and pose tantalizing questions related to a unified framework underlying relativistic quantum theories. This introductory mini-review article invites further exploration of these topics. After a brief introduction to color-kinematics duality and the double copy as they emerges at tree and loop-level in gauge and gravity theories, we present two distinct examples: 1) an introduction to the web of double-copy-constructible theories, and 2) a discussion on the application of the double copy to calculation relevant to gravitational-wave physics.</description>

      <title>Cosmological forecasts for future galaxy surveys with the linear point standard ruler: Toward consistent BAO analyses far from a fiducial cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear point (LP) standard ruler was identified as the basis of a purely geometric method for exploiting the Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO). The LP exploits the BAO feature imprinted in the galaxy two-point correlation function to measure cosmological distances independent of any specific cosmological model. We forecast the expected precision of future and ongoing spectroscopic galaxy surveys to measure distances leveraging the linear point. We investigate the cosmological implications of our forecasted results. We focus in particular on a relevant working example: the detection of the late-time cosmic acceleration independent of other cosmological probes. Our findings show that, even within the LCDM standard cosmological paradigm, estimated distances need to be reliable over a very wide parameter range in order to realize their maximum utility. This is particularly relevant if we aim to properly characterize cosmological tensions. The LP is a promising candidate approach to achieve this reliability. In contrast, widely employed procedures in BAO analysis estimate distances keeping fixed cosmological parameters to fiducial values close to cosmic-microwave-background constraints in flat-LCDM. It is unclear whether they are purely geometric methods. Moreover, they rely on untested extrapolations to explore the parameter space away from those fiducial flat-LCDM values. We recommend that all BAO methodologies be validated across the full range of models and parameters over which their results are quoted, first by means of linear predictions and then N-body simulations.</description>

      <title>Bosonic Dark Matter in Light of the NICER Precise Mass-Radius Measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.17308</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.17308v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the presence of self-interacting bosonic dark matter (DM) within neutron stars (NSs) in light of the latest multi-messenger observations of the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and LIGO/Virgo detectors. The bosonic DM is distributed as a core inside the NS or as a halo around it leading to formation of a DM admixed NS. We focus on the variation of the visible and dark radius of the mixed object due to DM model parameters and fractions. It is shown that DM core formation reduces the visible radius and the total mass pushing them below observational limits while halo formation is in favor of the latest mass-radius observations. Moreover, we scan over the parameter space of the bosonic DM model considering two nuclear matter equation of states by applying the radius, maximum mass and tidal deformability constraints. Our investigation allows for the exclusion of a range of DM fractions, self-coupling constant and sub-GeV boson masses, which limits the amount of accumulated DM to relatively low values to be consistent with astrophysical bounds. In this paper, we introduce main features of the pulse profile corresponding to the DM admixed NS as a novel observable quantity. We find that the depth of minimum fluxes in the pulse profiles crucially depends on the amount of DM around NS and its compactness. The current/future astrophysics missions may test the possibility of the existence of DM within NSs and break the degeneracies between different scenarios via multiple observations.</description>

      <title>Momentum transport of chiral modes in a thermal QCD medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.12303v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have investigated the effect of a weak magnetic field on momentum transport in a thermal QCD medium at finite quark chemical potential using a semiclassical kinetic theory. In the presence of a magnetic field, the momentum transport coefficients acquire a tensor structure, reflected by the five shear $\left(\eta_0, \eta_1, \eta_2, \eta_3\right.$ and $\left.\eta_4\right)$ and two bulk viscous components $\left(\zeta_0\right.$ and $\left. \zeta_1\right)$. The weak magnetic field removes the degeneracy in the effective mass of flavours, leading to different masses for the left-handed (L) and right-handed (R) chiral modes of quarks. The coefficients, $\eta_0, \eta_1$ and $\eta_3$ decrease with magnetic field in L mode and increase in $\mathrm{R}$ mode, whereas, $\eta_2$ and $\eta_4$ increase in both L and $\mathrm{R}$ mode. The bulk viscous coefficients, $\zeta_0$ and $\zeta_1$ increase with magnetic field for both L and R mode. The shear and bulk viscous coefficients positively amplify with baryon asymmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.18517v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large-scale structure formation is studied in a kinetic theory approach, extending the standard perfect pressureless fluid description for dark matter by including the velocity dispersion tensor as a dynamical degree of freedom. The evolution of power spectra for density, velocity and velocity dispersion degrees of freedom is investigated in a non-perturbative approximation scheme based on the Dyson$\unicode{x2013}$Schwinger equation. In particular, the generation of vorticity and velocity dispersion is studied and predictions for the corresponding power spectra are made, which qualitatively agree well with results obtained from $N$-body simulations. It is found that velocity dispersion grows strongly due to non-linear effects and at late times its mean value seems to be largely independent of the initial conditions. By taking this into account, a rather realistic picture of non-linear large-scale structure formation can be obtained, albeit the numerical treatment remains challenging, especially for very cold dark matter models.</description>

      <title>Primordial magnetic field as a common solution of nanohertz gravitational waves and the Hubble tension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The origin of interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields remains largely unknown. One possibility is that they are related to the primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) produced by, for instance, the phase transitions of the early Universe. In this paper, we show that the PMF-induced turbulence generated at around the QCD phase transition epoch--the characteristic magnetic field strength $B_{\rm ch}^* \sim \mathcal{O}(1)~\rm{\mu G}$ and coherent length scale $\ell_{\rm ch}^* \sim \mathcal{O}(1)~\rm{pc}$--can naturally accommodate nanohertz gravitational waves reported by pulsar timing array (PTA) collaborations. Moreover, the evolution of the PMFs to the recombination era with the form of $B_{\rm ch}\sim \ell_{\rm ch}^{-\alpha}$ can induce baryon density inhomogeneities, alter the recombination history, and alleviate the tension of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ and the matter clumpiness parameter $S_8$ between early- and late-time measurements for $0.88\leq \alpha \leq 1.17$ (approximate 95\% credible region based on three PTA likelihoods). The further evolved PMFs may account for the $\sim {\cal O}(10^{-16})$ Gauss extragalactic magnetic field inferred with GRB 221009A.</description>

Abstract: Neutrinos are known to play important roles in many astrophysical scenarios from the early period of the big bang to current stellar evolution being a unique messenger of the fusion reactions occurring in the center of our sun. In particular, neutrinos are crucial in determining the dynamics and the composition evolution in explosive events such as core-collapse supernovae and the merger of two neutron stars. In this paper, we review the current understanding of supernovae and binary neutron star mergers by focusing on the role of neutrinos therein. Several recent improvements on the theoretical modeling of neutrino interaction rates in nuclear matter as well as their impact on the heavy element nucleosynthesis in the supernova neutrino-driven wind are discussed, including the neutrino-nucleon opacity at the mean field level taking into account the relativistic kinematics of nucleons, the effect due to the nucleon-nucleon correlation, and the nucleon-nucleon bremsstrahlung. We also review the framework used to compute the neutrino-nucleus interactions and the up-to-date yield prediction for isotopes from neutrino nucleosynthesis occurring in the outer envelope of the supernova progenitor star during the explosion. Here improved predictions of energy spectra of supernova neutrinos of all flavors have had significant impact on the nucleosynthesis yields. Rapid progresses in modeling the flavor oscillations of neutrinos in these environments, including several novel mechanisms for collective neutrino oscillations and their potential impacts on various nucleosynthesis processes are summarized.</description>

Abstract: We describe how the general mechanism of partial deconfinement applies to large-$N$ QCD and the partially-deconfined phase inevitably appears between completely-confined and completely-deconfined phases. Furthermore, we propose how the partial deconfinement can be observed in the real-world QCD with the SU(3) gauge group. For this purpose, we employ lattice configurations obtained by the WHOT-QCD collaboration and examine our proposal numerically. In the discussion, the Polyakov loop plays a crucial role in characterizing the phases, without relying on center symmetry, and hence, we clarify the meaning of the Polyakov loop in QCD at large $N$ and finite $N$.
  Both at large $N$ and finite $N$, the complete confinement is characterized by the Haar-random distribution of the Polyakov line phases. Haar-randomness, which is stronger than unbroken center symmetry, indicates that Polyakov loops in any nontrivial representations have vanishing expectation values and deviation from the Haar-random distribution at higher temperatures is quantified with the loops. We discuss that the transitions separating the partially-deconfined phase are characterized by the behaviors of Polyakov loops in various representations. The lattice QCD data provide us with the signals exhibiting two different characteristic temperatures: deconfinement of the fundamental representation and deconfinement of higher representations. As a nontrivial test for our proposal, we also investigate the relation between partial deconfinement and instanton condensation and confirm the consistency with the lattice data.
  To make the presentation more easily accessible, we provide a detailed review of the previously known aspects of partial deconfinement.</description>

Abstract: Cosmological distances are fundamental observables in cosmology. The luminosity ($D_L$), angular diameter ($D_A$) and gravitational wave ($D_{\rm GW}$) distances are all trivially related in General Relativity assuming no significant absorption of photons in the extragalactic medium, also known as cosmic opacity. Supernovae have long been the main cosmological standard candle, but bright standard sirens are now a proven alternative, with the advantage of not requiring calibration with other astrophysical sources. Moreover, they can also measure deviations from modified gravity through discrepancies between $D_L$ and $D_{\rm GW}$. However, both gravitational and cosmological parameters are degenerate in the Hubble diagram, making it hard to properly detect beyond standard model physics. Finally, recently a model-independent method named FreePower was proposed to infer angular diameter distances from large-scale structure which is independent of both early universe and dark energy physics. In this paper we propose a tripartite test of the ratios of these three distances with minimal amount of assumptions regarding cosmology, the early universe, cosmic opacity and modified gravity. We proceed to forecast this test with a combination of LSST and Roman supernovae, Einstein Telescope bright sirens and a joint DESI-like + Euclid-like galaxy survey. We find that even in this very model-independent approach we will be able to detect, in each of many redshift bins, percent-level deviations in these ratios of distances, allowing for very precise consistency checks of $\Lambda$CDM and standard physics. It can also result in sub-percent measurements of $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Scattering wave packets of hadrons in gauge theories: Preparation on a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.00840v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum simulation holds promise of enabling a complete description of high-energy scattering processes rooted in gauge theories of the Standard Model. A first step in such simulations is preparation of interacting hadronic wave packets. To create the wave packets, one typically resorts to adiabatic evolution to bridge between wave packets in the free theory and those in the interacting theory, rendering the simulation resource intensive. In this work, we construct a wave-packet creation operator directly in the interacting theory to circumvent adiabatic evolution, taking advantage of resource-efficient schemes for ground-state preparation, such as variational quantum eigensolvers. By means of an ansatz for bound mesonic excitations in confining gauge theories, which is subsequently optimized using classical or quantum methods, we show that interacting mesonic wave packets can be created efficiently and accurately using digital quantum algorithms that we develop. Specifically, we obtain high-fidelity mesonic wave packets in the $Z_2$ and $U(1)$ lattice gauge theories coupled to fermionic matter in 1+1 dimensions. Our method is applicable to both perturbative and non-perturbative regimes of couplings. The wave-packet creation circuit for the case of the $Z_2$ lattice gauge theory is built and implemented on the Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer using 13 qubits and up to 308 entangling gates. The fidelities agree well with classical benchmark calculations after employing a simple symmetry-based noise-mitigation technique. This work serves as a step toward quantum computing scattering processes in quantum chromodynamics.</description>

Abstract: Cosmelkology is the study of Elko in cosmology. Elko is a massive spin-half field of mass dimension one. Elko differs from the Dirac and Majorana fermions because it furnishes the irreducible representation of the extended Poincare group with a two-fold Wigner degeneracy where the particle and anti-particle states both have four degrees of freedom. Elko has a renormalizable quartic self interaction which makes it a candidate for self-interacting dark matter. We study Elko in the spatially flat FLRW space-time and find exact solutions in the de Sitter space. By choosing the appropriate solutions and phases, the fields satisfy the canonical anti-commutation relations and have the correct time evolutions in the flat space limit.</description>

Abstract: Evidence has accumulated that there are supermassive black holes (SMBHs) in the centers of most galaxies, and that these were formed in the very early universe by some as yet unknown process. In particular, there is evidence [15] that at least some galaxies formed as early as $10^8$ to $10^9$ years after the Big Bang host SMBHs. We suggest that the holographic model of inflation, whose dark matter candidates are primordial black holes carrying a discrete gauge charge, which originated as a small subset of the inflationary horizon volumes in the very early universe, can provide the seeds for this early structure formation. Aspects of the model pointed out long ago suggested an early era of structure formation, with structures dominated by dark matter. The additional assumption that the dark matter consists of discretely charged black holes implies black hole dominance of early structures, which seems to be implied by JWST data.</description>

      <title>A proposed PKU-Muon experiment for muon tomography and dark matter search</title>

Abstract: We propose here a set of new methods to directly detect light mass dark matter through its scattering with abundant atmospheric muons or accelerator beams. Firstly, we plan to use the free cosmic-ray muons interacting with dark matter in a volume surrounded by tracking detectors, to trace possible interaction between dark matter and muons. Secondly, we will interface our device with domestic or international muon beams. Due to much larger muon intensity and focused beam, we anticipate the detector can be made further compact and the resulting sensitivity on dark matter searches will be improved. In line with above projects, we will develop muon tomography methods and apply them on atmospheric and environmental sciences, archaeology and civil engineering. Furthermore, we will measure precisely directional distributions of cosmic-ray muons, either at mountain or sea level, and the differences may reveal possible information of dark matter distributed near the earth. In the future, we may also extend our study to muon on target experiments. Specifically, our methods can have advantages over exotic dark matters which are either muon-philic or slowed down due to some mechanism.</description>

      <title>Detailed Report on the Measurement of the Positive Muon Anomalous Magnetic Moment to 0.20 ppm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15410</link>

Abstract: We present details on a new measurement of the muon magnetic anomaly, $a_\mu = (g_\mu -2)/2$. The result is based on positive muon data taken at Fermilab's Muon Campus during the 2019 and 2020 accelerator runs. The measurement uses $3.1$ GeV$/c$ polarized muons stored in a $7.1$-m-radius storage ring with a $1.45$ T uniform magnetic field. The value of $ a_{\mu}$ is determined from the measured difference between the muon spin precession frequency and its cyclotron frequency. This difference is normalized to the strength of the magnetic field, measured using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR). The ratio is then corrected for small contributions from beam motion, beam dispersion, and transient magnetic fields. We measure $a_\mu = 116 592 057 (25) \times 10^{-11}$ (0.21 ppm). This is the world's most precise measurement of this quantity and represents a factor of $2.2$ improvement over our previous result based on the 2018 dataset. In combination, the two datasets yield $a_\mu(\text{FNAL}) = 116 592 055 (24) \times 10^{-11}$ (0.20 ppm). Combining this with the measurements from Brookhaven National Laboratory for both positive and negative muons, the new world average is $a_\mu$(exp) $ = 116 592 059 (22) \times 10^{-11}$ (0.19 ppm).</description>
