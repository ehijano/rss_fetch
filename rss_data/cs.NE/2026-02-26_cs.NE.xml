      <title>Outpatient Appointment Scheduling Optimization with a Genetic Algorithm Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.21995</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.21995v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optimization of complex medical appointment scheduling remains a significant operational challenge in multi-center healthcare environments, where clinical safety protocols and patient logistics must be reconciled. This study proposes and evaluates a Genetic Algorithm (GA) framework designed to automate the scheduling of multiple medical acts while adhering to rigorous inter-procedural incompatibility rules. Using a synthetic dataset encompassing 50 medical acts across four healthcare facilities, we compared two GA variants, Pre-Ordered and Unordered, against deterministic First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) and Random Choice baselines. Our results demonstrate that the GA framework achieved a 100% constraint fulfillment rate, effectively resolving temporal overlaps and clinical incompatibilities that the FCFS baseline failed to address in 60% and 40% of cases, respectively. Furthermore, the GA variants demonstrated statistically significant improvements (p &lt; 0.001) in patient-centric metrics, achieving an Idle Time Ratio (ITR) frequently below 0.4 and reducing inter-healthcenter trips. While the GA (Ordered) variant provided a superior initial search locus, both evolutionary models converged to comparable global optima by the 100th generation. These findings suggest that transitioning from manual, human-mediated scheduling to an automated metaheuristic approach enhances clinical integrity, reduces administrative overhead, and significantly improves the patient experience by minimizing wait times and logistical burdens.</description>

      <title>Stream Neural Networks: Epoch-Free Learning with Persistent Temporal State</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most contemporary neural learning systems rely on epoch-based optimization and repeated access to historical data, implicitly assuming reversible computation. In contrast, real-world environments often present information as irreversible streams, where inputs cannot be replayed or revisited. Under such conditions, conventional architectures degrade into reactive filters lacking long-horizon coherence. This paper introduces Stream Neural Networks (StNN), an execution paradigm designed for irreversible input streams. StNN operates through a stream-native execution algorithm, the Stream Network Algorithm (SNA), whose fundamental unit is the stream neuron. Each stream neuron maintains a persistent temporal state that evolves continuously across inputs. We formally establish three structural guarantees: (1) stateless mappings collapse under irreversibility and cannot encode temporal dependencies; (2) persistent state dynamics remain bounded under mild activation constraints; and (3) the state transition operator is contractive for {\lambda} &lt; 1, ensuring stable long-horizon execution. Empirical phase-space analysis and continuous tracking experiments validate these theoretical results. The execution principles introduced in this work define a minimal substrate for neural computation under irreversible streaming constraints.</description>

      <title>Applying a Random-Key Optimizer on Mixed Integer Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.22173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.22173v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixed-Integer Programs (MIPs) are NP-hard optimization models that arise in a broad range of decision-making applications, including finance, logistics, energy systems, and network design. Although modern commercial solvers have achieved remarkable progress and perform effectively on many small- and medium-sized instances, their performance often degrades when confronted with large-cale or highly constrained formulations. This paper explores the use of the Random-Key Optimizer (RKO) framework as a flexible, metaheuristic alternative for computing high-quality solutions to MIPs through the design of problem-specific decoders. The proposed approach separates the search process from feasibility enforcement by operating in a continuous random-key space while mapping candidate solutions to feasible integer solutions via efficient decoding procedures. We evaluate the methodology on two representative and structurally distinct benchmark problems: the mean-variance Markowitz portfolio optimization problem with buy-in and cardinality constraints, and the Time-Dependent Traveling Salesman Problem. For each formulation, tailored decoders are developed to reduce the effective search space, promote feasibility, and accelerate convergence. Computational experiments demonstrate that RKO consistently produces competitive, and in several cases superior, solutions compared to a state-of-the-art commercial MIP solver, both in terms of solution quality and computational time. These results highlight the potential of RKO as a scalable and versatile heuristic framework for tackling challenging large-scale MIPs.</description>

      <title>Training Deep Normalization-Free Spiking Neural Networks with Lateral Inhibition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23253v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) have garnered significant attention as a central paradigm in neuromorphic computing, owing to their energy efficiency and biological plausibility. However, training deep SNNs has critically depended on explicit normalization schemes, leading to a trade-off between performance and biological realism. To resolve this conflict, we propose a normalization-free learning framework that incorporates lateral inhibition inspired by cortical circuits. Our framework replaces the traditional feedforward SNN layer with distinct excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neuronal populations that capture the key features of the cortical E-I interaction. The E-I circuit dynamically regulates neuronal activity through subtractive and divisive inhibition, which respectively control the excitability and gain of neurons. To stabilize end-to-end training of the biologically constrained SNNs, we propose two key techniques: E-I Init and E-I Prop. E-I Init is a dynamic parameter initialization scheme that balances excitatory and inhibitory inputs while performing gain control. E-I Prop decouples the backpropagation of the circuit from the forward pass, regulating gradient flow. Experiments across multiple datasets and network architectures demonstrate that our framework enables stable training of deep normalization-free SNNs with biological realism, achieving competitive performance. Therefore, our work not only provides a solution to training deep SNNs but also serves as a computational platform for further exploring the functions of E-I interaction in large-scale cortical computation.

      <title>OR-Agent: Bridging Evolutionary Search and Structured Research for Automated Algorithm Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.13769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Automating scientific discovery in complex, experiment-driven domains requires more than iterative mutation of programs; it demands structured hypothesis management, environment interaction, and principled reflection. We present OR-Agent, a configurable multi-agent research framework designed for automated exploration in rich experimental environments. OR-Agent organizes research as a structured tree-based workflow that explicitly models branching hypothesis generation and systematic backtracking, enabling controlled management of research trajectories beyond simple mutation-crossover loops. At its core, we introduce an evolutionary-systematic ideation mechanism that unifies evolutionary selection of research starting points, comprehensive research plan generation, and coordinated exploration within a research tree. We introduce a hierarchical optimization-inspired reflection system in which short-term reflections act as verbal gradients, long-term reflections as verbal momentum, and memory compression as semantic weight decay, collectively forming a principled mechanism for governing research dynamics. We conduct extensive experiments across classical combinatorial optimization benchmarks as well as simulation-based cooperative driving scenarios. Results demonstrate that OR-Agent outperforms strong evolutionary baselines while providing a general, extensible, and inspectable framework for AI-assisted scientific discovery. All code and experimental data are publicly available at https://github.com/qiliuchn/OR-Agent.</description>
