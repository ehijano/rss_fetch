      <title>Structural results on idealistic equivalence relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We address some fundamental problems concerning the structure of idealistic equivalence relations. In particular, we show that, under analytic determinacy, there are continuum many idealistic analytic equivalence relations that are not classwise Borel isomorphic to an orbit equivalence relation. Moreover, we also discuss alternative formulations of the E1 conjecture, and present an elementary counterexample to one of its earliest variants proposed by Hjorth and Kechris in 1997.</description>

      <title>Generalized Schatunowsky theorem in a weak arithmetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Schatunowsky's 1893 theorem, that 30 is the largest number all of whose totatives are primes, has been recently generalized by Kaneko and Nakai. In its generalized form, it states the finiteness of the set of all positive numbers $n$, which, for a fixed prime $p$, have the property that all of $n$'s totatives that are not divisible by any prime less than or equal to $p$ are prime numbers. It is this generalized form that we show holds in a weak arithmetic</description>

      <title>Functional monadic ortholattices and locally finite $\sigma$-free polyadic ortholattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that every monadic ortholattice is isomorphic to a functional one, thereby resolving a recent question posed by Harding. We then study certain substitution-free reducts of the polyadic ortholattices, which we call locally finite $\sigma$-free polyadic ortholattices, and provide an analogous functional representation result.</description>

      <title>Full normalization for $\kappa^+$-supercompactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We extend the normalization results of the author's paper "Full normalization for transfinite stacks" [5] to mice at the level of $\kappa^+$-supercompactness: given a normal iteration strategy $\Sigma$ for such a mouse $M$, with both $M$ and $\Sigma$ satisfying certain condensation properties, we extend $\Sigma$ to a strategy $\Sigma^*$ for stacks of normal trees, such that every iterate via $\Sigma^*$ is in fact a normal iterate via $\Sigma$.</description>

      <title>On Tameness, Measurability and the Independence Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the area of Tame Geometry, different model-theoretic tameness conditions are established and their relationships are analyzed. We construct a subfield $K$ of the real numbers that lacks several of such tameness properties. As our main result, we present a first-order formula in the language of rings that defines a non-Borel set in $K$. Moreover, $K$ has the independence property and admits both archimedean and non-archimedean orderings.</description>

      <title>The Complexity of the Set of Validities of a Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08901</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08901v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the collection of first-order logical schemata all of whose instances are theorems of a given theory $T$; we call these the validities of $T$ ($\mathsf{V}(T)$). It is easy to see that if $T$ is a decidable theory, then $\mathsf{V}(T)$ is distinct from the set of valid formulas of first-order logic as customarily understood. We provide a complete model-theoretic characterization of the complexity, in the sense of Turing degree, of $\mathsf{V}(T)$ for decidable theories $T$, and answer a question posed by Vaught in 1960 concerning the complexity of the collection of validities common to all decidable theories.</description>

      <title>Approximate Axiomatization for Differentially-Defined Functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article establishes a complete approximate axiomatization for the real-closed field $\mathbb{R}$ expanded with all differentially-defined functions, including special functions such as $\sin(x), \cos(x), e^x, \dots$. Every true sentence is provable up to some numerical approximation, and the truth of such approximations converge under mild conditions. Such an axiomatization is a fragment of the axiomatization for differential dynamic logic, and is therefore a finite extension of the axiomatization of real-closed fields. Furthermore, the numerical approximations approximate formulas containing special function symbols by $\text{FOL}_{\mathbb{R}}$ formulas, improving upon earlier decidability results only concerning closed sentences.</description>

      <title>A logical perspective on intending to keep a true secret</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11654v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Logical investigations of the notion of secrecy are typically concentrated on tools for deducing whether private information is well hidden from unauthorized, direct, or indirect access attempts. This paper proposes a multi-agent, normal multi-modal logic to capture salient features of secrecy's intentions. Specifically, we focus on the intentions, beliefs, and knowledge of secret keepers and, more generally, of all the actors involved in secret-keeping scenarios. In particular, we investigate intentions underlying the keeping of a true secret, namely a secret concerning information known (and so true) by the secret keeper. The resulting characterization of intending to keep a true secret provides valuable insights into conditions ensuring or undermining secrecy depending on agents' attitudes and links between secrets and their surrounding context. We present the proposed logical system's soundness, completeness, and decidability results. Furthermore, we outline some theorems with potential applications to several fields, e.g., computer science and the social sciences.</description>
