      <title>Photodetachment of negative hydrogen ion beam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The method of H- photoionization is interesting for laser assisted charge exchange injection. In this paper, the model and computation of photoionization of negative hydrogen ion by using strong lasers is considered. The development of this work is motivated by using pure lasers for photodetachment of electron from negative hydrogen ion when it is not convenient or not possible to use stripping magnet. Herein we develop a method of calculation of high efficiency photoionization using time dependent wave equation with application of powerful lasers. We compare this precise method of calculation with simplified method of calculation through linear model of cross section interaction. Another mechanism of photodetachment through excitation of the Feshbach resonance is also considered.</description>

      <title>Feedforward Cancellation of High-Frequency Phase Noise in Frequency-Doubled Lasers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07381v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The cancellation of high-frequency laser phase noise using feedforward techniques, as opposed to feedback methods, has achieved significant advancements in recent years. However, directly applying existing feedforward techniques to laser systems based on nonlinear conversion still faces substantial challenges. Here, we propose and demonstrate a feedforward scheme that suppresses phase noise in frequency-doubled light by utilizing phase noise information of its fundamental pump. This scheme is enabled by the fact that the phase jitter of the frequency-doubled light is simply twice that of the pump, except for a first-order low-pass filtering effect introduced by the SHG enhancement cavity. Testing this method on a 420-nm frequency-doubled laser system, we realize a 25-dB suppression of the servo noise bump near 1 MHz on the 420-nm light, and an average suppression of 30 dB for strong injected noise ranging from 100 kHz to 20 MHz. This scheme shows promising potential for applications requiring blue or ultraviolet light with minimal high-frequency phase noise, such as precision control of atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>New Constraints on Axion Mediated Dipole-Dipole Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07865v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The search for axions sits at the intersection of solving critical problems in fundamental physics, including the strong CP problem in QCD, uncovering the nature of dark matter, and understanding the origin of the universe's matter-antimatter asymmetry. The measurement of axion-mediated spin-dependent interactions offers a powerful approach for axion detection. However, it has long been restricted to regions outside the 'axion window' due to a significant trade-off: the need to effectively suppress the magnetic leakage from highly polarized spin sources while simultaneously detecting sub-femtotesla level exotic physics signals at sub-decimeter-scale distances. In this work, we report new experimental results on axion-mediated exotic spin-spin interactions using an iron-shielded SmCo$_5$ spin source in combination with a specially designed self-compensation comagnetometer. Employing a composite shielding structure, we achieved a suppression of the magnetic field by up to $10^{11}$. This enabled us to establish new constraints on the coupling between electrons and neutrons, surpassing previous experimental limits by more than 10000 times within the axion window. Furthermore, we also set strongest constraints on the coupling between electrons and protons. The proposed method holds substantial potential not only for advancing the search for new physics beyond the Standard Model but also for enabling transformative applications in biological and chemical research.</description>

      <title>Planetary Nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planetary nebulae are formed by the matter ejected by low-to-intermediate mass stars (~0.8-8 times the mass of the Sun) towards the end of their lives. As hydrogen and then helium fuel sources run out, stars expand. During these giant phases stars also lose sizable amounts of mass. During the second giant phase, after the exhaustion of core helium, the mass loss is so great that stars lose a large fraction of their mass (50 - 90%), leaving behind a small, hot core, known as a white dwarf, surrounded by a nebula. Planetary nebulae are the result of many processes that shape and alter their ionization structure and chemical composition. The resulting nebula, illuminated by the ultraviolet-rich spectrum of the remnant very hot stellar core, is a spectacle of beauty and science. In this chapter, we show that these objects are invaluable laboratories for astrophysics, astrochemistry, and astromineralogy studies, with impact in many areas of Astronomy.</description>

      <title>Double Microwave Shielding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop double microwave shielding, which has recently enabled evaporative cooling to the first Bose-Einstein condensate of polar molecules [Bigagli et al., Nature 631, 289 (2024)]. Two microwave fields of different frequency and polarization are employed to effectively shield polar molecules from inelastic collisions and three-body recombination. Here, we describe in detail the theory of double microwave shielding. We demonstrate that double microwave shielding effectively suppresses two- and three-body losses. Simultaneously, dipolar interactions and the scattering length can be flexibly tuned, enabling comprehensive control over interactions in ultracold gases of polar molecules. We show that this approach works for a wide range of molecules. This opens the door to studying many-body physics with strongly interacting dipolar quantum matter.</description>

      <title>Superoxide anion (O$_{2}\negthinspace^{-}$) collisions with CO$_{2}$ molecules in the energy range 50-950 eV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A novel gas-phase molecular scattering study is reported for O$_{2}\negthinspace^{-}$ colliding with CO$_{2}$ for impact energies ranging from 50 to 950 eV. The absolute total electron detachment, relative total and partial ionization cross sections have been measured within this energy range and the positive ion yield of those produced during the collisions has been obtained. The primary anionic beam projectile is produced in a pulsed hollow cathode discharge induced plasma, and its interactions with the neutral molecular target occur in a gas cell at a well-known constant pressure. For impact energies above 500 eV high mass (m $&gt;$ 44 u) charged complexes have been detected. With the aid of a theoretical study, using ab initio methods, we propose a mechanism to infer on the formation of these cationic species, which have been assigned as projectile-target stable compounds (CO$_{3}\negthinspace^{+}$ and CO$_{4}\negthinspace^{+}$).</description>

      <title>Tomonaga-Luttinger Liquid Behavior in a Rydberg-encoded Spin Chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08179</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08179v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum fluctuations can disrupt long-range order in one-dimensional systems, and replace it with the universal paradigm of the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL), a critical phase of matter characterized by power-law decaying correlations and linearly dispersing excitations. Using a Rydberg quantum simulator, we study how TLL physics manifests in the low-energy properties of a spin chain, interacting under either the ferromagnetic or the antiferromagnetic dipolar XY Hamiltonian. Following quasi-adiabatic preparation, we directly observe the power-law decay of spin-spin correlations in real-space, allowing us to extract the Luttinger parameter. In the presence of an impurity, the chain exhibits tunable Friedel oscillations of the local magnetization. Moreover, by utilizing a quantum quench, we directly probe the propagation of correlations, which exhibit a light-cone structure related to the linear sound mode of the underlying TLL. Our measurements demonstrate the influence of the long-range dipolar interactions, renormalizing the parameters of TLL with respect to the case of nearest-neighbor interactions. Finally, comparison to numerical simulations exposes the high sensitivity of TLLs to doping and finite-size effects.</description>

      <title>Realization of a doped quantum antiferromagnet with dipolar tunnelings in a Rydberg tweezer array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Doping an antiferromagnetic Mott insulator is central to our understanding of a variety of phenomena in strongly-correlated electrons, including high-temperature superconductors. To describe the competition between tunneling $t$ of hole dopants and antiferromagnetic (AFM) spin interactions $J$, theoretical and numerical studies often focus on the paradigmatic $t$-$J$ model, and the direct analog quantum simulation of this model in the relevant regime of high-particle density has long been sought. Here, we realize a doped quantum antiferromagnet with next-nearest neighbour (NNN) tunnelings $t'$ and hard-core bosonic holes using a Rydberg tweezer platform. We utilize coherent dynamics between three Rydberg levels, encoding spins and holes, to implement a tunable bosonic $t$-$J$-$V$ model allowing us to study previously inaccessible parameter regimes. We observe dynamical phase separation between hole and spin domains for $|t/J|\ll 1$, and demonstrate the formation of repulsively bound hole pairs in a variety of spin backgrounds. The interference between NNN tunnelings $t'$ and perturbative pair tunneling gives rise to light and heavy pairs depending on the sign of $t$. Using the single-site control allows us to study the dynamics of a single hole in 2D square lattice (anti)ferromagnets. The model we implement extends the toolbox of Rydberg tweezer experiments beyond spin-1/2 models to a larger class of $t$-$J$ and spin-$1$ models.</description>

Abstract: In this Letter, we present mass-ratio measurements on highly charged Yb$^{42+}$ ions with a precision of $4\times 10^{-12}$ and isotope-shift measurements on Yb$^{+}$ on the $^{2}$S$_{1/2}$ $\to$ $^{2}$D$_{5/2}$ and $^{2}$S$_{1/2}$ $\to$ $^{2}$F$_{7/2}$ transitions with a precision of $4\times 10^{-9}$ for the isotopes $^{168,170,172,174,176}$Yb. We present a new method that allows us to extract higher-order changes in the nuclear charge distribution along the Yb isotope chain, benchmarking ab-initio nuclear structure calculations. Additionally, we perform a King plot analysis to set bounds on a fifth force in the keV$/c^2$ to MeV$/c^2$ range coupling to electrons and neutrons.</description>

Abstract: The Rydberg blockade mechanism is an important ingredient in quantum simulators based on neutral atom arrays. It enables the emergence of a rich variety of quantum phases of matter, such as topological spin liquids. The typically isotropic nature of the blockade effect, however, restricts the range of natively accessible models and quantum states. In this work, we propose a method to systematically overcome this limitation, by developing gadgets, i.e., specific arrangements of atoms, that transform the underlying Rydberg blockade into more general constraints. We apply this technique to realize dimer models on square and triangular geometries. In these setups, we study the role of the quantum fluctuations induced by a coherent drive of the atoms and find signatures of $U(1)$ and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid states in the respective ground states. Finally, we show that these states can be dynamically prepared with high fidelity, paving the way for the quantum simulation of a broader class of constrained models and topological matter in experiments with Rydberg atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Beyond the semiclassical approximation in atom interferometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08040v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a quantum perturbative approach to evaluating the phase shift of an atom interferometer in a weakly anharmonic trap. This provides a simple way to evaluate quantum corrections to the standard semi-classical approximation. The calculation benefits from the use of generalized coherent states for a basis. We find that the form of the semi-classical approximation remains valid to first order in the anharmonic perturbation, but that phase differences arise because the trajectory of a quantum wave packet will generally deviate from that of a classical particle. The quantum correction to the phase is a factor $\ell^2/A^2$ smaller than the semi-classical perturbation itself, where $\ell$ is the quantum harmonic oscillator length scale and $A$ is the classical amplitude of the motion. We provide analytical results for one-dimensional perturbations of power three through six in the position coordinate.</description>

      <title>Quantum Compilation Toolkit for Rydberg Atom Arrays with Implications for Problem Hardness and Quantum Speedups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14976v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose and implement a comprehensive quantum compilation toolkit for solving the maximum independent set (MIS) problem on quantum hardware based on Rydberg atom arrays. Our end-to-end pipeline involves three core components to efficiently map generic MIS instances onto Rydberg arrays with unit-disk connectivity, with modules for graph reduction, hardware compatibility checks, and graph embedding. The first module (reducer) provides hardware-agnostic and deterministic reduction logic that iteratively reduces the problem size via lazy clique removals. We find that real-world networks can typically be reduced by orders of magnitude on sub-second time scales, thus significantly cutting down the eventual load for quantum devices. Moreover, we show that reduction techniques may be an important tool in the ongoing search for potential quantum speedups, given their ability to identify hard problem instances. In particular, for Rydberg-native MIS instances, we observe signatures of an easy-hard-easy transition and quantify a critical degree indicating the onset of a hard problem regime. The second module (compatibility checker) implements a hardware compatibility checker that quickly determines whether or not a given input graph may be compatible with the restrictions imposed by Rydberg quantum hardware. The third module (embedder) describes hardware-efficient graph embedding routines to generate (approximate) encodings with controllable overhead and optimized ancilla placements. We exemplify our pipeline with experiments run on the QuEra Aquila device available on Amazon Braket. In aggregate, our work provides a set of tools that extends the class of problems that can be tackled with near-term Rydberg atom arrays.</description>
