      <title>Early stakeholder engagement for a possible new multipurpose research reactor for Canada</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17624</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17624v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Canada has a rich history of nuclear technology development. Since the 1940s, nuclear research infrastructure and facilities, such as National Research Universal (NRU) reactor at Canadian Nuclear Laboratories in Chalk River, Ontario, have played a key role for R&amp;D and for building Canadian expertise and competency in nuclear technology. The NRU reactor retired in 2018. Since the needs of stakeholders vary with time, consideration of a new multipurpose research reactor for Canada must contemplate current user input for their requirements. As an early step in such consideration, a systematic approach was employed to engage various national stakeholders from academia, industry, and research organizations, including the government. Several virtual workshops were held, each with a specific theme around utilizations. To provide international context, our workshops also included presentations from leading nuclear laboratories around the world. We provide a summary of Canada's approach and the main findings of this early stakeholder engagement.</description>

      <title>In the Network of the Conclave: Social Network Analysis and the Making of a Pope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study brings a network perspective to the centuries-old mystery of papal elections by mapping the relational architecture of the College of Cardinals. Using publicly available data sources, such as official Vatican directories and episcopal consecration records, we assemble a multilayered network that captures cardinals' co-membership in various collegial bodies of the Vatican and their consecration ties. We then calculate structural metrics to capture three key mechanisms that we suggest have a crucial role in the dynamics of the conclave: status, mediation power, and coalition building. Our descriptive study -- publicly shared before the white smoke of May 8, 2025 -- uncovers a striking case: Cardinal Robert F. Prevost, largely ignored by pundits, bookmakers, and AI models, held a uniquely advantageous position in the Vatican network, by virtue of being both highly central and positioned in-between others. Thus, although considered an underdog by many, the network perspective suggests that Cardinal Prevost (elected as Pope Leo XIV) was de facto one of the strongest "papabili". In highlighting the divergence between network-agnostic and network-informed analyses, we show the merit of adopting a social network perspective to study the conclave. Rather than predicting ballots, our work demonstrates how network theory can reveal the structural preconditions for consensus. We argue that any serious inquiry into future conclaves -- or analogous elite decision processes -- must begin by charting the relational space of influence before considering doctrinal, regional, or theological dimensions.</description>

      <title>Multiplexity amplifies geometry in networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many real-world network are multilayer, with nontrivial correlations across layers. Here we show that these correlations amplify geometry in networks. We focus on mutual clustering--a measure of the amount of triangles that are present in all layers among the same triplets of nodes--and find that this clustering is abnormally high in many real-world networks, even when clustering in each individual layer is weak. We explain this unexpected phenomenon using a simple multiplex network model with latent geometry: links that are most congruent with this geometry are the ones that persist across layers, amplifying the cross-layer triangle overlap. This result reveals a different dimension in which multilayer networks are radically distinct from their constituent layers.</description>

      <title>Educational programs and crime: a compartmental model approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a mathematical model to describe the temporal evolution of delinquent behavior, treating it as a socially transmitted phenomenon influenced by peer interactions, thus similar to an epidemic. We consider a compartmental framework involving three ordinary differential equations to describe the dynamics among the three population groups: individuals not incarcerated (susceptible), incarcerated offenders, and incarcerated offenders participating in an educational program. Transitions between the groups are governed by interaction-based mechanisms that capture the influence of peer effects in the spread of criminal behavior. The model revealed three equilibrium states: a delinquence free equilibrium, an equilibrium where no criminals attend an educational program, and a coexistence equilibrium. The basic reproduction number, $R_0$, was derived, and a sensitivity analysis revealed the key parameters that influence the system's stability. The model thus provides a quantitative basis for evaluating the effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies in correctional settings. Numerical simulations and an empirical application illustrate the qualitative properties of the model and show how parameter variations influence system behavior.</description>

      <title>Synchronization of identical oscillators on a sphere: exact results with external forces and higher-order interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17255v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the Kuramoto model on the sphere under higher-order interactions and an external periodic force. For identical oscillators, we introduce a novel way to incorporate three- and four-body interactions into the dynamics of the order parameter, allowing for a full dimensional reduction of this system. We discuss how such reduction can be implemented in two different ways and how they are related. When restricted to the equator, the dynamics is similar to that of the usual Kuramoto model, up to an interesting renormalization of the coupling constants. Outside this plane, the motion reduces to a two-parameter set of periodic orbits. We also locate the bifurcation curves of the system as functions of different parameters.</description>

      <title>Farm Size Matters: A Spatially Explicit Ecological-Economic Framework for Biodiversity and Pest Management</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17687v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intensification of European agriculture, characterized by increasing farm sizes, landscape simplification and reliance on synthetic pesticides, remains a key driver of biodiversity decline. While many studies have investigated this phenomenon, they often focus on isolated elements, resulting in a lack of holistic understanding and leaving policymakers and farmers with unclear priorities. This study addresses this gap by developing a spatially explicit ecological economic model designed to dissect the complex interplay between landscape structure and pesticide application, and their combined effects on natural enemy populations and farmers' economic returns. In particular, the model investigates how these relationships are modulated by farm size (a crucial aspect frequently overlooked in prior research). By calibrating on the European agricultural sector, we explore the ecological and economic consequences of various policy scenarios. We show that the effectiveness of ecological restoration strategies is strongly contingent upon farm size. Small to medium-sized farms can experience economic benefits from reduced pesticide use when coupled with hedgerow restoration, owing to enhanced natural pest control. In contrast, large farms encounter challenges in achieving comparable economic gains due to inherent landscape characteristics. This highlights the need to account for farm size in agri-environmental policies in order to promote biodiversity conservation and agricultural sustainability.</description>

      <title>Towards Industrial Convergence : Understanding the evolution of scientific norms and practices in the field of AI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.17945v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence (AI) research, there seems to be a rapprochement between academics and industrial forces. The aim of this study is to assess whether and to what extent industrial domination in the field as well as the ever more frequent switch between academia and industry resulted in the adoption of industrial norms and practices by academics. Using bibliometric information and data on scientific code, we aimed to understand academic and industrial researchers' practices, the way of choosing, investing, and succeeding across multiple and concurrent artifacts. Our results show that, although both actors write papers and code, their practices and the norms guiding them differ greatly. Nevertheless, it appears that the presence of industrials in academic studies leads to practices leaning toward the industrial side, but also to greater success in both artifacts, suggesting that if convergence is, then it is passing through those mixed teams rather than through pure academic or industrial studies.</description>

      <title>Quantifying urban socio-economic segregation through co-residence network reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.15920v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Urban segregation poses a critical challenge in cities, exacerbating inequalities, social tensions, fears, and polarization. It emerges from a complex interplay of socio-economic disparities and residential preferences, disproportionately impacting migrant communities. In this paper, using a comprehensive administrative data from Vienna, where nearly 40% of the population consists of international migrants, we analyse co-residence preferences between migrants and locals at the neighbourhood level. Our findings reveal two major clusters in Vienna shaped by wealth disparities, district diversity, and nationality-based homophily. These insights shed light on the underlying mechanisms of urban segregation and designing policies for better integration.</description>

      <title>Paving the way to carbon neutrality: Evaluating the decarbonization of residential building electrification worldwide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the context of increasing global climate change, decarbonizing the residential building sector is crucial for sustainable development. This study aims to analyze the role of various influencing factors in carbon intensity changes using the decomposing structural decomposition (DSD) to assess and compare the potential and effectiveness of electrifying end-use activities during the operational phase of residential buildings worldwide for decarbonization. The results show that (1) while the electrification rate varied in its impact on emissions across different countries and regions, the overall increase in electrification contributed to higher carbon intensity. In contrast, changes in the emission factor of electricity generally made a positive contribution to emission reduction globally. (2) The global electrification level has significantly increased, with the electrification rate rising from 29.9% in 2000 to 40.1% in 2021. A 39.8% increase in the electricity-related carbon emissions of global residential buildings was observed, increasing from 1452 MtCO2 to 2032 MtCO2, 2000-2021. (3) From 2000 to 2021, electrification of space heating was the main contributor to carbon reduction, whereas the contributions of electrification to cooling and lighting were relatively limited. Emission reductions from appliances and others remained stable. The electrification of water heating and cooking had varying effects on emission reductions in different countries. Furthermore, this study proposes a series of electrification decarbonization strategies. Overall, this study analyzes and contrasts decarbonization efforts from building electrification at the global and regional levels, explores the key motivations behind these efforts to aid national net-zero emission targets and accelerate the transition of the global residential building sector toward a carbon-neutral future.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's Technosphere: Luminosity and Mass as Limits to Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23420v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Earth remains the only known example of a planet with technology, and future projections of Earth's trajectory provide a basis and motivation for approaching the search for extraterrestrial technospheres. Conventional approaches toward projecting Earth's technosphere include applications of the Kardashev scale, which suggest the possibility that energy-intensive civilizations may expand to harness the entire energy output available to their planet, host star, or even the entire galaxy. In this study, we argue that the Kardashev scale is better understood as a "luminosity limit" that describes the maximum capacity for a civilization to harvest luminous stellar energy across a given spatial domain, and we note that thermodynamic efficiency will always keep a luminosity-limited technosphere from actually reaching this theoretical limit. We suggest the possibility that an advanced technosphere might evolve beyond this luminosity limit to draw its energy directly from harvesting stellar mass, and we also discuss possible trajectories that could exist between Earth today and such hypothetical "stellivores." We develop a framework to describe trajectories for long-lived technospheres that optimize their growth strategies between exploration and exploitation, unlike Earth today. We note that analyses of compact accreting stars could provide ways to test the stellivore hypothesis, and we more broadly suggest an expansion of technosignature search strategies beyond those that reside exactly at the luminosity limit.</description>
