      <title>Science Opportunities of Wet Extreme Mass-Ratio Inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03252</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03252v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wet extreme mass-ratio inspirals (wet EMRIs), which arise from stellar-mass black holes (sBHs) inspiral into supermassive black holes (SMBHs) within the gas-rich environments of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), are primary sources of gravitational waves (GWs) for space-borne detectors like LISA, TianQin, and Taiji. Unlike "dry EMRIs", which form through gravitational scattering in nuclear star clusters, wet EMRIs are naturally accompanied by interactions with accretion disks, offering rich multi-messenger science opportunities. They are distinct in generating transient electromagnetic (EM) signals, such as quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs), which serve as valuable probes of accretion disk physics and SMBH environments. Their GW signals provide an unprecedented precision of the order of $O(10^{-4}\sim 10^{-6})$ in measuring SMBH mass and spin, enabling the calibration of traditional EM techniques and offering insights into jet formation models. Additionally, wet EMRIs serve as bright and dark sirens for cosmology, facilitating percent-level precision measurements of Hubble parameter through AGN host identification or statistical association. These systems hold immense potential for advancing our understanding of black hole dynamics, accretion physics, and cosmology.</description>

      <title>Polarization Profiles of Globular Cluster Pulsars from FAST I. 25 Profiles from Previously Known Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsar polarization profiles are critical for understanding their magnetospheric structures and radiation mechanisms. We present polarization profile measurements for 25 pulsars in globular clusters (GCs) from the observation of the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope (FAST). The diversity of polarization profiles shows complex magnetic structure and emission pattern of pulsars. Among these, the polarization profiles of 15 pulsars were firstly measured. M53A present a 57\% linear polarization ratio, being highest among these 25 GC pulsars. M15H present a 42\% circular polarization ratio, which is the highest among these 25 pulsars. The average ratios of circular and absolute circular polarization of these GC pulsars are -1\% and 10\% respectively, lower than normal pulsars measured with Parkes (\citealt{Oswald2023}), which are 5\% and 32\%, respectively. The Rotation Measure (RM) values of each pulsar were measured, giving the range of pulsar(s) from M3, M5, M15, M71, M53, NGC6517, NGC6539, NGC6760 being 8(1) to 16(1) rad $m^{-2}$, -1(2) to -4(6) rad $m^{-2}$, -70(2) to -76(1) rad $m^{-2}$, -480(14) rad $m^{-2}$ (M71A only), -2(1) rad $m^{-2}$ (M53A only), 187(1) to 212(2) rad $m^{-2}$, 109(1) rad $m^{-2}$ (NGC6539A only), and 102(1) to 129(4) rad $m^{-2}$. The GCs closer to the Galactic plane (GP) tend to have larger RM. This is consistent with previous study (\citealt{Hutschenreuter2022}).</description>

      <title>Stellar Tidal Disruptions by Newborn Neutron Stars or Black Holes: A Mechanism for Hydrogen-poor (Super)luminous Supernovae and Fast Blue Optical Transients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03316v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrogen-poor supernovae (SNe) of Type Ibc are explosions of massive stars that lost their hydrogen envelopes, typically due to interactions with a binary companion. We consider the case where the natal kick imparted to the neutron star (NS) or black hole (BH) remnant brings the compact object to a collision with a main-sequence companion, eventually leading to full tidal disruption of the companion. Subsequently, super-Eddington accretion onto the NS/BH launches a powerful, fast wind which collides with the SN ejecta and efficiently converts the kinetic energy of the wind into radiation. The radiation is reprocessed by the surrounding ejecta into a luminous ($\sim 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at peak), days to months-long transient with optical peaks from $-19$ to $-21$ mag, comparable to (super)luminous Type Ibc SNe and fast blue optical transients (FBOTs) like AT2018cow. From a Monte-Carlo analysis we estimate the fraction of tidal disruptions following SNe in binaries to be $\sim 0.1$--$1$\%, roughly compatible with the event rates of these luminous SNe. At the broad-brush level, our model reproduces the multi-wavelength and spectral observations of FBOTs, and has the potential to explain peculiar features seen in some (super)luminous SNe which are difficult to reproduce by the conventional magnetar spindown mechanism, such as late-time hydrogen lines, bumpy light curves, and pre-peak excess.</description>

      <title>Identifying Thorne-\.Zytkow Objects through Neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03330v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thorne-\.Zytkow Objects (T\.ZOs) have been predicted to form when a neutron star is engulfed by a diffuse, convective giant envelope. Accretion onto a neutron star at a rate that is larger than $10^{-4}\, M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ is expected to lead to significant emission of neutrinos of all flavors with energy of 1-100 MeV. Since the neutrino signal is expected to largely vary in time (from milliseconds to thousands of years), we outline detection strategies tailored to the signal duration. We find that neutrino detection from T\.ZOs up to the Small Magellanic Cloud is within the reach of current- and next-generation neutrino observatories, such as Super- and Hyper-Kamiokande, the IceCube Neutrino Observatory, and JUNO. Interestingly, if targeted searches for neutrinos from T\.ZO candidates (e.g. VX Sgr in our Galaxy as well as HV 2112 and HV 11417 in the Small Magellanic Cloud) should lead to positive results, neutrinos could positively identify the nature of such sources and their accretion rate. Our findings should serve as motivation for establishing dedicated searches for neutrino emission from T\.ZOs. This is especially timely since it is challenging to detect T\.ZOs via electromagnetic radiation unambiguously, and the T\.ZO gravitational wave signal could be probed with next-generation detectors for sources within our Galaxy only.</description>

      <title>The properties of GSN 069 accretion disk from a joint X-ray and UV spectral analysis: stress-testing quasi-periodic eruption models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03333v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and XMM-Newton data of the tidal disruption event (TDE) candidate and quasi-periodic eruption (QPE) source GSN 069. Using ultraviolet (UV) and optical images at HST resolution, we show that GSN 069's emission consists of a point source superimposed on a diffuse stellar component. The latter accounts for $\leq 5\%$ of the UV emission in the inner 0.5"$\times$0.5" region, while the luminosity of the former cannot be attributed to stars. Analyzing the 2014/2018 HST UV spectra, we show that to leading order the intrinsic spectral shape is $\nu L_{\nu} \propto \nu^{4/3}$, with $\sim 10\%$ far UV flux variability between epochs. The contemporaneous X-ray and UV spectra can be modeled self-consistently in a thin disk framework. At observed epochs, the disk had an outer radius ($R_{\rm out}$) of $\mathcal{O}(10^3 R_{\rm g})$, and shows both cooling and expansion over the four years. Incorporating relativistic effects via numerical ray tracing, we constrain the disk inclination angle ($i$) to be $30^\circ \lesssim i \lesssim 65^\circ $ and identify a narrow region of spin-inclination parameter space that describes the observations. These findings confirm that GSN 069 hosts a compact, viscously expanding accretion disk likely formed after a TDE. Implications for QPE models are: (i) No published disk instability model can explain the disk's stability in 2014 (no QPEs) and its instability in 2018 (QPEs present); (ii) While the disk size in 2018 allows for orbiter/disk interactions to produce QPEs, in 2014 the disk was already sufficiently extended, yet no QPEs were present. These findings pose challenges to existing QPE models.</description>

      <title>Time-resolved Hubble Space Telescope UV observations of an X-ray quasi-periodic eruption source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: X-ray quasi-periodic eruptions (QPEs) are a novel mode of variability in nearby galactic nuclei whose origin remains unknown. Their multi-wavelength properties are poorly constrained, as studies have focused almost entirely on the X-ray band. Here we report on time-resolved, coordinated Hubble Space Telescope far ultraviolet and XMM-Newton X-ray observations of the shortest period X-ray QPE source currently known, eRO-QPE2. We detect a bright UV point source ($L_{\rm FUV} \approx {\rm few} \times 10^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$) that does not show statistically significant variability between the X-ray eruption and quiescent phases. This emission is unlikely to be powered by a young stellar population in a nuclear stellar cluster. The X-ray-to-UV spectral energy distribution can be described by a compact accretion disk ($R_{\rm out} = 343^{+202}_{-138} \ R_{\rm g}$). Such compact disks are incompatible with typical disks in active galactic nuclei, but form naturally following the tidal disruption of a star. Our results rule out models (for eRO-QPE2) invoking i) a classic AGN accretion disk and ii) no accretion disk at all. For orbiter models, the expected radius derived from the timing properties would naturally lead to disk-orbiter interactions for both quasi-spherical and eccentric trajectories. We infer a black hole mass of log$_{10}(M_{\rm BH}) = 5.9 \pm 0.3$ M$_{\odot}$ and Eddington ratio of 0.13$^{+0.18}_{-0.07}$; in combination with the compact outer radius this is inconsistent with existing disk instability models. After accounting for the quiescent disk emission, we constrain the ratio of X-ray to FUV luminosity of the eruption component to be $L_{\rm X} / L_{\rm FUV} &gt; 16-85$ (depending on the intrinsic extinction).</description>

      <title>Multi-Wavelength Analysis of AT 2023sva: a Luminous Orphan Afterglow With Evidence for a Structured Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03337</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present multi-wavelength analysis of ZTF23abelseb (AT 2023sva), an optically discovered fast-fading ($\Delta m_r = 2.2$ mag in $\Delta t = 0.74 $ days), luminous ($M_r \sim -30.0$ mag) and red ($g-r = 0.50$ mag) transient at $z = 2.28$ with accompanying luminous radio emission. AT 2023sva does not possess a $\gamma$-ray burst (GRB) counterpart to an isotropic equivalent energy limit of $E_{\rm{\gamma, \, iso}} &lt; 1.6 \times 10^{52}$ erg, determined through searching $\gamma$-ray satellite archives between the last non-detection and first detection, making it the sixth example of an optically-discovered afterglow with a redshift measurement and no detected GRB counterpart. We analyze AT 2023sva's optical, radio, and X-ray observations to characterize the source. From radio analyses, we find the clear presence of strong interstellar scintillation (ISS) 72 days after the initial explosion, allowing us to place constraints on the source's angular size and bulk Lorentz factor. When comparing the source sizes derived from ISS of orphan events to those of the classical GRB population, we find orphan events have statistically smaller source sizes. We also utilize Bayesian techniques to model the multi-wavelength afterglow. Within this framework, we find evidence that AT 2023sva possesses a shallow power-law structured jet viewed slightly off-axis ($\theta_{\rm{v}} = 0.07 \pm 0.02$) just outside of the jet's core opening angle ($\theta_{\rm{c}} = 0.06 \pm 0.02$). We determine this is likely the reason for the lack of a detected GRB counterpart, but also investigate other scenarios. AT 2023sva's evidence for possessing a structured jet stresses the importance of broadening orphan afterglow search strategies to a diverse range of GRB jet angular energy profiles, to maximize the return of future optical surveys.</description>

      <title>Empirical Modeling of Magnetic Braking in Millisecond Pulsars to Measure the Local Dark Matter Density and Effects of Orbiting Satellite Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03409</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03409v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel method that enables us to estimate the acceleration of individual millisecond pulsars (MSPs) using only their spin period and its time derivative. For our binary MSP sample, we show that one can obtain an empirical calibration of the magnetic braking term that relies only on observed quantities. We find that such a model for magnetic braking is only valid for MSPs with small surface magnetic field strengths ($&lt;3\times10^8$ G) and large characteristic ages ($&gt;$ 5 Gyr). With this method we are able to effectively double the number of pulsars with line-of-sight acceleration measurements, from 28 to 54 sources. This expanded dataset leads to an updated measurement of the total density in the midplane, which we find to be $\rho_0$ = 0.086 $\pm$ 0.001 stat. $\pm$ 0.006 sys. M$_\odot$/pc$^3$, and an updated measurement of the local dark matter density, which we calculate to be $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ = 0.014 $\pm$ 0.005 stat. $\pm$ 0.006 sys. M$_\odot$/pc$^3$ (0.53 $\pm$ 0.30 GeV/cm$^3$). This updated value for $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ is in good agreement with literature values derived from kinematic estimates. We show that each new acceleration measurement improves the precision of $\rho_{0,\mathrm{DM}}$ by the same amount as roughly 10$^5$ stars. The pulsar accelerations are very asymmetric above and below the disk; we show that the shape and size of this asymmetry can be largely explained by the north-south asymmetry of disk star counts and the offset in the Milky Way disk and halo centers of mass due to the Large Magellanic Cloud.</description>

      <title>The ubiquity of variable radio emission and spin-down rates in pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pulsars are often lauded for their (relative) rotational and radio emission stability over long time scales. However, long-term observing programmes are identifying an increasing number that deviate from this preconceived notion. Using Gaussian process regression and Bayesian inference techniques, we investigated the emission and rotational stability of 259 radio pulsars that have been monitored using Murriyang, the Parkes 64 m radio telescope, over the past three decades. We found 238 pulsars display significant variability in their spin-down rates, 52 of which also exhibit changes in profile shape. Including 23 known state-switching pulsars, this represents the largest catalogue of variable pulsars identified to date and indicates that these behaviours are ubiquitous among the wider population. The intensity of spin-down fluctuations positively scales with increasing pulsar spin-down rate, with only a marginal dependence on spin-frequency. This may have substantial implications for ongoing searches for gravitational waves in the ensemble timing of millisecond pulsars. We also discuss challenges in explaining the physical origins of quasi-periodic and transient profile/spin-down variations detected among a subset of our pulsars.</description>

      <title>Spectro-timing analysis of Be X-ray pulsar SMC X-2 during the 2022 outburst</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present broadband X-ray observations of the High Mass X-ray Binary (HMXB) pulsar SMC X-2, using concurrent NuSTAR and NICER observations during its 2022 outburst. The source is found to be spinning with a period of 2.37281(3) s. We confirm the existence of cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) at 31 keV in addition to the iron emission line in the X-ray continuum of the source. Spectral analysis performed with the physical bulk and thermal Comptonization model indicates that the bulk Comptonization dominates the thermal Comptonization. Using phase-resolved spectroscopy, we have investigated the variations of the spectral parameters relative to pulse phase that may be due to the complex structure of magnetic field of the pulsar or the impact of the emission geometry. It is observed that the spectral parameters exhibit significant variabilities relative to the pulsed phase. Time-resolved spectroscopy is employed to examine the evolution of the continuum and changes in the spectral characteristics. Measurements of luminosity along with variations in cyclotron line energy and photon index suggest that the source may be accreting in the super-critical regime.</description>

      <title>Constraints from Gamma-ray Burst Phenomenology on the Hypothesis of Quark Star as the central engine of Gamma-ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03610v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a strange quark star (QS) predicted in the Bodmer-Witten hypothesis has been a matter of debate. The combustion from a neutron star to a strange QS in its accreted process in a low-mass X-ray binary is proposed to be a scenario that generates gamma-ray bursts (GRBs); the baryon contamination of the outflow is very low and mainly from the masses of crusts ($M_{\rm crust}$) of QSs. A special subset of GRBs detected in the past 16 years are collected and used to estimate $M_{\rm crust}$ under this assumption of QSs as central engines. Correspondingly, $M_{\rm crust}$ is calculated in the frameworks of several models for cold dense quark matter (MIT bag model and Nambu-Jona-Lasino model with or without the impacts from the formation of color superconducting condensates being considered), for comparison with the observation. In conclusion, we find that the GRB samples have so far failed to provide positive support for this hypothesis.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we analyze the most recent short gamma-ray burst (sGRB) sample detected by the \emph{Fermi} satellite to reassess the sGRB luminosity function and formation rate. Using the empirical luminosity correlation, we first determine the pseudo redshifts of 478 sGRBs. Then, we use the maximum likelihood method to constrain the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs under various delay-time distribution models, finding the power-law delay model marginally preferred over the Gaussian and lognormal delay models based on the Akaike Information Criterion. The local formation rate of sGRBs is $1.73_{-0.45}^{+0.60}$ $\mathrm{Gpc^{-3}\,yr^{-1}}$, largely independent of the adopted delay-time distribution model. Additionally, we investigate the potential for joint detection of sGRBs and their gravitational wave (GW) counterparts from binary neutron star mergers using both current and future GRB and GW facilities. For sGRB detection, we consider three existing satellites: \emph{Fermi}, the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}), and the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}). For GW detection, we examine two International GW Networks (IGWN): a four-detector network consisting of LIGO Hanford, Livingston, Virgo, and Kagra (IGWN4) and an upcoming five-detector network that includes these four detectors plus LIGO India (IGWN5). Our results indicate that for different delay-time distribution models, the joint sGRB and GW detection rates for \emph{Fermi}, \emph{SVOM}, and \emph{EP} with IGWN4 (IGWN5) lie within 0.09--0.31 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.55--1.98 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), 0.03--0.11 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.26--0.80 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), and 0.01--0.04 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$ (0.09--0.27 $\mathrm{yr^{-1}}$), respectively.</description>

      <title>The impact of mass uncertainties on the r-process nucleosynthesis in neutron star mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03633v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theoretical predictions of element yields from the rapid neutron capture (r-) process are subject to large uncertainties due to incomplete knowledge of nuclear properties and approximative hydrodynamical modeling of matter ejection. A major source of uncertainty in determining ejecta composition and radioactive decay heat is the lack of nuclear mass data for exotic neutron-rich nuclei produced during neutron irradiation.
  We examine both model (systematic) and parameter (statistical) uncertainties affecting nuclear mass predictions and their impact on r-process nucleosynthesis, and consequently, the composition of neutron star merger ejecta. To estimate the effect of model uncertainties, we consider five nuclear mass models that accurately describe known masses. We also use a backward-forward Monte Carlo method to estimate uncorrelated uncertainties from local variations in model parameters, constraining them to experimentally known masses before propagating them to unknown masses of neutron-rich nuclei.
  These mass uncertainties are then applied to a 1.38-1.38 M$_{\odot}$ neutron star merger model, considering a wide range of ejecta trajectories. We find that uncorrelated parameter uncertainties lead to ejected abundance uncertainties of 20% up to A $\simeq$ 130, 40% between A=150 and 200, with peaks around A $\simeq$ 140 and A $\simeq$ 203, leading to deviations of 100-300%. While correlated model uncertainties generally exceed parameter uncertainties for most nuclei, both have a significant impact on heavy element production.
  Overall, improvements in nuclear models are essential to reducing uncertainties in r-process predictions. Both correlated model uncertainties and coherent determination of parameter uncertainties are crucial for sensitivity analysis in r-process nucleosynthesis.</description>

      <title>Continuation of an Optical Spectroscopic Campaign of Fermi Blazar Candidates with TNG: Discovery of a New Changing-Look Blazar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Blazars are a distinct subclass of active galactic nuclei (AGN), known for their fast variability, high polarization, and intense emission across the electromagnetic spectrum, from radio waves to gamma rays. Gamma-ray blazar candidates of uncertain type (BCU) are an ongoing challenge in gamma-ray astronomy due to difficulties in classification and redshift determination. Aims. This study continues an optical spectroscopic campaign aimed at identifying the characteristics of BCUs to improve classification and redshift estimates, particularly focusing on low-synchrotron-peak sources. Methods. We conducted a detailed analysis of optical spectroscopic data for a sample of 21 low-synchrotron-peak BCUs plus one bl lac with contradictory results in the literature, using the 3.58-m Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG, La Palma, Spain). Results. Our analysis identifies 14 out of the 21 BCUs as flat-spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), demonstrating the effectiveness of our selection criteria. Notably, four FSRQs have redshifts exceeding 1, including 4FGL J2000.0+4214 at z = 2.04. Six sources are classified as bl lacs, with one of them, 4FGL J0746.5-0719, showing a featureless spectrum in this work despite previously exhibiting strong lines, suggesting it may be a changing-look blazar. One source remains classified as a BCU due to a noisy spectrum. Additionally, we observed a bl lac object, 4FGL J1054.5+2211, due to inconsistent redshift estimates in the literature, but we could not confirm any redshift due to its featureless spectrum. Our findings provide insights into the classification and redshift estimation of blazar candidates, emphasizing the need for continued spectroscopic monitoring.</description>

      <title>Dimming GRS 1915+105 observed with NICER and Insight--HXMT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03804</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03804v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The black hole X-ray binary GRS 1915+105 was bright for 26 years since its discovery and is well-known for its disk instabilities, quasi-periodic oscillations, and disk wind signatures. We report a long-term spectral-timing tracing of this source from mid-2017 until the onset of the "obscured state", based on the complete data from the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (NICER) and the Insight--Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (HXMT), whose hard coverage decisively informs the modeling at lower energies. In the soft state predating 2018, we observed highly ionized winds. However, in the hard state shortly before transitioning into the "obscured state" on May 14, 2019 (MJD 58617), the winds exhibited a discernible reduction in ionization degree ($\log \xi$), decreasing from above 4 to approximately 3. Our analysis involves the measurement of the frequencies of the quasi-periodic oscillations and the estimation of the properties of the ionized winds and the intensities of different spectral components through spectroscopy during the decay phase. We delve into the origin of these infrequently observed warm outflows in the hard state. It is found that the launching radius of the winds in the hard decay phase is similar to that in the soft state, indicating the launching mechanism of those winds in both states is likely the same. The presence of the ionized winds is preferentially dependent on the periphery of the accretion disk, but not directly related to the corona activities in the center of the binary system.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Markarian 421 during its most violent year: Multiwavelength variability and correlations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03831</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03831v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mrk 421 was in its most active state around early 2010, which led to the highest TeV gamma-ray flux ever recorded from any active galactic nuclei. We aim to characterize the multiwavelength behavior during this exceptional year for Mrk 421, and evaluate whether it is consistent with the picture derived with data from other less exceptional years. We investigated the period from November 5, 2009, (MJD 55140) until July 3, 2010, (MJD 55380) with extensive coverage from very-high-energy (VHE; E$\,&gt;\,$100$\,$GeV) gamma rays to radio with MAGIC, VERITAS, Fermi-LAT, RXTE, Swift, GASP-WEBT, VLBA, and a variety of additional optical and radio telescopes. We investigated the variability and correlation behavior among different energy bands in great detail. We find the strongest variability in X-rays and VHE gamma rays, and PSDs compatible with power-law functions. We observe strong correlations between X-rays and VHE gamma rays. We also report a marginally significant positive correlation between high-energy (HE; E$\,&gt;\,$100$\,$MeV) gamma rays and the ultraviolet band. We detected marginally significant correlations between the HE and VHE gamma rays, and between HE gamma rays and the X-ray, that disappear when the large flare in February 2010 is excluded from the correlation study. The activity of Mrk 421 also yielded the first ejection of features in the VLBA images of the jet of Mrk 421. Yet the large uncertainties in the ejection times of these radio features prevent us from firmly associating them to the specific flares recorded during the campaign. We also show that the collected multi-instrument data are consistent with a scenario where the emission is dominated by two regions, a compact and extended zone, which could be considered as a simplified implementation of an energy-stratified jet as suggested by recent IXPE observations.</description>

      <title>Cosmic-ray acceleration and escape from supernova remnant W44 as probed by Fermi-LAT and MAGIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. The supernova remnant (SNR) W44 and its surroundings are a prime target for studying the acceleration of cosmic rays (CRs). Several previous studies established an extended gamma-ray emission that is set apart from the radio shell of W44. This emission is thought to originate from escaped high-energy CRs that interact with a surrounding dense molecular cloud complex. Aims. We present a detailed analysis of Fermi-LAT data with an emphasis on the spatial and spectral properties of W44 and its surroundings. We also report the results of the observations performed with the MAGIC telescopes of the northwestern region of W44. Finally, we present an interpretation model to explain the gamma-ray emission of the SNR and its surroundings. Methods. We first performed a detailed spatial analysis of 12 years of Fermi-LAT data at energies above 1 GeV, in order to exploit the better angular resolution, while we set a threshold of 100MeV for the spectral analysis. We performed a likelihood analysis of 174 hours of MAGIC data above 130 GeV using the spatial information obtained with Fermi-LAT. Results. The combined spectra of Fermi-LAT and MAGIC, extending from 100MeV to several TeV, were used to derive constraints on the escape of CRs. Using a time-dependent model to describe the particle acceleration and escape from the SNR, we show that the maximum energy of the accelerated particles has to be ' 40 GeV. However, our gamma-ray data suggest that a small number of lower-energy particles also needs to escape. We propose a novel model, the broken-shock scenario, to account for this effect and explain the gamma-ray emission.</description>

      <title>A novel experimental approach to uncover the nature of cosmic-ray Deuterium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the isotopic composition of cosmic-rays (CRs) provides crucial insights into the galactic environment and helps improve existing propagation models. Special attention is given to the secondary-to-primary ratios of light isotopic components in CRs, as these measurements can offer complementary data compared to traditional secondary-to-primary ratios like B/C. Recently, a precision measurement of the Deuterium (D) abundance in CR in the 2-21 GV rigidity range provided by the AMS02 experiment unexpectedly detected an excess of D with respect to its expected secondary nature, opening the field for new measurements at high rigidity to determine how the spectrum evolves and whether there is confirmation of a primary or primary plus secondary origin. While there are theoretical models that attempt to explain this excess, the experimental uncertainties on D production cross-sections and on CR propagation models remain significant, and only new and precise measurements can dissipate existing doubts. In this work we review the current experimental scenario and we propose a dedicated experiment able to extend the D abundance measurement up to 100 GeV/nucl without the need of a magnetic spectrometer, using a multiple scattering based technique for the measurement of particle momentum. The expected performances of the proposed detector were assessed through a dedicated simulation using the GEANT4 package, and its role in the current particle physics scenario is discussed.</description>

      <title>The Variable X-ray Emission of the Cataclysmic Variable V1460 Her with a Rapidly Rotating White Dwarf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using a recent Chandra ACIS observation of the eclipsing cataclysmic variable (CV) V1460 Her (2MASS J16211735+4412541) with a fast-rotating ($P_{\rm spin} = 38.9$~s) white dwarf, we estimated a flux $F_{0.5-7 {\rm keV}}^{\rm abs} = (1.9\pm 0.5)\times 10^{-14}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$, a factor of $\sim7$ lower than found from previous Swift XRT observations $\approx8$ years ago, when the CV was quiescent. The drop in the flux suggests a corresponding drop in the accretion rate, and the resulting intrinsic luminosity $L_{0.5-7 {\rm keV}} \sim 1.6\times 10^{29}$ erg s$^{-1}$ places V1460 Her among the lowest-luminosity magnetic CVs known, in a state of very low accretion.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots are Tidal Disruption Events in Runaway-Collapsing Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03309v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I hypothesize a physical explanation for the "Little Red Dots" (LRDs) discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). The first star formation in the universe occurs in dense clusters, some of which may undergo runaway collapse and form an intermediate mass black hole. This process would appear as a very dense stellar system, with recurring tidal disruption events (TDEs) as stellar material is accreted by the black hole. Such a system would be compact, UV-emitting, and exhibit broad H-alpha emission. If runaway collapse is the primary mechanism for forming massive black hole seeds, this process could be fairly common and explain the large volume densities of LRDs. In order to match the predicted number density of runaway collapse clusters, the tidal disruption rate must be on the order of 10^-4 per year. A top-heavy stellar initial mass function may be required to match observations without exceeding the predicted LambdaCDM mass function. The TDE LRD hypothesis can be verified with followup JWST observations looking for TDE-like variability.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Detection of a 2.9-hour Orbit in a Long Period Radio Transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long Period radio Transients (LPTs) are a mysterious new class of radio transients pulsating on periods of minutes to hours. So far, eight LPTs have been discovered predominantly at low Galactic latitudes, yet their nature remains unknown. Here, I present the first phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of the 2.9-h LPT GLEAM-X J0704-37, acquired with the 10-m Keck I telescope. Radial velocity (RV) shifts of $189\pm 3 \textrm{km s}^{-1}$ of an M5-type star in a binary system are detected on a period nearly equal to the radio period. Weak H$\alpha$ emission is also present, with some of it possibly originating from outside of the M dwarf. Based on the RV amplitude, and assuming a typical M dwarf mass, the companion mass must be $M \geq 0.22 M_\odot$. Calibrating the spectra with space-based \textit{Gaia} photometry reveals that the system is nearly four times closer than previously reported, at $d \approx 400$ pc, suggesting that more systems could be nearby and amenable to optical characterization. The optical spectrum between 3500-10,000 Angstrom is well modeled by a binary comprised of a massive white dwarf (WD; $T_\textrm{eff}\approx$7,300 K, $M\approx0.8-1.0M_\odot$) and M dwarf ($T_\textrm{eff}\approx$3,000 K, $M\approx0.14M_\odot$). Radio pulses arrive when the WD is at nearly maximum blueshift and the M dwarf at nearly maximum redshift, in contrast to what has been reported in a similar LPT, ILT J1101+5521. GLEAM-X J0704-37 is now the second LPT with an orbital period nearly equal to the radio period, hinting at two classes of LPTs: ``long LPTs'' ($P\gtrsim$78 min) associated with WD + M dwarf binary orbits, and ``short LPTs'' ($P\lesssim$78 min) related to WD or neutron star spins. This work demonstrates that precise localization of LPTs, which enables optical follow-up, will be key in uncovering the mechanism(s) that power this new class of phenomenon.</description>

      <title>HST Observations within the Sphere of Influence of the Powerful Supermassive Black Hole in PKS0745-191</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph observations from the Hubble Space Telescope of the supermassive black hole (SMBH) at the center of PKS0745-191, a brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) undergoing powerful radio-mode AGN feedback ($P_{\rm cav}\sim5\times10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$). These high-resolution data offer the first spatially resolved map of gas dynamics within a SMBHs sphere of influence under such powerful feedback. Our results reveal the presence of highly chaotic, non-rotational ionized gas flows on sub-kpc scales, in contrast to the more coherent flows observed on larger scales. While radio-mode feedback effectively thermalizes hot gas in galaxy clusters on kiloparsec scales, within the core, the hot gas flow may decouple, leading to a reduction in angular momentum and supplying ionized gas through cooling, which could enhance accretion onto the SMBH. This process could, in turn, lead to a self-regulating feedback loop. Compared to other BCGs with weaker radio-mode feedback, where rotation is more stable, intense feedback may lead to more chaotic flows, indicating a stronger coupling between jet activity and gas dynamics. Additionally, we observe a sharp increase in velocity dispersion near the nucleus, consistent with a very massive $M_{\rm BH}\sim1.5\times10^{10} M_\odot$ SMBH. The density profile of the ionized gas is also notably flat, paralleling the profiles observed in X-ray gas around galaxies where the Bondi radius is resolved. These results provide valuable insights into the complex mechanisms driving galaxy evolution, highlighting the intricate relationship between SMBH fueling and AGN feedback within the host galaxy.</description>

      <title>Using the STIX background detector as a proxy for GOES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-Rays (STIX) onboard Solar Orbiter was designed to observe solar flares in the X-ray range of 4-150 keV, providing spectral, temporal and spatial information. Besides 30 imaging detectors, STIX has two additional detectors, the coarse flare locator (CFL) and the background (BKG) detector. Flares observed from Earth are classified using their peak X-ray flux observed by the GOES satellites. Roughly half of all flares observed by STIX are located on the backside of the Sun. These flares lack a GOES-class classification.
  Aims. In this paper, we describe the calibration of the BKG detector aperture sizes. Using the calibrated measurements of the BKG detector, we explore the relationship between the peak flux for flares jointly observed by STIX and GOES. This allows us to estimate the GOES flare classes of backside flares using STIX measurements.
  Methods. We looked at the 500 largest flares observed by both STIX and GOES in the time range Feb. 21 to Apr. 23. Aperture size calibration is done by comparing 4-10 keV counts of the BKG detector with the CFL measurements. In a second step, we correlate the calibrated STIX BKG peak flux with the GOES peak flux for individual flares.
  Results. We calibrated the BKG detector aperture sizes of STIX. Further, we showed that for the larger flares a close power law fit exists between the STIX BKG and GOES peak flux with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.97. This correlation provides a GOES proxy with a one sigma uncertainty of 11%. We were able to show that the BKG detector can reliably measure a broad range of GOES flare classes from roughly B5 up to at least X85 (assuming a radial distance of 1AU), making it an interesting detector-concept for future space weather missions. The largest flare observed by STIX to date is an estimated X16.5 $\pm$ 1.8 backside flare on the 20 Mai 2024.</description>

      <title>Effects of energetic particles produced by magnetic reconnection on discs of young stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T Tauri stars and their discs are crucial for understanding stellar evolution and the formation of planets in low-mass systems. These stars exhibit significant variability, notably emitting intense X-ray flares due to magnetic reconnection events. During these events, magnetic energy is converted into kinetic energy of particles. Some of these particles then heat the plasma of the underlying chromosphere, emitting the observed X-rays. A portion of particles are thought to escape the chromosphere to interact with the surrounding circumstellar environment. The question is what impact do particles produced by magnetic reconnection events have on the discs of young stars.
  The complex characteristics of protoplanetary discs around T Tauri stars require an interdisciplinary strategy to enhance our understanding of these objects. This thesis contribute to establish a framework combining observational methodologies, chemical and dynamic models of protoplanetary discs, and the mechanics of acceleration and transport of energetic particles.
  We indroduce the role of ionisation in disc dynamics, including its sources. Not only from standard sources like stellar radiation and galactic cosmic rays but also from non-thermal ionisation due to magnetic reconnection events. We then examine energetic particles accelerated during magnetic reconnection events in T Tauri flares as an alternative source of ionisation, requiring the construction of a theoretical model based on solar flares. Then, we present a study revealing that particles from magnetic reconnection events could significantly contribute to the ionisation of the inner disc. Finally, we present a complementary study accounting for temporal effects, showing that considering these particles could increase the ionisation rate as well as viscosity, accretion rate, volumetric heating rate, and chemical complexity of inner protoplanetary discs.</description>

      <title>Jet properties of FR0 radio galaxies: need for VLBI data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03787v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fanaroff-Riley (FR) type 0 radio galaxies are a subclass of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) that lack extended kpc-scale jets, different from the classical FRI and FRII radio galaxies. They constitute the most abundant population of radio galaxies in the local Universe (z&lt;0.1), yet remain largely unexplored. VLBI observations of a limited number of FR0s demonstrated that their central supermassive black hole (SMBH) are able to lunch mostly two-sided jets, with mildly relativistic bulk speed. In this work, we highlight the need of further high-resolution radio observations to probe the jet structures of these compact radio galaxies, by showing exploratory results of our EVN+eMERLIN observation campaign of FR0s. A preliminary analysis of these recent data reveals a possible change of the jet direction at different scales. We shortly discuss their physical conditions to explain the observed jet compactness, stressing the role of the SMBH spin vector in shaping their radio morphology</description>

      <title>Enabling high mass accretion rates onto massive main sequence stars by outer envelope mass removal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03947</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03947v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the one-dimensional numerical code MESA, we simulate mass accretion at very high rates onto massive main sequence stars, M=30, 60, 80 Mo, and find that these stars can accrete up to 10% of their mass without expanding much if we consider a simultaneous mass removal by jets. In this jetted-mass-removal accretion scenario, the accretion is through an accretion disk that launches jets. When the star expands due to rapid mass accretion, it engulfs the inner zones of the accretion disk and the jets it launches. We assume that these jets remove the outer layers of the envelope. We mimic this in the one-dimensional numerical code by alternating mass addition and mass removal parts. We add mass and energy, the accretion energy, to the outer layers of the envelope, leading to rapid stellar expansion. When the star expands by a few tens of percent, we stop mass addition and start mass removal until the star returns to its initial radius. We also show that the density of the accretion disk is larger than the density of the outer layers of the inflated envelope, allowing the disk to launch jets inside the outer inflated envelope layers. Our results show that main sequence stars can accrete mass at high rates while maintaining the deep potential well, as some models of eruptive systems require, e.g., some luminous red novae, the grazing envelope evolution, and the 1837-1856 Great Eruption of Eta Carinae.</description>

      <title>GRB Redshift Classifier to Follow-up High-Redshift GRBs Using Supervised Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08763v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are intense, short-lived bursts of gamma-ray radiation observed up to a high redshift ($z \sim 10$) due to their luminosities. Thus, they can serve as cosmological tools to probe the early Universe. However, we need a large sample of high$-z$ GRBs, currently limited due to the difficulty in securing time at the large aperture Telescopes. Thus, it is painstaking to determine quickly whether a GRB is high$z$ or low$-z$, which hampers the possibility of performing rapid follow-up observations. Previous efforts to distinguish between high$-$ and low$-z$ GRBs using GRB properties and machine learning (ML) have resulted in limited sensitivity. In this study, we aim to improve this classification by employing an ensemble ML method on 251 GRBs with measured redshifts and plateaus observed by the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory. Incorporating the plateau phase with the prompt emission, we have employed an ensemble of classification methods to enhance the sensitivity unprecedentedly. Additionally, we investigate the effectiveness of various classification methods using different redshift thresholds, $z_{threshold}$=$z_t$ at $z_{t}=$ 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5. We achieve a sensitivity of 87\% and 89\% with a balanced sampling for both $z_{t}=3.0$ and $z_{t}=3.5$, respectively, representing a 9\% and 11\% increase in the sensitivity over Random Forest used alone. Overall, the best results are at $z_{t} = 3.5$, where the difference between the sensitivity of the training set and the test set is the smallest. This enhancement of the proposed method paves the way for new and intriguing follow-up observations of high$-z$ GRBs.</description>

      <title>A machine-learning classifier for the postmerger remnant of binary neutron stars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10678v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knowing the kind of remnant produced after the merger of a binary neutron star system, e.g., if a black hole forms or not, would not only shed light on the equation of state describing the extremely dense matter inside neutron stars, but also help understand the physical processes involved in the postmerger phase. Moreover, in the event of a gravitational-wave detection, predicting the presence of a neutron star remnant is crucial in order to advise potential electromagnetic follow-up campaigns. In this work, we use Gradient Boosted Decision Trees and publicly available data from numerical-relativity simulations to construct a classifier that predicts the outcome of binary neutron star mergers, based on the binary's parameters inferred from gravitational-wave inspiral signals: total mass, mass-weighted tidal deformability, mass ratio, and effective inspiral spin. Employing parameters that can be estimated from the inspiral part of the signal only allows us to predict the remnant independently on the detection of a postmerger gravitational-wave signal. We build three different classifiers to distinguish between various potential scenarios, we estimate their accuracy and the confidence of their predictions. Finally, we apply the developed classifiers to real events data, finding that GW170817 most likely led to the formation of a hypermassive neutron star, while GW190425 to a prompt collapse to a black hole.</description>

Abstract: We present GTC-OSIRIS phase-resolved optical spectroscopy of three compact binary MSPs, or 'spiders': PSR J1048+2339, PSR J1810+1744, and (for the first time) PSR J1908+2105. For the companion in each system, the temperature is traced throughout its orbit, and radial velocities are measured. The radial velocities are found to vary with the absorption features used when measuring them, resulting in different radial velocity curve semi-amplitudes: for J1048 ($K_\mathrm{metals, red} = 344 \pm 4$ km s$^{-1}$, $K_\mathrm{metals, blue} = 372 \pm 3$ km s$^{-1}$) and, tentatively, for J1810 ($K_\mathrm{Balmer} = 448 \pm 19$ km s$^{-1}$, $K_\mathrm{metals} = 491 \pm 32$ km s$^{-1}$). With existing inclination constraints, this gives the neutron star (NS) and companion masses $M_\mathrm{NS} = 1.50 - 2.04$ $M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.32 - 0.40$ $M_\odot$ for J1048, and $M_\mathrm{NS} &gt; 1.7$ $M_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.05 - 0.08$ $M_\odot$ for J1810. For J1908, we find an upper limit of $K_2 &lt; 32$ km s$^{-1}$, which constrains its mass ratio $q = M_2 / M_\mathrm{NS} &gt; 0.55$ and inclination $i &lt; 6.0^\circ$, revealing the previously misunderstood system to be the highest mass ratio, lowest inclination redback yet. This raises questions for the origins of its substantial radio eclipses. Additionally, we find evidence of asymmetric heating in J1048 and J1810, and signs of metal enrichment in J1908. We also explore the impact of inclination on spectroscopic temperatures, and demonstrate that the temperature measured at quadrature ($\phi = 0.25, 0.75$) is essentially independent of inclination, and thus can provide additional constraints on photometric modelling.</description>

      <title>The size of accretion disks from self-consistent X-ray spectra and UV/optical/NIR photometry fitting: applications to ASASSN-14li and HLX-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17296</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17296v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We implement a standard thin disk model with the outer disk radius ($R_{\rm out}$) as a free parameter, integrating it into standard X-ray fitting package to enable self-consistent and simultaneous fitting of X-ray spectra and UV/optical/NIR photometry. We apply the model to the late-time data ($\Delta t \approx 350-1300$ days) of the tidal disruption event (TDE) ASASSN-14li. We show that at these late-times the multi-wavelength emission of the source can be fully described by a bare compact accretion disk. We obtain a black hole mass ($M_{\rm BH}$) of $7^{+3}_{-2}\times10^{6} M_{\odot}$, consistent with host-galaxy scaling relations; and an $R_{\rm out}$ of $45 \pm 13 \, R_{\rm g}$, consistent with the circularization radius, with possible expansion at the latest epoch. We discuss how simplistic models, such as a single-temperature blackbody fitted to either X-ray spectra or UV/optical photometry, lead to erroneous interpretations on the scale/energetics of TDE emission. We also apply the model to the soft/high state of the intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) candidate HLX-1. The model fits the full spectral energy distribution (from X-rays to NIR) without needing an additional stellar population component. We investigate how relativistic effects improve our results by implementing a version of the model with full ray tracing calculations in the Kerr metric. For HLX-1, we find $M_{\rm BH} = 4^{+3}_{-1} \times 10^{4} M_{\odot}$ and $R_{\rm out} \approx {\rm few} \times 10^{3} \, R_{\rm g}$, in agreement with previous findings. The relativistic model can constrain the inclination ($i$) of HLX-1 to be $10^o \leq i \leq 70^o$.</description>

Abstract: Massive black-hole binaries will be the loudest sources detectable by LISA. These systems are predicted to form during the hierarchical assembly of cosmic structures and coalesce by interacting with the surrounding environment. The hardening phase of their orbit is driven by either stars or gas and encodes distinctive features into the binary black holes that can potentially be reconstructed with gravitational-wave observations. We present a Bayesian framework to assess the likelihood of massive mergers being hardened by either gaseous or stellar interactions. We use state-of-the-art astrophysical models tracking the cosmological evolution of massive black-hole binaries and construct a large number of simulated catalogs of sources detectable by LISA. From these, we select a representative catalog and run both parameter estimation assuming a realistic LISA response as well model comparison capturing selection effects. Our results suggest that, at least within the context of the adopted models, future LISA observations can confidently constrain whether stars or gas are responsible for the binary hardening. We stress that accurate astrophysical modeling of the black-hole spins and the inclusion of subdominant emission modes in the adopted signal might be crucial to avoid systematic biases.</description>

      <title>The Disk Wind Contribution to the Gamma-Ray emission from the nearby Seyfert Galaxy GRS 1734-292</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies have been detected in GeV gamma-rays by the $Fermi$ Large Area Telescope (LAT), but the origin of much of this emission is unclear. We consider the nearby example, the Seyfert galaxy GRS 1734-292, which exhibits weak starburst and jet activities that are insufficient to explain the observed gamma-ray flux. With the first detailed multi-wavelength study of this source, we demonstrate that an active galactic nucleus (AGN) disk wind can account for its gamma-ray emission. Using a lepto-hadronic emission model based on a shocked ambient medium and a shocked wind region created by an AGN accretion disk wind, we identify two viable scenarios that are consistent with the $Fermi$-LAT data and multi-wavelength observations: a hadronic $pp$-dominated scenario and a leptonic external Compton-dominated scenario. Both of these show that future observations with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and the Southern Wide-field Gamma-ray Observatory (SWGO) could detect TeV emission from a disk wind in GRS 1734-292. Such a detection would substantially improve our understanding of cosmic ray acceleration efficiency in AGN disk wind systems, and would establish radio-quiet Seyfert galaxies as cosmic ray accelerators capable of reaching ultra-high energies.</description>

      <title>Self-organized critical characteristics of teraelectronvolt photons from GRB 221009A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16052v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The very high-energy afterglow in GRB 221009A, known as the ``brightest of all time'' (BOAT), has been thoroughly analyzed in previous studies. In this paper, we conducted a statistical analysis of the waiting time behavior of 172 TeV photons from the BOAT observed by LHAASO-KM2A. The following results were obtained: (I) The waiting time distribution (WTD) of these photons deviates from the exponential distribution. (II) The behavior of these photons exhibits characteristics resembling those of a self-organized critical system, such as a power-law distribution and scale-invariance features in the WTD. The power-law distribution of waiting times is consistent with the prediction of a nonstationary process. (III) The relationship between the power-law slopes of the WTD and the scale-invariant characteristics of the Tsallis q-Gaussian distribution deviates from existing theory. We suggest that this deviation is due to the photons not being completely independent of each other. In summary, the power-law and scale-free characteristics observed in these photons imply a self-organized critical process in the generation of teraelectronvolt photons from GRB 221009A. Based on other relevant research, we propose that the involvement of a partially magnetically dominated component and the continuous energy injection from the central engine can lead to deviations in the generation of teraelectronvolt afterglow from the simple external shock-dominated process, thereby exhibiting the self-organized critical characteristics mentioned above.</description>

      <title>Searches for primary photons and neutrinos with the Pierre Auger Observatory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory stands as the largest detector for ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays. The Observatory is also sensitive to UHE photons and neutrinos that can be produced along with UHE cosmic rays or in top-down processes, such as the decay of dark matter particles. The search for these neutral particles relies on the hybrid measurements of extensive air showers, combining a fluorescence detector with a surface detector array and an underground muon detector. We present an overview of the searches for UHE photons and neutrinos utilizing data from the Pierre Auger Observatory. Currently, no photon or neutrino candidates have been identified. Consequently, we report on the most stringent limits to the integral UHE photon and neutrino fluxes above 50 PeV and 100 PeV, respectively, from diffuse and point-like steady sources. These limits led to strong constraints on theoretical models describing the cosmological evolution of the acceleration sites and the nature of dark-matter particles. Lastly, we briefly comment on the searches for these neutral particles in coincidence with gravitational wave events, underscoring the pivotal role of the Observatory in the context of multi-messenger astronomy at the highest energies.</description>

      <title>Self-Interacting Dark Sectors in Supernovae Can Behave as a Relativistic Fluid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07714v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We revisit supernova (SN) bounds on a hidden sector consisting of millicharged particles $\chi$ and a massless dark photon. Unless the self-coupling is fine-tuned to be small, rather than exiting the SN core as a gas, the particles form a relativistic fluid and subsequent dark QED fireball, streaming out against the drag due to the interaction with matter. Novel bounds due to excessive energy deposition in the mantle of low-energy SNe can be obtained. The cooling bounds from SN 1987A are unexpectedly not affected in the free-streaming regime. The inclusion of $\chi\bar{\chi}\rightarrow \rm SM$ substantially modifies the constraints in the trapping regime, which can only be treated hydrodynamically. Our results can be adapted to generic sub-GeV self-interacting dark sectors.</description>

      <title>Relic Neutrino Background from Cosmic-Ray Reservoirs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04568</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04568v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the flux of relic neutrino background (R$\nu$B) up-scattered by ultra-high-energy (UHE) cosmic rays (CRs) in clusters that act as CR-reservoirs. The long trapping times of UHECRs make this flux larger than that of R$\nu$B up-scattered by UHECRs on their way to Earth, which we also compute. We find that IceCube excludes R$\nu$B weighted overdensities larger than $10^{10}$ in clusters, and that PUEO, RNO-G, GRAND and IceCube-Gen2 will test values down to $10^{8}$. Our treatment incorporates the momentum transfer dependence of the neutrino-nucleus cross section, deep inelastic scattering, a mixed UHECR composition, and flavour information on the up-scattered R$\nu$B fluxes for both cases of neutrino mass spectrum with normal and inverted ordering, providing new handles to possibly disentangle the up-scattered R$\nu$B from cosmogenic neutrinos.</description>

      <title>AGN energetics and lifetimes from remnant radio galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.11777v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The energy coupling efficiency of active galactic nucleus (AGN) outbursts is known to {vary} significantly with factors including the jet kinetic power, duration of the outburst, and properties of the host galaxy group or cluster. As such, constraints on their jet power and lifetime functions are crucial to quantify the role of kinetic-mode AGN feedback on the evolution of galaxies since $z \sim 1$. In this work, we address this issue by measuring the energetics of a sample of 79~low-redshift (0.02 $&lt; z &lt;$ 0.2) remnant radio galaxies compiled from large-sky radio surveys - remnants uniquely probe the full duration of an AGN outburst. The jet kinetic power and outburst duration of each remnant are determined using the RAiSE dynamical model based on the surface brightness distribution observed in multi-frequency radio images. We compare the energetics constrained for this sample to those predicted for mock radio source populations - with various intrinsic functions for jet power and lifetime distributions - to correct for sample selection biases imposed on our sample. The intrinsic jet power and lifetime functions that yield a selection-biased mock population most similar to our observed sample are determined using Bayesian inference. Our analysis places robust constraints on assumed power-law indices for the intrinsic jet power and lifetime functions: $p(Q)\propto Q^{-1.49\pm0.07}$ and $p(t_{\mathrm{on}})\propto t_{\mathrm{on}}^{-0.97\pm0.12}$ respectively. We discuss the implications of these findings for feedback-regulated accretion and the self-regulating nature of jet activity. The methodology proposed in this work can be extended to active radio galaxies in future studies.</description>

      <title>Searching for gravitational waves from stellar-mass binary black holes early inspiral</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The early inspiral from stellar-mass binary black holes (sBBHs) can emit milli-Hertz gravitational wave signals, making them detectable sources for space-borne gravitational wave missions like TianQin. However, the traditional matched filtering technique poses a significant challenge for analyzing this kind of signal, as it requires an impractically high number of templates ranging from $10^{31}$ to $10^{40}$. We propose a search strategy that involves two main parts: initially, we reduce the dimensionality of the simulated signals using incremental principal component analysis (IPCA). Subsequently, we train the convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based on the compressed TianQin data obtained from IPCA, aiming to develop both a detection model and a point parameter estimation model. The compression efficiency for the trained IPCA model achieves a cumulative variance ratio of 95.6% when applied to $10^6$ simulated signals. To evaluate the performance of CNN we generate the receiver operating characteristic curve for the detection model which is applied to the test data with varying signal-to-noise ratios. At a false alarm probability of 5%, the corresponding true alarm probability for signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50 is 86.5%. Subsequently, we introduce the point estimation model to evaluate the value of the chirp mass of corresponding sBBH signals with an error. For signals with a signal-to-noise ratio of 50, the trained point estimation CNN model can estimate the chirp mass of most test events, with a standard deviation error of 2.49 $M_{\odot}$and a relative error precision of 0.13.</description>

      <title>Theory of neutrino fast flavor evolution. Part II. Solutions at the edge of instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17232</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17232v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In dense neutrino environments, such as provided by core-collapse supernovae or neutron-star mergers, neutrino angular distributions may be unstable to collective flavor conversions, whose outcome remains to be fully understood. These conversions are much faster than hydrodynamical scales, suggesting that self-consistent configurations may never be strongly unstable. With this motivation in mind, we study weakly unstable modes, i.e., those with small growth rates. We show that our newly developed dispersion relation (Paper~I of this series) allows for an expansion in powers of the small growth rate. For weakly unstable distributions, we show that the unstable modes must either move with subluminal phase velocity, or very close to the speed of light. The instability is fed from neutrinos moving resonantly with the waves, allowing us to derive explicit expressions for the growth rate. For axisymmetric distributions, often assumed in the literature, numerical examples show the accuracy of these expressions. We also note that for the often-studied one-dimensional systems one should not forget the axial-symmetry-breaking modes, and we provide explicit expressions for the range of wavenumbers that exhibit instabilities.</description>

      <title>To stealth or not to stealth: Thermodynamics of stealth black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using Euclidean methods we investigate the thermodynamics of stealth black hole solutions, which are solutions that geometrically are indistinguishable from those of general relativity, however they are accompanied by a non-trivial additional field that does not back-react to the metric. We find that in general, one can observe shifts in the mass and/or the entropy of such black holes, hence, at least at the thermodynamic level, the stealth solutions may be distinguished by the those of general relativity. We also point out an example, the {\it{bona fide stealth}}, where a non-trivial scalar field can accompany an (A)dS-Schwarzschild black hole without altering the thermodynamic quantities. We point out that thermodynamic discrepancies arise due to the additional boundary terms emanating from the stealth fields, where care should be given in order for the theory at hand to possess a well-defined variational procedure.</description>

      <title>Orbital eccentricity in general relativity from catastrophe theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.00098v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: While the orbital eccentricity is a key feature of the gravitational two-body problem, providing an unambiguous definition in general relativity poses significant challenges. Despite such foundational issue, the eccentricity of binary black holes has important implications in gravitational-wave astronomy. We present a novel approach to consistently define the orbital eccentricity in general relativity, grounded in the mathematical field of catastrophe theory. Specifically, we identify the presence of catastrophes, i.e., breakdowns of the stationary-phase approximation, in numerical relativity waveforms and exploit them to develop a robust and fully gauge-invariant estimator of the eccentricity. Our procedure does not require orbital fitting and naturally satisfies the Newtonian limit. The proposed eccentricity estimator agrees with and generalizes a previous proposal, though with a fully independent derivation. We extract gauge-free eccentricity estimates from about 100 numerical relativity simulations and find that the resulting values are systematically lower compared to those reported alongside the simulations themselves.</description>

      <title>Collective modes in relativistic cold asymmetric nuclear matter within the covariant Vlasov approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.06960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A covariant relativistic approach based on the Vlasov equation is applied to the study of infinite asymmetric nuclear matter. We use several Walecka-type hadronic models and obtain the dispersion relations for the longitudinal modes. The isovector and isoscalar collective modes are determined for a wide range of densities as a function of isospin asymmetry and momentum transfer within a set of eleven relativistic mean field models with different nuclear matter properties. Special attention is given to beta-equilibrium matter. It is shown that the possible propagation of isoscalar and isovector-like modes depends directly on the density dependence of the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state and of the symmetry energy, with a stiff equation of state favouring the propagation of isoscalar like collective modes at high densities, and a stiff symmetry energy defining the behavior of the isovector like modes which propagate for densities below two times saturation density. The coupling of the nuclear modes to the electron plasmon is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Effects of Landau quantization on neutrino emission and absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.02925v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some neutron stars known as magnetars possess very strong magnetic fields, with surface fields as large as $10^{15}\,\rm G$ and internal fields that are possibly stronger. Recent observations of the radio pulsar GLEAM-X J1627 suggest it may have a surface field as strong as $10^{16} \,\rm G$. In the presence of a strong magnetic field, the energy levels of electrons and protons are quantized and the Direct Urca process allows neutron stars to cool rapidly, even at low density. For the case of magnetic fields $B \geq 10^{16}\,\rm G$, we find features in the emissivity due to energy quantization that are not captured by the frequently employed quasiclassical approximation where energy levels are treated as nearly continuous. Resonances can result in amplification of the neutrino emissivity at specific densities compared to a calculation that neglects quantization, particularly at low temperature. These effects are not important for the thermal evolution of an entire neutron star, but may be relevant for phenomena that depend on behavior at specific densities. We present a fully relativistic calculation of the Direct Urca rate in a strong magnetic field using the standard V-A weak Lagrangian incorporating mean field nuclear effects and discuss approaches to the numerical challenge the modified wavefunctions present and a new semi-analytic approximation. These tools are also applicable to calculating neutrino opacities in strong magnetic fields in the ejecta of binary neutron star mergers. We calculate the opacities for neutrinos capturing on free nucleons at sub-saturation densities and temperatures exceeding an MeV. We find an enhancement to capture processes of the lowest energy neutrinos by an order of magnitude or more due to suppression of electron Pauli blocking in the case of capture on neutrons, and from the effect of the nucleon magnetic moments in the case of capture on protons.</description>
