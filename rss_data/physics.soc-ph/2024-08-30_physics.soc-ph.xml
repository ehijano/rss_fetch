      <title>Autocorrelation properties of temporal networks governed by dynamic node variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16270v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study synthetic temporal networks whose evolution is determined by stochastically evolving node variables - synthetic analogues of, e.g., temporal proximity networks of mobile agents. We quantify the long-timescale correlations of these evolving networks by an autocorrelative measure of edge persistence. Several distinct patterns of autocorrelation arise, including power-law decay and exponential decay, depending on the choice of node-variable dynamics and connection probability function. Our methods are also applicable in wider contexts; our temporal network models are tractable mathematically and in simulation, and our long-term memory quantification is analytically tractable and straightforwardly computable from temporal network data.</description>

      <title>On the practicalities of producing a nuclear weapon using high-assay low-enriched uranium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16013v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It was recently argued by Kemp et al. that HALEU (high-assay low-enriched uranium, or uranium enriched up to 19.75\%) can conceivably be used to produce a nuclear weapon and on this basis civilian enrichment limits should be lowered to 10% or 12%. We find their argument unconvincing in several respects.</description>

      <title>Healthcare Utilization Patterns Among Migrant Populations: Increased Readmissions Suggest Poorer Access. A Population-Wide Retrospective Cohort Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Equal access to health ensures that all citizens, regardless of socio-economic status, can achieve optimal health, leading to a more productive, equitable, and resilient society. Yet, migrant populations were frequently observed to have lower access to health. The reasons for this are not entirely clear and may include language barriers, a lack of knowledge of the healthcare system, and selective migration (a "healthy migrant" effect). We use extensive medical claims data from Austria (13 million hospital stays of approximately 4 million individuals) to compare the healthcare utilization patterns between Austrians and non-Austrians. We looked at the differences in primary diagnoses and hospital sections of initial hospital admission across different nationalities. We hypothesize that cohorts experiencing the healthy migrant effect show lower readmission rates after hospitalization compared to migrant populations that are in poorer health but show lower hospitalization rates due to barriers in access. We indeed find that all nationalities showed lower hospitalization rates than Austrians, except for Germans, who exhibit a similar healthcare usage to Austrians. Although around 20\% of the population has a migration background, non-Austrian citizens account for only 9.4% of the hospital patients and 9.79% of hospital nights. However, results for readmission rates are much more divergent. Nationalities like Hungary, Romania, and Turkey (females) show decreased readmission rates in line with the healthy migrant effect. Patients from Russia, Serbia, and Turkey (males) show increased readmissions, suggesting that their lower hospitalization rates are more likely due to access barriers. Considering the surge in migration, our findings shed light on healthcare access and usage behaviours across patients with different nationalities, offering new insights and perspectives.</description>

      <title>Predictability maximization and the origins of word order harmony</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16570v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the linguistic problem of the sequential arrangement of a head and its dependents from an information theoretic perspective. In particular, we consider the optimal placement of a head that maximizes the predictability of the sequence. We assume that dependents are statistically independent given a head, in line with the open-choice principle and the core assumptions of dependency grammar. We demonstrate the optimality of harmonic order, i.e., placing the head last maximizes the predictability of the head whereas placing the head first maximizes the predictability of dependents. We also show that postponing the head is the optimal strategy to maximize its predictability while bringing it forward is the optimal strategy to maximize the predictability of dependents. We unravel the advantages of the strategy of maximizing the predictability of the head over maximizing the predictability of dependents. Our findings shed light on the placements of the head adopted by real languages or emerging in different kinds of experiments.</description>

      <title>Independence role in the generalized Sznajd model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.13309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.13309v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Sznajd model is one of sociophysics's well-known opinion dynamics models. Based on social validation, it has found application in diverse social systems and remains an intriguing subject of study, particularly in scenarios where interacting agents deviate from prevailing norms. This paper investigates the generalized Sznajd model, featuring independent agents on a complete graph and a two-dimensional square lattice. Agents in the network act independently with a probability $p$, signifying a change in their opinion or state without external influence. This model defines a paired agent size $r$, influencing a neighboring agent size $n$ to adopt their opinion. This study incorporates analytical and numerical approaches, especially on the complete graph. Our results show that the macroscopic state of the system remains unaffected by the neighbor size $n$ but is contingent solely on the number of paired agents $r$. Additionally, the time required to reach a stationary state is inversely proportional to the number of neighboring agents $n$. For the two-dimensional square lattice, two critical points $p = p_c$ emerge based on the configuration of agents. The results indicate that the universality class of the model on the complete graph aligns with the mean-field Ising universality class. Furthermore, the universality class of the model on the two-dimensional square lattice, featuring two distinct configurations, is identical and falls within the two-dimensional Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>Constant-selection evolutionary dynamics on weighted networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17208v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The population structure often impacts evolutionary dynamics. In constant-selection evolutionary dynamics between two types, amplifiers of selection are networks that promote the fitter mutant to take over the entire population, and suppressors of selection do the opposite. It has been shown that most undirected and unweighted networks are amplifiers of selection under a common updating rule and initial condition. Here, we extensively investigate how edge weights influence selection on undirected networks. We show that random edge weights make small networks less amplifying than the corresponding unweighted networks in a majority of cases and also make them suppressors of selection (i.e., less amplifying than the complete graph, or equivalently, the Moran process) in many cases. Qualitatively, the same result holds true for larger empirical networks. These results suggest that amplifiers of selection are not as common for weighted networks as for unweighted counterparts.</description>

      <title>Recent Decade's Power Outage Data Reveals the Increasing Vulnerability of U.S. Power Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15882v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite significant anecdotal evidence regarding the vulnerability of the U.S. power infrastructure, there is a dearth of longitudinal and nation-level characterization of the spatial and temporal patterns in the frequency and extent of power outages. A data-driven national-level characterization of power outage vulnerability is particularly essential for understanding the urgency and formulating policies to promote the resilience of power infrastructure systems. Recognizing this, we retrieved 179,053,397 county-level power outage records with a 15-minute interval across 3,022 US counties during 2014-2023 to capture power outage characteristics. We focus on three dimensions--power outage intensity, frequency, and duration--and develop multiple metrics to quantify each dimension of power outage vulnerability. The results show that in the past ten years, the vulnerability of U.S. power system has consistently been increasing. Counties experienced an average of 999.4 outages over the decade, affecting an average of more than 540,000 customers per county, with disruptions occurring approximately every week. Coastal areas, particularly in California, Florida and New Jersey, faced more frequent and prolonged outages, while inland regions showed higher outage rates. A concerning increase in outage frequency and intensity was noted, especially after 2017, with a sharp rise in prolonged outages since 2019. The research also found positive association between social vulnerability and outage metrics, with the association becoming stronger over the years under study. Areas with higher social vulnerability experienced more severe and frequent outages, exacerbating challenges in these regions. These findings reveal the much-needed empirical evidence for stakeholders to inform policy formulation and program development for enhancing the resilience of the U.S. power infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Statistical properties of probabilistic context-sensitive grammars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07113v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probabilistic context-free grammars (PCFGs), which are commonly used to generate trees randomly, have been well analyzed theoretically, leading to applications in various domains. Despite their utility, the distributions that the grammar can express are limited to those in which the distribution of a subtree depends only on its root and not on its context. This limitation presents a challenge for modeling various real-world phenomena, such as natural languages. To overcome this limitation, a probabilistic context-sensitive grammar (PCSG) is introduced, where the distribution of a subtree depends on its context. Numerical analysis of a PCSG reveals that the distribution of a symbol does not constitute a qualitative difference from that in the context-free case, but mutual information does. Furthermore, a novel metric introduced to directly quantify the breaking of this limitation detects a distinct difference between PCFGs and PCSGs. This metric, applicable to an arbitrary distribution of a tree, allows for further investigation and characterization of various tree structures that PCFGs cannot express.</description>
