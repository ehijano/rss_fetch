      <title>Copula Analysis of Risk: A Multivariate Risk Analysis for VaR and CoVaR using Copulas and DCC-GARCH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06950</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06950v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A multivariate risk analysis for VaR and CVaR using different copula families is performed on historical financial time series fitted with DCC-GARCH models. A theoretical background is provided alongside a comparison of goodness-of-fit across different copula families to estimate the validity and effectiveness of approaches discussed.</description>

      <title>LSR-IGRU: Stock Trend Prediction Based on Long Short-Term Relationships and Improved GRU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08282v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stock price prediction is a challenging problem in the field of finance and receives widespread attention. In recent years, with the rapid development of technologies such as deep learning and graph neural networks, more research methods have begun to focus on exploring the interrelationships between stocks. However, existing methods mostly focus on the short-term dynamic relationships of stocks and directly integrating relationship information with temporal information. They often overlook the complex nonlinear dynamic characteristics and potential higher-order interaction relationships among stocks in the stock market. Therefore, we propose a stock price trend prediction model named LSR-IGRU in this paper, which is based on long short-term stock relationships and an improved GRU input. Firstly, we construct a long short-term relationship matrix between stocks, where secondary industry information is employed for the first time to capture long-term relationships of stocks, and overnight price information is utilized to establish short-term relationships. Next, we improve the inputs of the GRU model at each step, enabling the model to more effectively integrate temporal information and long short-term relationship information, thereby significantly improving the accuracy of predicting stock trend changes. Finally, through extensive experiments on multiple datasets from stock markets in China and the United States, we validate the superiority of the proposed LSR-IGRU model over the current state-of-the-art baseline models. We also apply the proposed model to the algorithmic trading system of a financial company, achieving significantly higher cumulative portfolio returns compared to other baseline methods.

      <title>Market information of the fractional stochastic regularity model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07159v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Fractional Stochastic Regularity Model (FSRM) is an extension of Black-Scholes model describing the multifractal nature of prices. It is based on a multifractional process with a random Hurst exponent $H_t$, driven by a fractional Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (fOU) process. When the regularity parameter $H_t$ is equal to $1/2$, the efficient market hypothesis holds, but when $H_t\neq 1/2$ past price returns contain some information on a future trend or mean-reversion of the log-price process. In this paper, we investigate some properties of the fOU process and, thanks to information theory and Shannon's entropy, we determine theoretically the serial information of the regularity process $H_t$ of the FSRM, giving some insight into one's ability to forecast future price increments and to build statistical arbitrages with this model.</description>
