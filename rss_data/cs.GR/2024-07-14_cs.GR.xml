      <title>Bridging the Gap between Human Motion and Action Semantics via Kinematic Phrases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.04189v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motion understanding aims to establish a reliable mapping between motion and action semantics, while it is a challenging many-to-many problem. An abstract action semantic (i.e., walk forwards) could be conveyed by perceptually diverse motions (walking with arms up or swinging). In contrast, a motion could carry different semantics w.r.t. its context and intention. This makes an elegant mapping between them difficult. Previous attempts adopted direct-mapping paradigms with limited reliability. Also, current automatic metrics fail to provide reliable assessments of the consistency between motions and action semantics. We identify the source of these problems as the significant gap between the two modalities. To alleviate this gap, we propose Kinematic Phrases (KP) that take the objective kinematic facts of human motion with proper abstraction, interpretability, and generality. Based on KP, we can unify a motion knowledge base and build a motion understanding system. Meanwhile, KP can be automatically converted from motions to text descriptions with no subjective bias, inspiring Kinematic Prompt Generation (KPG) as a novel white-box motion generation benchmark. In extensive experiments, our approach shows superiority over other methods. Our project is available at https://foruck.github.io/KP/.</description>

      <title>AirSketch: Generative Motion to Sketch</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08906v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Illustration is a fundamental mode of human expression and communication. Certain types of motion that accompany speech can provide this illustrative mode of communication. While Augmented and Virtual Reality technologies (AR/VR) have introduced tools for producing drawings with hand motions (air drawing), they typically require costly hardware and additional digital markers, thereby limiting their accessibility and portability. Furthermore, air drawing demands considerable skill to achieve aesthetic results. To address these challenges, we introduce the concept of AirSketch, aimed at generating faithful and visually coherent sketches directly from hand motions, eliminating the need for complicated headsets or markers. We devise a simple augmentation-based self-supervised training procedure, enabling a controllable image diffusion model to learn to translate from highly noisy hand tracking images to clean, aesthetically pleasing sketches, while preserving the essential visual cues from the original tracking data. We present two air drawing datasets to study this problem. Our findings demonstrate that beyond producing photo-realistic images from precise spatial inputs, controllable image diffusion can effectively produce a refined, clear sketch from a noisy input. Our work serves as an initial step towards marker-less air drawing and reveals distinct applications of controllable diffusion models to AirSketch and AR/VR in general.</description>

      <title>TRAVERSE: Traffic-Responsive Autonomous Vehicle Experience &amp; Rare-event Simulation for Enhanced safety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Data for training learning-enabled self-driving cars in the physical world are typically collected in a safe, normal environment. Such data distribution often engenders a strong bias towards safe driving, making self-driving cars unprepared when encountering adversarial scenarios like unexpected accidents. Due to a dearth of such adverse data that is unrealistic for drivers to collect, autonomous vehicles can perform poorly when experiencing such rare events. This work addresses much-needed research by having participants drive a VR vehicle simulator going through simulated traffic with various types of accidental scenarios. It aims to understand human responses and behaviors in simulated accidents, contributing to our understanding of driving dynamics and safety. The simulation framework adopts a robust traffic simulation and is rendered using the Unity Game Engine. Furthermore, the simulation framework is built with portable, light-weight immersive driving simulator hardware, lowering the resource barrier for studies in autonomous driving research.

      <title>LFS-Aware Surface Reconstruction from Unoriented 3D Point Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.13924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.13924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel approach for generating isotropic surface triangle meshes directly from unoriented 3D point clouds, with the mesh density adapting to the estimated local feature size (LFS). Popular reconstruction pipelines first reconstruct a dense mesh from the input point cloud and then apply remeshing to obtain an isotropic mesh. The sequential pipeline makes it hard to find a lower-density mesh while preserving more details. Instead, our approach reconstructs both an implicit function and an LFS-aware mesh sizing function directly from the input point cloud, which is then used to produce the final LFS-aware mesh without remeshing. We combine local curvature radius and shape diameter to estimate the LFS directly from the input point clouds. Additionally, we propose a new mesh solver to solve an implicit function whose zero level set delineates the surface without requiring normal orientation. The added value of our approach is generating isotropic meshes directly from 3D point clouds with an LFS-aware density, thus achieving a trade-off between geometric detail and mesh complexity. Our experiments also demonstrate the robustness of our method to noise, outliers, and missing data and can preserve sharp features for CAD point clouds.</description>

      <title>NeuSDFusion: A Spatial-Aware Generative Model for 3D Shape Completion, Reconstruction, and Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.18241v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 3D shape generation aims to produce innovative 3D content adhering to specific conditions and constraints. Existing methods often decompose 3D shapes into a sequence of localized components, treating each element in isolation without considering spatial consistency. As a result, these approaches exhibit limited versatility in 3D data representation and shape generation, hindering their ability to generate highly diverse 3D shapes that comply with the specified constraints. In this paper, we introduce a novel spatial-aware 3D shape generation framework that leverages 2D plane representations for enhanced 3D shape modeling. To ensure spatial coherence and reduce memory usage, we incorporate a hybrid shape representation technique that directly learns a continuous signed distance field representation of the 3D shape using orthogonal 2D planes. Additionally, we meticulously enforce spatial correspondences across distinct planes using a transformer-based autoencoder structure, promoting the preservation of spatial relationships in the generated 3D shapes. This yields an algorithm that consistently outperforms state-of-the-art 3D shape generation methods on various tasks, including unconditional shape generation, multi-modal shape completion, single-view reconstruction, and text-to-shape synthesis.
