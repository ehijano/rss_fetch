      <title>Impact of Weather on Satellite Communication: Evaluating Starlink Resilience</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satellite communications have emerged as one of the most feasible solutions to provide global wireless coverage and connect the unconnected. Starlink dominates the market with over 7,000 operational satellites in low Earth orbit (LEO) and offers global high-speed and low-latency Internet service for stationary and mobile use cases, including in-motion connectivity for vehicles, vessels, and aircraft. Starlink terminals are designed to handle extreme weather conditions. Starlink recommends a flat high performance (FHP) terminal for users living in areas with extreme weather conditions. The earlier studies evaluated Starlink's FHP throughput for stationary and in-motion users without providing a detailed analysis of how weather affects its performance. There remains a need to investigate the impact of weather on FHP's throughput. In this paper, we address this shortcoming by analyzing the impact of weather on Starlink's performance in Oulu, Finland, a city located in Northern Europe near the Arctic Circle. Our measurements reveal that rain degrades median uplink and downlink throughput by 52.27% and 37.84%, respectively. On the contrary, there was no noticeable impact on the round-trip time. Additionally, we also examine the impact of cloud cover on the Starlink throughput. The linear regression analysis reveals the negative relationship between throughput and cloud cover. The cloud cover of up to 12.5% has around 20% greater throughput than the cloud cover of 87.5%</description>

      <title>Integrating Communication, Sensing, and Security: Progress and Prospects of PLS in ISAC Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The sixth generation of wireless networks defined several key performance indicators (KPIs) for assessing its networks, mainly in terms of reliability, coverage, and sensing. In this regard, remarkable attention has been paid recently to the integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) paradigm as an enabler for efficiently and jointly performing communication and sensing using the same spectrum and hardware resources. On the other hand, ensuring communication and data security has been an imperative requirement for wireless networks throughout their evolution. The physical-layer security (PLS) concept paved the way to catering to the security needs in wireless networks in a sustainable way while guaranteeing theoretically secure transmissions, independently of the computational capacity of adversaries. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to consider a balanced trade-off between communication reliability, sensing, and security in future networks, such as the 5G and beyond, and the 6G. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive and system-wise review of designed secure ISAC systems from a PLS point of view. In particular, the impact of various physical-layer techniques, schemes, and wireless technologies to ensure the sensing-security trade-off is studied from the surveyed work. Furthermore, the amalgamation of PLS and ISAC is analyzed in a broader impact by considering attacks targeting data confidentiality, communication covertness, and sensing spoofing. The paper also serves as a tutorial by presenting several theoretical foundations on ISAC and PLS, which represent a practical guide for readers to develop novel secure ISAC network designs.</description>

      <title>Phase Retrieval via Gain-Based Photonic XY-Hamiltonian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04766</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04766v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase-retrieval from coded diffraction patterns (CDP) is important to X-ray crystallography, diffraction tomography and astronomical imaging, yet remains a hard, non-convex inverse problem. We show that CDP recovery can be reformulated exactly as the minimisation of a continuous-variable XY Hamiltonian and solved by gain-based photonic networks. The coupled-mode equations we exploit are the natural mean-field dynamics of exciton-polariton condensate lattices, coupled-laser arrays and driven photon Bose-Einstein condensates, while other hardware such as the spatial photonic Ising machine can implement the same update rule through high-speed digital feedback, preserving full optical parallelism. Numerical experiments on images, two- and three-dimensional vortices and unstructured complex data demonstrate that the gain-based solver consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art Relaxed-Reflect-Reflect (RRR) algorithm in the medium-noise regime (signal-to-noise ratios 10--40 dB) and retains this advantage as problem size scales. Because the physical platform performs the continuous optimisation, our approach promises fast, energy-efficient phase retrieval on readily available photonic hardware. uch as two- and three-dimensional vortices, and unstructured random data. Moreover, the solver's accuracy remains high as problem sizes increase, underscoring its scalability.</description>

      <title>X-Driver: Explainable Autonomous Driving with Vision-Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05098v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: End-to-end autonomous driving has advanced significantly, offering benefits such as system simplicity and stronger driving performance in both open-loop and closed-loop settings than conventional pipelines. However, existing frameworks still suffer from low success rates in closed-loop evaluations, highlighting their limitations in real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce X-Driver, a unified multi-modal large language models(MLLMs) framework designed for closed-loop autonomous driving, leveraging Chain-of-Thought(CoT) and autoregressive modeling to enhance perception and decision-making. We validate X-Driver across multiple autonomous driving tasks using public benchmarks in CARLA simulation environment, including Bench2Drive[6]. Our experimental results demonstrate superior closed-loop performance, surpassing the current state-of-the-art(SOTA) while improving the interpretability of driving decisions. These findings underscore the importance of structured reasoning in end-to-end driving and establish X-Driver as a strong baseline for future research in closed-loop autonomous driving.</description>

      <title>Empirical Analysis of Transaction Conflicts in Ethereum and Solana for Parallel Execution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of historical data across two popular blockchain networks: Ethereum and Solana. Our study focuses on two key aspects: transaction conflicts and the maximum theoretical parallelism within historical blocks. We aim to quantify the degree of transaction parallelism and assess how effectively it can be exploited by systematically examining block-level characteristics, both within individual blocks and across different historical periods. In particular, this study is the first of its kind to leverage historical transactional workloads to evaluate transactional conflict patterns. By offering a structured approach to analyzing these conflicts, our research provides valuable insights and an empirical basis for developing more efficient parallel execution techniques in the Ethereum and Solana Virtual Machines. Our empirical analysis reveals that Ethereum blocks frequently achieve high independence$-$over 50\% in more than 50\% of blocks, while Solana blocks contain longer conflict chains, comprising $\sim$59\% of the block size compared to $\sim$18\% in Ethereum, reflecting fundamentally different parallel execution dynamics.</description>

      <title>Exhaustive Search for Quantum Circuit Optimization using ZX Calculus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10983v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum computers allow a near-exponential speed-up for specific applications when compared to classical computers. Despite recent advances in the hardware of quantum computers, their practical usage is still severely limited due to a restricted number of available physical qubits and quantum gates, short coherence time, and high error rates. This paper lays the foundation towards a metric independent approach to quantum circuit optimization based on exhaustive search algorithms. This work uses depth-first search and iterative deepening depth-first search. We rely on ZX calculus to represent and optimize quantum circuits through the minimization of a given metric (e.g. the T-gate and edge count). ZX calculus formally guarantees that the semantics of the original circuit is preserved. As ZX calculus is a non-terminating rewriting system, we utilise a novel set of pruning rules to ensure termination while still obtaining high-quality solutions. We provide the first formalization of quantum circuit optimization using ZX calculus and exhaustive search. We extensively benchmark our approach on 100 standard quantum circuits. Finally, our implementation is integrated in the well-known libraries PyZX and Qiskit as a compiler pass to ensure applicability of our results.</description>

      <title>Flexing RISC-V Instruction Subset Processors (RISPs) to Extreme Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04567v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a methodology for automatically generating processors that support a subset of the RISC-V instruction set for a new class of applications at Extreme Edge. The electronics used in extreme edge applications must be power-efficient, but also provide additional qualities, such as low cost, conformability, comfort and sustainability. Flexible electronics, rather than silicon-based electronics, will be capable of meeting these qualities. For this purpose, we propose a methodology to generate RISPs (RISC-V instruction subset processors) customised to extreme edge applications and to implement them as flexible integrated circuits (FlexICs). The methodology is unique in the sense that verification is an integral part of design. The RISP methodology treats each instruction in the ISA as a discrete, fully functional, pre-verified hardware block. It automatically builds a custom processor by stitching together the hardware blocks of the instructions required by an application or a set of applications in a specific domain. This approach significantly reduces the processor verification and its time-to-market. We generate RISPs using this methodology for three extreme edge applications, and embedded applications from the Embench benchmark suite, synthesize them as FlexICs, and compare their power, performance and area to the baselines. Our results show that RISPs generated using this methodology achieve, on average, 30% reductions in power and area compared to a RISC-V processor supporting the full instruction set when synthesized, and are nearly 30 times more energy efficient with respect to Serv - the world's smallest 32-bit RISC-V processor. In addition, the full physical implementation of RISPs show up to 21% and 26% less area and power than Serv.</description>
