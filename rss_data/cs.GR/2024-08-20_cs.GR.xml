      <title>Unified Smooth Vector Graphics: Modeling Gradient Meshes and Curve-based Approaches Jointly as Poisson Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09211</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09211v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Research on smooth vector graphics is separated into two independent research threads: one on interpolation-based gradient meshes and the other on diffusion-based curve formulations. With this paper, we propose a mathematical formulation that unifies gradient meshes and curve-based approaches as solution to a Poisson problem. To combine these two well-known representations, we first generate a non-overlapping intermediate patch representation that specifies for each patch a target Laplacian and boundary conditions. Unifying the treatment of boundary conditions adds further artistic degrees of freedoms to the existing formulations, such as Neumann conditions on diffusion curves. To synthesize a raster image for a given output resolution, we then rasterize boundary conditions and Laplacians for the respective patches and compute the final image as solution to a Poisson problem. We evaluate the method on various test scenes containing gradient meshes and curve-based primitives. Since our mathematical formulation works with established smooth vector graphics primitives on the front-end, it is compatible with existing content creation pipelines and with established editing tools. Rather than continuing two separate research paths, we hope that a unification of the formulations will lead to new rasterization and vectorization tools in the future that utilize the strengths of both approaches.</description>

      <title>Meta-Learning Empowered Meta-Face: Personalized Speaking Style Adaptation for Audio-Driven 3D Talking Face Animation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-driven 3D face animation is increasingly vital in live streaming and augmented reality applications. While remarkable progress has been observed, most existing approaches are designed for specific individuals with predefined speaking styles, thus neglecting the adaptability to varied speaking styles. To address this limitation, this paper introduces MetaFace, a novel methodology meticulously crafted for speaking style adaptation. Grounded in the novel concept of meta-learning, MetaFace is composed of several key components: the Robust Meta Initialization Stage (RMIS) for fundamental speaking style adaptation, the Dynamic Relation Mining Neural Process (DRMN) for forging connections between observed and unobserved speaking styles, and the Low-rank Matrix Memory Reduction Approach to enhance the efficiency of model optimization as well as learning style details. Leveraging these novel designs, MetaFace not only significantly outperforms robust existing baselines but also establishes a new state-of-the-art, as substantiated by our experimental results.</description>

      <title>Double-Precision Floating-Point Data Visualizations Using Vulkan API</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09699v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Proper representation of data in graphical visualizations becomes challenging when high accuracy in data types is required, especially in those situations where the difference between double-precision floating-point and single-precision floating-point values makes a significant difference. Some of the limitations of using single-precision over double-precision include lesser accuracy, which accumulates errors over time, and poor modeling of large or small numbers. In such scenarios, emulated double precision is often used as a solution. The proposed methodology uses a modern GPU pipeline and graphics library API specifications to use native double precision. In this research, the approach is implemented using the Vulkan API, C++, and GLSL. Experimental evaluation with a series of experiments on 2D and 3D point datasets is proposed to indicate the effectiveness of the approach. This evaluates performance comparisons between native double-precision implementations against their emulated double-precision approaches with respect to rendering performance and accuracy. This study provides insight into the benefits of using native double-precision in graphical applications, denoting limitations and problems with emulated double-precision usages. These results improve the general understanding of the precision involved in graphical visualizations and assist developers in making decisions about which precision methods to use during their applications.</description>

      <title>Neural Representation of Shape-Dependent Laplacian Eigenfunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator are essential in mathematical physics, engineering, and geometry processing. Typically, these are computed by discretizing the domain and performing eigendecomposition, tying the results to a specific mesh. However, this method is unsuitable for continuously-parameterized shapes.
  We propose a novel representation for eigenfunctions in continuously-parameterized shape spaces, where eigenfunctions are spatial fields with continuous dependence on shape parameters, defined by minimal Dirichlet energy, unit norm, and mutual orthogonality. We implement this with multilayer perceptrons trained as neural fields, mapping shape parameters and domain positions to eigenfunction values.
  A unique challenge is enforcing mutual orthogonality with respect to causality, where the causal ordering varies across the shape space. Our training method therefore requires three interwoven concepts: (1) learning $n$ eigenfunctions concurrently by minimizing Dirichlet energy with unit norm constraints; (2) filtering gradients during backpropagation to enforce causal orthogonality, preventing earlier eigenfunctions from being influenced by later ones; (3) dynamically sorting the causal ordering based on eigenvalues to track eigenvalue curve crossovers.
  We demonstrate our method on problems such as shape family analysis, predicting eigenfunctions for incomplete shapes, interactive shape manipulation, and computing higher-dimensional eigenfunctions, on all of which traditional methods fall short.</description>

      <title>GeneticPrism: Multifaceted Visualization of Scientific Impact Evolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.08912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of scholarly impact is essential for many real-life decision-making processes in academia, such as research planning, frontier exploration, and award selection. Popular platforms like Google Scholar and Web of Science rely on numerical indicators that are too abstract to convey the context and content of scientific impact, while most existing visualization approaches on mapping science do not consider the presentation of individual scholars' impact evolution using curated self-citation data. This paper builds on our previous work and proposes an integrated pipeline to visualize a scholar's impact evolution from multiple topic facets. A novel 3D prism-shaped visual metaphor is introduced as the overview of a scholar's impact, whilst their scientific evolution on each topic is displayed in a more structured manner. Additional designs by topic chord diagram, streamgraph visualization, and inter-topic flow map, optimized by an elaborate layout algorithm, assist in perceiving the scholar's scientific evolution across topics. A new six-degree-impact glyph metaphor highlights key interdisciplinary works driving the evolution. The proposed visualization methods are evaluated through case studies analyzing the careers of prestigious Turing award laureates and a major visualization venue.</description>

      <title>Photorealistic Object Insertion with Diffusion-Guided Inverse Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09702v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The correct insertion of virtual objects in images of real-world scenes requires a deep understanding of the scene's lighting, geometry and materials, as well as the image formation process. While recent large-scale diffusion models have shown strong generative and inpainting capabilities, we find that current models do not sufficiently "understand" the scene shown in a single picture to generate consistent lighting effects (shadows, bright reflections, etc.) while preserving the identity and details of the composited object. We propose using a personalized large diffusion model as guidance to a physically based inverse rendering process. Our method recovers scene lighting and tone-mapping parameters, allowing the photorealistic composition of arbitrary virtual objects in single frames or videos of indoor or outdoor scenes. Our physically based pipeline further enables automatic materials and tone-mapping refinement.</description>

      <title>DiscoNeRF: Class-Agnostic Object Field for 3D Object Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.09928v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have become a powerful tool for modeling 3D scenes from multiple images. However, NeRFs remain difficult to segment into semantically meaningful regions. Previous approaches to 3D segmentation of NeRFs either require user interaction to isolate a single object, or they rely on 2D semantic masks with a limited number of classes for supervision. As a consequence, they generalize poorly to class-agnostic masks automatically generated in real scenes. This is attributable to the ambiguity arising from zero-shot segmentation, yielding inconsistent masks across views. In contrast, we propose a method that is robust to inconsistent segmentations and successfully decomposes the scene into a set of objects of any class. By introducing a limited number of competing object slots against which masks are matched, a meaningful object representation emerges that best explains the 2D supervision and minimizes an additional regularization term. Our experiments demonstrate the ability of our method to generate 3D panoptic segmentations on complex scenes, and extract high-quality 3D assets from NeRFs that can then be used in virtual 3D environments.</description>

      <title>SpaRP: Fast 3D Object Reconstruction and Pose Estimation from Sparse Views</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10195v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-world 3D generation has recently attracted considerable attention. While many single-image-to-3D methods have yielded visually appealing outcomes, they often lack sufficient controllability and tend to produce hallucinated regions that may not align with users' expectations. In this paper, we explore an important scenario in which the input consists of one or a few unposed 2D images of a single object, with little or no overlap. We propose a novel method, SpaRP, to reconstruct a 3D textured mesh and estimate the relative camera poses for these sparse-view images. SpaRP distills knowledge from 2D diffusion models and finetunes them to implicitly deduce the 3D spatial relationships between the sparse views. The diffusion model is trained to jointly predict surrogate representations for camera poses and multi-view images of the object under known poses, integrating all information from the input sparse views. These predictions are then leveraged to accomplish 3D reconstruction and pose estimation, and the reconstructed 3D model can be used to further refine the camera poses of input views. Through extensive experiments on three datasets, we demonstrate that our method not only significantly outperforms baseline methods in terms of 3D reconstruction quality and pose prediction accuracy but also exhibits strong efficiency. It requires only about 20 seconds to produce a textured mesh and camera poses for the input views. Project page: https://chaoxu.xyz/sparp.</description>

      <title>MeshFormer: High-Quality Mesh Generation with 3D-Guided Reconstruction Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Open-world 3D reconstruction models have recently garnered significant attention. However, without sufficient 3D inductive bias, existing methods typically entail expensive training costs and struggle to extract high-quality 3D meshes. In this work, we introduce MeshFormer, a sparse-view reconstruction model that explicitly leverages 3D native structure, input guidance, and training supervision. Specifically, instead of using a triplane representation, we store features in 3D sparse voxels and combine transformers with 3D convolutions to leverage an explicit 3D structure and projective bias. In addition to sparse-view RGB input, we require the network to take input and generate corresponding normal maps. The input normal maps can be predicted by 2D diffusion models, significantly aiding in the guidance and refinement of the geometry's learning. Moreover, by combining Signed Distance Function (SDF) supervision with surface rendering, we directly learn to generate high-quality meshes without the need for complex multi-stage training processes. By incorporating these explicit 3D biases, MeshFormer can be trained efficiently and deliver high-quality textured meshes with fine-grained geometric details. It can also be integrated with 2D diffusion models to enable fast single-image-to-3D and text-to-3D tasks. Project page: https://meshformer3d.github.io</description>

      <title>Neural Appearance Model for Cloth Rendering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.04061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.04061v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The realistic rendering of woven and knitted fabrics has posed significant challenges throughout many years. Previously, fiber-based micro-appearance models have achieved considerable success in attaining high levels of realism. However, rendering such models remains complex due to the intricate internal scatterings of hundreds of fibers within a yarn, requiring vast amounts of memory and time to render. In this paper, we introduce a new framework to capture aggregated appearance by tracing many light paths through the underlying fiber geometry. We then employ lightweight neural networks to accurately model the aggregated BSDF, which allows for the precise modeling of a diverse array of materials while offering substantial improvements in speed and reductions in memory. Furthermore, we introduce a novel importance sampling scheme to further speed up the rate of convergence. We validate the efficacy and versatility of our framework through comparisons with preceding fiber-based shading models as well as the most recent yarn-based model.</description>

Abstract: Accurate camera calibration is crucial for various computer vision applications. However, measuring calibration accuracy in the real world is challenging due to the lack of datasets with ground truth to evaluate them. In this paper, we present SynthCal, a synthetic camera calibration benchmarking pipeline that generates images of calibration patterns to measure and enable accurate quantification of calibration algorithm performance in camera parameter estimation. We present a SynthCal generated calibration dataset with four common patterns, two camera types, and two environments with varying view, distortion, lighting, and noise levels for both monocular and multi-camera systems. The dataset evaluates both single and multi-view calibration algorithms by measuring re-projection and root-mean-square errors for identical patterns and camera settings. Additionally, we analyze the significance of different patterns using different calibration configurations. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of SynthCal in evaluating various calibration algorithms and patterns.</description>

      <title>Street Gaussians: Modeling Dynamic Urban Scenes with Gaussian Splatting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01339v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper aims to tackle the problem of modeling dynamic urban streets for autonomous driving scenes. Recent methods extend NeRF by incorporating tracked vehicle poses to animate vehicles, enabling photo-realistic view synthesis of dynamic urban street scenes. However, significant limitations are their slow training and rendering speed. We introduce Street Gaussians, a new explicit scene representation that tackles these limitations. Specifically, the dynamic urban scene is represented as a set of point clouds equipped with semantic logits and 3D Gaussians, each associated with either a foreground vehicle or the background. To model the dynamics of foreground object vehicles, each object point cloud is optimized with optimizable tracked poses, along with a 4D spherical harmonics model for the dynamic appearance. The explicit representation allows easy composition of object vehicles and background, which in turn allows for scene editing operations and rendering at 135 FPS (1066 $\times$ 1600 resolution) within half an hour of training. The proposed method is evaluated on multiple challenging benchmarks, including KITTI and Waymo Open datasets. Experiments show that the proposed method consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all datasets. The code will be released to ensure reproducibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Text-to-image models are powerful tools for image creation. However, the generation process is akin to a dice roll and makes it difficult to achieve a single image that captures everything a user wants. In this paper, we propose a framework for creating the desired image by compositing it from various parts of generated images, in essence forming a Generative Photomontage. Given a stack of images generated by ControlNet using the same input condition and different seeds, we let users select desired parts from the generated results using a brush stroke interface. We introduce a novel technique that takes in the user's brush strokes, segments the generated images using a graph-based optimization in diffusion feature space, and then composites the segmented regions via a new feature-space blending method. Our method faithfully preserves the user-selected regions while compositing them harmoniously. We demonstrate that our flexible framework can be used for many applications, including generating new appearance combinations, fixing incorrect shapes and artifacts, and improving prompt alignment. We show compelling results for each application and demonstrate that our method outperforms existing image blending methods and various baselines.</description>
