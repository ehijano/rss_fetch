      <title>Attracting measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Under mild assumptions, the SRB measure $\mu$ associated to an Axiom A attractor $A$ has the following properties: (i) the empirical measure starting at a typical point near $A$ converges weakly to $\mu$; (ii) the pushforward of any Lebesgue-absolutely continuous probability measure supported near $A$ converges weakly to $\mu$. In general, a measure with the first property is called a "physical measure", and physical measures are recognised as generally important in their own right. In this paper, we highlight the second property as also important in its own right, and we prove a result that serves as a topological abstraction of the original result that establishes the second property for SRB measures on Axiom A attractors.</description>

      <title>Rescaled topological entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02383v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that to any smooth vector field of a closed manifold it can be assigned a nonnegative number called {\em rescaled topological entropy} satisfying the following properties: it is an upper bound for both the topological entropy and the rescaled metric entropy \cite{ww}; coincides with the topological entropy for nonsingular vector fields; is positive for certain surface vector fields (in contrast to the topological entropy); is invariant under rescaled topological conjugacy; and serves as an upper bound for the growth rate of periodic orbits for rescaling expansive flows with dynamically isolated singular set. Therefore, the rescaled topological entropy bounds such growth rates for $C^r$-generic rescaling (or $k^*$) expansive vector fields on closed manifolds.</description>

      <title>Pugh's global linearization for the nonautonomous unbounded system with $\mu$-dichotomy via Lyapunov theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02855v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The classical global linearization theorem for autonomous system given in [C. Pugh, Amer. J. Math., 91 (1969) 363-367] requires that nonlinear system with hyperbolicity satisfies boundedness and Lipschitz continuity.In this paper, we establish an {\em unbounded} global linearization theorem for nonautonomous systems subject to unbounded Lipschitz perturbations, under the assumption that the linear system admits a nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy (more general than classical exponential dichotomy). To this end, we first develop a comprehensive Lyapunov function framework for systems exhibiting nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy. Subsequently, we establish a characterization of nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy in terms of strict quadratic Lyapunov functions. Building upon these theoretical foundations, we then employ these Lyapunov functions to derive a linearization result under the nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy assumption. In the proof, we give a splitting lemma for nonuniform $\mu$-dichotomy to decouple hyperbolic system into a contractive system and an expansive system. Then we construct a transformation to linearize contractive/expansive system, which is defined by the crossing time with respect to the unit sphere.</description>

      <title>There is only one Farey map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let A_0, A_1 be nonnegative matrices in GL(n+1,Z) such that the subsimplexes A_0[Delta], A_1[Delta] split the standard unit n-dimensional simplex Delta in two. We prove that, for every n=1,2,... and up to the natural action of the symmetric group by conjugation, there are precisely three choices for the pair (A_0, A_1) such that the resulting projective Iterated Function System is topologically contractive. In equivalent terms, in every dimension there exist precisely three continued fraction algorithms that assign distinct two-symbol expansions to distinct points. These expansions are induced by the Gauss-type map G: Delta --&gt; Delta with branches A_0^{-1}, A_1^{-1}, which is continuous in exactly one of these three cases, namely when it equals the Farey-Monkemeyer map.</description>

      <title>Pinched Arnol'd tongues for Families of circle maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The family of circle maps \begin{equation*} f_{b, \omega} (x) = x + \omega + b\, \phi(x) \end{equation*} is used as a simple model for a periodically forced oscillator. The parameter $\omega$ represents the unforced frequency, $b$ the coupling, and $\phi$ the forcing. When $\phi = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \sin(2 \pi x)$ this is the classical Arnol'd standard family. Such families are often studied in the $(\omega,b)$-plane via the so-called tongues $T_\beta$ consisting of all $(\omega,b)$ such that $f_{b, \omega}$ has rotation number $\beta$. The interior of the rational tongues $T_{p/q}$ represent the system mode-locked into a $p/q$-periodic response. Campbell, Galeeva, Tresser, and Uherka proved that when the forcing is a PL map with $k=2$ breakpoints, all $T_{p/q}$ pinch down to a width of a single point at multple values when $q$ large enough. In contrast, we prove that it generic amongst PL forcings with a given $k\geq 3$ breakpoints that there is no such pinching of any of the rational tongues. We also prove that the absence of pinching is generic for Lipschitz and $C^r$ ($r&gt;0$) forcing.</description>

      <title>Early warning skill, extrapolation and tipping for accelerating cascades</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate how nonlinear behaviour (both of forcing in time and of the system itself) can affect the skill of early warning signals to predict tipping in (directionally) coupled bistable systems when using measures based on critical slowing down due to the breakdown of extrapolation. We quantify the skill of early warnings with a time horizon using a receiver-operator methodology for ensembles where noise realisations and parameters are varied to explore the role of extrapolation and how it can break down. We highlight cases where this can occur in an accelerating cascade of tipping elements, where very slow forcing of a slowly evolving ``upstream'' system forces a more rapidly evolving ``downstream'' system. If the upstream system crosses a tipping point, this can shorten the timescale of valid extrapolation. In particular, ``downstream-within-upstream'' tipping will typically have warnings only on a timescale comparable to the duration of the upstream tipping process, rather than the timescale of the original forcing.</description>

      <title>Universal Bound on the Eigenvalues of 2-Positive Trace-Preserving Maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove an upper bound on the trace of any 2-positive, trace-preserving map in terms of its smallest eigenvalue. We show that this spectral bound is tight, and that 2-positivity is necessary for this inequality to hold in general. Moreover, we use this to infer a similar bound for generators of one-parameter semigroups of 2-positive trace-preserving maps. With this approach we generalize known results for completely positive trace-preserving dynamics while providing a significantly simpler proof that is entirely algebraic.</description>

      <title>Second-order AAA algorithms for structured data-driven modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02241v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The data-driven modeling of dynamical systems has become an essential tool for the construction of accurate computational models from real-world data. In this process, the inherent differential structures underlying the considered physical phenomena are often neglected making the reinterpretation of the learned models in a physically meaningful sense very challenging. In this work, we present three data-driven modeling approaches for the construction of dynamical systems with second-order differential structure directly from frequency domain data. Based on the second-order structured barycentric form, we extend the well-known Adaptive Antoulas-Anderson algorithm to the case of second-order systems. Depending on the available computational resources, we propose variations of the proposed method that prioritize either higher computation speed or greater modeling accuracy, and we present a theoretical analysis for the expected accuracy and performance of the proposed methods. Three numerical examples demonstrate the effectiveness of our new structured approaches in comparison to classical unstructured data-driven modeling.</description>

      <title>Simplicial volume via foliated simplices and duality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02962</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.02962v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $M$ be an aspherical oriented closed connected manifold with universal cover $\widetilde{M}\to M$ and let $\Gamma=\pi_1(M)\curvearrowright (X,\mu)$ be a measure preserving action on a standard Borel probability space. We consider singular foliated simplices on the measured foliation $\Gamma\backslash(\widetilde{M}\times X)$ defined by Sauer and we compare the \emph{real singular foliated homology} with classic singular homology. We introduce a notion of \emph{foliated fundamental class} and we prove that its norm coincides with the simplicial volume of $M$. Then we consider the dual cochain complex and define the \emph{singular foliated bounded cohomology}, proving that it is isometrically isomorphic to the measurable bounded cohomology of the action $\Gamma\curvearrowright X$. As a consequence of the duality principle we deduce a vanishing criteria for the simplicial volume in terms of the vanishing of the bounded cohomology of p.m.p actions and of their transverse groupoids.</description>

      <title>Enriched functional limit theorems for dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2011.10153v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove functional limit theorems for dynamical systems in the presence of clusters of large values which, when summed and suitably normalised, get collapsed in a jump of the limiting process observed at the same time point. To keep track of the clustering information, which gets lost in the usual Skorohod topologies in the space of c\`adl\`ag functions, we introduce a new space which generalises the already more general spaces introduced by Whitt. Our main applications are to hyperbolic and non-uniformly expanding dynamical systems with heavy-tailed observable functions maximised at dynamically linked maximal sets (such as periodic points). We also study limits of extremal processes and record times point processes for observables not necessarily heavy tailed. The applications studied include hyperbolic systems such as Anosov diffeomorphisms, but also non-uniformly expanding maps such as maps with critical points of Benedicks-Carleson type or indifferent fixed points such as Pomeau-Manneville or Liverani-Saussol-Vaienti maps. The main tool is a limit theorem for point processes with decorations derived from a bi-infinite sequence called the transformed anchored tail process.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17191v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is known that if each point $x$ of a dynamical system is generic for some invariant measure $\mu_x$, then there is a strong connection between certain ergodic and topological properties of that system. In particular, if the acting group is abelian and the map $x\mapsto \mu_x$ is continuous, then every orbit closure is uniquely ergodic.
  In this note, we show that if the acting group is not abelian, orbit closures may well support more than one ergodic measure even if $x\mapsto \mu_x$ is continuous. We provide examples of such a situation via actions of the group of all orientation-preserving homeomorphisms on the unit interval as well as the Lamplighter group. To discuss these examples, we need to extend the existing theory of weakly mean equicontinuous group actions to allow for multiple ergodic measures on orbit closures and to allow for actions of general amenable groups. These extensions are achieved by adopting an operator-theoretic approach.</description>

      <title>Semi-analytic construction of global transfers between quasi-periodic orbits in the spatial R3BP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02485v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the spatial restricted three-body problem, as a model for the motion of a spacecraft relative to the Sun-Earth system. We focus on the dynamics near the equilibrium point $L_1$, located between the Sun and the Earth. We show that we can transfer the spacecraft from a quasi-periodic orbit that is nearly planar relative to the ecliptic to a quasi-periodic orbit that has large vertical amplitude, at zero energy cost. (In fact, the final orbit has the maximum vertical amplitude that can be obtained through the particular mechanism that we consider. Moreover, the transfer can be made through any prescribed sequence of quasi-periodic orbits in between).
  Our transfer mechanism is based on selecting trajectories homoclinic to a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold (NHIM) near $L_1$, and then gluing them together. We present a theoretical result establishing the existence of such transfer orbits, and we verify numerically its applicability to our model. We provide several explicit constructions of such transfers, and also develop an algorithm to design trajectories that achieve the shortest transfer time for this particular mechanism.
  The change in the vertical amplitude along a homoclinic trajectory can be described via the scattering map. We develop a new tool, the `Standard Scattering Map' (SSM), which is a series representation of the exact scattering map. We use the SSM to obtain a complete description of the dynamics along homoclinic trajectories. The SSM can be used in many other situations, from Arnold diffusion problems to transport phenomena in applications.</description>

      <title>A mathematical model of CAR-T cell therapy in combination with chemotherapy for malignant gliomas</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13774v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the dynamics and interactions between combined chemotherapy and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR-T) cells therapy and malignant gliomas (MG). MG is one of the most common primary brain tumor, with high resistance to therapy and unfavorable prognosis. Here, we develop a mathematical model that describes the application of chemo- and CAR-T cell therapies and the dynamics of sensitive and resistant populations of tumor cells. This model is a five-dimensional dynamical system with impulsive inputs corresponding to clinical administration of chemo- and immunotherapy. We provide a proof of non-negativeness of solutions of the proposed model for non-negative initial data. We demonstrate that if we apply both therapies only once, the trajectories will be attracted to an invariant surface that corresponds to the tumor carrying capacity. On the other hand, if we apply both treatments constantly, we find regions of the parameter where the tumor is eradicated. Moreover, we study applications of different combinations of the above treatments in order to find an optimal combination at the population level. To this aim, we generate a population of $10^{4}$ virtual patients with the model parameters uniformly distributed in the medically relevant ranges and perform \emph{in silico} trials with different combinations of treatments. We obtain optimal protocols for several different relations of tumor growth rates between sensitive and drug resistant cells. We demonstrate that the tumor growth rate, efficacy of chemotherapy, and tumor immunosuppression are the parameters that mostly impact survival time in \emph{in silico} trials. We believe that our results provide new theoretical insights to guide the design of clinical trials for MG therapies.</description>

      <title>Rotation number and dynamics of 3-interval piecewise $\lambda$-affine contractions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a family of piecewise contractions admitting a rotation number and defined for every $x\in[0,1)$ by $f(x)=\lambda x + \delta + d \theta_a(x) \pmod 1$, where $\lambda\in(0,1)$, $d\in(0,1-\lambda)$, $\delta\in[0,1]$, $a\in[0,1]$ and $\theta_a(x)=1$ if $x\geq a$ and $\theta_a(x)=0$ otherwise. In the special case where $a=1$, the family reduces to the well studied ``contracted rotations" $x\mapsto \lambda x + \delta \pmod 1$, which are 2-interval piecewise $\lambda$-affine contractions when $\delta\in(1-\lambda,1)$. Considering $a\in(0,1)$ allows maps with an additional discontinuity, that is, $3$-interval piecewise $\lambda$-affine contractions. Supposing $\lambda$ and $d$ fixed, for any $\rho\in(0,1)$ and $\alpha\in[0,1]$, we provide the values of the parameters $\delta$ and $a$ for which the corresponding map has rotation number $\rho$, and a symbolic dynamics containing that of the rotation $R_\rho:[0,1)\to[0,1)$ of angle $\rho$ with respect to the partition given by the positions of $1-\rho$ and $\alpha$ in $[0,1)$. This enables in particular to determine the maps that have a given number of periodic orbits of an arbitrary period, or a Cantor set attractor supporting a dynamics of a given complexity.</description>

In particular, finitely generated groups admitting planar Cayley graphs, elementarily free groups, and the group of isometries of the hyperbolic plane and all its closed subgroups. This provides the first examples of one-ended nonamenable groups which are measure strongly treeable. In higher dimensions, we also prove a dichotomy that the fundamental group of a closed aspherical $3$-manifold is either amenable or has strong ergodic dimension $2$. Our main technical tool is a method for finding measurable treeings of Borel planar graphs by constructing one-ended spanning subforests in their planar dual. Our techniques for constructing one-ended spanning subforests also give a complete classification of the locally finite pmp graphs which admit Borel a.e.\ one-ended spanning subforests.</description>

      <title>Integrable dynamics in projective geometry via dimers and triple crossing diagram maps on the cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.12692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.12692v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce twisted triple crossing diagram maps, collections of points in projective space associated to bipartite graphs on the cylinder, and use them to provide geometric realizations of the cluster integrable systems of Goncharov and Kenyon constructed from toric dimer models. Using this notion, we provide geometric proofs that the pentagram map and the cross-ratio dynamics integrable systems are cluster integrable systems. We show that in appropriate coordinates, cross-ratio dynamics is described by geometric $R$-matrices, which solves the open question of finding a cluster algebra structure describing cross-ratio dynamics.</description>

      <title>A Pansiot-type subword complexity theorem for automorphisms of free groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.00676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.00676v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by Pansiot's work on substitutions, we prove a similar theorem for automorphisms of a free group F of finite rank: if a right-infinite word X represents an attracting fixed point of an automorphism of F, the subword complexity of X is equivalent to n, n log log n, n log n, or n^2. The proof uses combinatorial arguments analogue to Pansiot's as well as train tracks. We also define the recurrence complexity of X, and we apply it to laminations. In particular, we show that attracting laminations have complexity equivalent to n, n log log n, n log n, or n^2 (to n if the automorphism is fully irreducible).</description>

      <title>Flow map matching with stochastic interpolants: A mathematical framework for consistency models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07507v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models based on dynamical equations such as flows and diffusions offer exceptional sample quality, but require computationally expensive numerical integration during inference. The advent of consistency models has enabled efficient one-step or few-step generation, yet despite their practical success, a systematic understanding of their design has been hindered by the lack of a comprehensive theoretical framework. Here we introduce Flow Map Matching (FMM), a principled framework for learning the two-time flow map of an underlying dynamical generative model, thereby providing this missing mathematical foundation. Leveraging stochastic interpolants, we propose training objectives both for distillation from a pre-trained velocity field and for direct training of a flow map over an interpolant or a forward diffusion process. Theoretically, we show that FMM unifies and extends a broad class of existing approaches for fast sampling, including consistency models, consistency trajectory models, and progressive distillation. Experiments on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet-32 highlight that our approach can achieve sample quality comparable to flow matching while reducing generation time by a factor of 10-20.</description>

      <title>Changing the ranking in eigenvector centrality of a weighted graph by small perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10745v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider eigenvector centrality for the nodes of a graph and study the robustness (and stability) of this popular centrality measure. For a given weighted graph ${\mathcal G}$ (both directed and undirected), we consider the associated weighted adjacency matrix $A$, which by definition is a non-negative matrix. The eigenvector centralities of the nodes of ${\mathcal G}$ are the entries of the Perron eigenvector of $A$, which is the (positive) eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue with largest modulus. They provide a ranking of the nodes according to the corresponding centralities. An indicator of the robustness of eigenvector centrality consists in looking for a nearby perturbed graph $\widetilde{\mathcal G}$, with the same structure as ${\mathcal G}$ (i.e., with the same vertices and edges), but with a weighted adjacency matrix $\widetilde A$ such that the highest $m$ entries ($m \ge 2$) of the Perron eigenvector of $\widetilde A$ coalesce, making the ranking at the highest level ambiguous. To compute a solution to this matrix nearness problem, a nested iterative algorithm is proposed that makes use of a constrained gradient system of matrix differential equations in the inner iteration and a one-dimensional optimization of the perturbation size in the outer iteration.
  The proposed algorithm produces the {\em optimal} perturbation (i.e., the one with smallest Frobenius norm) of the $A$ which causes the looked-for coalescence, which is a measure of the sensitivity of the graph. Our numerical experiments indicate that the proposed strategy outperforms more standard approaches based on algorithms for constrained optimization. The methodology is formulated in terms of graphs but applies to any nonnegative matrix, with potential applications in fields like population models, consensus dynamics, economics, etc.</description>

      <title>Structural properties of reduced $C^*$-algebras associated with higher-rank lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12737v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the first examples of higher-rank lattices whose reduced $C^{*}$-algebras satisfy strict comparison, stable rank one, selflessness, uniqueness of embeddings of the Jiang--Su algebra, and allow explicit computations of the Cuntz semigroup. This resolves a question raised in recent groundbreaking work of Amrutam, Gao, Kunnawalkam Elayavalli, and Patchell, in which they exhibited a large class of finitely generated non-amenable groups satisfying these properties. Our proof relies on quantitative estimates in projective dynamics, crucially using the exponential mixing for diagonalizable flows. As a result, we obtain an effective mixed-identity-freeness property, which, combined with V. Lafforgue's rapid decay theorem, yields the desired conclusions.</description>
