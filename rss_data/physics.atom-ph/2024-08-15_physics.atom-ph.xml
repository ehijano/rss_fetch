      <title>Micro-integrated crossed-beam optical dipole trap system with long-term alignment stability for mobile atomic quantum technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies extensively use laser light for state preparation, manipulation, and readout. For field applications, these systems must be robust and compact, driving the need for miniaturized and highly stable optical setups and system integration. In this work, we present a micro-integrated crossed-beam optical dipole trap setup, the $\mu$XODT, designed for trapping and cooling $^{87}\text{Rb}$. This fiber-coupled setup operates at $1064\,\text{nm}$ wavelength with up to $2.5\,\text{W}$ optical power and realizes a free-space crossed beam geometry. The $\mu$XODT precisely overlaps two focused beams ($w_0 \approx 33\,\mu\text{m}$) at their waists in a $45^\circ$ crossing angle, achieving a position difference $\leq 3.4\,\mu\text{m}$ and 0.998 power ratio between both beams with long-term stability. We describe the design and assembly process in detail, along with optical and thermal tests with temperatures of up to $65\,^\circ C$. The system's volume of $25\,\text{ml}$ represents a reduction of more than two orders of magnitude compared to typically used macroscopic setups, while demonstrating exceptional mechanical robustness and thermal stability. The $\mu$XODT is integrated with a $^{87}\text{Rb}$ 3D MOT setup, trapping $3 \times 10^5$ atoms from a laser-cooled atomic cloud, and has shown no signs of degradation after two years of operation.</description>

      <title>Single ion spectroscopy of four metastable state clear-out transitions in Yb II: isotope shifts and hyperfine structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present spectroscopic data for four metastable state clear-out transitions between 399 nm and 412 nm for all even long-lived isotopes of Yb$^+$ as well as their hyperfine structure in $^{171}$Yb$^+$. The strong $^2 \rm{D}_{3/2} \rightarrow {}^1[1/2]_{1/2}$ transition at 412 nm represents an attractive alternative for the standard 935 nm repumper used in cooling and trapping experiments, while the transition to the $^3[3/2]_{3/2}$ state at 411 nm clears out the $^2 $F$_{7/2}$ state, for which typically 638 nm or 760 nm are used. These two alternative transitions simplify the experimental setup by removing the need for infrared optics to cool and manipulate Yb$^+$ and may be of particular interest when considering integrated photonics solutions. We also present data for the transitions $^2 $D$_{3/2} \rightarrow {}^3[1/2]_{3/2}$ at 399 nm, and $^2 $D$_{3/2} \rightarrow {}^1[5/2]_{5/2}$ at 410 nm including decay branching ratios of the excited states.</description>

      <title>Rapid stochastic spatial light modulator calibration and pixel crosstalk optimisation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.07672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Holographic light potentials generated by phase-modulating liquid-crystal spatial light modulators (SLMs) are widely used in quantum technology applications. Accurate calibration of the wavefront and intensity profile of the laser beam at the SLM display is key to the high fidelity of holographic potentials. Here, we present a new calibration technique that is faster than previous methods while maintaining the same level of accuracy. By employing stochastic optimisation and random speckle intensity patterns, we calibrate a digital twin that accurately models the experimental setup. This approach allows us to measure the wavefront at the SLM to within $\lambda /170$ in ~ 5 minutes using only 10 SLM phase patterns, a significant speedup over state-of-the-art techniques. Additionally, our digital twin models pixel crosstalk on the liquid-crystal SLM, enabling rapid calibration of model parameters and reducing the error in light potentials by a factor of ~ 5 without losing efficiency. Our fast calibration technique will simplify the implementation of high-fidelity light potentials in, for example, quantum-gas microscopes and neutral-atom tweezer arrays where high-NA objectives and thermal lensing can deform the wavefront significantly. Applications in the field of holographic displays that require high image fidelity will benefit from the novel pixel crosstalk calibration, especially for displays with a large field of view and increased SLM diffraction angles.</description>

      <title>Chiral topological light for detecting robust enantio-sensitive observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.10932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.10932v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The topological response of matter to electromagnetic fields is a property in high demand in materials design and metrology due to its robustness against noise and decoherence, stimulating recent advances in ultrafast photonics. Embedding topological properties into the enantio-sensitive optical response of chiral molecules could therefore enhance the efficiency and robustness of chiral optical discrimination. Here we achieve such a topological embedding by introducing the concept of chiral topological light~-- a light beam which displays chirality locally, with an azimuthal distribution of its handedness described globally by a topological charge. The topological charge is mapped onto the azimuthal intensity modulation of the non-linear optical response, where enantio-sensitivity is encoded into its spatial rotation. The spatial rotation is robust against intensity fluctuations and imperfect local polarization states of the driving field. Our theoretical results show that chiral topological light enables detection of percentage-level enantiomeric excesses in randomly oriented mixtures of chiral molecules, opening a way to new, extremely sensitive and robust chiro-optical spectroscopies with attosecond time resolution.</description>
