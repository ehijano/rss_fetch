      <title>Character tables are ideal Perron similarities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02830v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An invertible matrix is called a Perron similarity if it diagonalizes an irreducible, nonnegative matrix. Each Perron similarity gives a nontrivial polyhedral cone, called the spectracone, and polytope, called the spectratope, of realizable spectra (thought of as vectors in complex Euclidean space). A Perron similarity is called ideal if its spectratope coincides with the conical hulls of its rows. Identifying ideal Perron similarities is of great interest in the pursuit of the longstanding nonnegative inverse eigenvalue problem.
  In this work, it is shown that the character table of a finite group is an ideal Perron similarity. In addition to expanding ideal Perron similarities to include a broad class of matrices, the results unify previous works into a single, theoretical framework.
  It is demonstrated that the spectracone can be described by finitely-many group-theoretic inequalities. When the character table is real, we derive a group-theoretic formula for the volume of the projected Perron spectratope, which is a simplex. Finally, an implication for further research is given.</description>

      <title>Advancing Computational Tools for Analyzing Commutative Hypercomplex Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02709v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Commutative hypercomplex algebras offer significant advantages over traditional quaternions due to their compatibility with linear algebra techniques and efficient computational implementation, which is crucial for broad applicability. This paper explores a novel family of commutative hypercomplex algebras, referred to as (alpha,beta)-tessarines, which extend the system of generalized Segre's quaternions and, consequently, elliptic quaternions. The main contribution of this work is the development of theoretical and computational tools for matrices within this algebraic system, including inversion, square root computation, LU factorization with partial pivoting, and determinant calculation. Additionally, a spectral theory for (alpha,beta)-tessarines is established, covering eigenvalue and eigenvector analysis, the power method, singular value decomposition, rank-k approximation, and the pseudoinverse. Solutions to the classical least squares problem are also presented. These results not only enhance the fundamental understanding of hypercomplex algebras but also provide researchers with novel matrix operations that have not been extensively explored in previous studies. The theoretical findings are supported by real-world examples, including image reconstruction and color face recognition, which demonstrate the potential of the proposed techniques.</description>

      <title>Cholesky decomposition for symmetric matrices, Riemannian geometry, and random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02715v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For each $n \geq 1$ and sign pattern $\epsilon \in \{ \pm 1 \}^n$, we introduce a cone of real symmetric matrices $LPM_n(\epsilon)$: those with leading principal $k \times k$ minors of signs $\epsilon_k$. These cones are pairwise disjoint and their union $LPM_n$ is a dense cone in all symmetric matrices; they subsume positive and negative definite matrices, and symmetric (P-,) N-, PN-, almost P-, and almost N- matrices. We show that each $LPM_n$ matrix $A$ admits an uncountable family of Cholesky-type factorizations - yielding a unique lower triangular matrix $L$ with positive diagonals - with additional attractive properties: (i) each such factorization is algorithmic; and (ii) each such Cholesky map $A \mapsto L$ is a smooth diffeomorphism from $LPM_n(\epsilon)$ onto an open Euclidean ball.
  We then show that (iii) the (diffeomorphic) balls $LPM_n(\epsilon)$ are isometric Riemannian manifolds as well as isomorphic abelian Lie groups, each equipped with a translation-invariant Riemannian metric (and hence Riemannian means/barycentres). Moreover, (iv) this abelian metric group structure on each $LPM_n(\epsilon)$ - and hence the log-Cholesky metric on Cholesky space - yields an isometric isomorphism onto a finite-dimensional Euclidean space. The complex version of this also holds.
  In the latter part, we show that the abelian group $PD_n$ of positive definite matrices, with its bi-invariant log-Cholesky metric, is precisely the identity-component of a larger group with an alternate metric: the dense cone $LPM_n$. This also holds for Hermitian matrices over several subfields $\mathbb{F} \subseteq \mathbb{C}$. As a result, (v) the groups $LPM_n^{\mathbb{F}}$ and $LPM_\infty^{\mathbb{F}}$ admit a rich probability theory, and the cones $LPM_n(\epsilon), TPM_n(\epsilon)$ admit Wishart densities with signed Bartlett decompositions.</description>

      <title>Anderson localization for the multi-frequency quasi-periodic CMV matrices and quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15284v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we prove Anderson localization for multi-frequency quasi-periodic extended CMV matrices with analytic Verblunsky coefficients in the regime of positive Lyapunov exponents. By constructing a suitable semialgebraic set and combining the Avalanche Principle with a Large Deviation Theorem, we overcome the key obstruction of eliminating double resonances along the orbit, where multi-frequency potentials introduce significant challenges compared to the single-frequency case. As a direct application, we establish Anderson localization for corresponding analytic multi-frequency quasi-periodic quantum walks via unitary equivalence.</description>

      <title>Improved Berezin-Li-Yau inequality and Kr\"oger inequality and consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20330v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We provide quantitative improvements to the Berezin-Li-Yau inequality and the Kr\"oger inequality, in $\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\ge 2$. The improvement on Kr\"oger's inequality resolves an open question raised by Weidl from 2006. The improvements allow us to show that, for any open bounded domains, there are infinite many Dirichlet eigenvalues satisfying P\'olya's conjecture if $n\ge 3$, and infinite many Neumann eigenvalues satisfying P\'olya's conjecture if $n\ge 5$ and the Neumann spectrum is discrete.</description>

      <title>Cheng's eigenvalue comparison on metric measure spaces and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23671v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using the localization technique, we prove a sharp upper bound on the first Dirichlet eigenvalue of metric balls in essentially non-branching $\mathsf{CD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces. This extends a celebrated result of Cheng to the non-smooth setting of metric measure spaces satisfying Ricci curvature lower bounds in a synthetic sense, via optimal transport. Rigidity and stability statements are provided for $\mathsf{RCD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces; the stability seems to be new even for smooth Riemannian manifolds. We then present some mathematical and physical applications: in the former, we obtain an upper bound on the $j^{th}$ Neumann eigenvalue in essentially non-branching $\mathsf{CD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces and a bound on the essential spectrum in non-compact $\mathsf{RCD}^{\star}(K,N)$ spaces; in the latter, the eigenvalue bounds correspond to general upper bounds on the masses of the spin-2 Kaluza-Klein excitations around general warped compactifications of higher-dimensional theories of gravity.</description>
