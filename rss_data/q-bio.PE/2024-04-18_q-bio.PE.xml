      <title>How to study the evolution of parametrized games?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I consider a family of games with corresponding payoff matrices, parametrized by the parameter The informal question of interest is: what game is the best? Instead of attempting to suggest a more or less arbitrary definition of the best game, I allow natural selection to find it through honest competition between games. Specifically, I consider a model of a community composed of populations with different payoff matrices and study the natural selection between the populations. The outcome of the community evolution determines the best game. I develop here a mathematical toolbox, that allows the study of evolution of parametrized games. The developed approach is applied to three examples of parametrized games from the literature: local replicator dynamics, pairwise competition and the game of alleles in diploid genomes.</description>

      <title>Modelling infectious disease transmission dynamics in conference environments: An individual-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The global public health landscape is perpetually challenged by the looming threat of infectious diseases. Central to addressing this concern is the imperative to prevent and manage disease transmission during pandemics, particularly in unique settings. This study addresses the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases within conference venues, presenting a computational model designed to simulate transmission processes within a condensed timeframe (one day), beginning with sporadic cases. Our model intricately captures the activities of individual attendees within the conference venue, encompassing meetings, rest intervals, and meal breaks. While meetings entail proximity seating, rest and lunch periods allow attendees to interact with diverse individuals. Moreover, the restroom environment poses an additional avenue for potential infection transmission. Employing an individual-based model, we meticulously replicated the transmission dynamics of infectious diseases, with a specific emphasis on close-contact interactions between infected and susceptible individuals. Through comprehensive analysis of model simulations, we elucidated the intricacies of disease transmission dynamics within conference settings and assessed the efficacy of control strategies to curb disease dissemination. Ultimately, our study proffers a numerical framework for assessing the risk of infectious disease transmission during short-duration conferences, furnishing conference organizers with valuable insights to inform the implementation of targeted prevention and control measures.</description>

      <title>The genetic basis and evolution of meiotic recombination rate variation -- what have we learned?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12288v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Meiotic recombination is the exchange of DNA between homologous chromosomes, through chromosomal crossover and gene-conversion events. It is a fundamental feature of sex, and an important driver of diversity in eukaryotic genomes. The toolbox of recombination is remarkably conserved, yet meiotic genes show substantial variation even between closely related species. Furthermore, the rate and distribution of recombination is diverse across eukaryotes, both within and between genomic regions (i.e. "hotspots"), chromosomes, individuals, sexes, populations, and species. In recent decades, major advances have been made in understanding recombination rate variation, in terms of measuring it, identifying its genetic architecture and evolutionary potential, and understanding the complex dynamics of recombination landscapes. In this perspective, written for the 40th anniversary of the journal Molecular Biology and Evolution, I explore what we have learned and are still learning about the genetic basis and evolution of recombination rates, and present open questions for future research.</description>
