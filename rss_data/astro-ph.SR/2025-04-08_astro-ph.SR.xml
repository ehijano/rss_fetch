      <title>Angular Momentum Transport by Internal Gravity Waves Across Age</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two-dimensional numerical simulations of convection and waves in a 7 solar mass star across stellar ages ranging from zero age to terminal-age-main-sequence. We show that waves efficiently transport angular momentum across the stellar radiative envelope at young ages. However, as the core recedes, leaving behind a "spike" in the buoyancy frequency at the convective-radiative interface, the waves are severely attenuated. This, coupled with the changing stratification throughout the radiation zone, leads to significantly reduced angular momentum transport at later stages on the main sequence. Indeed, the angular momentum transport at mid-main sequence is typically 3-4 orders of magnitude lower than at zero age, though we expect this to be somewhat mitigated by the chemical mixing also induced by such waves. We provide measures of the angular momentum transport, both in terms of the divergence of the Reynolds stress and a typical "wave luminosity". However, we caution that the angular momentum transport drive shear flows, resulting in both slowing and speeding up of radiative interiors. While the values of Reynolds stress and angular momentum transport are only within the context of these limited simulations, they are not significantly different to those found previously using simpler prescriptions, providing some confidence in their applicability.</description>

      <title>Simulations of coronal mass ejections on a young solar-type star and their detectability through coronal spectral observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There is a growing interest in searching for coronal mass ejections (CMEs) in other stellar systems because they are thought to be one of the important factors shaping planetary atmospheres. We investigated the possible spectral signatures related to stellar CMEs using magnetohydrodynamic simulations and spectral synthesis techniques. Blue wing enhancements of the synthetic coronal line profiles caused by the line-of-sight motion of plasma were observed during the simulated CME events. We included instrumental conditions in the spectral synthesis and tested the detectability of the asymmetries under different instrumental broadening conditions. The results show that blue wing asymmetries are visible in some EUV lines with spectral resolutions higher than around 2000, and the line-of-sight velocities of CMEs obtained from asymmetry analysis techniques are comparable to the CME velocities derived from three-dimensional model outputs. However, when the spectral resolution drops below 2000, the asymmetries in the blue wings become barely visible, but blue shifts in the line centroids with velocities around -100 to -200 km/s are observed. We suggest a method of using MHD simulation to synthesize line profiles and analyze their asymmetries which may help to guide future instrument design in terms of detecting stellar CMEs through Doppler shifts or asymmetries of coronal spectral lines.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Weak CN Spectral Absorption Feature in Red Supergiant Stars in the Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33) Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using Keck DEIMOS spectra of stars in the Andromeda (M31) and Triangulum (M33) galaxies, selected from the large multi-band (near ultraviolet, visible light, and near infrared) Hubble Space Telescope surveys PHAT and PHATTER, respectively, we have identified a subset of stars that contain a previously unnoticed weak spectral absorption feature around 8000 Angstrom (0.8 micron). This absorption feature appears to be associated with the cyanogen (CN) molecule. Strong CN spectral absorption is a standard feature of carbon stars, which are thought to be intermediate mass (2-3 ~ M_sun) stars with C/O &gt; 1 in the thermally-pulsating asymptotic giant branch phase of stellar evolution. However, the stars that are the focus of this paper are characterized by a weak version of this CN spectral absorption feature in a spectrum that is otherwise dominated by normal O-rich spectral absorption lines such as TiO and/or the Ca near infrared triplet. We have dubbed these stars "weak CN" stars. We present an automated method for identifying weak CN stars in M31 and M33, and examine their photometric properties in relation to model isochrones and stellar tracks. We find that weak CN stars tend to be fairly localized in color-magnitude space, and appear to be red supergiant stars with masses ranging from 5-10 M_sun, overall lifetimes of about 40-50 Myr, and currently in the core He burning phase of stellar evolution.</description>

      <title>The enigmatic magnetic field of the planet hosting Herbig Ae/Be star HD169142</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of the accretion disk around the Herbig Ae/Be star HD169142 revealed its complex and asymmetric morphology indicating the presence of planets. The knowledge of the magnetic field structure in host stars is indispensable for our understanding of the magnetospheric interaction between the central stars, the circumstellar (CS) environment, and planetary companions. We intend to study the geometry of the magnetic field of HD169142. We measured the mean longitudinal magnetic field from high resolution ESPaDOnS and HARPSpol spectra of HD169142 using the Least Square Deconvolution technique. Additionally, the spectral variability of hydrogen lines is studied using dynamical spectra.
  Our analysis of the Stokes V spectra reveals the presence of definitely detected narrow Zeeman features observed using line masks with neutral iron lines. On two observing epochs, we also obtain marginally detected broad Zeeman features. To explain the simultaneous appearance of narrow and broad Zeeman features, we discuss different scenarios, including one scenario related to a non-photospheric origin of the narrow Zeeman features due to magnetospheric interaction with warm CS matter. In an environment such as a wind or an accretion disk, spectral lines may form over a relatively large volume, and the field topology may therefore be complex not only in latitude and azimuth, but in radius as well. Dynamical plots of the Hbeta line show an intriguing very complex structure with appearing and disappearing absorption features, which can be related to the complex morphology of the CS matter with asymmetric dust clump structures. The profiles of spectral lines belonging to different elements are variable, indicating the presence of chemical spots.</description>

      <title>A super-Chandrasekhar mass type Ia supernova progenitor at 49 pc set to detonate in 23 Gyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double white dwarf binaries are a leading explanation to the origin of type Ia supernovae, but no system exceeding the Chandrasekhar mass limit (1.4 M$_\odot$) has been found that will explode anywhere close to a Hubble time. Here, we present the super-Chandrasekhar mass double white dwarf WDJ181058.67+311940.94 whose merger time ($22.6\pm1.0$ Gyr) is of the same order as a Hubble time. The mass of the binary is large, combining to $1.555\pm0.044$ M$_\odot$, while being located only 49 pc away. We predict that the binary will explode dynamically via a double detonation destroying both stars just before they merge, appearing as a subluminous type Ia supernova with a peak apparent magnitude of about $m_V=-16$ (200,000 times brighter than Jupiter). The observationally-derived birthrate of super-Chandrasekhar mass double white dwarfs is now at least $6.0\times10^{-4}$ yr$^{-1}$ and the observed rate of type Ia supernovae in the Milky Way from such systems is approximately $4.4\times10^{-5}$ yr$^{-1}$, while the predicted type Ia supernova rate in the Milky Way from all progenitor channels is about sixty times larger. Hence, WDJ181058.67+311940.94 mitigates the observed deficit of massive double white dwarfs witnessed in volume-complete populations, but further evidence is required to determine the majority progenitors of type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Basic Pattern of Three-dimensional Magnetic Reconnection within Strongly Turbulent Current Sheets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is a fundamental mechanism of driving eruptive phenomena of different scales and may be coupled with turbulence as suggested by recent remote-sensing and in-situ observations. However, the specific physics behind the complex three-dimensional (3D) turbulent reconnection remains mysterious. Here, we develop a novel methodology to identify and analyze multitudes of multi-scale reconnection fragments within a strongly turbulent current sheet (CS) and apply it to a state-of-the-art numerical simulation of turbulent reconnection for solar flares. It is determined that the reconnection fragments tend to appear as quasi-2D sheets forming along local magnetic flux surfaces, and, due to strong turbulence, their reconnection flow velocities and reconnection rates are significantly broadened statistically but are scale-independent. Each reconnection fragment is found to be surrounded by strongly fluctuated in/out-flows and has a widely distributed reconnection rate, mainly in the range of 0.01-0.1. The results, for the first time, provide quantitative measurements of 3D magnetic reconnection in strongly turbulent flare CSs, offering insights into the cascading laws of 3D reconnection in other turbulent plasmas.</description>

      <title>Variations in the magnetic field strength of pre-main-sequence stars, solar-type main-sequence stars, and the Sun</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The surface magnetic fields of pre-main-sequence stars and zero-age main-sequence stars are notably strong, resulting in the generation of numerous spots and the emission of bright chromospheric lines. Rotational variations in magnetic field strength have been identified in T Tauri stars (TTSs) and young main-sequence stars using Zeeman--Doppler imaging. This study investigates the relationship between the mean values and variation amplitudes of the magnetic field strengths of TTSs, main-sequence stars, and the Sun. The findings reveal a positive correlation of over three orders of magnitude, suggesting that a common mechanism drives the magnetic fields of these stars. This positive correlation implies that stars with larger spot sizes experience greater variation amplitudes due to rotational modulations. For the Sun, both the mean magnetic field strength value and its variation amplitude tend to be higher during solar maximum than during solar minimum.</description>

      <title>X-class flare on Dec 31, 2023, observed by the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope on board Aditya-L1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the multi-wavelength study of the ejection of a plasma blob from the limb flare SOL2023-12-31T21:36:00 from NOAA 13536 observed by the Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (SUIT) on board Aditya-L1. We use SUIT observations along with those from Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board SDO and Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) on board Solar Orbiter to infer the kinematics and thermal nature of the ejected blob and its connection to the associated flare. The observations show that the flare was comprised of two eruptions. The blob was ejected during the first eruption and later accelerated to velocities over 1500 km/s measured at a maximum projected height of ~ 178 Mm from the Sun's surface. The acceleration of the ejected plasma blob is co-temporal with the bursty appearance of the hard X-ray light curve recorded by STIX. Radio spectrogram observations from STEREO-A/WAVES and RSTN reveal type III bursts at the same time, indicative of magnetic reconnection. DEM analysis using AIA observations suggests the plasma blob is comprised of cooler and denser plasma in comparison to the ambient corona. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first observation of such a plasma blob in the NUV, providing crucial measurements for eruption thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>A parametric study of solar wind properties and composition using fluid and kinetic solar wind models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical processes in the solar corona that shape the solar wind remain an active research topic. Modeling efforts have shown that energy and plasma exchanges near the transition region plays a crucial role in modulating solar wind properties. Although these regions cannot be measured in situ, plasma parameters can be inferred from coronal spectroscopy and ionization states of heavy ions, which remain unchanged as they escape the corona. We introduce a new solar wind model extending from the chromosphere to the inner heliosphere, capturing thermodynamic coupling across atmospheric layers. By including neutral and charged particle interactions, we model the transport and ionisation processes of the gas through the transition region, the corona and into the solar wind. Instead of explicitly modeling coronal heating, we link its spatial distribution to large-scale magnetic field properties. Our results confirm that energy deposition strongly affects wind properties through key mechanisms involving chromospheric evaporation, thermal expansion, and magnetic flux expansion. For sources near active regions, the model predicts significant solar wind acceleration, with plasma outflows comparable to those inferred from coronal spectroscopy. For winds from large coronal holes, the model reproduces the observed anticorrelation between charge state and wind speed. However, the predicted charge state ratios are overall lower than observed. Inclusion of a population of energetic electrons enhances both heavy ion charge states and solar wind acceleration, improving agreement with observations.</description>

      <title>Strong ionospheric activity at the MWA site associated with plasma bubble measured by GNSS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Earth's ionosphere refracts radio signals, shifting the apparent position of radio sources. Wide-field measurements with a radio interferometer can measure the ionospheric distortion. The Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has the ability to capture ionospheric structures that are smaller than 100 km in extent. We report unusually strong ionospheric activity in MWA data during a magnetic storm on 2023 December 1. The duct-like structure (roughly 50 km $\times$ $&gt;$100 km) passes through the MWA field-of-view (FOV) with a velocity of ~ 100 m/s. The offsets of the apparent position of the radio source are more than 1 degree in the MWA observation data at around 180 MHz. By comparing the Total Electron Content (TEC) data obtained from the GNSS receiver network, we have found that the TEC fluctuations represented by a high Rate of TEC change index (ROTI) coincided with the strong ionospheric activity observed by the MWA. This result suggests that unusual ionospheric signatures detected by the MWA could be caused by plasma bubbles extending across Western Australia during a magnetic storm.</description>

      <title>Radial variations in nitrogen, carbon, and hydrogen fractionation in the PDS 70 planet-hosting disk</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Element isotopic ratios are powerful tools to reconstruct the journey of planetary material, from the parental molecular cloud to protoplanetary disks, where planets form and accrete their atmosphere. Radial variations in isotopic ratios in protoplanetary disks reveal local pathways which can critically affect the degree of isotope fractionation of planetary material. In this work we present spatially-resolved profiles of the 14N/15N, 12C/13C, and D/H isotopic ratios of the HCN molecule in the PDS 70 disk, which hosts two actively-accreting giant planets. ALMA high spatial resolution observations of HCN, H13CN, HC15N, and DCN reveal radial variations of fractionation profiles. We extract the HCN/HC15N ratio out to ~120 au, which shows a decreasing trend outside the inner cavity wall of the PDS 70 disk located at ~50 au. We suggest that the radial variations observed in the HCN/HC15N ratio are linked to isotope selective photodissociation of N2. We leverage the spectrally resolved hyperfine component of the HCN line to extract the radial profile of the HCN/H13CN ratio between ~40 and 90 au, obtaining a value consistent with the ISM 12C/13C ratio. The deuteration profile is also mostly constant throughout the disk extent, with a DCN/HCN ratio ~0.02, in line with other disk-averaged values and radial profiles in disks around T Tauri stars. The extracted radial profiles of isotopologue ratios show how different fractionation processes dominate at different spatial scales in the planet-hosting disk of PDS 70.</description>

      <title>Optical and Near-infrared Observations of SN 2023ixf for over 600 days after the Explosion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03856v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context.We present a comprehensive photometric and spectroscopic study of the nearby Type II supernova (SN) 2023ixf, with our extensive observations spanning the phases from ~3 to over 600 days after the first light.\\ Aims.The aim of this study is to obtain key information on the explosion properties of SN\,2023ixf and the nature of its progenitor.\\ Methods.The observational properties of SN\,2023ixf are compared with those of a sample of Type IIP/L SNe to investigate commonalities and diversities. We conduct a detailed analysis of temporal evolution of major spectral features observed throughout different phases of the SN\,2023ixf explosion. Several interpretations are addressed through a comparison between the data and the model spectra for progenitor stars within a range of zero-age main sequence (ZAMS) masses.\\ Results.Our observations indicate that SN\,2023ixf is a transitional SN that bridges the gap between Type IIP and IIL subclasses of H-rich SNe, characterized by a relatively short plateau ($\lesssim 70$\,d) in the light curve. It shows a rather prompt spectroscopic evolution toward the nebular phase; emission lines of Na, O, H, and Ca in nebular spectra all exhibit multipeak profiles, which might be attributed to bipolar distribution of the ejecta. In particular, the H$\alpha$ profile can be separated into two central peaked components (with a velocity of about 1500\,km\,s$^{-1}$) that is likely due to nickel-powered ejecta and two outer peak/box components (with a velocity extending up to ~8000 km\,s$^{-1}$) that can arise from interaction of the outermost ejecta with a circumstellar shell at a distance of $\sim6.2\times10^{15}$cm. The nebular-phase spectra of SN\,2023ixf show good agreement with those predicted by model spectra for progenitor stars with a ZAMS mass ranging from 15 to 19\,M${_\odot}$. A distance $D = 6.35^{+0.31}_{-0.39}$\,Mpc is estimated for M101.</description>

      <title>Doppler Shifted Transient Sodium Detection by KECK/HIRES</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03974v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We carried out the first high-resolution transit observations of the exoplanet WASP-49 Ab with Keck/HIRES. Upon custom wavelength calibration we achieve a Doppler RV precision of $&lt;$ 60 {\mbox{${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$}}. This is an improvement in RV stability of roughly 240 {\mbox{${\rm m\,s}^{-1}$}} with respect to the instrument standard. We report an average sodium flux residual of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD}/ \mathcal{F}_{\star} (\lambda) \sim$ 3.2 $\pm$ 0.4 $\%$ (8.0 $\sigma$) comparable to previous studies. Interestingly, an average Doppler shift of -6.2 $\pm$ 0.5 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}} (12.4 $\sigma$) is identified offset from the exoplanet rest frame. The velocity residuals \textit{in time} trace a blueshift (v$_{\Gamma, ingress} \sim$ -10.3 $\pm$ 1.9 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}}) to redshift (v$_{\Gamma, egress} \sim$ +4.1 $\pm$ 1.5 {\mbox{${\rm km\,s}^{-1}$}}) suggesting the origin of the observed sodium is unlikely from the atmosphere of the planet. The average Na light curves indicate a depth of $\Delta \mathcal{F}_{NaD} /\mathcal{F}_{\star} (t) \sim$ 0.47 $\pm$ 0.04 \% (11.7 $\sigma$) enduring $\lesssim$ 90 minutes with a half-max duration of $\sim$ 40.1 minutes. Frequent high-resolution spectroscopic observations will be able to characterize the periodicity of the observed Doppler shifts. Considering the origin of the transient sodium gas is of unknown geometry, a co-orbiting natural satellite may be a likely source.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04384v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a novel concept of enhanced asymmetric dark matter annihilation in astrophysical bodies like the Sun in the presence of multiple dark matter candidates based on hidden annihilation mechanisms. We consider hidden sector annihilation of a heavy dark matter into an asymmetric dark matter, resulting in a significant change in the dark matter annihilation flux and the muon flux at neutrino detectors. We quantify expected changes in the muon flux with scaling parameters for the symmetric or asymmetric nature of the heavier dark matter candidate.</description>

      <title>Observations of fast radio variations in microquasars by FAST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04719v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Microquasars are the compact objects generally including accreting black holes which produce relativistic jets. The physical mechanisms of jet launching, collimation, and acceleration are poorly understood. Microquasars show strong variability in multi-wavelength observations. In X-rays, the sources show the fast variation features down to millisecond time scales, with the prominent quasiperiodic oscillations (QPOs) around 0.1 Hz - tens of Hz in light curves, however, physical origin of QPOs is still uncertain. FAST as the largest radio telescope provides the opportunity to study fast variability of both radio flux and polarization in microquasars. In the FAST observations from 2020 - 2022, we reported the first evidence of radio subsecond quasi-periodic oscillations of GRS 1915+105, providing the direct link between QPOs and the dynamics of relativistic jets. These QPOs with the centroid frequency around 5 Hz are transient, accompanied with strong evolution of the spectral index. Combined with multiwavelength observations, we discuss the possible physical models to produce radio QPOs in BH systems: the helical motion of jet knots or precession of the jet base. In near future, high time resolution radio monitoring of microquasars based on FAST is expected to discover more new phenomena in black hole systems, which will be important to understand the physics in strong gravity.</description>

      <title>The spin measurement of the black hole SLX 1746-331 using Insight-HXMT observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04760v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an X-ray spectral analysis of a black hole X-ray binary SLX 1746-331 during the 2023 outburst using five \textit{Insight}-HXMT observations. We jointly use the reflection model \texttt{relxillcp} and the general relativistic thermal thin disk model \texttt{kerrbb} to fit the spectra from 2 - 100 keV. By jointly fitting the five spectra, we constrained the black hole mass to be $M=5.8\pm 0.3 M_{\odot}$ and dimensionless spin parameter to be $a_{*}=0.88^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$ (90 percent statistical confidence). The reflection model shows that SLX 1746-331 is a high-inclination system with the inclination angle $i=63.7^{+1.3}_{-1.0}$ degrees, the accretion disk has a density $\rm{log}N\sim 16 ~\rm cm^{-3}$. In addition, with the different reflection model \texttt{relxilllp}, which assumes a lamp-post geometry corona, we still give similar results.</description>

      <title>Broad-band noises in GX 339-4 during the 2021 outburst observed with Insight-HXMT and NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rapid X-ray variability of GX 339$-$4 including the low-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (LFQPOs) and broad-band noises have been observed with the Hard X-ray Modulation Telescope (\textit{Insight}-HXMT) and Neutron star Interior Composition Explorer (\textit {NICER}) during the 2021 outburst. Here we present a systematic study of the evolution and energy dependence properties of such broad-band noises (BBN). The outburst from February to March of 2021 can be divided into three stages: the low hard state (LHS), the hard intermediate state (HIMS) and soft intermediate state (SIMS). In the PDSs of the LHS and HIMS, the broad-band noises are well fitted with three Lorentzian components: a low-frequency component $L_1$, a middle-frequency component $L_2$ and a high-frequency component $L_3$. The increasing trend of the characteristic frequencies for $L_1$ and $L_2$ and the relation between the QPO frequency and characteristic BBN frequency are reported. We found that the energies corresponding to the peaks and shapes of the rms spectra for three BBN components are different. The comparison among three BBN components indicates that energy-dominant bands of these BBN components are distinct. Our results can be explained with the truncated disc/hot flow model with a large variable disc and a small hot inner flow. A possible description of the accretion structure and its evolution from the LHS to the SIMS is proposed. Further research is still required to probe such accretion structure in GX 339--4.</description>

      <title>Generalized Fermi-Dirac Distribution of Exclusive Fermions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04813v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A system of exclusive fermions occurs when two fermions of opposite spin are prohibited from occupying the same quantum level. We derive the distribution of exclusive fermions via the employment of the grand canonical ensemble. Salient features of its statistical properties, compared to the free electron gases, include: larger Fermi energy, higher degeneracy pressure, but the same Pauli paramagnetism and Landau diamagnetism. In particular, higher degeneracy pressure leads to an inflation of the Chandrasekhar limit to 1.6 times when applied to white dwarf stars and neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Modeling the circumstellar interaction around SN 2004gq</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relationship between the mass-loss history and final evolutionary stage of massive stars and the properties of the observable supernova (SN) is still under debate. This is especially true for stripped-envelope (Type Ib/c) SNe, where the progenitor ejects a considerably large amount of material during its evolution, which can lead to a circumstellar medium relatively close to the exploding star. Moreover, when the star explodes as a SN, this matter may contribute significantly to the generated luminosity because of the interaction. However, the trace of this circumstellar interaction can only be investigated for a couple of Type Ib/c SNe, and the nature of a close (within around $10^{15}$ cm) circumstellar matter (CSM) has also been largely unexplored for these objects.
  Here, we present the results of our radio and bolometric light curve (LC) analysis related to SN 2004gq. We describe a combined model that explains the unusual LC properties of this event and supports the circumstellar interaction scenario. For that, we computed the quasi-bolometric LC of the SN and fit this with a multicomponent model to gain information on the progenitor and the surrounding circumstellar medium. We also analyzed the available radio LCs (taken at 1.4,\ 4.9 and 8.5 GHz) of SN 2004gq to verify our estimated average mass-loss rate, which is one of the most crucial physical properties related to CSM models.
  We infer reasonable parameters for SN 2004gq using radioactive decay and magnetar energy input. To power the entire LC, we must also add an extra energy source related to the CSM. We determine the most essential parameter of this medium: the average mass-loss rate from both LC and radio data fitting. We find that the suggested hidden circumstellar interaction is a viable mechanism that provides the required energy deficiency and that it can be estimated using a simple semi-analytic model.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet Photometry and Reddening Estimation of 105 Galactic Open Clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04930v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper focuses on observing unstudied Galactic open clusters in the Ultraviolet (UV) wavelength range and analyzing their photometric data. The Gaia Data Release 3 (DR3) enables us to precisely study known Galactic open clusters. We conducted observations using the 1.54-meter Danish Telescope (DK1.54) in Chile and the 2.15-meter telescope at the Complejo Astronomico El Leoncito (CASLEO) in Argentina, employing UV filters. Furthermore, we have collected available photometric and astrometric data for our observed clusters. We aim to estimate the reddening of Galactic open clusters using UV photometry. We applied isochrone fitting to determine the reddening of the clusters using well-known members. As a final result, we present the reddening values of 105 Galactic open clusters in the UV, as determined by our photometry.</description>

      <title>On the Origins of "Hostless'' Supernovae: Testing the Faint-end Galaxy Luminosity Function and Supernova Progenitors with Events in Dwarf Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present arguments on the likely origins of supernovae without associated host galaxies from open field, non-clustered, environments. We show why it is unlikely these ``hostless'' supernovae stem from escaped hyper-velocity stars (HVS) in any appreciable numbers, especially for core-collapse supernovae. It is highly likely that hostless events arise from dwarf host galaxies too faint to be detected in their parent surveys. Several detections and numerous upper limits suggest a large number of field dwarfs, to $M_V&gt;-14$, which themselves may be important to constraining the slope of the low-mass end of the UV luminosity function, understanding galaxy evolution, and putting $\Lambda$CDM into context. Moreover, the detailed study of these mass and metallicity-constrained host environments, and the variety of supernovae that occur within them, could provide more stringent constraints on the nature of progenitor systems.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes and absorption cross-section of a Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter in four dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study quasinormal modes and absorption cross sections for the $(1+3)$-dimensional Bardeen black hole surrounded by perfect fluid dark matter. Studies of the massless scalar field is already done in \cite{Sun:2023slzl}. Hence, in this paper we will focus on the massive scalar field perturbations and massless Dirac field perturbations. To compute the quasinormal modes we use the semi-analytical 3rd-order WKB method, which has been shown to be one of the best approaches when the effective potential is adequate and when $n &lt; \ell$ and $n &lt; \lambda$. We have also utilized the P\"oschl-Teller method to compare the valus obtained using the WKB approach. We have computed quasinormal frequencies by varying various parameters of the theory such as the mass of the scalar field $\mu$, dark matter parameter $\alpha$ and the magnetic charge $g$. We have summarized our solutions in tables and figures for clarity. As for the absorption cross section, we used third order WKB approach to compute reflection, transmission coefficients and partial absorption cross sections. Graphs are presented to demonstrate the behavior of the above quantities when the dark matter parameter and mass of the massive scalar field are varied.</description>

      <title>An X-ray and Optical Study of the Dwarf Nova Candidate OGLE-BLG-DN-0064</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05263v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The source OGLE-BLG-DN-0064 (hereafter OGLE64) was classified as a potential dwarf nova based on its regular outburst activity revealed by the OGLE optical survey. In this paper, we investigate the X-ray and optical emissions from the source OGLE64 based on archival Chandra and Swift X-ray data and our optical observations with the 6-m BTA telescope at the Special Astrophysical Observatory of the Russian Academy of Sciences. OGLE64 shows an X-ray luminosity $ L_X \approx 1.6 \times 10^{32} \, \text{erg s}^{-1} $ and a high X-ray-to-optical flux ratio $ F_X / F_{\text{opt}} \approx 1.5$, typical for accreting white dwarfs. The X-ray spectrum of OGLE64 is better fitted by the models of a power law with a photon index $\Gamma \approx 1.9$ and an optically thin plasma with a temperature $ kT \approx 6.4 \, \text{keV} $. The optical spectrum shows hydrogen and neutral helium emission lines, in some of which a double-peaked structure is observed. An analysis of the outburst activity of OGLE64, based on data from the OGLE, ZTF, ATLAS, and ASAS-SN optical surveys, has revealed superoutbursts with a characteristic supercycle $ P_{\text{super}} \approx 400 \, \text{days} $. We found no significant variability in either the X-ray or optical light curves of OGLE64 that could be associated with the change in the visibility conditions for the emitting regions at different orbital phases. Our estimates of the orbital period of the system by indirect methods show that the period probably lies in the range $ P_{\text{orb}} \sim 1.5 - 3.5 \, \text{h} $. The properties of the X-ray and optical emissions from OGLE64 lead us to conclude that the system is an SU UMa-type dwarf nova.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.05286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Systematic R-matrix calculations of electron-impact excitation for ions of astrophysical interest have been performed since 2007 for many iso-electronic sequences as part of the UK Atomic Process for Astrophysical Plasma (APAP) network. Rate coefficients for Maxwellian electron distributions have been provided and used extensively in the literature and many databases for astrophysics. Here, we provide averaged collision strengths to be used to model plasma where electrons are non-Maxwellian, which often occur in laboratory and astrophysical plasma. We also provide for many ions new Maxwellian-averaged collision strengths which include important corrections to the published values. The H- and He-like atomic data were recently made available in Mao+(2022). Here, we provide data for ions of the Li-, Be-, B-, C-, N-, O-, Ne-, Na-, and Mg-like sequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.06253v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the stability of gravitational triple systems comprising a central massive body and a tight binary of less massive pairs. In the present paper, we focus on improving the Hill-type stability criterion for the binary in those systems, with particular attention to the effects of the eccentricities of the inner and outer orbits. We perform direct Newtonian N-body simulations over much longer integration times than previous studies, which is essential to determine the stability and breakup timescale distributions of those systems in a reliable fashion. As a result, we obtain an empirical fitting formula of the binary breakup condition that incorporates effects of the inner and outer eccentricities, the mutual inclination of the inner and outer orbits, the mass ratios of the three bodies, and the breakup timescale.</description>

Abstract: Searches for variations of fundamental constants require a comprehensive understanding of measurement errors. This paper examines a source of error that is usually overlooked: the impact of continuum placement error. We investigate the problem using a high resolution, high signal to noise spectrum of the white dwarf G191$-$B2B. Narrow photospheric absorption lines allow us to search for new physics in the presence of a gravitational field approximately $10^4$ times that on Earth. Modelling photospheric lines requires knowing the underlying spectral continuum level. We describe the development of a fully automated, objective, and reproducible continuum estimation method. Measurements of the fine structure constant are produced using several continuum models. The results show that continuum placement variations result in small systematic shifts in the centroids of narrow photospheric absorption lines which impact significantly on fine structure constant measurements. This effect should therefore be included in the error budgets of future measurements. Our results suggest that continuum placement variations should be investigated in other contexts, including fine structure constant measurements in stars other than white dwarfs. The analysis presented here is based on NiV absorption lines in the photosphere of G191$-$B2B. Curiously, the inferred measurement of the fine structure constant obtained in this paper using NiV (the least negative of our measurements is $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = -1.462 \pm 1.121 \times 10^{-5}$) is inconsistent with the most recent previous G191$-$B2B photospheric measurement using FeV ($\Delta\alpha/\alpha = 6.36 \pm 0.35_{stat} \pm 1.84_{sys} \times 10^{-5}$). Given both measurements are derived from the same spectrum, we presume (but in this work are unable to check) that this 3.2$\sigma$ difference results from unknown laboratory wavelength systematics.</description>

      <title>Acoustic modes in M67 cluster stars trace deepening convective envelopes</title>

Abstract: Acoustic oscillations in stars are sensitive to stellar interiors. Frequency differences between overtone modes -- large separations -- probe stellar density, while differences between low-degree modes -- small separations -- probe the sound speed gradient in the energy-generating core of main sequence Sun-like stars, and hence their ages. At later phases of stellar evolution, characterised by inert cores, small separations are believed to lose much of their power to probe deep interiors and simply become proportional to large separations. Here, we present clear evidence of a rapidly evolving convective zone as stars evolve from the subgiant phase into red giants. By measuring acoustic oscillations in 27 stars from the open cluster M67, we observe deviations of proportionality between small and large separations, which are caused by the influence of the bottom of the convective envelope. These deviations become apparent as the convective envelope penetrates deep into the star during subgiant and red giant evolution, eventually entering an ultra-deep regime that leads to the red giant branch luminosity bump. The tight sequence of cluster stars, free of large spreads in ages and fundamental properties, is essential for revealing the connection between the observed small separations and the chemical discontinuities occurring at the bottom of the convective envelope. We use this sequence to show that combining large and small separations can improve estimations of the masses and ages of field stars well after the main sequence.</description>

      <title>The first Palomar Gattini-IR catalog of J-band light curves: construction and public data release</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01720</link>

Abstract: Palomar Gattini-IR (PGIR) is a wide-field, synoptic infrared time domain survey covering $\approx 15000$\,sq.\,deg. of the \textbf{accessible} sky at $\approx 1-3$\,night cadence to a depth of $J\approx 13.0$ and $\approx 14.9$\,Vega mag in and outside the Galactic plane, respectively. Here, we present the first data release of $J$-band light curves of 2MASS sources within the survey footprint covering approximately the first four years of operations. We describe the construction of the source catalog based on 2MASS point sources, followed by exposure filtering criteria and forced PSF photometry. The catalog contains light curves of $\approx 286$\,million unique sources with 2MASS magnitudes of $J &lt; 15.5$\,mag, with a total of $\approx 50$\,billion photometric measurements and $\approx 20$\,billion individual source detections at signal-to-noise-ratio $&gt; 3$. We demonstrate the photometric fidelity of the catalog by i) quantifying the magnitude-dependent accuracy and uncertainty of the photometry with respect to 2MASS and ii) comparing against forced PGIR aperture photometry for known variable sources. We present simple filtering criteria for selecting reliable photometric measurements as well as example \texttt{Python} notebooks for users. This catalog is textbf{one of} the largest compilation of nightly cadence, synoptic infrared light curves to date, comparable to those in the largest optical surveys, providing a stepping stone to upcoming infrared surveys in the coming decade.</description>

      <title>Blue Loops, Cepheids, and Forays into Axions</title>

Abstract: The blue loop stage of intermediate mass stars has been called a "magnifying glass", where even seemingly small effects in prior stages of evolution, as well as assumptions about stellar composition, rotation, and convection, produce discernible changes. As such, blue loops, and especially the existence and properties of Cepheids, can serve as a laboratory where feebly connected Beyond Standard Model particles such as axions can be gainfully studied. We undertake a careful study of the effects of these putative particles on the blue loop, paying close attention to the evolution of the core potential and the hydrogen profile. Our simulations, performed with MESA, place bounds on the axion-photon coupling using the galactic Cepheid S Mus, with dynamically-determined mass of $6 M_\odot$, as a benchmark. The effects of varying convective overshoot on the core potential and hydrogen profile, and the ensuing changes in the axion constraints, are carefully studied. Along the way, we explore the "mirror principle" induced by the hydrogen burning shell and contrast our results with those existing in the literature. Less conservative (but more stringent) bounds on the axion-photon coupling are given for a $9 M_\odot$ model, which is the heaviest that can be simulated if overshoot is incorporated, and tentative projections are given for a $12 M_\odot$ model, which is approximately the heaviest tail of the mass distribution of galactic Cepheids determined by pulsation models using Gaia DR2. Our main message is that the reliable simulation and observation (ideally, through dynamical mass determination) of massive Cepheids constitutes an important frontier in axion searches, challenges in modeling uncertainties in the microphysics of the blue loop stage notwithstanding.</description>

      <title>Impact of the shape of the prestellar density fluctuations on the core mass function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06963v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well known that departure from sphericity in the geometry of primordial dark matter halos modifies their mass function. The ellipsoidal collapse model yields a better agreement with simulations of hierarchical clustering than the original, spherical model. In the present paper, we examine the same issue in the context of star formation by studying the impact of non-sphericity of density perturbations in a gravoturbulent medium on the prestellar core mass function (CMF). An important question, notably, is to find out how ellipsoidal, instead of spherical, initial density fluctuations modify both the high-mass and low-mass tails of the CMF. Our study shows that triaxial density fluctuations indeed depart from a purely spherical form but the deformation (prolateness and ellipticity) remains modest, suggesting that the usual hypothesis of spherical collapse in existing theories of the IMF is reasonable. We find that, as in the cosmological case, the departure from sphericity increases the collapse barrier, stabilizing the prestellar cores. The striking difference between the stellar case and the cosmological one for the ellipsoidal collapse model is that, although in both cases the less dense structures are the most deformed, they correspond to small scales, thus low mass halos in cosmology but to large scales, thus large mass cores in star formation. As a result, the high mass range of the CMF is the most affected by the ellipsoidal collapse, resulting in a slightly less steep slope than the one predicted with the spherical hypothesis and a peak slightly shifted toward lower masses.</description>

      <title>Double progenitor origin of the S-star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17165</link>

Abstract: The origin of the cluster of S-stars located in the Galactic Centre is tied to the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, but exactly how is still debated. In this paper, we investigate whether the Hills mechanism can simultaneously reproduce both the S-star cluster's properties and the observed number of hypervelocity stars. To do so, we forward-model the capture and disruption of binary stars originating from the nuclear star cluster (NSC) and the clockwise disk (CWD). We find that the ratio of evolved to main-sequence S-stars is highly sensitive to the origin of the binaries, and that neither the injection of binaries from the CWD nor from the NSC exclusively can reproduce all observations. However, when considering the injection of binaries from both locations, we are able to reproduce all the observations simultaneously, including the number of observed hypervelocity stars, the evolutionary stage of the S-stars, their luminosity function and the distribution of their semi-major axes. The implications of our findings include that ~90% of hypervelocity stars ejected over the past ~10 Myr should originate from the CWD, that the main-sequence S-stars originated in the CWD, and that the evolved S-stars originated in an old stellar population such as the NSC.</description>
