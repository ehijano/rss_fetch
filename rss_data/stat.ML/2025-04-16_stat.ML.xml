      <title>AB-Cache: Training-Free Acceleration of Diffusion Models via Adams-Bashforth Cached Feature Reuse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10540</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10540v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable success in generative tasks, yet their iterative denoising process results in slow inference, limiting their practicality. While existing acceleration methods exploit the well-known U-shaped similarity pattern between adjacent steps through caching mechanisms, they lack theoretical foundation and rely on simplistic computation reuse, often leading to performance degradation. In this work, we provide a theoretical understanding by analyzing the denoising process through the second-order Adams-Bashforth method, revealing a linear relationship between the outputs of consecutive steps. This analysis explains why the outputs of adjacent steps exhibit a U-shaped pattern. Furthermore, extending Adams-Bashforth method to higher order, we propose a novel caching-based acceleration approach for diffusion models, instead of directly reusing cached results, with a truncation error bound of only \(O(h^k)\) where $h$ is the step size. Extensive validation across diverse image and video diffusion models (including HunyuanVideo and FLUX.1-dev) with various schedulers demonstrates our method's effectiveness in achieving nearly $3\times$ speedup while maintaining original performance levels, offering a practical real-time solution without compromising generation quality.</description>

      <title>Beyond Worst-Case Online Classification: VC-Based Regret Bounds for Relaxed Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit online binary classification by shifting the focus from competing with the best-in-class binary loss to competing against relaxed benchmarks that capture smoothed notions of optimality. Instead of measuring regret relative to the exact minimal binary error -- a standard approach that leads to worst-case bounds tied to the Littlestone dimension -- we consider comparing with predictors that are robust to small input perturbations, perform well under Gaussian smoothing, or maintain a prescribed output margin. Previous examples of this were primarily limited to the hinge loss. Our algorithms achieve regret guarantees that depend only on the VC dimension and the complexity of the instance space (e.g., metric entropy), and notably, they incur only an $O(\log(1/\gamma))$ dependence on the generalized margin $\gamma$. This stands in contrast to most existing regret bounds, which typically exhibit a polynomial dependence on $1/\gamma$. We complement this with matching lower bounds. Our analysis connects recent ideas from adversarial robustness and smoothed online learning.</description>

      <title>Differentially Private Geodesic and Linear Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In statistical applications it has become increasingly common to encounter data structures that live on non-linear spaces such as manifolds. Classical linear regression, one of the most fundamental methodologies of statistical learning, captures the relationship between an independent variable and a response variable which both are assumed to live in Euclidean space. Thus, geodesic regression emerged as an extension where the response variable lives on a Riemannian manifold. The parameters of geodesic regression, as with linear regression, capture the relationship of sensitive data and hence one should consider the privacy protection practices of said parameters. We consider releasing Differentially Private (DP) parameters of geodesic regression via the K-Norm Gradient (KNG) mechanism for Riemannian manifolds. We derive theoretical bounds for the sensitivity of the parameters showing they are tied to their respective Jacobi fields and hence the curvature of the space. This corroborates recent findings of differential privacy for the Fr\'echet mean. We demonstrate the efficacy of our methodology on the sphere, $\mbS^2\subset\mbR^3$ and, since it is general to Riemannian manifolds, the manifold of Euclidean space which simplifies geodesic regression to a case of linear regression. Our methodology is general to any Riemannian manifold and thus it is suitable for data in domains such as medical imaging and computer vision.</description>

      <title>Formalising Anti-Discrimination Law in Automated Decision Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00400v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Algorithmic discrimination is a critical concern as machine learning models are used in high-stakes decision-making in legally protected contexts. Although substantial research on algorithmic bias and discrimination has led to the development of fairness metrics, several critical legal issues remain unaddressed in practice. To address these gaps, we introduce a novel decision-theoretic framework grounded in anti-discrimination law of the United Kingdom, which has global influence and aligns more closely with European and Commonwealth legal systems. We propose the 'conditional estimation parity' metric, which accounts for estimation error and the underlying data-generating process, aligning with legal standards. Through a real-world example based on an algorithmic credit discrimination case, we demonstrate the practical application of our formalism and provide insights for aligning fairness metrics with legal principles. Our approach bridges the divide between machine learning fairness metrics and anti-discrimination law, offering a legally grounded framework for developing non-discriminatory automated decision systems.</description>

      <title>Energy Matching: Unifying Flow Matching and Energy-Based Models for Generative Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative models often map noise to data by matching flows or scores, but these approaches become cumbersome for incorporating partial observations or additional priors. Inspired by recent advances in Wasserstein gradient flows, we propose Energy Matching, a framework that unifies flow-based approaches with the flexibility of energy-based models (EBMs). Far from the data manifold, samples move along curl-free, optimal transport paths from noise to data. As they approach the data manifold, an entropic energy term guides the system into a Boltzmann equilibrium distribution, explicitly capturing the underlying likelihood structure of the data. We parameterize this dynamic with a single time-independent scalar field, which serves as both a powerful generator and a flexible prior for effective regularization of inverse problems. Our method substantially outperforms existing EBMs on CIFAR-10 generation (FID 3.97 compared to 8.61), while retaining the simulation-free training of transport-based approaches away from the data manifold. Additionally, we exploit the flexibility of our method and introduce an interaction energy for diverse mode exploration. Our approach focuses on learning a static scalar potential energy -- without time conditioning, auxiliary generators, or additional networks -- marking a significant departure from recent EBM methods. We believe this simplified framework significantly advances EBM capabilities and paves the way for their broader adoption in generative modeling across diverse domains.</description>

Abstract: SPREV, short for hyperSphere Reduced to two-dimensional Regular Polygon for Visualisation, is a novel dimensionality reduction technique developed to address the challenges of reducing dimensions and visualizing labeled datasets that exhibit a unique combination of three characteristics: small class size, high dimensionality, and low sample size. SPREV is designed not only to uncover but also to visually represent hidden patterns within such datasets. Its distinctive integration of geometric principles, adapted for discrete computational environments, makes it an indispensable tool in the modern data science toolkit, enabling users to identify trends, extract insights, and navigate complex data efficiently and effectively.</description>

      <title>On the Contractivity of Stochastic Interpolation Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate stochastic interpolation, a recently introduced framework for high dimensional sampling which bears many similarities to diffusion modeling. Stochastic interpolation generates a data sample by first randomly initializing a particle drawn from a simple base distribution, then simulating deterministic or stochastic dynamics such that in finite time the particle's distribution converges to the target. We show that for a Gaussian base distribution and a strongly log-concave target distribution, the stochastic interpolation flow map is Lipschitz with a sharp constant which matches that of Caffarelli's theorem for optimal transport maps. We are further able to construct Lipschitz transport maps between non-Gaussian distributions, generalizing some recent constructions in the literature on transport methods for establishing functional inequalities. We discuss the practical implications of our theorem for the sampling and estimation problems required by stochastic interpolation.</description>

      <title>Beyond Coordinates: Meta-Equivariance in Statistical Inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optimal statistical decisions should transcend the language used to describe them. Yet, how do we guarantee that the choice of coordinates - the parameterisation of an optimisation problem - does not subtly dictate the solution? This paper reveals a fundamental geometric invariance principle. We first analyse the optimal combination of two asymptotically normal estimators under a strictly convex trace-AMSE risk. While methods for finding optimal weights are known, we prove that the resulting optimal estimator is invariant under direct affine reparameterisations of the weighting scheme. This exemplifies a broader principle we term meta-equivariance: the unique minimiser of any strictly convex, differentiable scalar objective over a matrix space transforms covariantly under any invertible affine reparameterisation of that space. Distinct from classical statistical equivariance tied to data symmetries, meta-equivariance arises from the immutable geometry of convex optimisation itself. It guarantees that optimality, in these settings, is not an artefact of representation but an intrinsic, coordinate-free truth.</description>

      <title>On relative universality, regression operator, and conditional independence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The notion of relative universality with respect to a {\sigma}-field was introduced to establish the unbiasedness and Fisher consistency of an estimator in nonlinear sufficient dimension reduction. However, there is a gap in the proof of this result in the existing literature. The existing definition of relative universality seems to be too strong for the proof to be valid. In this note we modify the definition of relative universality using the concept of \k{o}-measurability, and rigorously establish the mentioned unbiasedness and Fisher consistency. The significance of this result is beyond its original context of sufficient dimension reduction, because relative universality allows us to use the regression operator to fully characterize conditional independence, a crucially important statistical relation that sits at the core of many areas and methodologies in statistics and machine learning, such as dimension reduction, graphical models, probability embedding, causal inference, and Bayesian estimation.</description>

      <title>Divergence of Empirical Neural Tangent Kernel in Classification Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11130</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11130v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates that in classification problems, fully connected neural networks (FCNs) and residual neural networks (ResNets) cannot be approximated by kernel logistic regression based on the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) under overtraining (i.e., when training time approaches infinity). Specifically, when using the cross-entropy loss, regardless of how large the network width is (as long as it is finite), the empirical NTK diverges from the NTK on the training samples as training time increases. To establish this result, we first demonstrate the strictly positive definiteness of the NTKs for multi-layer FCNs and ResNets. Then, we prove that during training, % with the cross-entropy loss, the neural network parameters diverge if the smallest eigenvalue of the empirical NTK matrix (Gram matrix) with respect to training samples is bounded below by a positive constant. This behavior contrasts sharply with the lazy training regime commonly observed in regression problems. Consequently, using a proof by contradiction, we show that the empirical NTK does not uniformly converge to the NTK across all times on the training samples as the network width increases. We validate our theoretical results through experiments on both synthetic data and the MNIST classification task. This finding implies that NTK theory is not applicable in this context, with significant theoretical implications for understanding neural networks in classification problems.</description>

      <title>Hessian stability and convergence rates for entropic and Sinkhorn potentials via semiconcavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we determine quantitative stability bounds for the Hessian of entropic potentials, i.e., the dual solution to the entropic optimal transport problem. Up to authors' knowledge this is the first work addressing this second-order quantitative stability estimate in general unbounded settings. Our proof strategy relies on semiconcavity properties of entropic potentials and on the representation of entropic transport plans as laws of forward and backward diffusion processes, known as Schr\"odinger bridges. Moreover, our approach allows to deduce a stochastic proof of quantitative stability entropic estimates and integrated gradient estimates as well. Finally, as a direct consequence of these stability bounds, we deduce exponential convergence rates for gradient and Hessian of Sinkhorn iterates along Sinkhorn's algorithm, a problem that was still open in unbounded settings. Our rates have a polynomial dependence on the regularization parameter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11249v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation-based inference provides a powerful framework for cryo-electron microscopy, employing neural networks in methods like CryoSBI to infer biomolecular conformations via learned latent representations. This latent space represents a rich opportunity, encoding valuable information about the physical system and the inference process. Harnessing this potential hinges on understanding the underlying geometric structure of these representations. We investigate this structure by applying manifold learning techniques to CryoSBI representations of hemagglutinin (simulated and experimental). We reveal that these high-dimensional data inherently populate low-dimensional, smooth manifolds, with simulated data effectively covering the experimental counterpart. By characterizing the manifold's geometry using Diffusion Maps and identifying its principal axes of variation via coordinate interpretation methods, we establish a direct link between the latent structure and key physical parameters. Discovering this intrinsic low-dimensionality and interpretable geometric organization not only validates the CryoSBI approach but enables us to learn more from the data structure and provides opportunities for improving future inference strategies by exploiting this revealed manifold geometry.</description>

      <title>Simulation-based inference for stochastic nonlinear mixed-effects models with applications in systems biology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11279v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The analysis of data from multiple experiments, such as observations of several individuals, is commonly approached using mixed-effects models, which account for variation between individuals through hierarchical representations. This makes mixed-effects models widely applied in fields such as biology, pharmacokinetics, and sociology. In this work, we propose a novel methodology for scalable Bayesian inference in hierarchical mixed-effects models. Our framework first constructs amortized approximations of the likelihood and the posterior distribution, which are then rapidly refined for each individual dataset, to ultimately approximate the parameters posterior across many individuals. The framework is easily trainable, as it uses mixtures of experts but without neural networks, leading to parsimonious yet expressive surrogate models of the likelihood and the posterior. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our methodology using challenging stochastic models, such as mixed-effects stochastic differential equations emerging in systems biology-driven problems. However, the approach is broadly applicable and can accommodate both stochastic and deterministic models. We show that our approach can seamlessly handle inference for many parameters. Additionally, we applied our method to a real-data case study of mRNA transfection. When compared to exact pseudomarginal Bayesian inference, our approach proved to be both fast and competitive in terms of statistical accuracy.</description>

      <title>Bipartite Ranking From Multiple Labels: On Loss Versus Label Aggregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bipartite ranking is a fundamental supervised learning problem, with the goal of learning a ranking over instances with maximal area under the ROC curve (AUC) against a single binary target label. However, one may often observe multiple binary target labels, e.g., from distinct human annotators. How can one synthesize such labels into a single coherent ranking? In this work, we formally analyze two approaches to this problem -- loss aggregation and label aggregation -- by characterizing their Bayes-optimal solutions. Based on this, we show that while both methods can yield Pareto-optimal solutions, loss aggregation can exhibit label dictatorship: one can inadvertently (and undesirably) favor one label over others. This suggests that label aggregation can be preferable to loss aggregation, which we empirically verify.</description>

      <title>Optimizing LLM Inference: Fluid-Guided Online Scheduling with Memory Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are indispensable in today's applications, but their inference procedure -- generating responses by processing text in segments and using a memory-heavy Key-Value (KV) cache -- demands significant computational resources, particularly under memory constraints. This paper formulates LLM inference optimization as a multi-stage online scheduling problem where sequential prompt arrivals and KV cache growth render conventional scheduling ineffective. We develop a fluid dynamics approximation to provide a tractable benchmark that guides algorithm design. Building on this, we propose the Waiting for Accumulated Inference Threshold (WAIT) algorithm, which uses multiple thresholds to schedule incoming prompts optimally when output lengths are known, and extend it to Nested WAIT for cases with unknown output lengths. Theoretical analysis shows that both algorithms achieve near-optimal performance against the fluid benchmark in heavy traffic conditions, balancing throughput, latency, and Time to First Token (TTFT). Experiments with the Llama-7B model on an A100 GPU using both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate improved throughput and reduced latency relative to established baselines like vLLM and Sarathi. This work bridges operations research and machine learning, offering a rigorous framework for the efficient deployment of LLMs under memory constraints.</description>

      <title>A Minimalist Approach to LLM Reasoning: from Rejection Sampling to Reinforce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has become a prevailing approach for fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) on complex reasoning tasks. Among recent methods, GRPO stands out for its empirical success in training models such as DeepSeek-R1, yet the sources of its effectiveness remain poorly understood. In this work, we revisit GRPO from a reinforce-like algorithm perspective and analyze its core components. Surprisingly, we find that a simple rejection sampling baseline, RAFT, which trains only on positively rewarded samples, yields competitive performance than GRPO and PPO. Our ablation studies reveal that GRPO's main advantage arises from discarding prompts with entirely incorrect responses, rather than from its reward normalization. Motivated by this insight, we propose Reinforce-Rej, a minimal extension of policy gradient that filters both entirely incorrect and entirely correct samples. Reinforce-Rej improves KL efficiency and stability, serving as a lightweight yet effective alternative to more complex RL algorithms. We advocate RAFT as a robust and interpretable baseline, and suggest that future advances should focus on more principled designs for incorporating negative samples, rather than relying on them indiscriminately. Our findings provide guidance for future work in reward-based LLM post-training.</description>

      <title>Interpretable Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.11344v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Temporal Point Processes (TPPs) are widely used for modeling event sequences in various medical domains, such as disease onset prediction, progression analysis, and clinical decision support. Although TPPs effectively capture temporal dynamics, their lack of interpretability remains a critical challenge. Recent advancements have introduced interpretable TPPs. However, these methods fail to incorporate numerical features, thereby limiting their ability to generate precise predictions. To address this issue, we propose Hybrid-Rule Temporal Point Processes (HRTPP), a novel framework that integrates temporal logic rules with numerical features, improving both interpretability and predictive accuracy in event modeling. HRTPP comprises three key components: basic intensity for intrinsic event likelihood, rule-based intensity for structured temporal dependencies, and numerical feature intensity for dynamic probability modulation. To effectively discover valid rules, we introduce a two-phase rule mining strategy with Bayesian optimization. To evaluate our method, we establish a multi-criteria assessment framework, incorporating rule validity, model fitting, and temporal predictive accuracy. Experimental results on real-world medical datasets demonstrate that HRTPP outperforms state-of-the-art interpretable TPPs in terms of predictive performance and clinical interpretability. In case studies, the rules extracted by HRTPP explain the disease progression, offering valuable contributions to medical diagnosis.</description>

      <title>An Adaptive Dropout Approach for High-Dimensional Bayesian Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11353</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a widely used algorithm for solving expensive black-box optimization problems. However, its performance decreases significantly on high-dimensional problems due to the inherent high-dimensionality of the acquisition function. In the proposed algorithm, we adaptively dropout the variables of the acquisition function along the iterations. By gradually reducing the dimension of the acquisition function, the proposed approach has less and less difficulty to optimize the acquisition function. Numerical experiments demonstrate that AdaDropout effectively tackle high-dimensional challenges and improve solution quality where standard Bayesian optimization methods often struggle. Moreover, it achieves superior results when compared with state-of-the-art high-dimensional Bayesian optimization approaches. This work provides a simple yet efficient solution for high-dimensional expensive optimization.</description>

      <title>Property Inheritance for Subtensors in Tensor Train Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.11396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor dimensionality reduction is one of the fundamental tools for modern data science. To address the high computational overhead, fiber-wise sampled subtensors that preserve the original tensor rank are often used in designing efficient and scalable tensor dimensionality reduction. However, the theory of property inheritance for subtensors is still underdevelopment, that is, how the essential properties of the original tensor will be passed to its subtensors. This paper theoretically studies the property inheritance of the two key tensor properties, namely incoherence and condition number, under the tensor train setting. We also show how tensor train rank is preserved through fiber-wise sampling. The key parameters introduced in theorems are numerically evaluated under various settings. The results show that the properties of interest can be well preserved to the subtensors formed via fiber-wise sampling. Overall, this paper provides several handy analytic tools for developing efficient tensor analysis</description>

      <title>Posterior and variational inference for deep neural networks with heavy-tailed weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider deep neural networks in a Bayesian framework with a prior distribution sampling the network weights at random. Following a recent idea of Agapiou and Castillo (2023), who show that heavy-tailed prior distributions achieve automatic adaptation to smoothness, we introduce a simple Bayesian deep learning prior based on heavy-tailed weights and ReLU activation. We show that the corresponding posterior distribution achieves near-optimal minimax contraction rates, simultaneously adaptive to both intrinsic dimension and smoothness of the underlying function, in a variety of contexts including nonparametric regression, geometric data and Besov spaces. While most works so far need a form of model selection built-in within the prior distribution, a key aspect of our approach is that it does not require to sample hyperparameters to learn the architecture of the network. We also provide variational Bayes counterparts of the results, that show that mean-field variational approximations still benefit from near-optimal theoretical support.</description>

      <title>Robust Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback for Large Language Models Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03784v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has emerged as a key technique for aligning the output of large language models (LLMs) with human preferences. To learn the reward function, most existing RLHF algorithms use the Bradley-Terry model, which relies on assumptions about human preferences that may not reflect the complexity and variability of real-world judgments. In this paper, we propose a robust algorithm to enhance the performance of existing approaches under such reward model misspecifications. Theoretically, our algorithm reduces the variance of reward and policy estimators, leading to improved regret bounds. Empirical evaluations on LLM benchmark datasets demonstrate that the proposed algorithm consistently outperforms existing methods, with 77-81% of responses being favored over baselines on the Anthropic Helpful and Harmless dataset.</description>

      <title>A Piecewise Lyapunov Analysis of Sub-quadratic SGD: Applications to Robust and Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.08178v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by robust and quantile regression problems, we investigate the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm for minimizing an objective function $f$ that is locally strongly convex with a sub--quadratic tail. This setting covers many widely used online statistical methods. We introduce a novel piecewise Lyapunov function that enables us to handle functions $f$ with only first-order differentiability, which includes a wide range of popular loss functions such as Huber loss. Leveraging our proposed Lyapunov function, we derive finite-time moment bounds under general diminishing stepsizes, as well as constant stepsizes. We further establish the weak convergence, central limit theorem and bias characterization under constant stepsize, providing the first geometrical convergence result for sub--quadratic SGD. Our results have wide applications, especially in online statistical methods. In particular, we discuss two applications of our results. 1) Online robust regression: We consider a corrupted linear model with sub--exponential covariates and heavy--tailed noise. Our analysis provides convergence rates comparable to those for corrupted models with Gaussian covariates and noise. 2) Online quantile regression: Importantly, our results relax the common assumption in prior work that the conditional density is continuous and provide a more fine-grained analysis for the moment bounds.</description>

      <title>Inferring Outcome Means of Exponential Family Distributions Estimated by Deep Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09347v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While deep neural networks (DNNs) are widely used for prediction, inference on DNN-estimated subject-specific means for categorical or exponential family outcomes remains underexplored. We address this by proposing a DNN estimator under generalized nonparametric regression models (GNRMs) and developing a rigorous inference framework. Unlike existing approaches that assume independence between prediction errors and inputs to establish the error bound, a condition often violated in GNRMs, we allow for dependence and our theoretical analysis demonstrates the feasibility of drawing inference under GNRMs. To implement inference, we consider an Ensemble Subsampling Method (ESM) that leverages U-statistics and the Hoeffding decomposition to construct reliable confidence intervals for DNN estimates. We show that, under GNRM settings, ESM enables model-free variance estimation and accounts for heterogeneity among individuals in the population. Through simulations under nonparametric logistic, Poisson, and binomial regression models, we demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method. We further apply the method to the electronic Intensive Care Unit (eICU) dataset, a large-scale collection of anonymized health records from ICU patients, to predict ICU readmission risk and offer patient-centric insights for clinical decision-making.</description>

      <title>Cramming Contextual Bandits for On-policy Statistical Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07031v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the cram method as a general statistical framework for evaluating the final learned policy from a multi-armed contextual bandit algorithm, using the dataset generated by the same bandit algorithm. The proposed on-policy evaluation methodology differs from most existing methods that focus on off-policy performance evaluation of contextual bandit algorithms. Cramming utilizes an entire bandit sequence through a single pass of data, leading to both statistically and computationally efficient evaluation. We prove that if a bandit algorithm satisfies a certain stability condition, the resulting crammed evaluation estimator is consistent and asymptotically normal under mild regularity conditions. Furthermore, we show that this stability condition holds for commonly used linear contextual bandit algorithms, including epsilon-greedy, Thompson Sampling, and Upper Confidence Bound algorithms. Using both synthetic and publicly available datasets, we compare the empirical performance of cramming with the state-of-the-art methods. The results demonstrate that the proposed cram method reduces the evaluation standard error by approximately 40% relative to off-policy evaluation methods while preserving unbiasedness and valid confidence interval coverage.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a reinforcement learning (RL) setting, the agent's optimal strategy heavily depends on her risk preferences and the underlying model dynamics of the training environment. These two aspects influence the agent's ability to make well-informed and time-consistent decisions when facing testing environments. In this work, we devise a framework to solve robust risk-aware RL problems where we simultaneously account for environmental uncertainty and risk with a class of dynamic robust distortion risk measures. Robustness is introduced by considering all models within a Wasserstein ball around a reference model. We estimate such dynamic robust risk measures using neural networks by making use of strictly consistent scoring functions, derive policy gradient formulae using the quantile representation of distortion risk measures, and construct an actor-critic algorithm to solve this class of robust risk-aware RL problems. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm on a portfolio allocation example.</description>

      <title>Model-free Estimation of Latent Structure via Multiscale Nonparametric Maximum Likelihood</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multivariate distributions often carry latent structures that are difficult to identify and estimate, and which better reflect the data generating mechanism than extrinsic structures exhibited simply by the raw data. In this paper, we propose a model-free approach for estimating such latent structures whenever they are present, without assuming they exist a priori. Given an arbitrary density $p_0$, we construct a multiscale representation of the density and propose data-driven methods for selecting representative models that capture meaningful discrete structure. Our approach uses a nonparametric maximum likelihood estimator to estimate the latent structure at different scales and we further characterize their asymptotic limits. By carrying out such a multiscale analysis, we obtain coarseto-fine structures inherent in the original distribution, which are integrated via a model selection procedure to yield an interpretable discrete representation of it. As an application, we design a clustering algorithm based on the proposed procedure and demonstrate its effectiveness in capturing a wide range of latent structures.</description>

      <title>Who's the (Multi-)Fairest of Them All: Rethinking Interpolation-Based Data Augmentation Through the Lens of Multicalibration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.10575v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data augmentation methods, especially SoTA interpolation-based methods such as Fair Mixup, have been widely shown to increase model fairness. However, this fairness is evaluated on metrics that do not capture model uncertainty and on datasets with only one, relatively large, minority group. As a remedy, multicalibration has been introduced to measure fairness while accommodating uncertainty and accounting for multiple minority groups. However, existing methods of improving multicalibration involve reducing initial training data to create a holdout set for post-processing, which is not ideal when minority training data is already sparse. This paper uses multicalibration to more rigorously examine data augmentation for classification fairness. We stress-test four versions of Fair Mixup on two structured data classification problems with up to 81 marginalized groups, evaluating multicalibration violations and balanced accuracy. We find that on nearly every experiment, Fair Mixup \textit{worsens} baseline performance and fairness, but the simple vanilla Mixup \textit{outperforms} both Fair Mixup and the baseline, especially when calibrating on small groups. \textit{Combining} vanilla Mixup with multicalibration post-processing, which enforces multicalibration through post-processing on a holdout set, further increases fairness.</description>

      <title>Explainable and Class-Revealing Signal Feature Extraction via Scattering Transform and Constrained Zeroth-Order Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to extract discriminant and explainable features from a particular machine learning model, i.e., a combination of the scattering transform and the multiclass logistic regression. Although this model is well-known for its ability to learn various signal classes with high classification rate, it remains elusive to understand why it can generate such successful classification, mainly due to the nonlinearity of the scattering transform. In order to uncover the meaning of the scattering transform coefficients selected by the multiclass logistic regression (with the Lasso penalty), we adopt zeroth-order optimization algorithms to search an input pattern that maximizes the class probability of a class of interest given the learned model. In order to do so, it turns out that imposing sparsity and smoothness of input patterns is important. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method using a couple of synthetic time-series classification problems.</description>

      <title>Steering No-Regret Agents in MFGs under Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incentive design is a popular framework for guiding agents' learning dynamics towards desired outcomes by providing additional payments beyond intrinsic rewards. However, most existing works focus on a finite, small set of agents or assume complete knowledge of the game, limiting their applicability to real-world scenarios involving large populations and model uncertainty. To address this gap, we study the design of steering rewards in Mean-Field Games (MFGs) with density-independent transitions, where both the transition dynamics and intrinsic reward functions are unknown. This setting presents non-trivial challenges, as the mediator must incentivize the agents to explore for its model learning under uncertainty, while simultaneously steer them to converge to desired behaviors without incurring excessive incentive payments. Assuming agents exhibit no(-adaptive) regret behaviors, we contribute novel optimistic exploration algorithms. Theoretically, we establish sub-linear regret guarantees for the cumulative gaps between the agents' behaviors and the desired ones. In terms of the steering cost, we demonstrate that our total incentive payments incur only sub-linear excess, competing with a baseline steering strategy that stabilizes the target policy as an equilibrium. Our work presents an effective framework for steering agents behaviors in large-population systems under uncertainty.</description>

      <title>The Pitfalls of Imitation Learning when Actions are Continuous</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09722v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of imitating an expert demonstrator in a discrete-time, continuous state-and-action control system. We show that, even if the dynamics satisfy a control-theoretic property called exponentially stability (i.e. the effects of perturbations decay exponentially quickly), and the expert is smooth and deterministic, any smooth, deterministic imitator policy necessarily suffers error on execution that is exponentially larger, as a function of problem horizon, than the error under the distribution of expert training data. Our negative result applies to any algorithm which learns solely from expert data, including both behavior cloning and offline-RL algorithms, unless the algorithm produces highly "improper" imitator policies--those which are non-smooth, non-Markovian, or which exhibit highly state-dependent stochasticity--or unless the expert trajectory distribution is sufficiently "spread." We provide experimental evidence of the benefits of these more complex policy parameterizations, explicating the benefits of today's popular policy parameterizations in robot learning (e.g. action-chunking and Diffusion Policies). We also establish a host of complementary negative and positive results for imitation in control systems.</description>

      <title>A Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm for Sampling Jeffreys Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.06372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inference and estimation are fundamental aspects of statistics, system identification and machine learning. For most inference problems, prior knowledge is available on the system to be modeled, and Bayesian analysis is a natural framework to impose such prior information in the form of a prior distribution. However, in many situations, coming out with a fully specified prior distribution is not easy, as prior knowledge might be too vague, so practitioners prefer to use a prior distribution that is as `ignorant' or `uninformative' as possible, in the sense of not imposing subjective beliefs, while still supporting reliable statistical analysis. Jeffreys prior is an appealing uninformative prior because it offers two important benefits: (i) it is invariant under any re-parameterization of the model, (ii) it encodes the intrinsic geometric structure of the parameter space through the Fisher information matrix, which in turn enhances the diversity of parameter samples. Despite these benefits, drawing samples from Jeffreys prior is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose a general sampling scheme using the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm that enables sampling of parameter values from Jeffreys prior, and provide numerical illustrations of our approach through several examples.</description>

      <title>FairACE: Achieving Degree Fairness in Graph Neural Networks via Contrastive and Adversarial Group-Balanced Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.09210v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Fairness has been a significant challenge in graph neural networks (GNNs) since degree biases often result in un-equal prediction performance among nodes with varying degrees. Existing GNN models focus on prediction accuracy, frequently overlooking fairness across different degree groups. To addressthis issue, we propose a novel GNN framework, namely Fairness- Aware Asymmetric Contrastive Ensemble (FairACE), which inte-grates asymmetric contrastive learning with adversarial training to improve degree fairness. FairACE captures one-hop local neighborhood information and two-hop monophily similarity to create fairer node representations and employs a degree fairness regulator to balance performance between high-degree and low-degree nodes. During model training, a novel group-balanced fairness loss is proposed to minimize classification disparities across degree groups. In addition, we also propose a novel fairness metric, the Accuracy Distribution Gap (ADG), which can quantitatively assess and ensure equitable performance across different degree-based node groups. Experimental results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that FairACE significantly improves degree fairness metrics while maintaining competitive accuracy in comparison to the state-of-the-art GNN models.</description>
