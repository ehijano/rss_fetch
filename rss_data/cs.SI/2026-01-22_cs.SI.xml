      <title>A Unified Framework for Scalable and Robust Paper Assignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Assigning papers to reviewers is a central challenge in the peer-review process of large academic conferences. Program chairs must balance competing objectives, including maximizing reviewer expertise, promoting diversity, and enhancing robustness to strategic manipulation, but it is challenging to do so at the modern conference scale.
  Existing algorithmic paper assignment approaches either fail to address all of these goals simultaneously or suffer from poor scalability. To address the limitation, we propose Robust Assignment via Marginal Perturbation (RAMP), a unified framework for large-scale peer review. Our approach formulates a linearized perturbed-maximization objective with soft constraints that flexibly balance assignment quality, diversity, and robustness while maintaining runtime efficiency. We further introduce an attribute-aware sampling procedure that converts fractional solutions into integral assignments and improves the diversity and robustness of the final assignment. On datasets with over 20,000 papers and 20,000 reviewers, RAMP runs in under 20 minutes, demonstrating its suitability for real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>Maximum Edge-based Quasi-Clique: Novel Iterative Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extracting cohesive subgraphs from complex networks is a fundamental task in graph analytics and is essential for understanding biological, social, and web graphs. The edge-based $\gamma$-quasi-clique model offers a flexible alternative by identifying subgraphs whose edge densities exceed a specified threshold $\gamma$. However, finding the exact maximum edge-based quasi-clique is computationally challenging, as the problem is NP-hard and lacks the hereditary property. These characteristics limit the effectiveness of conventional pruning methods and the development of efficient reduction rules. As a result, existing algorithms, such as QClique and FPCE, struggle to scale to large graphs. In this paper, we revisit the problem and propose a novel iterative framework that reformulates the problem as a sequence of hereditary subproblems, enabling more effective pruning and reduction strategies and improving the worst-case time complexity. Furthermore, we redesign the iterative process and introduce a novel heuristic to further improve practical efficiency. Extensive experiments on 253 large-scale real-world graphs demonstrate that our proposed algorithm EQC-Pro outperforms existing methods by up to four orders of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Validating Behavioral Proxies for Disease Risk Monitoring via Large-Scale E-commerce Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Digital traces of everyday behavior, such as e-commerce (EC) purchase logs, provide scalable signals for population-level monitoring, yet their epidemiological validity remains unclear due to weak links to clinical outcomes.
  We propose a behavioral proxy for disease onset based on transitions from regular to therapeutic diets observed in EC purchase histories, and evaluate its validity through large-scale cross-domain analysis. Using EC purchase data (N = 55,645 users) and independent insurance-derived clinical records, we compare ingredient-level risk patterns and seasonal disease dynamics in feline lower urinary tract disease (FLUTD) as a case study.
  The proxy-based estimates show strong agreement with clinical data, with correlations of r = 0.74 for ingredient-level risk patterns and r = 0.82 for seasonal variation. Both data sources consistently capture elevated disease risk during winter months. Moreover, analysis using EC data alone reproduces established domain knowledge, including the association between higher wet food consumption and lower disease risk.
  Our results demonstrate that behavioral signals derived from large-scale EC data can serve as validated, cost-effective complements to traditional surveillance systems, and suggest broader applicability to monitoring lifestyle-related and chronic conditions.</description>

      <title>Fractional Diffusion on Graphs: Superposition of Laplacian Semigroups and Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14977v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subdiffusion on graphs is often modeled by time-fractional diffusion equations, yet its structural and dynamical consequences remain unclear. We show that subdiffusive transport on graphs is a memory-driven process generated by a random time change that compresses operational time, produces long-tailed waiting times, and breaks Markovianity while preserving linearity and mass conservation. We prove that Mittag-Leffler graph dynamics admit an exact convex, mass-preserving representation as a superposition of classical heat semigroups evaluated at rescaled times, revealing fractional diffusion as ordinary diffusion acting across multiple intrinsic time scales. This framework uncovers heterogeneous, vertex-dependent memory effects and induces transport biases absent in classical diffusion, including algebraic relaxation, degree-dependent waiting times, and early-time asymmetries between sources and neighbors. These features define a subdiffusive geometry on graphs enabling particles to locally discover global shortest paths while favoring high-degree regions. Finally, we show that time-fractional diffusion arises as a singular limit of multi-rate diffusion.</description>

      <title>Turning Citation Networks Inside Out: Studying Science Using Content-Based Knowledge Graphs from LLM-Derived Taxonomies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scientific fields are often mapped using citations and metadata, despite knowledge being transmitted primarily through content. We introduce an 'inside-out' approach that reconstructs field structure directly from text by representing each paper as a small set of interpretable knowledge components. Using a large language model to induce domain-specific taxonomies and label papers, each publication is encoded as a triplet of measure, data type, and research-question type. These triplets define a knowledge graph with edges weighted by shared papers. Applied to 617 studies on intergenerational wealth mobility, the graph reveals a stable methodological backbone centered on regression-based mobility measures, alongside substantial temporal variation in component recombination. We further utilize normalized betweenness-to-connectivity ratios to identify components and pairings that act as structural bridges disproportionate to their prevalence. This content-derived, taxonomy-driven mapping complements citation-based approaches by exposing the evolving architecture of methods, data, and questions that define a field.</description>

      <title>Computable Structuralism: A Categorical Rewrite Calculus of Mythic Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Structural approaches to myth and narrative are compelling in close reading but hard to compare across traditions, media, and scale. We propose a formal framework that renders L\'evi-Straussian transformation as mathematics while remaining readable as narrative analysis. Variants, superhero continuities, and franchise arcs are modeled as typed rewrite programs on a coupled two-register state $(X,Y)$, abstracting an everyday/social channel and a symbolic/legitimation channel. The canonical formula becomes coherence data: a natural transformation $\eta:U\Rightarrow V$ between update endofunctors, where $U$ updates each register in place and $V$ performs a swap+inversion. Context is internalized by operator choice, turning naturality into a corpus-facing type check: failures diagnose mis-specified oppositions or illegal transport; successes witness coherent structural models. Order effects are summarized by a five-value invariant (Key). We apply the method to 80 narratives (20 folktales, 20 religious myths, 20 superheroes, 20 franchises), each encoded as $(a,b,x,y)$ with a Key. 59/80 (74\%) explicitly name a normative constraint in $y$ (law, taboo, contract, prophecy), supporting the two-register abstraction. The result is a testable bridge between structural anthropology and cultural analytics: stories remain interpretable yet become transportable objects for computation, comparison, and falsifiable constraints on transformation.</description>

      <title>An Agentic Operationalization of DISARM for FIMI Investigation on Social Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interoperability of data and intelligence across allied partners and their respective end-user groups is considered a foundational enabler to the collective defense capability--both conventional and hybrid--of NATO countries. Foreign Information Manipulation and Interference (FIMI) and related hybrid activities are conducted across various societal dimensions and infospheres, posing an ever greater challenge to the characterization of threats, sustaining situational awareness, and response coordination. Recent advances in AI have further led to the decreasing cost of AI-augmented trolling and interference activities, such as through the generation and amplification of manipulative content. Despite the introduction of the DISARM framework as a standardized metadata and analytical framework for FIMI, operationalizing it at the scale of social media remains a challenge. We propose a framework-agnostic agent-based operationalization of DISARM to investigate FIMI on social media. We develop a multi-agent pipeline in which specialized agentic AI components collaboratively (1) detect candidate manipulative behaviors, and (2) map these behaviors onto standard DISARM taxonomies in a transparent manner. We evaluated the approach on two real-world datasets annotated by domain practitioners. We demonstrate that our approach is effective in scaling the predominantly manual and heavily interpretive work of FIMI analysis, providing a direct contribution to enhancing the situational awareness and data interoperability in the context of operating in media and information-rich settings.</description>

      <title>Loss Aversion Online: Emotional Responses to Financial Booms and Crashes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.14423v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Financial events negatively affect emotional well-being, but large-scale studies examining their impact on online emotional expression using real-time social media data remain limited. To address this gap, we propose analyzing Reddit communities (financial and non-financial) across two case studies: a financial crash and a boom. We investigate how emotional and psycholinguistic responses differ between financial and non-financial communities, and the extent to which the type of financial event affects user behavior during the two case study periods. To examine the effect of these events on expressed language, we analyze daily sentiment, emotion, and LIWC counts using quasi-experimental methods: Difference-in-Differences (DiD) and Causal Impact analyses during a financial boom and a financial crash. Overall, we find coherent, negative shifts in emotional responses during financial crashes, but weaker, mixed responses during booms, consistent with loss aversion. By exploring emotional and psycholinguistic expressions during financial events, we identify future implications for understanding online users' mental health and building connected, healthy communities.</description>

      <title>LoRAP: Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting for Quantized Graph Neural Networks Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15079v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are neural networks that aim to process graph data, capturing the relationships and interactions between nodes using the message-passing mechanism. GNN quantization has emerged as a promising approach for reducing model size and accelerating inference in resource-constrained environments. Compared to quantization in LLMs, quantizing graph features is more emphasized in GNNs. Inspired by the above, we propose to leverage prompt learning, which manipulates the input data, to improve the performance of quantization-aware training (QAT) for GNNs. To mitigate the issue that prompting the node features alone can only make part of the quantized aggregation result optimal, we introduce Low-Rank Aggregation Prompting (LoRAP), which injects lightweight, input-dependent prompts into each aggregated feature to optimize the results of quantized aggregations. Extensive evaluations on 4 leading QAT frameworks over 9 graph datasets demonstrate that LoRAP consistently enhances the performance of low-bit quantized GNNs while introducing a minimal computational overhead.</description>

      <title>Circadian Modulation of Semantic Exploration in Social Media Language</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15091v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Human cognition exhibits strong circadian modulation, yet its influence on high-dimensional semantic behavior remains poorly understood. Using large-scale Reddit data, we quantify time-of-day variation in language use by embedding text into a pretrained transformer model and measuring semantic entropy as an index of linguistic exploration-exploitation, for which we show a robust circadian rhythmicity that could be entrained by seasonal light cues. Distinguishing between local and global semantic entropy reveals a systematic temporal dissociation: local semantic exploration peaks in the morning, reflecting broader exploration of semantic space, whereas global semantic diversity peaks later in the day as submissions accumulate around already established topics, consistent with "rich-get-richer" dynamics. These patterns are not explained by sentiment or affective valence, indicating that semantic exploration captures a cognitive dimension distinct from mood. The observed temporal structure aligns with known diurnal patterns in neuromodulatory systems, suggesting that biological circadian rhythms extend to the semantic domain.</description>

      <title>Roll in the Tanks! Measuring Left-wing Extremism on Reddit at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06981v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Social media's role in the spread and evolution of extremism is a focus of intense study. Online extremists have been involved in the dissemination of online hate, mis- and disinformation, and real-world violence. While the majority of research has focused on right-wing extremism, recent real-world incidents have highlighted the potential for far-left extremists to engage in violence and cause real-world harm as well. In this paper, we present the first large-scale measurement of left-wing extremism on social media. Analyzing 1.3 million posts from 53,000 authors from tankie subreddits, we focus on ``tankies,'' a left-wing community that first arose in the 1950s in support of hardline actions of the USSR and has evolved to support what they call ``Actually Existing Socialist'' countries, e.g., CCP-run China, the USSR, and North Korea. Among other things, our analysis reveals that these groups occupy the periphery of the broader far-left community on Reddit, and their discourse distinctively focus on state-level politics and support for authoritarian regimes, rather than on social justice issues. Finally, we show that tankies have high toxicity scores and use pejorative language, mirroring toxicity patterns reported for other online extremist communities. Our findings provide empirical evidence of the distinct positioning and discourse of left-wing extremist groups on social media.</description>

      <title>Opinion Dynamics with Multiple Adversaries</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Opinion dynamics models how the publicly expressed opinions of users in a social network coevolve according to their neighbors as well as their own intrinsic opinion. Motivated by the real-world manipulation of social networks during the 2016 US elections and the 2019 Hong Kong protests, a growing body of work models the effects of a strategic actor who interferes with the network to induce disagreement or polarization. We lift the assumption of a single strategic actor by introducing a model in which any subset of network users can manipulate network outcomes. They do so by acting according to a fictitious intrinsic opinion. Strategic actors can have conflicting goals, and push competing narratives. We characterize the Nash Equilibrium of the resulting meta-game played by the strategic actors. Experiments on real-world social network datasets from Twitter, Reddit, and Political Blogs show that strategic agents can significantly increase polarization and disagreement, as well as increase the "cost" of the equilibrium. To this end, we give worst-case upper bounds on the Price of Misreporting (analogous to the Price of Anarchy). Finally, we give efficient learning algorithms for the platform to (i) detect whether strategic manipulation has occurred, and (ii) learn who the strategic actors are. Our algorithms are accurate on the same real-world datasets, suggesting how platforms can take steps to mitigate the effects of strategic behavior.</description>

      <title>Whom We Trust, What We Fear: COVID-19 Fear and the Politics of Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20146v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic triggered not only a global health crisis but also an infodemic, an overload of information from diverse sources influencing public perception and emotional responses. In this context, fear emerged as a central emotional reaction, shaped by both media exposure and demographic factors. In this study, we analyzed the relationship between individuals' self-reported levels of fear about COVID-19 and the information sources they rely on, across nine source categories, including medical experts, government institutions, media, and personal networks. In particular, we defined a score that ranks fear levels based on self-reported concerns about the pandemic, collected through the Delphi CTIS survey in the United States between May 2021 and June 2022. We found that both fear levels and information source usage closely follow COVID-19 infection trends, exhibit strong correlations within each group (fear levels across sources are strongly correlated, as are patterns of source usage), and vary significantly across demographic groups, particularly by age and education. Applying causal inference methods, we found that among age, education, and information source, the latter is the most influential factor affecting individuals' fear levels. We further quantified the impact of different information sources on fear by estimating the average treatment effect, indicating how each source alters fear relative to a control. Furthermore, we demonstrated that information source preferences can reliably match the political orientation of U.S. states. These findings highlight the importance of information ecosystem dynamics in shaping emotional and behavioral responses during large-scale crises.</description>

      <title>Do We Really Need SFT? Prompt-as-Policy over Knowledge Graphs for Cold-start Next POI Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.08012v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Next point-of-interest (POI) recommendation is a key component of smart urban services, yet it remains challenging under cold-start conditions with sparse user-POI interactions. Recent LLM-based methods address this issue through either supervised fine-tuning (SFT) or in-context learning (ICL), but SFT is costly and prone to overfitting active users, while static prompts in ICL lack adaptability to diverse user contexts. We argue that the main limitation lies not in LLM reasoning ability, but in how contextual evidence is constructed and presented. Accordingly, we propose Prompt-as-Policy over knowledge graphs (KG), a reinforcement-guided prompting framework that formulates prompt construction as a learnable decision process, while keeping the LLM frozen as a reasoning engine. To enable structured prompt optimization, we organize heterogeneous user-POI signals into a KG and transform mined relational paths into evidence cards, which serve as atomic semantic units for prompt composition. A contextual bandit learner then optimizes a prompt policy that adaptively determines (i) which relational evidences to include, (ii) how many evidences to retain per candidate POI, and (iii) how to organize and order them within the prompt. Experiments on three real-world datasets show that Prompt-as-Policy consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving an average 11.87% relative improvement in Acc@1 for inactive users, while maintaining competitive performance for active users, without any model fine-tuning.</description>
