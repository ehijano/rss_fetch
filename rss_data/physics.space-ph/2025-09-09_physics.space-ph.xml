      <title>Magnetic Field and Plasma Asymmetries Between the Martian Quasi-Perpendicular and Quasi-Parallel Magnetosheaths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07119v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Martian magnetosheath acts as a conduit for mass and energy transfer between the upstream solar wind and its induced magnetosphere. However, our understanding of its global properties remains limited. Using nine years of data from NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN (MAVEN) mission, we performed a quantitative statistical analysis to explore the spatial distribution of the magnetic fields, solar wind and planetary ions in the magnetosheath. We discovered significant asymmetries in the magnetic field, solar wind protons, and planetary ions between the quasi-perpendicular and quasi-parallel magnetosheaths. The asymmetries in the Martian magnetosheath exhibit both similarities and differences compared to those in the Earth's and Venus' magnetosheaths. These results indicate that the Martian magnetosheath is distinctly shaped by both shock geometry and planetary ions.</description>

      <title>A polynomial-based Monte Carlo approach for estimating long-term collision probabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a versatile approach for computing the risk of collision specifically tailored for scenarios featuring low relative encounter velocities, but with potential applicability across a wide range of situations. The technique employs Differential Algebra (DA) to express the non-linear dynamical flow of the initial distribution in the primary-secondary objects relative motion through high-order Taylor polynomials. The entire initial uncertainty set is subdivided into subsets through Automatic Domain Splitting (ADS) techniques to control the accuracy of the Taylor expansions. The methodology samples the initial conditions of the relative state and evaluates the polynomial expansions for each sample while retaining their temporal dependency. The classical numerical integration of the initial statistics over the set of conditions for which a collision occurs is thus reduced to an evaluation of mono-dimensional time polynomials. Specifically, samples reaching a relative distance below a critical value are identified along with the time at which this occurs. The approach is tested against a Monte Carlo (MC) simulation for various literature test cases, yielding accurate results and a consistent gain in computational time.</description>

      <title>Comparing Simulated and Observed Particle Energy Distributions through Magnetic Reconnection in Earth's Magnetotail</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic reconnection is an explosive process that accelerates particles to high energies in Earth's magnetosphere, offering a unique natural laboratory to study this phenomenon. We performed fully kinetic 2D simulations of a reconnection event observed by the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission and compared the resulting ion and electron energy distributions with observations. The simulations capture the overall shape and evolution of non-thermal energy distributions for both species, but generally underestimate the very-high-energy tail of the electron spectrum. Variations in numerical parameters have negligible effects on the resulting spectra, while the initial upstream temperatures instead play a critical role in reproducing the observed distributions. This work presents a novel analysis of particle acceleration in fully kinetic modeling of reconnection directly informed by observed, realistic parameters; highlights the limitations of 2D simulations and underlines the need for more realistic simulations (e.g. employing 3D setups) to capture the observed particle energization more accurately.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing the Sun's Alfv\'en surface and wind braking torque with Parker Solar Probe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07088v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Alfv\'en surface -- where the solar wind exceeds the local Alfv\'en speed as it expands into interplanetary space -- is now routinely probed by NASA's Parker Solar Probe (PSP) in the near-Sun environment. The size of the Alfv\'en surface governs how efficiently the solar wind braking torque causes the Sun to spin-down. We aimed to characterise the size and evolution of the Alfv\'en surface as magnetic activity increased during solar cycle 25. The Alfv\'en surface was extrapolated from the solar wind mass and magnetic flux measured by the SWEAP and FIELDS instrument suites onboard PSP. We accounted for the acceleration of the solar wind along Parker spiral magnetic field lines and used potential field source surface modelling to determine the sources of the solar wind. The longitudinally averaged Alfv\'en radius measured by PSP grew from 11 to 16 solar radii as solar activity increased. Accordingly, the solar wind angular momentum-loss rate grew from $\sim$1.4$\times 10^{30}$ erg to 3$\times 10^{30}$ erg. Both the radial and longitudinal scans of the solar wind contained fluctuations of 10-40\% from the average Alfv\'en radius in each encounter. Structure in the solar corona influenced the morphology of the Alfv\'en surface, which was smallest around the heliospheric current sheet and pseudostreamers. The Alfv\'en surface was highly structured and time-varying however, at large-scales, organised by the coronal magnetic field. The evolution of the solar corona over the solar cycle systematically shifted the magnetic connectivity of PSP and influenced our perception of the Alfv\'en surface. The Alfv\'en surface was 30\% larger than both thermally-driven and Alfv\'en wave-driven wind simulations with the same mass-loss rate and open magnetic flux, but had a similar dependence on the wind magnetisation parameter.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Rays on Galaxy Scales: Progress and Pitfalls for CR-MHD Dynamical Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07104v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen many arguments for cosmic rays (CRs) as an important influence on galactic and circumgalactic (CGM) physics, star and galaxy formation. We present a pedagogical overview of state-of-the-art modeling of CR-magnetohydrodynamics (CR-MHD) on macro scales (~kpc), highlighting their fundamental dependence on the micro (&lt; au) scales of CR gyro orbits and meso (~pc) scales of CR mean-free-paths, intended to connect the extragalactic, Galactic, and plasma CR transport modeling communities. We note the pitfalls and systematic errors that arise from older assumptions in CR modeling, including: use of a simple Fokker-Planck equation or ad-hoc two-moment formalisms for transport; assumption of leaky boxes or plane-parallel or shear-periodic boundaries for comparison to local interstellar medium (LISM) observations; ignoring detailed LISM constraints on CR spectra (e.g. focusing only on extragalactic observables or spectrally integrated models); assuming CR transport is mediated by classical models of advection, streaming from self-confinement (super-Alfvenic or Alfvenic), or extrinsic turbulence. We emphasize recent progress addressing these: development of rigorously-derived CR-MHD equations; use of global, 3D galaxy+halo models for LISM comparisons; new methods for full-spectrum dynamics; novel models for intermittent scattering and/or new drivers. We compile extragalactic+LISM observations to show how ~GeV CR transport is being rapidly constrained in the CGM, and present phenomenological models which can be used in future simulations. We conclude by highlighting critical open questions for micro, meso, and macro-scale CR-MHD simulations.</description>

      <title>Imaging and Radio Signatures of Shock-Plasmoid Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding how shocks interact with coronal structures is crucial for understanding the mechanisms of particle acceleration in the solar corona and inner heliosphere. Using simultaneous radio and white-light observations, we investigate the interaction between a CME-driven shock and a plasmoid. LASCO and STEREO-A COR-2 white-light images are analyzed to track the evolution of the plasmoid, CME and its associated shock, while the Wind/WAVES and STEREO/WAVES dynamic spectra provide complementary radio signatures of the shock-plasmoid interaction at $\approx$7 R$_\odot$. An interplanetary Type II radio burst was detected as the shock propagated through the plasmoid. The merging of the plasmoid into the CME was accompanied by interplanetary Type III radio bursts, suggesting escaping electron beams during the reconnection process. These observations clearly demonstrate that shock-plasmoid interactions can enhance the efficiency of particle acceleration associated with CMEs, with implications for electron acceleration in flare and heliospheric current sheets as well.</description>

      <title>The Integrating Miniature Piggyback for Impulsive Solar Hard X-rays (IMPISH): a spectrometer for the GRIPS-2 balloon campaign</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.07156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Integrating Miniature Piggyback for Impulsive Solar Hard X-rays (IMPISH) is a piggyback mission originally designed for the second flight of the Gamma-Ray Imager/Polarimeter for Solar flares (GRIPS-2) Antarctic balloon. IMPISH will take measurements of collimated, full-Sun X-ray spectra with the goal of detecting sub-second variations (order of tens of milliseconds) of nonthermal X-ray emission during the impulsive phase of large solar flares to probe particle acceleration mechanisms driven by magnetic reconnection.
  The IMPISH detector system, made up of four identical detectors totaling 64 cm$^2$ effective area, is capable of measuring from ~10 keV to over 200 keV through the use of silicon photomultipliers (SiPMs) and LYSO scintillators. At the stratospheric altitude of GRIPS-2, the effective lower energy limit is ~20-30 keV. The geometry of the LYSO crystal has been optimized to balance the light collection efficiency with the effective area required for stratospheric X-ray measurements. Development of the IMPISH detectors has introduced a path for a low-cost solution to fast solar X-ray measurements across a large energy range utilizing commercially available components. The payload has a 3U form factor and has been designed so that both the electronics and detectors may be easily adaptable for space-based missions.</description>

      <title>Contemporaneous Appearances of Auroral Spiral and Transpolar Arc: Polar UVI Observations and Global MHD Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.06389</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.06389v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A local vortex-structured aurora and a large-scale transpolar arc (TPA) were contemporaneously observed by the Polar ultraviolet imager (UVI) when a substorm almost recovered, and the associated interplanetary magnetic field (IMF)BY and BZ polarities were negative and negative-to-positive. The TPA grew along the dawnside auroral oval from the nightside to the dayside, and an auroral spiral and several spots were located azimuthally near the poleward edge of the nightside auroral oval. Both auroras had tailward elongated source regions with scales of ~30 RE (spiral) and more than ~45 RE (TPA). To examine their magnetospheric and ionospheric field-aligned current (FAC) profiles, we performed global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations, using two different types of code: Block-Adaptive-Tree Solar-wind Roe Upwind Scheme (BATS-R-US) and improved REProduce Plasma Universe (REPPU). Both MHD simulations reproduced the tailward elongated TPA-associated FAC structures. The spiral-associated FAC intensity was, however, approximately three orders of magnitude weaker than the TPA-associated FAC intensity. Only improved REPPU simulation replicated faint but continuous poleward extending streak-like structures without evident FACs, instead of the auroral spiral. Geomagnetic field measurements showed that the spiral had upward (from the ionosphere to the magnetosphere) FACs, and its appearance might be accompanied by ultra-low-frequency Pc5 waves. Our results suggest that 1) a local-scale spiral might be formed with much weaker magnetotail FACs than global-scale TPA-associated FACs, although the spiral source region is elongated tailward, and 2) a solar wind-magnetosphere-ionosphere coupling system with minimal or no significant substorm effects is required to form the spiral with the weak magnetotail FACs.</description>
