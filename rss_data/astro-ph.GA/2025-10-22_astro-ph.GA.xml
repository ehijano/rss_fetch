      <title>Evolutionary Tracks and Spectral Properties of Quasi-stars and Their Correlation with Little Red Dots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a population of red, compact, high-redshift (${z\sim3-10}$) objects referred to as ``Little Red Dots'' (LRDs). These objects exhibit unusual spectral features reminiscent of stellar spectra with blackbody-like SEDs, large hydrogen Balmer breaks, Balmer line absorption, and classical stellar absorption features such as calcium H&amp;K and the calcium triplet. Following the recent suggestion that these may be actively accreting direct-collapse black holes in the process of assembly, i.e. quasi-stars, we present evolutionary models of quasi-stars using our recently released, publicly available MESA-QUEST modeling framework. We compute a grid of models spanning a range of black hole masses and predict the luminosities, temperatures, surface gravities, and lifetimes of these objects. We find that these models lie along a Hayashi track once they hit their ``late-stage'' which constitutes the majority of their lives ($\sim 20$~Myr). We present scaling relations for estimating the mass of a quasi-star as a function of the bolometric luminosity, as well as the bolometric luminosity as a function of the effective temperature for the Hayashi track. The short lifetimes in tandem with the observed number density of LRDs imply the possibility that every supermassive black hole was once a quasi-star. We compare synthetic spectra of our quasi-star models to observations of LRDs, and show that these models are broadly capable of reproducing the continuum spectra of observed LRDs. These results indicate that quasi-stars are promising candidates for the origin of supermassive black holes via direct collapse in the early universe.</description>

      <title>Rise of the forsaken relics: connecting present-day stellar streams and phase-mixed galaxies to the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17968</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17968v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The `near-far' approach to studying reionization leverages the star formation histories of the Milky Way (MW) or Local Group (LG) galaxies, derived from resolved photometry, to infer the low-mass/faint-end of the stellar mass functions (SMFs) or the ultraviolet luminosity functions (UVLFs) of high-redshift galaxies ($z \gtrsim 6$), beyond the current JWST detection limits ($M_{\mathrm{UV}} \gtrsim -15$). Previous works considered only intact low-mass galaxies in the MW and LG, neglecting disrupted galaxies such as stellar streams and phase-mixed objects. Using the FIRE-2 simulations, we show that these disrupted galaxies contribute up to $\sim50\%$ of the total stellar mass budget of the proto-MW/LG at $z =6-9$. Including all the progenitors of these disrupted galaxies improves the normalization of the recovered SMFs/UVLFs by factors of $\sim2-3$ and reduces the halo-to-halo variation in the slope by $\sim20-40\%$. This enables robust constraints down to at least the resolution limit of the simulations, near $M_\star$ $\sim$ $10^{5}$ $M_\odot$ or $M_{\mathrm{UV}} \sim -10$ at $z \gtrsim 6$. We also show that `fossil record' reconstructions - which assume each present-day system descends from a single reionization-era progenitor - are sensitive to the stellar mass/UV magnitude thresholds, which introduces bias in the inferred low-mass/faint-end slopes. Additionally, we demonstrate that neglecting disrupted systems underestimates the contribution of galaxies with $M_{\mathrm{UV}} \lesssim -15$ to the reionization-era UV luminosity density. Finally, we estimate that a significant fraction ($\sim50\%$) of streams with $M_\star$ $\gtrsim$ $10^{6}$ $M_\odot$ at $z=0$ should be detectable from upcoming Rubin Observatory and Roman Space Telescope observations.</description>

      <title>Testing the Stellar Feedback-driven Breathing Mode in Low-mass Galaxies with Gas Kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hydrodynamic simulations have proposed that stellar feedback and bursty star-formation can produce dark matter cores in low-mass galaxies. A key prediction is that feedback-driven gas outflow and inflow cycles can lead to ``breathing modes'' (rapid fluctuations in the global gravitational potential) which drive correlated variations in galaxy size, kinematics, and star-formation rate. In this paper, we test the dynamical effects of feedback-driven breathing modes using a sample of 103 star-forming low-mass galaxies with stellar masses between $7.9&lt;\rm \log M_*/M_\odot&lt;9.6$ and $0.02&lt;z&lt;0.19$. We measure ionized gas velocity dispersions from H$\alpha$ emission lines and compare them to mock observations from the FIRE-2 simulations. We compare gas velocity dispersions ($\rm \sigma_{gas}$), stellar masses, and specific star-formation rates (sSFR). We find a positive correlation between gas velocity dispersion residuals at fixed stellar masses ($\rm \Delta\sigma_{gas}$) and sSFR in both data and simulations. However, the relation is tighter in FIRE-2 compared to the data. FIRE-2 produces more low-sSFR galaxies compared to our observational sample, however, the sSFR distributions agree after limiting both samples to a minimum sSFR. A deeper and more complete photometric sample further indicates that observed low-mass galaxies could span the full range of sSFR predicted in the FIRE-2 simulations. Our results support the existence of short-timescale dynamical effects driven by gas outflow and inflow cycles in low-mass galaxies and motivate additional tests of the breathing mode.</description>

      <title>Formation Of Sub-Structure In Luminous Submillimeter galaxies (FOSSILS): Evidence of Multiple Pathways to Trigger Starbursts in Luminous Submillimeter Galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of rest-frame optical and far-infrared continuum emission in three luminous submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at $3.0\lesssim z\lesssim4.5$. The SMGs are spatially resolved down to 400-500 pc ($\sim0.05$'') resolution by James Webb Space telescope (JWST) and Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations. Despite similarities in their observed far-infrared properties (flux density, infrared luminosity, and effective radius), the three SMGs exhibit heterogeneous morphologies both across wavelengths and among the sources themselves. While two of them (AzTEC-4 and AzTEC-8) show a disk-like structure in optical continuum, AzTEC-1 is dominated by highly concentrated component with the S\'{e}rsic index of $n=5.4$, where its far-infrared continuum emission is clumpy and less concentrated. AzTEC-4, which is confirmed to be at $z=4.198$, shows a two-arm spiral of dust, but not in the stellar distribution. These three SMGs exemplify that multiple physical mechanisms exist in triggering starbursts in luminous SMGs at high redshift: secular instability in gas disks (AzTEC-4) in addition to possible minor mergers (AzTEC-8), and a combination of the efficient gas supply to the central core induced by a gas-rich major merger and the reformation of cold gas disk (AzTEC-1).</description>

      <title>Time-evolving diagnostic of the ionized absorbers in NGC 4051. I. High-resolution time-averaged spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a high-resolution X-ray spectroscopic study of the Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4051 using two XMM-Newton high-resolution Reflection Grating Spectrometer (RGS) observations. The spectra reveal three distinct layers of photoionized gas flowing outward from the central black hole: a low-ionization phase (LIP), a higher-ionization phase (HIP), and a high-velocity and high ionization phase (HVIP). Each absorber leaves characteristic imprints on the soft X-ray spectrum. While the LIP and HVIP are fully consistent with being in ionization equilibrium with the central radiation field over the course of the $\sim$250 ks spanned by the two observations, the HIP shows a significant change in ionization ($3.8\sigma$), suggesting non-equilibrium. By modeling the two spectra with our time-dependent photoionization code (TEPID), we constrain the density of the HIP gas to $\log n_{\rm H}=7.7^{+0.2}_{-0.9}$ and estimate its distance to be about $R=0.45^{+0.80}_{-0.09}$ light-days from the black hole, corresponding to $R=4000^{+7000}_{-800}$ gravitational radii. In contrast, the narrow soft X-ray emission lines remain constant, consistent with an origin in the more extended narrow-line region. Our results show the value of combining high-resolution and time-resolved spectroscopy to probe the structure, physical conditions, and variability of AGN outflows.</description>

      <title>Extraplanar emission in isolated edge-on late-type galaxies.II. The H$\alpha$ kinematics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isolated galaxies are rare yet invaluable for studying secular evolution, as their physical properties can remain largely unaffected by external influences for several billion years, primarily shaped by internal evolutionary processes. This study focuses on a representative sample of nearly edge-on ($i\geq80^{\circ}$) late-type galaxies selected from the Catalogue of Isolated Galaxies (CIG). We analyse the H$\alpha$ kinematics derived from Fabry-Perot data and integrate these findings with a comprehensive examination of the UV, optical, and FIR properties of these galaxies to study their dynamic evolutionary processes. We investigate the individual kinematics by computing rotation curves and dynamical masses for each galaxy in the sample. The accuracy of our kinematic results is confirmed through comparisons with HI data and by applying the B- and K-band Tully-Fisher relationships. Among the galaxies studied, we observed a rotational lag along the $z$-axis in half of the total sample (7 out of 14 cases), with an average lag ($\Delta V/\Delta z=32.0\pm10.6\,{\rm km\,s^{-1}\,pc^{-1}}$) consistent with previous research findings. Notably, not all galaxies exhibiting measurable lag display morphological extraplanar components, leading us to conclude that this cannot serve as a definitive marker for the extraplanar Diffuse Ionized Gas (eDIG) component. While we found no significant correlations between rotation lag and overall galaxy properties, there seems to be a potential correlation with tidal strength. Based on the kinematic characteristics observed in our sample, we suggest that that the extended disc gas likely originates from interactions with the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) rather than arising internally within the galaxies themselves.</description>

      <title>The Photometric Analysis of the Environment Around Two Dusty Star-Forming Galaxies at $z \sim 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Studying the environments of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) provides insight into whether these luminous systems are reliable signposts of large-scale overdensities. Evidence suggests that individual DSFGs can trace overdense environments, although this association may not be universal. To test this, we investigate the environments surrounding two luminous, gravitationally-lensed DSFGs (SDP.17b at $z_\text{spec} = 2.3049$ and HELMS-55 at $z_\text{spec} = 2.2834$). Using Gemini South Flamingos-2 (F2) $K_s$-band imaging together with ancillary Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam and Hubble Space Telescope multi-band photometry, we obtain photometric redshifts, $z_\text{phot}$, as well as star formation rates and stellar mass estimates for companion galaxies of the DSFGs. At least $5\pm2$ and $15\pm3$ companion galaxies exist with consistent $z_\text{phot}$ ($dz \leq 0.2$) within a projected separation of 5.5 cMpc of SDP.17b and HELMS-55, respectively. These correspond to galaxy overdensities of $\delta = 0.1 \pm 0.2$ and ${\delta} =1.0 \pm 0.3$, with significances of $(0.2 \pm 0.4)\sigma$ and $(2.2 \pm 0.6) \sigma$, respectively. On the $M_{\rm H_2}$-overdensity-significance plane, HELMS-55 may follow the positive correlation between the gas mass and the overdensity significance, while SDP.17b lies well above the relation despite its large gas reservoir, making it a potential outlier. Based on this study of two DSFGs, our photometric analysis suggests that DSFGs can trace the outskirts of protoclusters or associated large-scale structures. However, our small sample prevents firm conclusions about their ability to pinpoint dense cluster cores. Future multi-object spectroscopic observations are required to confirm the membership and star formation properties of the companion galaxies.</description>

      <title>Milky Way Mass Through Escape Velocity Curve from LAMOST K Giants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Escape velocity has long been used to constrain the mass of the Dark Matter (DM) halo in the Milky Way (MW). Here we present a study of the escape velocity curve using a sample of high-velocity K giants with full 6D phase-space information and relatively good quality, selected from LAMOST DR8 and cross-matched with Gaia DR3. To expand the high-velocity stars to larger distances, we used radius-dependent criteria of total velocity, that is, $v_{\rm GC}&gt;300\;\rm{km s^{-1}}$ for the solar neighborhood; $v_{\rm GC}&gt;v_{\rm min}\sim0.6\times v_{\rm esc}(r_{\rm GC})$ for outer region. We also selected halo stars based on $v_{\phi}-{\rm [Fe/H]}$ information to ensure that the sample is isotropic. We modeled the velocity distribution with traditional power-law models to determine the escape velocity in each radial bin. For the first time, we have directly measured a relatively continuous escape velocity curve that can extend to Galactocentric radii of $\sim 50$ kpc, finding a decline in agreement with previous studies. The escape velocity at the solar position yielded by our measurements is $523.74^{+12.83}_{-13.47}\;\rm{km s^{-1}}$. Combined with the local circular velocity, we estimated the mass of the MW assuming a Navarro-Frenk-White DM profile, which resulted in a total mass of $M_{200,\;\rm{total}}=0.90_{-0.07}^{+0.06}\times 10^{12}\;M_{\odot}$, with a concentration of $c_{200}=13.47_{-1.70}^{+1.85}$. The small uncertainty implies that including the escape velocities beyond the solar neighborhood can result in a more precise mass estimate. Our derived MW mass is consistent with some recent studies using the escape velocity as well as other tracers, which may support a lower mass of the DM halo than in the past.</description>

      <title>The ALPINE-CRISTAL-JWST Survey: Stellar and nebular dust attenuation of main-sequence galaxies at z~4-6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18248v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Characterizing dust attenuation is crucial for revealing the intrinsic physical properties of galaxies. We present an analysis of dust attenuation in 18 spectroscopically confirmed star-forming main-sequence galaxies at $z = 4.4-5.7$ observed with JWST/NIRSpec IFU and NIRCam, selected from the ALPINE and CRISTAL ALMA large programs. We fit the emission line fluxes from NIRSpec and the broad-band photometry from NIRCam with Prospector, using both spatially integrated emission and $\sim0.6$ kpc pixel-by-pixel measurements. We derive the stellar-to-nebular dust attenuation ratio ($f=E(B-V)_{\mathrm{star}}/E(B-V)_{\mathrm{neb}}$) from the SED fits and the Balmer decrement with H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$. Although individual galaxies show large scatter, the best-fit value is $f = 0.51^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$, slightly higher than that measured for local starburst galaxies. We find weak correlations of $f$ with galaxy properties, increasing with higher specific star-formation rates, younger stellar ages, and more recent star-formation. For the range of $E(B-V)_{\mathrm{star}} = 0.009-0.15$ mag for in our sample, assuming $f = 1$ (often adopted in high-redshift studies) instead of $f = 0.51$ underestimate line luminosities and ionizing photon production efficiency $\xi_\text{ion}$ by $\sim3-36\%$ and $\sim4-46\%$, respectively. We also find that the total stellar masses estimated from spatially-integrated SED fits with a delayed-$\tau$ star-formation histories are systematically smaller than the sum of pixel-by-pixel SED fits, with a median offset of $\sim 0.26$ dex, likely because the integrated fits are biased toward luminous young stellar populations.</description>

      <title>On the consistency of jet feedback modelling across different astrophysics hydrodynamical codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) feedback is essential in cosmological simulations of galaxy formation, yet its implementation has to rely on subgrid models due to limited resolution. We present a novel subgrid jet-launching method for galaxy formation simulations and implement it in three hydrodynamical codes: the smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) code SWIFT, the moving-mesh code AREPO, and the Eulerian grid code PLUTO. To isolate the impact of hydrodynamical solvers on jet evolution, we compare idealised jets and their remnants in uniform and stratified media across resolutions and jet parameters. In uniform media, all jets drive bow shocks, inflate hot lobes, exhibit backflows, and evolve self-similarly. For the parameters explored, SWIFT lobes are shorter, wider, and hotter; AREPO lobes are longer, thinner, and cooler; while PLUTO lobes display complex flows with intermediate characteristics. In stratified media, jets deviate from self-similar evolution, inflating longer and thinner lobes due to lower external ram pressure. After switch-off, SWIFT jets evolve into smooth cylindrical bubbles, AREPO jets produce long filamentary remnants, and PLUTO jets yield intermediate-length remnants with varying degrees of mixing. Despite such differences, all jets and remnants have a similar impact on the ambient medium. We conclude that variations in lobe properties between codes emerge even for identical subgrid prescriptions, since the coupling of jet feedback to resolvable scales and the effective resolution depend on the hydrodynamical method. In structure formation simulations, these solver differences are likely subdominant to uncertainties in subgrid modelling and calibration, while averaging over galaxy populations may lessen their impact.</description>

Abstract: Thermal dust is the major polarized foreground hindering the detection of primordial CMB B-modes. Its signal presents a complex behavior in frequency space inherited from the joint variation in our Galaxy of the orientation of magnetic fields and of the spectral properties of dust grains aligned with magnetic field lines. In this work, we present a new framework for analyzing the thermal dust signal using polarized microwave data. We introduce residual maps, represented as complex quantities, that capture deviations of the local polarized SED from the mean complex SED averaged over the sky mask. We make simple predictions that relate the values of the statistical correlation and covariances between the residual maps to the physical properties of the emitting aligned grains. The validation or falsification of these predictions provide valuable information on the nature of the dust signal. We confront our predictions with Planck data over a 97% mask excluding the inner Galactic plane. Despite its simplicity, our model captures a significant part of the statistical properties of the data. The spectral dependence of the covariances between residual maps is, for the Sroll2 version of the data, compatible with a dust model assuming only temperature variations rather than spectral index variations, while it is incompatible with either of them for the PR4 Planck official release. Our methodology can be used to analyze future high precision polarization data and build more accurate dust models to be used by the CMB community.</description>

      <title>The selection function of the Gaia DR3 open cluster census</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Open clusters are among the most useful and widespread tracers of Galactic structure. The completeness of the Galactic open cluster census, however, remains poorly understood. For the first time ever, we establish the selection function of an entire open cluster census, publishing our results as an open-source Python package for use by the community. Our work is valid for the Hunt &amp; Reffert catalogue of clusters in Gaia DR3. We developed and open-sourced our cluster simulator from our first work. Then, we performed 80,590 injection and retrievals of simulated open clusters to test the Hunt &amp; Reffert catalogue's sensitivity. We fit a logistic model of cluster detectability that depends only on a cluster's number of stars, median parallax error, Gaia data density, and a user-specified significance threshold. We find that our simple model accurately predicts cluster detectability, with a 94.53\% accuracy on our training data that is comparable to a machine-learning based model with orders of magnitude more parameters. Our model itself offers numerous insights on why certain clusters are detected. We briefly use our model to show that cluster detectability depends on non-intuitive parameters, such as a cluster's proper motion, and we show that even a modest 25 km/s boost to a cluster's orbital speed can result in an almost 3$\times$ higher detection probability, depending on its position. In addition, we publish our raw cluster injection and retrievals and cluster memberships, which could be used for a number of other science cases -- such as estimating cluster membership incompleteness. Using our results, selection effect-corrected studies are now possible with the open cluster census. Our work will enable a number of brand new types of study, such as detailed comparisons between the Milky Way's cluster census and recent extragalactic cluster samples.</description>

      <title>A Census of Double-Peaked Lyman-alpha Emitters in MAGPI: Classification, Global Characteristics, and Spatially Resolved Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Double-peaked Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) profiles provide critical insights into gas kinematics and the distribution of neutral hydrogen (HI) from the interstellar to the intergalactic medium (ISM to IGM), and serve as valuable diagnostics of ionising Lyman continuum (LyC) photon escape. We present a study of the global and spatially resolved properties of double-peaked Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) based on VLT/MUSE data from the MAGPI survey. From a parent sample of 417 LAEs at z = 2.9 - 6.6 in the first 35 fields, we identify 108 double-peaked LAEs using an automated peak classification technique. We measure a double-peak fraction of $\sim37\%$ at $z &lt; 4$, decreasing to $\sim14\%$ at $z &gt; 4$, likely due to enhanced IGM attenuation. Approximately $17\%$ of the double-peaked LAEs are blue-dominated, suggesting gas inflows. The blue-to-total flux ratio exhibits a luminosity dependence: fainter lines generally show higher blue flux, though some luminous sources also show strong blue peaks. We find a narrowing of the red peak at $z &gt; 4$, despite the presence of the blue peak, indicating intrinsic galaxy evolution rather than IGM attenuation. Several LAEs exhibit residual flux in the absorption trough, with normalised trough flux anticorrelating with peak separation, reflecting variations in HI column density. We further investigate spatially resolved properties of ten red-dominated LAEs with extended Ly$\alpha$ halos. Despite azimuthal variations, both the blue-to-total flux ratio and normalised trough flux density increase with radius, while peak separation decreases. The red peak asymmetry shows only minor radial changes. These trends are consistent with variations in shell outflow velocity and HI column density across the halos. Based on peak separation, red peak asymmetry, and residual trough flux, we identify five LAEs as strong LyC-leaker candidates.</description>

      <title>Head-tail molecular clouds falling onto the Milky Way disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report discovery of two CO clouds which are likely falling down to the Galactic plane at more than $35$ km s$^{-1}$. The clouds show head-tail distributions elongated perpendicular to the Galactic plane at $l=331.6^{\circ}$ and $b=0^{\circ}$ as revealed by an analysis of the Mopra CO $J=$1-0 survey data. We derived the distance of the clouds to be $2.46 \pm 0.18$ kpc based on the Gaia Data Release 3. The CO clouds have molecular masses of $4.8\times 10^3\ M_{\odot}$ and $3.5\times 10^3\ M_{\odot}$, respectively, and show kinetic temperature of 30-50 K as derived from the line intensities of the $^{13}$CO $J$=2-1, $^{12}$CO $J$=1-0, and $^{13}$CO $J$=1-0 emission. The temperature in the heads of the clouds is significantly higher than 10 K of the typical molecular clouds, although no radiative heat source is found inside or close to the clouds. Based on the results, we interpret that the present clouds are falling onto the Milky Way disk and are significantly heated up by the strong shock interaction with the disk HI gas. We suggest that the clouds represent part of the HI intermediate velocity clouds falling to the Galactic plane which were converted into molecular clouds by shock compression. This is the first case of falling CO clouds having direct observed signatures of the falling motion including clear directivity and shock heating. Possible implications of the CO clouds in the evolution of the Galactic interstellar medium are discussed.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Repeating Transitions in 25 Changing-look Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The repeating changing-look active galactic nuclei (RCL AGNs) exhibit multiple appearances and disappearances of broad emission lines (BELs), whose underlying mechanism remains a puzzle. Expanding the sample of RCL AGNs is valuable for constraining the transition timescale and probing the accretion physics driving CL behaviors. This study aims to identify RCL AGNs using the multi-epoch spectroscopic data of confirmed CL AGNs from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope, and Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument, supplemented with mid-infrared (MIR) light curves. Through selection criteria and visual inspection, we identify 25 RCL AGNs among 331 CL AGNs, corresponding to an occurrence rate of about $8\%$, indicating that repeated transitions are not rare in CL AGNs. Among the 25 RCL AGNs, 19 are newly identified, which significantly expands the known RCL AGN sample. Based on the spectra and densely sampled MIR light curves, we derive reliable turn-on transition timescales for 19 RCL AGNs, and find no significant correlation between the timescale and the black hole mass.</description>

      <title>GLEAM-300: The GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) survey at 300 MHz</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18511v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we present a wide-field radio survey at 300 MHz covering the sky from $-90^\circ \leq \delta_\text{J2000} \lesssim +40^\circ$ using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). This 300-MHz survey follows the Galactic and Extragalactic All-sky MWA (GLEAM) survey, and provides an additional comparatively high-frequency data point to existing multi-frequency (72-231 MHz) data. With this data release we provide mosaic images and a catalogue of compact source components. We use two-minute snapshot observations covering 2015-2016, combining overlapping two-minute snapshot images to provide full-sensitivity mosaic images with a median root-mean-square noise of $9.1_{-2.8}^{+5.5}$ mJy beam$^{-1}$ and median angular resolution of $128.8^{\prime\prime} \times 112.5^{\prime\prime}$, with some position-dependent variation. We find a total of 338 080 unique Gaussian components across the mosaic images. The survey is the first at 300 MHz from the MWA covering the whole Southern Hemisphere. It provides a unique spectral data point that complements the existing GLEAM survey and the ongoing GLEAM-eXtended survey, and points toward results from the upcoming SKA-Low surveys.</description>

      <title>A Detailed Chemical Analysis of the Red Giant Orbiting the Black Hole $Gaia$ BH3: From Lithium to Thorium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18757v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Preliminary astrometric data from the fourth data release of the $Gaia$ mission revealed a 33 M$_{\odot}$ dark companion to a metal-poor red giant star, deemed $Gaia$ BH3. This system hosts both the most massive known stellar-origin black hole and the lowest-metallicity star yet discovered in orbit around a black hole. The formation pathway for this peculiar stellar-black hole binary system has yet to be determined, with possible production mechanisms that include isolated binary evolution and dynamical capture. The chemical composition of the stellar companion in $Gaia$ BH3 (hereafter \bhstar) can help constrain the potential formation mechanisms of this system. Here, we conduct the most comprehensive chemical analysis of \bhstar\ to date using high resolution spectra obtained by the Tull Coud\'e Spectrograph on the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory to constrain potential formation mechanisms. We derived 29 elemental abundances ranging from lithium to thorium and find that \bhstar\ is an $\alpha$-enriched ([$\alpha$/Fe] = 0.41), r-I neutron-capture star ([Eu/Fe] = 0.57). We conclude that \bhstar\ shows no chemical peculiarities (defined as deviations from the expected chemical pattern of an r-I halo red giant) in any elements, which is in alignment with both the dynamical capture and isolated binary evolution formation scenarios. With an upper limit detection on Th, we use the Th/Eu chronometer to place limits on the cosmochronometric age of this system. These observations lay the groundwork for heavy-element chemical analysis for subsequent black hole and low-metallicity stellar binaries that will likely be found in $Gaia$ DR4.</description>

      <title>Linking Electron Density with Elevated Star Formation Activity from $z=0$ to $z=10$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interstellar medium (ISM) in high-redshift galaxies exhibits significantly higher electron densities ($n_{\rm e}$) than in the local universe. To investigate the origin of this trend, we analyze a sample of 9590 centrally star-forming galaxies with stellar masses greater than $10^9\,M_\odot$ at redshifts $0.01 &lt; z &lt; 0.04$, selected from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) Data Release 1. We derive electron densities from the [S~II]~$\lambda\lambda6716,6731$ doublet, measuring values of $n_{\rm e} = 30$-$400~{\rm cm^{-3}}$ at $z \approx 0$. We find a tight correlation between $n_{\rm e}$ and the star formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), which is well described by a broken power law. Above a threshold of $\log(\Sigma_{\rm SFR} / M_\odot\,{\rm yr^{-1}\,kpc^{-2}}) \ge -1.46$, the relation follows $n_{\rm e} = (233 \pm 13)\,\Sigma_{\rm SFR}^{0.49 \pm 0.02}$. Below this threshold, $n_{\rm e}$ remains approximately constant at $44 \pm 3~{\rm cm^{-3}}$. Remarkably, this relation remains consistent with measurements of galaxies at $z = 0.9$-$10.2$. By converting the observed redshift evolution of $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ into $n_{\rm e}$ evolution through our $n_{\rm e}$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation, we obtain $n_{\rm e} = 40(1+z)^{1.4}~{\rm cm^{-3}}$, consistent with previous direct observations. The $n_{\rm e}$-$\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ relation likely arises because the high $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, fueled by dense cold gas or elevated efficiency, enhances radiative and mechanical feedback and produces dense ionized gas whose electron densities are further regulated by ambient pressure. We conclude that the redshift evolution of $n_{\rm e}$ primarily reflects the evolution of cold gas density and star formation activity over cosmic time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17927v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Commission Femmes et Astronomie of the French Astronomical Society, has conducted a statistical study aimed at mapping the current presence of women in French professional astronomy and establishing a baseline for tracking its evolution over time. This study follows an initial survey carried out in 2021, which covered eight astronomy and astrophysics institutes (1,060 employees). This year, the scope was expanded to 11 institutes, bringing together a total of 1,525 employees, including PhD students, postdoctoral researchers, academics, as well as technical and administrative staff, representing about 57% of the whole French community. We examined how the proportion of women varies according to career stage, level of responsibility, job security, and income. The results are compared to the 2021-2022 survey and appear to illustrate the well-known "leaky pipeline", with one of the main bottlenecks being access to permanent positions. The study shows that the proportion of women consistently declines with increasing job security, career seniority, qualification level, and salary.</description>

      <title>Using Strong Lensing to Detect Subhalos with Steep Inner Density Profiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17956v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inner region of a subhalo's density distribution is particularly sensitive to dark matter microphysics, with alternative dark matter models leading to both cored and steeply-rising inner density profiles. This work investigates how the lensing signature and detectability of dark matter subhalos in mock HST-, Euclid-, and JWST-like strong lensing observations depends on the subhalo's radial density profile, especially with regards to the inner power-law slope, $\beta$. We demonstrate that the minimum-mass subhalo detectable along the Einstein ring of a system is strongly dependent on $\beta$. In particular, we show that subhalos with $\beta \sim 2.2$ can be detected down to masses over an order-of-magnitude lower than their Navarro-Frenk-White (NFW) counterparts with $\beta \sim 1$. Importantly, we find that the detectability of subhalos with steep inner profiles is minimally affected by increasing the complexity of the main lens galaxy's mass model. This is a unique characteristic of these subhalos, as those with NFW or shallower profiles become essentially undetectable when multipole perturbations are added to the lens model. The results of this work highlight how the underlying dark matter physics can significantly impact the expected number of subhalo detections from strong gravitational lensing observations. This is important for testing Cold Dark Matter against alternatives, such as Self-Interacting Dark Matter, which predict the existence of subhalos with diverse inner density profiles.</description>

      <title>FLAMINGO: Tracing the co-evolution of hot gas and black holes in galaxy groups and clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The gas mass fraction of galaxy groups and clusters is a key physical quantity for constraining the impact of feedback processes on large-scale structure. While several modern cosmological simulations use the gas fraction-halo mass relation to calibrate their feedback implementations, we note that this relation exhibits substantial intrinsic scatter whose origin has not been fully elucidated. Using the large-volume FLAMINGO hydrodynamical simulations, we examine the role of both central and satellite supermassive black holes (BHs) in shaping this scatter, probing higher halo masses than previously possible. For haloes with M500 &lt; 10^13 Msun, we find that central BH mass correlates strongly and negatively with gas fraction, such that higher BH masses give rise to lower gas fractions at fixed halo mass, consistent with previous studies. Interestingly, however, for 10^13 Msun &lt; M500 &lt; 10^14.5 Msun the correlation reverses and becomes positive, with overmassive BHs residing in haloes with above-average gas fractions. By tracing progenitor BHs and haloes through cosmic time, we show that this behaviour is driven by the expulsion and subsequent re-accretion of halo gas, regulated by the timing of BH growth and feedback. Specifically, haloes that collapse earlier form BHs earlier, leading to earlier gas expulsion and re-accretion and a high gas fraction compared to haloes of the same present-day mass that formed later. Our results demonstrate that present-day scatter in the gas fraction-halo mass relation is strongly shaped by the early growth history of BHs and their haloes, a prediction that can be tested with future observational measurements.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Powerful Multi-Velocity Ultra-Fast Outflows in the Starburst Merger Galaxy IRAS 05189$-$2524 with XRISM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We observed the X-ray-bright ultra-luminous infrared galaxy, IRAS 05189$-$2524, with XRISM during its performance verification phase. The unprecedented energy resolution of the onboard X-ray microcalorimeter revealed complex spectral features at $\sim$7$-$9 keV, which can be interpreted as blueshifted Fe XXV/XXVI absorption lines with various velocity dispersions, originating from ultra-fast outflow (UFO) components with multiple bulk velocities of $\sim0.076c$, $\sim0.101c$, and $\sim0.143c$. In addition, a broad Fe-K emission line was detected around $\sim7$ keV, forming a P Cygni profile together with the absorption lines. The onboard X-ray CCD camera revealed a 0.4$-$12 keV broadband spectrum characterized by a neutrally absorbed power-law continuum with a photon index of $\sim2.3$, and intrinsic flare-like variability on timescales of $\sim10$ ksec, both of which are likely associated with near-Eddington accretion. We also found potential variability of the UFO parameters on a timescale of $\sim140$ ksec. Using these properties, we propose new constraints on the outflow structure and suggest the presence of multiple outflowing regions on scales of about tens to a hundred Schwarzschild radii, located within roughly two thousand Schwarzschild radii. Since both the estimated momentum and energy outflow rates of the UFOs exceed those of galactic molecular outflows, our results indicate that powerful, multi-velocity UFOs are already well developed during a short-lived evolutionary phase following a major galaxy merger, characterized by intense starburst activity and likely preceding the quasar phase. This system is expected to evolve into a quasar, sustaining strong UFO activity and suppressing star formation in the host galaxy.</description>

      <title>A Physical Model for the Ice Coma of 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18157v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High-resolution imaging of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS with the Hubble Space Telescope on July 21, 2025 revealed a pronounced sunward anti-tail with a projected 2:1 elongation that our earlier study suggests is dominated by scattering off grains of H$_2$O ice ejected from the nucleus by CO$_2$ sublimation. Subsequent observations with the Keck and Gemini South observatories showed a reduction in the anti-tail and the growth of a conventional tail in a direction away from the sun. In this study we explain the physics behind this evolution. As a function of heliocentric distance, we model the apparent visual brightness of scattering in the ice coma. As the comet approaches the Sun, the exponential temperature dependence of the sublimation rate causes a continuous increase in the production rate of ice grains and a sharp decline in their residence time within the observing aperture. The combined effects produce a peak in total scattering cross-section due to H$_2$O ice grains at 3-4 AU. At closer distances, the scattering becomes dominated by longer-lived refractory and larger volatile grains with survival times long enough to form a conventional tail.</description>

      <title>SKYSURF-11: A New Zodiacal Light Model Optimized for Optical Wavelengths</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an improved zodiacal light model, optimized for optical wavelengths, using archival Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging from the SKYSURF program. The Kelsall et. al. 1998 model used infrared imaging from the Diffuse Infrared Background Experiment (DIRBE) on board the Cosmic Background Explorer to create a 3D structure of the interplanetary dust cloud. However, this model cannot accurately represent zodiacal light emission outside of DIRBE's nominal wavelength bandpasses, the bluest of which is 1.25 micron. We present a revision to this model (called ZodiSURF) that incorporates analytical forms of both the scattering phase function and albedo as a function of wavelength, which are empirically determined across optical wavelengths (0.3-1.6 micron) from over 5,000 HST sky surface brightness (sky-SB) measurements. This refined model results in significantly improved predictions of zodiacal light emission at these wavelengths and for Sun angles greater than 80 deg. Fits to HST data show an uncertainty in the model of ~4.5%. Remarkably, the HST sky-SB measurements show an excess of residual diffuse light (HST Sky - ZodiSURF - Diffuse Galactic Light) of 0.013 +/- 0.006 MJy/sr. The blue color of our diffuse light signal makes it unlikely to be of extragalactic origin. Instead, we suggest that a very dim spherical dust cloud may need to be included in the zodiacal light model, which we present here as a toy model.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the nature of HE 0107-5240</title>

Abstract: The vast majority of the most iron-poor stars in the Galaxy exhibit a strong carbon enhancement, with C/H ratios only about two orders of magnitude below solar. This unusual chemical composition likely reflects the properties of the gas cloud from which these stars formed, having been enriched by one, or at most a few, supernovae. A remarkable member of this stellar class, HE 0107-5240 with [Fe/H]=-5.56, has been identified as part of a binary system. To constrain its orbital parameters, radial velocity monitoring has been carried out using the ESPRESSO spectrograph. Radial velocities were derived using cross-correlation with a template, taking advantage of the strong G-band feature. Combining all observations yielded a high signal-to-noise spectrum, which has been used to refine our understanding of the stellar chemical composition. Additionally, a co-added UVES spectrum in the blue was used to complement the wavelength coverage of ESPRESSO. Observations of HE 0107-5240 over a span of more than four years have yielded a revised orbital period of about 29 years. Updated elemental abundances have been determined for Sc, Cr, Co, and, tentatively, Al, along with a new upper limit for Be. The iron abundance has been derived from ionised Fe lines. Significant upper limits have been established for Li, Si, and Sr. The star is confirmed to be a long-period binary. Iron abundances derived from neutral and ionised lines are consistent with local thermodynamical equilibrium (LTE) assumption, casting doubt on published deviation from LTE corrections for Fe for this star. The heavy elements Sr and Ba remain undetected, confirming the classification of HE 0107-5240 as a carbon enhanced metal-poor and non enhanced in heavy elements (CEMP-no) star and supporting the absence of an n-capture element plateau at the lowest metallicities.</description>

      <title>Line-force driven wind from a thin disk in tidal disruption event</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.18657v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Winds from the accretion disk in tidal disruption events (TDEs) play a key role in determining the radiation of TDEs. The winds from the super-Eddington accretion phase in TDEs have recently been studied. However, properties of the winds from the sub-Eddington accretion disk in TDEs are not clear. We aim to investigate properties of winds from the circularized sub-Eddington accretion disk in TDEs. We study the line force driven accretion disk wind. We perform two-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations using the PLUTO code to study the line force driven wind from the circularized accretion disk around a $10^6$ solar mass black hole in TDEs. We find that although the disk has a very small size in TDEs, strong wind can be driven by line force when the disk have luminosity higher than $20\%$ of the Eddington luminosity. The maximum velocity of wind can be as high as $0.3$ times the speed of light. The kinematic power of wind is in the range of $1\%-6\%$ times the Eddington luminosity. Strong wind can be driven by line force from the thin disk around a $10^6$ solar mass black hole in TDEs. We briefly discuss the possible radio emission from the shock when the wind collides with the surrounding medium.</description>

      <title>Pre-perihelion Development of Interstellar Comet 3I/ATLAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe pre-perihelion optical observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS taken during July - September 2025 using the Nordic Optical Telescope. Fixed aperture photometry of the comet is well described by a power law function of heliocentric distance, rH, with the exponent (``index") n = 3.8+/-0.3 across the 4.6 au to 1.8 au distance range (phase function 0.04+/-0.02 magnitude/degree assumed). This indicates that the dust production rates vary in proportion to rH**(-1.8+/-0.3). An rH**(-2) variation is expected of a strongly volatile material, and consistent with independent spectroscopic observations showing that carbon dioxide is the primary driver of activity. The measured heliocentric index is unremarkable in the context of solar system comets, for which n is widely dispersed, and provides no basis on which to describe 3I as either dynamically old (thermally processed) or new (pristine). The morphology of the comet changes from a Sun-facing dust fan in the early 2025 July observations, to one dominated by an antisolar dust tail at later dates. We attribute the delayed emergence of the tail to the large size (effective radius 0.1 mm) and slow ejection (5 m/s) of the optically dominant dust particles, and their consequently sluggish response to solar radiation pressure. Small (micron-sized) particles may be present but not in numbers sufficient to dominate the scattering cross-section. Their relative depletion possibly reflects interparticle cohesion, which binds small particles more effectively than large ones. A similar preponderance of 0.1 mm grains was reported in 2I/Borisov. However, 2I differed from 3I in having a much smaller (asteroid-like) heliocentric index, n = 1.9+/-0.1. Dust production rates in 3I are 180 kg/s at 2 au, compared with 70 kg/s in 2I/Borisov at the same distance.</description>

      <title>The Dual Nature of GHZ9: Coexisting Active Galactic Nuclei and Star Formation Activity in a Remote X-ray Source at z = 10.145</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18763v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)/NIRSpec PRISM spectroscopic characterization of GHZ9 at z= 10.145 $\pm$ 0.010, currently the most distant source detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. The spectrum reveals several UV high-ionization lines, including CII, SiIV, NIV], CIV, HeII, OIII], NIII], and CIII]. The prominent rest-frame equivalent widths (EW(CIV)$\simeq$65A, EW(OIII])$\simeq$28A, EW(CIII])$\simeq$48A) show the presence of a hard active galactic nucleus (AGN) radiation field, while line ratio diagnostics are consistent with either AGN or star formation as the dominant ionizing source. GHZ9 is nitrogen-enriched (6--9.5 (N/O)$_{\odot}$), carbon-poor (0.2--0.65 (C/O)$_{\odot}$), metal-poor (Z = 0.01--0.1 Z$_{\odot}$), and compact ($&lt;$ 106 pc), similarly to GN-z11, GHZ2, and recently discovered N-enhanced high redshift objects. We exploited the newly available JWST/NIRSpec and NIRCam data set to perform an independent analysis of the Chandra data confirming that GHZ9 is the most likely JWST source associated with X-ray emission at 0.5-7 keV. Assuming a spectral index $\Gamma$ = 2.3 (1.8), we estimate a black hole (BH) mass of 1.60 $\pm$ 0.31 (0.48 $\pm$ 0.09) $\times$ 10$^8$M$_{\odot}$, which is consistent either with Eddington-accretion onto heavy ($\geq$ 10$^6$ M$_{\odot}$) BH seeds formed at z=18, or super-Eddington accretion onto a light seed of $\sim$ 10$^2-10^4$ M$_{\odot}$ at z = 25. The corresponding BH-to-stellar mass ratio M$_{BH}$/M$_{star}$= 0.33$\pm$0.22 (0.10$\pm$0.07), with a stringent limit $&gt;$0.02, implies an accelerated growth of the BH mass with respect to the stellar mass. GHZ9 is the ideal target to constrain the early phases of AGN-galaxy coevolution with future multi-frequency observations.</description>

      <title>On the kinematic and thermodynamic state of clouds in complex wind-multi-cloud environments using a Friends-of-Friends analysis</title>

Abstract: We investigate the interaction between a shock-driven hot wind and a cold multi-cloud layer, for conditions commonly found in interstellar and circumgalactic gas. We present a method for identifying distinct clouds using a Friends-of-Friends algorithm. This approach unveils novel detailed information about individual clouds and their collective behaviour. By tracing the evolution of individual clouds, our method provides comprehensive descriptions of cloud morphology, including measures of the elongation and fractal dimension. Combining the kinematics and morphology of clouds, we refine previous models for drag and entrainment processes. Our by-cloud analysis allows to discern the dominant entrainment processes at different times. We find that after the initial shock passage, momentum transfer due to condensation becomes increasingly important, compared to ram pressure, which dominates at early times. We also find that internal motions within clouds act as an effective dynamic pressure that exceeds the thermal pressure by an order of magnitude. Our analysis shows how the highly efficient cooling of the warm mixed gas at temperatures $\sim 10^{5}$ K is effectively balanced by the kinetic energy injected by the hot wind into the warm and cold phases via shocks and shear motions. Compression-driven condensation and turbulence dissipation maintain a multi-phase outflow and can help explain the presence of dense gas in galaxy-scale winds. Finally, we show that applying our Friends-of-Friends analysis to $\rm{H}_\rm{I}$-emitting gas and correcting for beam size and telescope sensitivity can explain two populations of $\rm{H}_\rm{I}$ clouds within the Milky-Way nuclear wind as structures pertaining to the same outflow.</description>

      <title>MISTRAL: a model for AGN winds from radiatively efficient accretion in cosmological simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) is crucial for regulating galaxy evolution. Motivated by observations of broad absorption line winds from rapidly accreting supermassive black holes (SMBHs), we introduce the Mistral AGN feedback model, implemented in the Arepo code. Mistral comes in two versions: continuous radial (Mistral-continuous) and stochastic bipolar momentum deposition (Mistral-stochastic). Using the framework of the IllustrisTNG simulations, we explore the effect of Mistral on BH and galaxy properties, through an idealized Milky Way-mass galaxy and cosmological zoom simulations run down to $z=2$. Unlike standard thermal AGN feedback prescriptions, Mistral generates galaxy-scale winds that mimic outflows driven by BH accretion. Mistral-continuous produces short-lived galactic fountains, and is inefficient at regulating the growth of massive galaxies at $z=2$. In contrast, Mistral-stochastic efficiently suppresses star formation in massive galaxies, reproduces the empirical stellar-to-halo mass relation, and yields a consistent trend of BH-stellar mass evolution. By supporting large-scale outflows while simultaneously preventing gas inflows, Mistral-stochastic additionally regulates the cold and hot gas fractions at both galaxy and halo scales. Mistral-stochastic therefore works self-consistently across the halo mass range explored $\left(10^{12}-3\times10^{13}\,\rm M_\odot\right)$, without adopting a SMBH-mass dependent AGN feedback scheme such as the one used in IllustrisTNG. Our model is a promising tool for predicting the impact of AGN winds on galaxy evolution, and interpreting the growing population of high-redshift galaxies and quasars observed by JWST. This work is part of the "Learning the Universe" collaboration, which aims to infer the physical processes governing the evolution of the Universe.</description>

      <title>The MandelZoom project I: modelling black hole accretion through an $\alpha$-disc in dwarf galaxies with a resolved interstellar medium</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18384v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While mounting observational evidence suggests that intermediate mass black holes (IMBHs) may be important in shaping the properties of dwarf galaxies both at high redshifts and in the local Universe, our theoretical understanding of how these IMBHs grow is largely incomplete. To address this, we perform high-resolution simulations of an isolated dwarf galaxy with a virial mass of $10^{10}~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ harbouring a $10^4~{\rm M}_{\odot}$ IMBH at its centre at a peak spatial resolution of $\lesssim 0.01$ pc. Within the fully multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM), we incorporate explicit sampling of stars from the initial mass function, photo-ionization, photoelectric heating, individual supernovae (SNe), as well as a Shakura-Sunyaev accretion disc model to track the evolution of BH mass and spin. We find that a nuclear star cluster (NSC) effectively captures the ISM gas and promotes formation of a circumnuclear disc (CND) on scales of $\lesssim 7$ pc. Simultaneously, gravitational torques from the NSC reduce CND angular momentum on (sub-)parsec scales, circularizing the gas onto the $\alpha$-accretion disc and promoting sustained IMBH growth at $\sim 0.01$ of the Eddington rate. While in the innermost regions ($\lesssim 0.5$ pc), star formation is highly suppressed, the CND is susceptible to fragmentation, leading to the formation of massive, young stars. Interestingly, despite an in-situ SN rate of $0.3~{\rm Myr}^{-1}$, the dense CND persists, sustaining BH accretion and leading to its net spin-up. Our study demonstrates the complexity of IMBH accretion within a multi-phase ISM, and paves the way for next-generation studies where IMBH growth in a fully cosmological context can be captured.</description>

      <title>Gravothermal expansion of dwarf spheroidal galaxies heated by dark subhaloes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use analytical and $N$-body methods to study the evolution of dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs) embedded in dark matter (DM) haloes that host a sizeable subhalo population. Dark subhaloes generate a fluctuating gravitational field that injects energy into stellar orbits, driving a gradual expansion of dSphs. Despite the overall expansion, the stellar density profile preserves its initial shape, suggesting that the evolution proceeds in a self-similar manner. Meanwhile, the velocity dispersion profile, initially flat, evolves as the galaxy expands: the inner regions heat up, while the outer regions cool down. Kinematically, this resembles gravothermal collapse but with an inverted evolution, instead of collapsing the stellar system expands within a fluctuating halo potential. As the half-light radius $r_{\rm half}$ approaches the halo peak velocity radius $r_{\rm max}$, the expansion slows, and the velocity dispersion peaks at $\sigma_{\rm max} \simeq 0.54 v_{\rm max}$. The stellar heat capacity remains positive for deeply embedded stars but diverges near $r_{\rm max}$, turning negative beyond this threshold, which indicates a phase transition in the dynamical response to energy injection. The relaxation time scales as $t_{\rm rel} \sim r_{\rm half}^{3/2}$, showing that orbital diffusion slows as the galaxy expands. Ultra-faint dSphs, having the smallest sizes and shortest relaxation times, are particularly sensitive to the presence of dark subhaloes. Some of our dSph models expand beyond the detection of current photometric surveys, becoming `stealth' galaxies with half-light radii and velocity dispersions similar to ultra-diffuse galaxies (UDGs), but orders of magnitude lower luminosities, representing a distinct, yet currently undetected, population of DM-dominated satellites.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Little Red Dot candidate at $z\gtrsim10$ in COSMOS-Web based on MIRI-NIRCam selection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00057v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JWST has revealed a new high-redshift population called little red dots (LRDs). Since LRDs may be in the early phase of black hole growth, identifying them in the early universe is crucial for understanding the formation of the first supermassive black holes. However, no robust LRD candidates have been identified at $z&gt;10$, because commonly-used NIRCam photometry covers wavelengths up to $\sim5\,{\rm \mu m}$ and is insufficient to capture the characteristic V-shaped spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of LRDs. In this study, we present the first search for $z\gtrsim10$ LRD candidates using both NIRCam and MIRI imaging from COSMOS-Web, which provides the largest joint NIRCam-MIRI coverage to date ($0.20\,{\rm deg^2}$). Taking advantage of MIRI/F770W to remove contaminants, we identify one robust candidate, CW-LRD-z10 at $z_{\rm phot}=10.5^{+0.7}_{-0.6}$ with $M_{\rm UV}=-19.9^{+0.1}_{-0.2}\,{\rm mag}$. CW-LRD-z10 exhibits a compact morphology, a distinct V-shaped SED, and a non-detection in F115W, all consistent with being an LRD at $z\sim10$. Based on this discovery, we place the first constraint on the number density of LRDs at $z\sim10$ with $M_{\rm UV}\sim-20$ of $1.2^{+2.7}_{-1.0}\times10^{-6}\,{\rm Mpc^{-3}\,mag^{-1}}$, suggesting that the fraction of LRDs among the overall galaxy population increases with redshift, reaching $\sim3\%$ at $z\sim10$. Although deep spectroscopy is necessary to confirm the redshift and the nature of CW-LRD-z10, our results imply that LRDs may be a common population at $z&gt;10$, playing a key role in the first supermassive black hole formation.</description>

      <title>The First RELHIC? Cloud-9 is a Starless Gas Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20157v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) observations have recently identified a compact HI cloud (hereafter Cloud-9) in the vicinity of the spiral galaxy M94. This identification has been confirmed independently by Very Large Array (VLA) and Green Bank Telescope (GBT) observations. Cloud-9 has the same recession velocity as M94, and is therefore at a similar distance ($\sim$4.4 Mpc). It is compact ($\sim$1$'$ radius, or $\sim$1.4 kpc), dynamically cold ($W_{50}=12$ km/s), non-rotating, and fairly massive, with an HI mass of $\sim 10^{6}$ $M_{\odot}$. Here we present deep Hubble Space Telescope/Advanced Camera for Surveys (HST/ACS) imaging designed to search for a luminous stellar counterpart. We visually rule out the presence of any dwarf galaxy with stellar mass exceeding 10$^{3.5}$$M_{\odot}$. A more robust color-magnitude diagram-based analysis conservatively rules out a 10$^{4}$$M_{\odot}$ stellar counterpart with $99.5^{+0.5}_{-8.2}$$\%$ confidence. The non-detection of a luminous component reinforces the interpretation that this system is a Reionization-Limited HI Cloud (RELHIC); i.e., a starless dark matter halo filled with hydrostatic gas in thermal equilibrium with the cosmic ultraviolet background. Our results make Cloud-9 the leading RELHIC candidate of any known compact HI cloud. This provides strong support for a cornerstone prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM model, namely the existence of gas-filled starless dark matter halos on sub-galactic mass scales, and constrains the present-day threshold halo mass for galaxy formation.</description>

      <title>Little Red Dots Are Nurseries of Massive Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02664v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) has revealed a previously unknown population of compact, red galaxies at $z \sim 5$, known as "Little Red Dots" (LRDs). With effective radii of $\sim 100$ pc and stellar masses of $10^9-10^{11} \, M_\odot$, a purely stellar interpretation implies extreme central densities, $\rho_\star\sim10^4-10^5 \, M_\odot \, \mathrm{pc}^{-3}$ and in some cases up to $\sim 10^9 \, M_\odot \, \mathrm{pc}^{-3}$, far exceeding those of globular clusters. At such densities, the dynamical friction time for $10 \, M_\odot$ stars in the central $0.1$ pc is $&lt; 0.1$ Myr, driving rapid mass segregation. We investigate the dynamical consequences of such an environment using: (i) a Fokker-Planck analysis of long-term core evolution, (ii) an analytical model for the collisional growth of a very massive star (VMS), and (iii) direct $N$-body simulations. All approaches show that runaway collisions produce a VMS with mass $9\times10^3 &lt; M_{\rm VMS} \, [M_\odot] &lt; 5\times10^4$ within $&lt;1$ Myr. Once the supply of massive stars is depleted, the VMS contracts on a $\sim 8000$ yr Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale and undergoes a general relativistic collapse, leaving a massive black hole of mass $M_\bullet \sim 10^4 \, M_\odot$. We conclude that LRDs are natural nurseries for the formation of heavy black hole seeds via stellar-dynamical processes. This pathway produces seed number densities that far exceed those expected from direct collapse models, and, owing to the dense residual stellar core, can sustain high rates of tidal disruption events.</description>

      <title>Infalling ultra-faint dwarfs as emissaries of the Axiverse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16915v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent discoveries of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies (UFDs) infalling onto the Milky Way, namely Leo K \&amp; M at $r \simeq 450$kpc, considerably strengthens the case that UFDs constitute a distinct galaxy class that is inherently smaller and fainter, and metal-poorer than the classical dwarf spheroidals (dSph). This distinction is at odds with the inherent continuity of galaxy halo masses formed under scale-free gravity for any standard dark-matter (DM) model. Here, we show that distinct galaxy classes do evolve in cosmological simulations of multiple light bosons representing the ``Axiverse'' proposal of string theory, where a discrete mass spectrum of axions is generically predicted to span many decades in mass. In this context, the
  observed UFD class we show corresponds to a relatively heavy boson of $3\times 10^{-21}$ eV, including Leo K \&amp; M, whereas a lighter axion of $10^{-22}$ eV comprises the bulk of DM in all larger galaxies including the dSphs. Although Leo M is larger in size than Leo K, we predict its velocity dispersion to be smaller $(\simeq 1.7$km/s) than that of Leo K $(\simeq 4.5$km/s) because of the inverse de Broglie scale dependence on momentum. This scenario can be definitively tested using millisecond pulsars close to the Galactic center, where the Compton frequencies of the heavy and light bosons imprint monotone timing residuals that may be detected by the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) on timescales of approximately one week and four months, respectively.</description>

      <title>Counterpart identification and classification for eRASS1 and characterisation of the AGN content</title>

Abstract: [abridged] Accurately accounting for the AGN phase in galaxy evolution requires a large, clean AGN sample. This is now possible with SRG/eROSITA. The public Data Release 1 (DR1, Jan 31, 2024) includes 930,203 sources from the Western Galactic Hemisphere. The data enable the selection of a large AGN sample and the discovery of rare sources. However, scientific return depends on accurate characterisation of the X-ray emitters, requiring high-quality multiwavelength data. This paper presents the identification and classification of optical and infrared counterparts to eRASS1 sources using Gaia DR3, CatWISE2020, and Legacy Survey DR10 (LS10) with the Bayesian NWAY algorithm and trained priors. Sources were classified as Galactic or extragalactic via a Machine Learning model combining optical/IR and X-ray properties, trained on a reference sample. For extragalactic LS10 sources, photometric redshifts were computed using Circlez. Within the LS10 footprint, all 656,614 eROSITA/DR1 sources have at least one possible optical counterpart; about 570,000 are extragalactic and likely AGN. Half are new detections compared to AllWISE, Gaia, and Quaia AGN catalogues. Gaia and CatWISE2020 counterparts are less reliable, due to the surveys shallowness and the limited amount of features available to assess the probability of being an X-ray emitter. In the Galactic Plane, where the overdensity of stellar sources also increases the chance of associations, using conservative reliability cuts, we identify approximately 18,000 Gaia and 55,000 CatWISE2020 extragalactic sources. We release three high-quality counterpart catalogues, plus the training and validation sets, as a benchmark for the field. These datasets have many applications, but in particular empower researchers to build AGN samples tailored for completeness and purity, accelerating the hunt for the Universes most energetic engines.</description>

      <title>The Weyl Geometric Gravity black hole in light of the Solar System tests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Weyl geometric gravity theory, in which the gravitational action is constructed from the square of the Weyl curvature scalar and the strength of the Weyl vector, has been intensively investigated recently. The theory admits a scalar-vector-tensor representation, obtained by introducing an auxiliary scalar field, and can therefore be reformulated as a scalar-vector-tensor theory in a Riemann space, in the presence of a nonminimal coupling between the Ricci scalar and the scalar field. By assuming that the Weyl vector has only a radial component, an exact spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the field equations can be obtained, which depends on three integration constants. As compared to the Schwarzschild solution, the Weyl geometric gravity solution contains two new terms, linear and quadratic in the radial coordinate, respectively. In the present work we consider the possibility of testing and obtaining observational restrictions on the Weyl geometric gravity black hole at the scale of the Solar System, by considering six classical tests of general relativity (gravitational redshift, the E\"{o}tv\"{o}s parameter and the universality of free fall, the Nortvedt effect, the planetary perihelion precession, the deflection of light by a compact object, and the radar echo delay effect, respectively) for the exact spherically symmetric black hole solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. All these gravitational effects can be fully explained and are consistent with the vacuum solution of the Weyl geometric gravity. Moreover, the study of the classical general relativistic tests also allows to constrain the free parameter of the solution.</description>
