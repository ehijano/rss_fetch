      <title>Radiating solutions in Entangled Relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Mineur--Vaidya radiating solutions satisfy $\mathcal{L}_m ~\propto~ F^2 = 0 = R$. As a consequence, it is not only a solution in General Relativity, but also in Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton theories for all coupling constants. The specific case of Entangled Relativity is noteworthy because the additional scalar degree of freedom is defined from the ratio between $R$ and $\mathcal{L}_m$, which is ill-defined in this situation. In the present work, we embed the Mineur--Vaidya solution in a magnetic (or electric) field within the framework of Entangled Relativity, and show that the Mineur--Vaidya solution corresponds to the limit where the magnetic (respectively, electric) field vanishes. This notably allows us to demonstrate that, as in General Relativity, it is possible to dynamically form naked singularities in Entangled Relativity. This conclusion, in fact, applies to any Einstein--Maxwell--dilaton theory, although it does not seem to be widely acknowledged in the literature.</description>

      <title>Black strings and BTZ black holes sourced by a Dekel-Zhao dark matter profile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we obtain analytical solutions for a $(3+1)$-dimensional black string and a BTZ black hole, both sourced by the Dekel-Zhao dark matter (DM) density profile. Our results indicate that the event horizon radius is sensitive to the inner slope parameter $a$; specifically, beyond a critical threshold, the horizon vanishes, leading to the formation of naked singularities. We find that the DM environment induces curvature singularities in the Ricci and Kretschmann scalars, which are absent in the vacuum BTZ case. Furthermore, an analysis of the effective energy-momentum tensor shows that while the null, weak, and strong energy conditions are strictly satisfied, the dominant energy condition is violated in the BTZ scenario due to the high tangential pressure gradient. We also observe that DM modifies the Hawking temperature and free energy without compromising local or global stability. Notably, the DM distribution transforms the originally constant-curvature BTZ spacetime into a singular one, suggesting that a inherent stiffness of the DM profile is a determinant factor in the causal structure of these solutions.</description>

      <title>A Nonlinear Endpoint of Charged Horizon Instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We numerically construct asymptotically extremal black holes through the nonlinear evolution of a charged scalar field. Our procedure -- which extends the work of Murata-Reall-Tanahashi to include charged scalar dynamics -- involves the fine-tuned scattering of wave packets within an initially super-extremal Reissner-Nordstrom spacetime. The resulting extremal solution develops an event horizon along which the energy density diverges and the charge density approaches a constant (i.e., the horizon forms with "hair"). We investigate this behavior from the perspective of critical phenomena in gravitational collapse, giving evidence that dynamical extremal black holes act as universal threshold solutions modulo this family-dependent hair. As in the linear instability of fixed extremal backgrounds, the scalar field decays outside the dynamical extremal horizon. But just inside the horizon, the scalar curvature appears to develop unbounded growth. This implies that near-threshold solutions without a black hole could develop correspondingly large curvatures visible from future null infinity.</description>

      <title>Dynamical systems approach to stellar modelling in $f(G, B)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11297v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The novel proposal to invoke the split of the Ricci scalar into bulk and boundary terms in the gravitational action, opens up a new avenue of investigation into stellar dynamics. The Lagrangian contains functional forms of the bulk while the boundary terms do not contribute to the dynamics. The advantage of the proposition is that the stellar structure equations are up to order two thus the theory is not haunted by ghosts. We obtain explicitly the defining equations for the thermodynamical variables and the geometry for the pure quadratic case since the linear case amounts to general relativity. In trying to establish the vacuum geometry associated with the theory it turns out that two possible metrics emerge through the vanishing of the energy-momentum tensor. Next we analyse the isotropy equation and make the observation that it is autonomous. It is rare that this happens in astrophysical modelling. This behaviour prompted the use of dynamical systems to understand the stability properties of fixed points or fixed manifolds. It was necessary to choose a gauge in order to split the autonomous equation into a system from which we could plot a phase portrait and deduce the stability of solution trajectories. We find that the fixed curves were generally stable with nearby paths approaching the fixed curves.</description>

      <title>Generalized entropic uncertainty relation and non-classicality in Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The uncertainty principle constitutes a fundamental pillar of quantum theory, representing one of the most distinctive features that differentiates quantum mechanics from classical physics. In this study, we firstly propose a novel generalized entropic uncertainty relation (EUR) for arbitrary multi-measurement in the many-body systems, and rigorously derive a significantly tighter bound compared to existing formulations. Specifically, we discuss the proposed EUR in the context of Schwarzschild black hole, where we demonstrate the superior tightness of our derived bound. The study further elucidates the dynamical evolution of multipartite quantum coherence and entanglement in the curved spacetime. A particularly noteworthy finding reveals the exact equivalence between entanglement and $l_1$-norm coherence for arbitrary $N$-partite Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger-type (GHZ-type) states. Moreover, we find that quantum coherence is significantly diminished and the measurement uncertainty increases to a stable maximum with increasing Hawking temperature. Thus, the findings of this study contribute to a deeper understanding of non-classicality and quantum resources in black holes.</description>

      <title>Precessions and parameter constraints from quasiperiodic oscillations in a rotating charged black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) as a diagnostic tool for probing frame-dragging effects and accretion disk physics in the spacetime of a rotating regular magnetic black hole (BH). Specifically, we analyze the precession of bound orbits and the epicyclic oscillations of test particles under small perturbations in the equatorial plane. We demonstrate how the BH nonminimal coupling parameter (lambda/M^4) and dimensionless magnetic charge (Q/M) significantly influence the three fundamental epicyclic frequencies. By applying the relativistic precession model and employing Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations (MCMC), we constrain the BH characteristic parameters, including mass, spin, magnetic charge, and nonminimal coupling, using observational QPO data from five X-ray binaries: GRO J1655-40, XTE J1859+226, H1743-322, XTE J1550-564, and GRS 1915+105. Furthermore, we examine the Lense-Thirring, geodetic, and general spin precession frequencies of a test gyroscope attached to a stationary observer around the black hole. Our theoretical results indicate that the regular charged black hole suppresses these precession frequencies compared with the Kerr black hole case.</description>

      <title>Complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement in Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational effects associated with black holes are widely believed to universally degrade quantum entanglement, with the loss of maximal entanglement being particularly severe and even irreversible for bosonic fields. In this work, we investigate the entanglement properties of the four-qubit cluster state ($CL_4$) for fermionic fields in the curved spacetime of a Schwarzschild black hole. Remarkably, we uncover a counterintuitive phenomenon: as the Hawking temperature increases, quantum entanglement ($1$-$3$ tangle) of the $CL_4$ state remains strictly constant, indicating a ``complete freezing of initially maximal entanglement". This constitutes the first explicit example in which maximal entanglement remains perfectly preserved in a black hole environment, defying the conventional expectation that gravitational effects can only suppress maximal quantum correlations. Moreover, our results indicate that, within a relativistic framework, the $CL_4$ state constitutes a high-quality quantum resource with potential applications in relativistic quantum information processing, and may significantly improve the performance of such protocols.</description>

      <title>On the numerical evaluation of the `exact' Post-Newtonian parameters in Brans-Dicke and Entangled Relativity theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In context of Brans-Dicke scalar-tensor theories of gravity, it has recently been obtained that the post-Newtonian parameters should be generalized in the context of strongly gravitating bodies, and that its generalization -- the so-called $\textit{exact parameters}$ -- actually depends on the pressure and energy density of a considered celestial body. Here we develop two new methods to numerically obtain the $\textit{exact parameters}$ by means of usual Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff computation, and find that the difference with the value of standard post-Newtonian parameters can be more than 80% in some situations. We also provide the connection with the Damour-Esposito Far\`ese non-pertubative parameter $\alpha_{DEF}$. We then apply the methodology to the case of Entangled Relativity, and derive these exact parameters for the Sun and the Earth, as well as for neutron stars. We argue that current and foreseeable experiments are likely able to constrain the theory under the assumption that $\mathcal{L}_m=-\rho$, where $\rho$ is the total energy density. If $\mathcal{L}_m=T$ instead, as often advocated in the literature, then there is no deviation with respect to General Relativity and the prospects of testing Entangled Relativity become much more remote in time, as only compact objects with extreme electric or magnetic fields could lead to some deviation from General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Black holes in effective loop quantum gravity: Hawking radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11828v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Emergent modified gravity provides a covariant framework for holonomy effects in models of loop quantum gravity with consistent black hole solutions coupled to a scalar field. Several independent studies of the Hawking thermal distribution are shown here to lead to the same final result. This internal consistency is a direct consequence of general covariance, which is analogous to the situation in classical general relativity but highly nontrivial in the context of modified canonical gravity. Holonomy corrections to the evaporation rate enter through the greybody factor, slowing down the evaporation process when the holonomy modification function decreases monotonically. Accounting for backreaction, corrected covariant semi-classical stress-energy tensors are computed in various vacuum states. Thanks to these results, the new concept of a net stress-energy tensor makes it possible to compute evaporation rates directly from energy conservation laws.</description>

      <title>A unified framework for photon and massive particle hypersurfaces in stationary spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11883v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the notion of massive particle hypersurfaces and place it within a unified framework alongside photon hypersurfaces in stationary spacetimes. More precisely, for Killing-invariant timelike hypersurfaces $T=\mathbb{R}\times S_0$, where $S_0$ is a smooth embedded surface in a spacelike slice $S$ of the stationary spacetime, we show that $T$ is a photon hypersurface or a massive particle hypersurface if and only if $S_0$ is totally geodesic with respect to certain associated Finsler structures on the slice: a Randers metric governing null geodesics and a Jacobi--Randers metric governing timelike solutions of the Lorentz force equation at fixed energy and charge-to-mass ratio. We also prove existence and multiplicity results for proper-time parametrized solutions of the Lorentz force equation with fixed energy and charge-to-mass ratio, either connecting a point to a flow line of the Killing vector field or having periodic, non-constant projection on $S$.</description>

      <title>Bosonic and fermionic statistics in nonperturbative quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11927v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The relation between spin and statistics in quantum field theory relies on Poincar\'e invariance, a symmetry that is lost in the presence of a gravitational field, and replaced in general relativity by the principle of general covariance. In a nonperturbative approach to quantum gravity, beyond the picture of gravitational perturbations propagating on a flat background, it is an open question whether the gravitational field must still satisfy a bosonic statistics. By implementing the principle of general covariance through the requirement of invariance under active diffeomorphisms in loop quantum gravity, we find that the space of kinematical states of the gravitational field includes not only bosonic states, but also subspaces of fermionic and mixed statistics.</description>

      <title>pespace: A new tool of GPU-accelerated and auto-differentiable response generation and likelihood evaluation for space-borne gravitational wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Space-borne gravitational wave detectors will expand the scope of gravitational wave astronomy to the milli-Hertz band in the near future. The development of data analysis software infrastructure at the current stage is crucial. In this paper, we introduce \texttt{pespace} which can be used for the full Bayesian parameter estimation of massive black hole binaries with detectors including LISA, Taiji, and Tianqin. The core computations are implemented using the high-performance parallel programming framework \texttt{taichi-lang} which enables automatic differentiation and hardware acceleration across different architectures. We also reimplement the waveform models \texttt{PhenomXAS} and \texttt{PhenomXHM} in the separate package \texttt{tiwave} to integrate waveform generation within the \texttt{taichi-lang} scope, making the entire computation accelerated and differentiable. To demonstrate the functionality of the tool, we use a typical signal from a massive black hole binary to perform the full Bayesian parameter estimation with the complete likelihood function for three scenarios: including a single detector using the waveform with only the dominant mode; a single detector using the waveform including higher modes; and a detector network with higher modes included. The results demonstrate that higher modes are essential in breaking degeneracies, and coincident observations by the detector network can significantly improve the measurement of source properties. Additionally, automatic differentiation provides an accurate way to obtain the Fisher matrix without manual fine-tuning of the finite difference step size. Using a subset of extrinsic parameters, we show that the approximated posteriors obtained by the Fisher matrix agree well with those derived from Bayesian parameter estimation.</description>

      <title>Dark matter distributions around extreme mass ratio inspirals: effects of radial pressure and relativistic treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate different treatments of dark matter (DM) distributions surrounding extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) to assess their impact on orbital evolution and gravitational wave emission. Density profiles derived from the mass current and from the energy-momentum tensor using a distribution function yield consistent results, but both differ substantially from profiles obtained using an anisotropic fluid model based on Einstein cluster ansatz. We find that the inclusion of radial pressure significantly modifies both the orbital dynamics and the resulting gravitational wave waveforms. By analyzing waveform dephasing and mismatches, we show that a fully relativistic treatment of DM distributions can substantially alter the detectability thresholds of DM halos. Our results demonstrate that radial pressure and relativistic modeling of DM are essential for accurately describing the dynamics and observational signatures of EMRIs embedded in DM halos.</description>

      <title>Primordial Black Hole Formation in Dust-Radiation Bouncing Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) provide a unique probe of the early Universe and may have an enhanced abundance in bouncing cosmologies, where a long contracting phase can amplify perturbations. We develop a unified framework to study PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies, focusing on the classical contracting phase so that the results are insensitive to bounce details. We compute the curvature power spectrum for an extremely small dust equation of state using a stable semi-analytical (adiabatic) method, derive the Jeans length of the two-fluid system using dynamical-system analysis and the WKB approximation, and extend the three-zone model from the single- to the two-fluid case to model local collapse. We implement two collapse criteria to obtain the curvature perturbation threshold for PBH formation and estimate PBH mass fractions for benchmark masses spanning low-mass ($10^{-17} M_{\odot}$) to supermassive ($10^{13} M_{\odot}$) scales. The critical curvature threshold is extremely small and nearly mass-independent over a broad range $(\zeta_c \sim 10^{-21}$ for $10^{-14}$ to $10^{13} M_{\odot})$, with deviations only near dust-radiation equality. Nevertheless, the square root of the curvature power spectrum at the relevant formation times is many orders of magnitude smaller, yielding vanishingly small PBH mass fractions across the benchmark masses. Compared with the pure-dust case, radiation pressure and the two-fluid collapse conditions significantly suppress PBH production, implying that substantial PBH formation in dust-radiation bouncing cosmologies would require additional mechanisms to amplify curvature perturbations.</description>

      <title>Cosmographic Connection Between Cosmological And Planck Scales: The Barrow-Tsallis Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: One of the fundamental challenges of quantum gravity is to understand how the microscopic degrees of freedom of the cosmological horizon shape the evolution of the Universe. One possible approach to this problem is based on the Barrow--Tsallis entropy. This entropy accounts for both quantum gravitational effects and the nonextensive effects inherent in any long-range interaction. Using a general method we developed for finding the parameters of cosmological models, we discovered a relationship between the parameter describing the microscopic structure of quantum foam and the parameter associated with macroscopic nonextensive effects. We also used our method for finding the parameters of cosmological models to evaluate the feasibility of using fractional derivatives to describe the late evolution of the Universe. The resulting relationships are exact. Therefore, the uncertainty in the relationship between the model parameters depends only on the current uncertainty in the values of the cosmographic parameters.</description>

      <title>Black Holes Trapped by Ghosts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12101v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Violent cosmic events, from black hole mergers to stellar collapses, often leave behind highly excited black hole remnants that inevitably relax to equilibrium. The prevailing view, developed over decades, holds that this relaxation is rapidly filtered into a linear regime, establishing linear perturbation theory as the bedrock of black hole spectroscopy and a key pillar of gravitational-wave physics. Here we unveil a distinct nonlinear regime that transcends the traditional paradigm: before the familiar linear ringdown, an intrinsically nonlinear, long-lived bottleneck can dominate the evolution. This stage is controlled by a saddle-node ghost in phase space, which traps the remnant and delays the onset of linearity by a timescale obeying a universal power-law. The ghost imprints a distinctive quiescence-burst signature on the emitted radiation: a prolonged silence followed by a violent burst and a delayed ringdown. Rooted in the bifurcation topology, it extends naturally to neutron and boson stars, echoing a topological universality shared with diverse nonlinear systems in nature. Our results expose a missing nonlinear chapter in gravitational dynamics and identify ghost-induced quiescence-burst patterns as clear targets for future observations.</description>

      <title>Spin networks of quantum channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin networks in Loop Quantum Gravity are traditionally described by unitary holonomies corresponding to noiseless transformations. In this work, we extend this framework to incorporate general quantum channels that model effects of environment, which can become significant at the Planck scale. Specifically, we demonstrate that the transformation properties of Kraus operators, which define completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) maps, are consistent with the gauge invariance of spin networks. This enables the introduction of generalized spin network states that can be expressed in terms of the Kraus operators. Furthermore, the associated notion of an inner product is proposed, allowing for introduction of the Hilbert space. We illustrate these constructions with examples involving a Wilson loop and a dipole network.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, astronomers discovered unusual Einstein cross images of the galaxy HerS-3, which feature a bright central spot. Motivated by studies of images produced by regular stars, it has been proposed that optical appearances caused by compact stars acting as gravitational lenses may account for this central bright spot. We further suggest that images produced by regular stars exhibit additional characteristics distinct from those of ordinary black holes, such as the possible partial or complete absence of secondary images. These phenomena may serve as favorable observational criteria for identifying regular stars in future searches.</description>

      <title>aurel: A Python package for automatic relativistic calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.00155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: \texttt{aurel} is an open-source Python package designed to \emph{au}tomatically calculate \emph{rel}ativistic quantities. It uses an efficient, flexible and user-friendly caching and dependency-tracking system, ideal for managing the highly nonlinear nature of general relativity. The package supports both symbolic and numerical calculations. The symbolic part extends \texttt{SymPy} with additional tensorial calculations. The numerical part computes a wide range of tensorial quantities, such as curvature, matter kinematics and much more, directly from any spacetime and matter data arrays using finite-difference methods. Inputs can be either generated from analytical expressions or imported from Numerical Relativity (NR) simulations, with helper functions provided to read in data from standard NR codes. Given the increasing use of NR, \texttt{aurel} offers a timely post-processing tool to support the popularisation of this field.</description>

      <title>Scale Invariance, Variety and Central Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11225v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scale invariance has received very little attention in physics. Nevertheless, it provides a natural conceptual foundation for a relational understanding of the universe, where absolute size loses meaning and only dimensionless ratios retain physical significance. We formalize this idea through the $N$-body problem, introducing a scale-invariant function--the variety, $V$--built from the square root of the center-of-mass moment of inertia and the Newtonian potential. Critical points of $V$, known as central configurations, correspond to special particle arrangements that preserve their shape under homothetic collapse or expansion. Numerical exploration of these critical points reveals that even slight deviations from the absolute minimum of $V$, which corresponds to a remarkably uniform configuration, lead to the spontaneous formation of filaments, loops, voids and other patterns reminiscent of the cosmic web. This behavior is a consequence of the intrinsic structure of shape space--the space of configurations modulo translations, rotations and dilatations--in which regions of higher variety act as attractors. Our results suggest that scale-invariant dynamics not only captures the relational nature of physical laws but also naturally generates organized patterns, offering a novel perspective on the formation of cosmic structures and on the emergence of a gravitational arrow of time from scale-invariant, relational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Kosmann derivative and momentum maps from a duality covariant framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A covariant implementation of diffeomorphisms in the presence of local symmetries is a nontrivial aspect of gravitational theories. In Double Field Theory, this is achieved through the so-called generalized Kosmann derivative. In this work, we show that the generalized Kosmann derivative admits a natural formulation entirely in terms of generalized fluxes through the inclusion of a compensating term that plays the role of a generalized momentum map, yielding a fully determined and covariant operator that provides a covariant realization of generalized diffeomorphisms. When parameterized in terms of the field content of heterotic supergravity, the resulting symmetry transformations give rise to momentum maps at the supergravity level, offering a duality-covariant interpretation of these objects. This framework provides a natural setting for the construction of conserved currents and Noether charges in doubled geometry with internal symmetries, with direct implications for black hole thermodynamics and its higher-derivative corrections in a duality-covariant setting.</description>

      <title>Tango of Titans: Centaurus A and M83 as a Local Group Analog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Centaurus A (CenA) and M83 form one of the most massive galaxy pairs in the nearby Universe. Although their observed heliocentric velocities suggest motion that is not obviously indicative of mutual attraction, this work presents evidence that CenA and M83 are in fact infalling toward each other, exhibiting a dynamical interaction analogous to the binary-like motion of the Milky Way and Andromeda in the Local Group (LG). Using the Timing Argument (TA), calibrated with analog galaxy pairs from the AbacusSummit simulation, we estimate the total mass of the CenA/M83 system under the assumption that the line-of-sight (LoS) velocity is dominated by motion toward the system's barycenter. This yields a total mass of $(6.36 \pm 1.30) \cdot 10^{12}\, M_\odot$. The inferred mass agrees well with independent estimates based on virial mass measurements and $K$-band luminosity--to-mass ratios. Together, the consistent bound signature and robust mass determination highlight the CenA/M83 system as a compelling nearby analog to the LG. Further discussion of NGC 4945 as a main perturber (as the Large Magellanic Could) for the CenA is also discussed.</description>

      <title>DeepRed: an architecture for redshift estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11281v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating redshift is a central task in astrophysics, but its measurement is costly and time-consuming. In addition, current image-based methods are often validated on homogeneous datasets. The development and comparison of networks able generalize across different morphologies, ranging from galaxies to gravitationally-lensed transients, and observational conditions, remain an open challenge. This work proposes DeepRed, a deep learning pipeline that demonstrates how modern computer vision architectures, including ResNet, EfficientNet, Swin Transformer, and MLP-Mixer, can estimate redshifts from images of galaxies, gravitational lenses, and gravitationally-lensed supernovae. We compare these architectures and their ensemble to both neural networks (A1, A3, NetZ, and PhotoZ) and a feature-based method (HOG+SVR) on simulated (DeepGraviLens) and real (KiDS, SDSS) datasets. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results on all datasets. On DeepGraviLens, DeepRed achieves a significant improvement in the Normalized Mean Absolute Deviation compared to the best baseline (PhotoZ): 55% on DES-deep (using EfficientNet), 51% on DES-wide (Ensemble), 52% on DESI-DOT (Ensemble), and 46% on LSST-wide (Ensemble). On real observations from the KiDS survey, the pipeline outperforms the best baseline (NetZ), improving NMAD by 16% on a general test set without high-probability lenses (Ensemble) and 27% on high-probability lenses (Ensemble). For non-lensed galaxies in the SDSS dataset, the MLP-Mixer architecture achieves a 5% improvement over the best baselines (A3 and NetZ). SHAP shows that the models correctly focus on the objects of interest with over 95% localization accuracy on high-quality images, validating the reliability of the predictions. These findings suggest that deep learning is a scalable, robust, and interpretable solution for redshift estimation in large-scale surveys.</description>

      <title>Measurement prospects for the pair-instability mass cutoff with gravitational waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pair-instability supernovae leave behind no compact remnants, resulting in a predicted gap in the distribution of stellar black-hole masses. Gravitational waves from binary black-hole mergers probe the relevant mass range and analyses of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA catalog (GWTC-4) indicate a possible mass cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$. However, the robustness of this result is yet to be tested. To this end, we simulate a comprehensive suite of gravitational-wave catalogs with full Bayesian parameter estimation and analyze them with parametric population models. For catalogs similar to GWTC-4, confident identification of a cutoff is not guaranteed, but GWTC-4 results are compatible with the best constraints among our simulations. Conversely, spurious false identification of a cutoff is unlikely. For catalogs expected by the end of the O4 observing run, uncertainty in the cutoff mass is reduced by $\gtrsim20\%$, but a cutoff at $40$-$50M_\odot$ yields only a lower bound on the $^{12}\mathrm{C}(\alpha,\gamma)^{16}\mathrm{O}$ reaction rate, which in terms of the S-factor at $300\,\mathrm{keV}$ may be $S_{300}\gtrsim125\,\mathrm{keV}\,\mathrm{b}$ at $90\%$ credibility by the end of O4. Relative uncertainties on the Hubble parameter $H_0$ from gravitational-wave data alone can still be up to $100\%$. We also analyze GWTC-4 with the nonparametric PixelPop population model, finding that some mass features are more prominent than in parametric models but a sharp cutoff is not required. However, the parametric model passes a likelihood-based predictive test in GWTC-4 and the PixelPop results are consistent with those from our simulated catalogs where a cutoff is present. We use the simple focus of this study to emphasize that such tests are necessary to make astrophysical claims from gravitational-wave catalogs going forward.</description>

      <title>Numerical simulation of the stochastic formalism including non-Markovianity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11652v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We numerically investigate stochastic dynamics in cosmology by solving Langevin equations for Infrared (IR) modes with stochastic noises generated by Ultraviolet (UV) modes at the coarse-graining scale. By construction, the stochastic formalism relies on the separation of scales, which requires solving the equations for UV modes on top of the evolving IR modes for all modes at every time step, leading to a non-Markovian system in general. In this paper, working on a de Sitter background, we analyze several representative models by simultaneously solving the Langevin equations for IR modes and the equations for UV modes at each time step. We demonstrate that once the effects of effective masses are treated consistently by our simulation, the flat direction in the minimal supersymmtric model (MSSM) does not saturate but instead evolves as an exactly flat direction. Furthermore, we investigate memory effects in simple two models; $V=\lambda\phi^4$ and $V=\mu\phi\chi + \lambda\phi^4$, and non-Markovian contributions can lead to quantitative differences, even in stationary configurations, when compared with Markovian approximations, particularly in the strong-coupling regime.</description>

      <title>GR from RG: Gravity Is Induced From Renormalization Group Flow In The Infrared</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11806</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.11806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this essay and utilizing the holographic Renormalization Group (RG) flow, we demonstrate how the effective action of a non-gravitating quantum field theory in the ultraviolet (UV) develops an Einstein-Hilbert term in the infrared (IR). That is, gravity is induced by the RG flow. An inherent outcome of holography that plays a crucial role in our analysis is the \textit{RG flow of boundary conditions}: the rigid Dirichlet conditions on the background metric in the UV become an admixture of Dirichlet and Neumann as we flow to the IR, thereby ``unfreezing'' the metric and transforming it from a non-dynamical background into a dynamical field. This mechanism, which is a conceptually new addition to the standard Wilsonian RG flow, also provides the mechanism to evade the Weinberg-Witten no-go theorem. Within the GR from RG picture outlined here, the search for a quantum theory of gravity by treating the metric as a fundamental field may be a hunt for a phantom -- akin to seeking the atomic structure of water by quantizing the equations of hydrodynamics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.11900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a Jordan domain diffeomorphic to a closed two-dimensional disk with a smooth boundary. Assuming the Gauss curvature of the domain has a negative lower bound, the Gauss-Bonnet formula provides an upper bound for the total geodesic curvature of the boundary curve. This bound, however, inherently depends on the interior geometry of the region. In this paper, we derive an upper bound for the total geodesic curvature expressed solely in terms of the boundary data. Notably, the proof is connected to the positivity of the hyperbolic Hamiltonian mass in the (2+1)-dimensional gravity theory.</description>

      <title>Search for Sub-Solar Mass Binaries in the First Part of LIGO's Fourth Observing Run</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the first results of a sub-solar mass compact binary search using the data from the first part of the fourth observing run (O4a) of the Advanced LIGO detectors. Sub-solar mass neutron stars or primordial black holes are not expected to form via standard stellar evolution, and their observation would signify a new class of astrophysical object or the discovery of dark matter. Our search covers binaries with primary masses 0.1 to 2 $\textrm{M}_\odot$ and secondary masses 0.1 to 1 $\textrm{M}_\odot$. We explicitly incorporate tidal effects up to $7\times10^5$ for extremely low mass neutron stars. No statistically significant candidates are identified. The advanced sensitivity of the O4a run enables an improvement in the sub-solar mass black hole merger rate limits by more than $2 \times$ over the previous three observing runs (O1-O3b). We place a $90\%$ confidence upper limit on the merger rate $\mathcal{R}_{90}$ for sub-solar mass black holes to be $&lt; 1.77\times10^4 \textrm{Gpc}^{-3} \textrm{yr}^{-1}$ for a chirp mass of 0.2 $\textrm{M}_\odot$. We place the first constraints for binary neutron stars with tidal deformabilities up to $\sim 7\times10^5$ and improve the merger rate estimate by a factor $\sim 4$ in comparison to previous O3 tidal searches for tidal deformabilities $&lt; 10^4$. We further constrain the fraction of dark matter composed of primordial black hole $f_{\rm PBH}&lt; 2\%$ for a chirp mass of 0.1 $\textrm{M}_\odot$. Our results significantly expand the observational search space for sub-solar binaries and provide rigorous constraints on the local abundance of compact objects that may arise from non-standard formation mechanisms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.12252v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The collapse of large-amplitude primordial curvature perturbations into planetary-mass primordial black holes generates a scalar-induced gravitational wave background in the $\mu $Hz frequency range that may be detectable by future Lunar Laser Ranging and Satellite Laser Ranging data. We derive projected constraints on the primordial black hole population from a null detection of stochastic gravitational wave background by these experiments, including the impact of the electroweak phase transition on the abundance of planetary-mass primordial black holes. We also discuss the connection between the obtained projected constraints and the recent microlensing observations by the HSC collaboration of the Andromeda Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Repulsive Gravitational Force as a Witness of the Quantum Nature of Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.12266v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that a single spatially superposed 'source' mass acting on a 'probe' matter wavepacket can reveal the quantum nature of the gravitational field. For this we use a specific state preparation and measurement of the superposed source mass, including a postselection, which altogether results in a repulsive gravitational force on the probe particle. A classical gravitational field can never lead to repulsion, as the effect requires quantum interference of two distinct states of gravity. We also present a calculation in the Heisenberg picture under the formalism of weak values that illustrates how repulsion is achieved. Finally, we estimate the range of parameters (masses and the spatio-temporal extent of interference) for which the experiment is feasible.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10013v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present and investigate charged wormhole solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations supported by anisotropic matter fields, with the purpose of establishing their physical plausibility as traversable wormholes. To this end, we examine the flare-out condition and evaluate tidal forces to confirm their traversability. We also analyze light deflection around these wormholes to provide observational implications. Additionally, we attempt to construct rotating generalizations of the solutions by applying and modifying the Newman-Janis algorithm. Our results suggest that the obtained geometries offer a concrete realization of the concept of ``charge without charge".</description>

      <title>Non-Commutative fluid: an alternative source of cosmic acceleration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel formulation for the Hubble parameter derived from Newtonian cosmology, incorporating non-commutative fluid dynamics through a deformed Poisson bracket structure. This approach introduces a new cosmological parameter, denoted by $\sigma$, which emerges naturally from the underlying non-commutative framework. It gives rise to a source term in the background fluid continuity equation, thereby leading to an apparent type of matter creation picture through the resulting non-conservation. Remarkably, the resulting Hubble function accounts for the observed accelerated expansion of the universe without invoking any external dark energy component or cosmological constant. Instead, the parameter $\sigma$ effectively serves as the driver of acceleration. We further examine the observational constraints on $\sigma$ using current cosmological data, including the recent Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument(DESI) dataset, demonstrating its viability as an alternative explanation for late-time cosmic acceleration within a non-commutative cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Effect of ultralight dark matter on compact binary mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.19660v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The growing catalogue of gravitational wave events enables a statistical analysis of compact binary mergers, typically quantified by the merger rate density. This quantity can be influenced by ambient factors, following which, in this work we have investigated the impact of dark matter environment on the merger statistics. We construct a baseline astrophysical model of compact binary mergers and extend it by incorporating a model of ultra light dark matter, which affects the orbital evolution of binaries through accretion and dynamical friction. Our analysis of the merged population of binary progenitors demonstrates that, compared to the baseline model, ULDM can significantly alter the merger statistics when its ambient density becomes larger than 104GeV/cm3. A comparison with the gravitational wave data from the GWTC-3 catalogue provides insight into potential observational signatures of the ULDM in merger events, leading to possible constraints on the existence and density of dark matter distribution in galaxies.</description>

      <title>Spatially covariant gravity with two degrees of freedom in the presence of an auxiliary scalar field: Hamiltonian analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02466v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A class of gravity theories respecting spatial covariance and in the presence of non-dynamical auxiliary scalar fields with only spatial derivatives is investigated. Generally, without higher temporal derivatives in the metric sector, there are 3 degrees of freedom (DOFs) propagating due to the breaking of general covariance. Through a Hamiltonian constraint analysis, we examine the conditions to eliminate the scalar DOF such that only 2 DOFs, which correspond the tensorial gravitational waves in a homogeneous and isotropic background, are propagating. We find that two conditions are needed, each of which can eliminate half degree of freedom. The second condition can be further classified into two cases according to its effect on the Dirac matrix. We also apply the formal conditions to a polynomial-type Lagrangian as a concrete example, in which all the monomials are spatially covariant scalars containing two derivatives. Our results are consistent with the previous analysis based on the perturbative method.</description>

      <title>Scalar-induced gravitational waves in spatially covariant gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20000v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate scalar-induced gravitational waves (SIGWs) in the framework of spatially covariant gravity (SCG), a broad class of Lorentz-violating modified gravity theories respecting only spatial diffeomorphism invariance. Extending earlier SCG formulations, we compute the general kernel function for SIGWs on a flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker background, focusing on polynomial-type SCG Lagrangians up to $d=3$, where $d$ denotes the total number of derivatives in each monomial. We derive explicit expressions for the kernel in the case of power-law time evolution of the coefficients, and restrict attention to the subset of SCG operators whose tensor modes propagate at the speed of light, thereby avoiding late-time divergences in the fractional energy density of SIGWs. Instead of the usual Newtonian gauge, the breaking of time reparametrization symmetry in SCG necessitates a unitary gauge analysis. We compute the energy density of SIGWs for representative parameter combinations, finding distinctive deviations from general relativity (GR), including scale-dependent modifications to both the amplitude and the spectral shape. Our results highlight the potential of stochastic GW background measurements to probe spatially covariant gravity and other Lorentz-violating extensions of GR.</description>

Abstract: Symmetries are a central concept in our understanding of physics. In quantum theories, a quantum reference frame (QRF) can be used to distinguish between observables related by a symmetry. The framework of operational QRFs provides a means to describe observables in terms of their relation to a reference quantum system. We discuss a number of applications of QRFs in the context of quantum field theory on curved spacetimes: 1) A type reduction result for algebras arising from QFTs and QRFs with good thermal properties. 2) Quantisation of boundary electric fluxes and gluing procedures for quantum electromagnetism on spacetimes with boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01376v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate electromagnetic and Dirac test field perturbations of a charged regular black hole arising from quantum gravity effects, commonly referred to as the Frolov black hole, a regular (nonsingular) black hole solution. We derive the master wave equations for massless electromagnetic and Dirac perturbations and solve them using the standard Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) method along with Pad\'e Averaging. From these solutions, we extract the dominant and overtone quasinormal mode (QNM) frequencies along with the associated grey-body factors, highlighting the deviations introduced by quantum gravity corrections compared to the classical case of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole. Furthermore, we analyze the Unruh-Verlinde temperature of this spacetime, providing quantitative estimates of how quantum gravity effects influence both quasinormal ringing and particle emission in nonsingular black hole models.</description>

      <title>Globally defined Carroll symmetry of gravitational waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.16762v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The local Carroll symmetry of a gravitational wave found in Baldwin-Jeffery-Rosen coordinates is extended to a globally defined one by switching to Brinkmann coordinates. Two independent globally defined solutions of a Sturm-Liouville equation allow us to describe both the symmetries (translations and Carroll boosts) and the geodesic motions. One of them satisfies particular initial conditions which imply zero initial momentum, while the other does not. Pure displacement arises when the latter is turned off by requiring the momentum to vanish and when the wave parameters take, in addition, some particular values which correspond to having an integer half-wave number. The relation to the Schwarzian derivative is highlighted. We illustrate our general statements by the P\"oschl-Teller profile.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical modeling of gravitational-wave populations for disentangling environmental and modified-gravity effects</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.17398v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will detect up to thousands of extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs). These sources will spend $\sim 10^5$ cycles in band, and are therefore sensitive to tiny changes in the general-relativistic dynamics, potentially induced by astrophysical environments or modifications of general relativity (GR). Previous studies have shown that these effects can be highly degenerate for a single source. However, it may be possible to distinguish between them at the population level, because environmental effects should impact only a fraction of the sources, while modifications of GR would affect all. We therefore introduce a population-based hierarchical framework to disentangle the two hypotheses. Using simulated EMRI populations, we perform tests of the null vacuum-GR hypothesis and two alternative beyond-vacuum-GR hypotheses, namely migration torques (environmental effects) and time-varying $G$ (modified gravity). We find that with as few as $\approx 20$ detected sources, our framework can statistically distinguish between these three hypotheses, and even indicate if both environmental and modified gravity effects are simultaneously present in the population. Our framework can be applied to other models of beyond-vacuum-GR effects available in the literature.</description>

      <title>On the foundations and applications of Lorentz-Finsler Geometry</title>

Abstract: Finslerian extensions of Special and General Relativity -- commonly referred to as Very Special and Very General Relativity -- necessitate the development of a unified Lorentz-Finsler geometry. However, the scope of this geometric framework extends well beyond relativistic physics. Indeed, it offers powerful tools for modeling wave propagation in classical mechanics, discretizing spacetimes in classical and relativistic settings, and supporting effective theories in fundamental physics. Moreover, Lorentz-Finsler geometry provides a versatile setting that facilitates the resolution of problems within Riemannian, Lorentzian, and Finslerian geometries individually. This work presents a plain introduction to the subject, reviewing foundational concepts, key applications, and future prospects. The reviewed topics include (i) basics on the setting of cones, Finsler and Lorentz-Finsler metrics and their (nonlinear, anisotropic and linear) connections, (ii) the global structure of Lorentz-Finsler manifolds and its space of null geodesics, (iii) links among Riemannian, Finsler and Lorentz geometries, (iv) applications in classical settings as wildfires and seisms propagation, and discretization in classical and relativistic settings with quantum prospects, and (v) Finslerian variational approach to Einstein equations. The new results include the splitting of globally hyperbolic Finsler spacetimes, in addition to the analysis of several extensions of the Lorentz setting, as the case of timelike boundaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15846v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Interpreting multimessenger signals from neutron stars and black holes requires reliable general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) simulations across rapidly evolving high-performance computing platforms, yet key algorithms are routinely rewritten within infrastructure-specific numerical relativity codes, hindering verification and reuse. We present the General Relativistic Hydrodynamics Library (GRHayL), a modular, infrastructure-agnostic GR(M)HD library providing conservative-to-primitive recovery, reconstruction, flux/source and induction operators, equations of state, and neutrino leakage through an intuitive interface. GRHayL refactors and extends the mature IllinoisGRMHD code into reusable point- and stencilwise kernels, enabling rapid development and cross-code validation in diverse frameworks, while easing adoption of new microphysics and future accelerators. We implement the same kernels in the Einstein Toolkit (Carpet and Carpetx) and BlackHoles@Home, demonstrating portability with minimal duplication. Validation combines continuous-integration unit tests with cross-infrastructure comparisons of analytic GRMHD Riemann problems, dynamical Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff evolutions, and binary neutron star mergers, showing comparable or improved behavior over legacy IllinoisGRMHD and established Einstein Toolkit codes.</description>

Abstract: We study grey-body factors and Hawking radiation of higher-dimensional regular black holes arising in quasi-topological gravity. These spacetimes incorporate infinite-curvature corrections that remove the central singularity while preserving an event horizon and a well-defined semiclassical description. We show that, for all considered regular black hole models, the transmission of radiation and the corresponding Hawking evaporation are significantly suppressed compared to the singular black hole solutions of General Relativity.</description>

Abstract: We explore spacetimes with multiple energy injections in asymptotically flat two-dimensional black hole and analyze the entanglement entropy in such spacetimes. This work is an extension of the setup of the single-injection case, by F. F. Gautason, L. Schneiderbauer, W. Sybesma and L. Thorlacius, to include the multiple energy injections. We derive the solution of the model, by J. G. Russo, L. Susskind and L. Thorlacius, for a general number $n$ of the total injections, and discuss the entropy only for the case $n=2$. The essential point of this work is in the delay of the island. This delay makes the intermediate state necessary, where the island's endpoint lies between the 1st and the 2nd injections while the observer is located after the 2nd injection. The intermediate state makes the entanglement entropy evolve continuously across the 2nd injection time.</description>

      <title>Time-Dependent Black Hole Lensing from Ringdown Quasinormal Mode</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19849v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is it possible to find imprints of a black hole ringdown through gravitational lensing? To address this question, we formulate an analytic description of weak-field and strong-deflection lensing of light in a time-dependent, perturbed Schwarzschild spacetime. The spacetime dynamics are modeled by a single, axisymmetric, even-parity quasinormal mode with \(\ell=2\), \(m=0\) and complex frequency \(\omega\). Working to first order in a small perturbation amplitude while keeping background null geodesics exact, we derive a time-dependent line-of-sight (Born) expression for the screen-plane deflection measured by a static observer at large radius. From the same integral, an asymptotic expansion yields the familiar weak-field \(1/b\) law with a ringdown-frequency correction that drives a harmonic centroid wobble, whereas a near-photon-sphere expansion produces a time-dependent generalization of the logarithmic strong-deflection limit with modulated coefficients, including a small oscillation of the critical impact parameter. An observer tetrad built from the background static frame ensures that all screen-plane quantities, such as centroid motion, multi-image hierarchy, and time delays, as well as photon-ring morphology, are gauge-safe at first order. We provide explicit matching across regimes, showing that the near-critical coefficients governing spacing and ring-radius modulations are encoded in the same Born kernel that controls the weak-field correction. This provides an analytic account of how ringdown-scale perturbations enter imaging observables, without resorting to numerical integration of null geodesics.</description>

Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes (QNMs) of dilaton black holes in Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton gravity through a correspondence with the quantum Seiberg-Witten (SW) curve of $\mathcal{N}=2$ SU(2) gauge theory with $N_f=3$ hypermultiplets. By mapping both the black hole perturbation equation and the quantum SW curve to the confluent Heun form, the QNM problem is reformulated in a gauge-theoretic framework, and the spectrum is obtained via the SW quantization condition. The resulting frequencies show excellent agreement with those computed using the WKB and continued fraction methods, with typical deviations below $10^{-3}$. The QNM spectrum exhibits consistent trends: increasing the black hole charge or scalar field mass raises the oscillation frequency, while higher angular momentum reduces the damping rate. These results demonstrate the precision of the quantum SW framework in describing black hole perturbations and reveal new links between supersymmetric gauge theories and gravitational dynamics.</description>

      <title>Cosmological singularity, conformal anomaly and symmetric polynomials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.04591v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a spacetime singularity at $t = 0$ arising in a Kasner-type metric that solves the gravitational equations modified by quantum effects of a conformal field theory (CFT). The resulting constraints can be solved efficiently when expressed in terms of symmetric polynomials. Focusing first on the trace part of the modified gravitational equation, we determine the corresponding solution surfaces in Kasner-parameter space. The geometry of these surfaces depends sensitively on the ratio $\eta = A/C$, the quotient of the conformal charges characterizing the underlying CFT. We then fully integrate the conformal anomaly near the singularity for a generic Kasner-type metric and obtain the corresponding stress-energy tensor. Its components are expressed in terms of three symmetric polynomials (of degrees $2$, $3$ and $4$) and depend on seven arbitrary constants, which may be interpreted as parameterizing different choices of the quantum state at the singularity. By imposing a set of constraints we reduce this parameter space to a single free constant. Subsequently, we solve, at leading order near the singularity, the modified gravitational equations. Among the admissible solutions, we identify, in particular, those that develop a curvature singularity while remaining geodesically complete.</description>

      <title>Entanglement in the Schwinger effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze entanglement generated by the Schwinger effect using a mode-by-mode formalism for scalar and spinor QED in constant backgrounds. Starting from thermal initial states, we derive compact, closed-form results for bipartite entanglement between particle-antiparticle partners in terms of the Bogoliubov coefficients. For bosons, thermal fluctuations enhance production but suppress quantum correlations: the logarithmic negativity is nonzero only below a (mode-dependent) critical temperature $T_c$. At fixed $T$, entanglement appears only above a critical field $E_{\text{entang}}$. For fermions, we observe a qualitatively different pattern: the fermionic logarithmic negativity is non-vanishing at finite temperature, and is monotonically suppressed by thermal noise. As a function of the electric field, it is non-monotonic, featuring a temperature-independent optimal field strength $E_*$ and decreasing on both sides of the maximum. We give quantitative estimates for analog experiments, where our entanglement criteria convert directly into concrete temperature and electric field constraints. These findings identify realistic regimes where the quantum character of Schwinger physics may be tested in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Structural Limitations on Constraining the Time Evolution of Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.14747v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cosmological constraints on a time-varying dark energy equation of state are fundamentally limited by the integral structure through which the equation of state enters cosmological observables. We rigorously derive the linear response kernel that maps perturbations in the equation of state \omega(z) to comoving distance fluctuations \delta D(z). By adopting a Fourier mode expansion \delta \omega(z) = \sin(kz), we obtain the exact analytic form of the distance response in terms of Sine and Cosine integrals. We show that this mapping involves a double integration over redshift, which acts as an intrinsic low-pass filter with a characteristic \sim k^{-2} scaling in redshift space. This structural limitation is visualized in a schematic diagram and confirmed by observational verification using the full covariance matrix of the Pantheon+ supernova dataset. Our analysis reveals a steep hierarchy in Fisher eigenvalues where the information content drops by an order of magnitude already at the second eigenmode. Consequently, distance-based probes effectively constrain only a single dominant mode of \omega(z). This implies that the difficulty in constraining dynamical parameters such as w_a is not due to data precision, but is a necessary consequence of the observable's integral nature, which renders it structurally blind to the instantaneous rate of change d\omega/da.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave oscillations in Multi-Proca dark energy models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational wave oscillations arise from the exchange of energy between the metric perturbations and additional tensor modes. This phenomenon can occur even when the extra degrees of freedom consist of a triplet of massive Abelian vector fields, as in Multi-Proca dark energy models. In this work, we study gravitational wave oscillations in this class of models minimally coupled to gravity with a general potential, allowing also for a kinetic coupling between the vector field and dark matter that can, in principle, enhance the modulation of gravitational wave amplitudes. After consistently solving the background dynamics, requiring the model parameters to reproduce a phase of late-time accelerated expansion, we assess the accuracy of commonly used analytical approximations and quantify the impact of gravitational wave amplitude modulation for current detectors (LIGO--Virgo) and future missions such as LISA. Although oscillations are present in these scenarios, we find that the effective mass scale (the mixing mass) governing the phenomenon is $m_g \sim \mu_A$, where $\mu_A$ is the (time-dependent) effective mass of the vector dark-energy field. Detectability of gravitational wave oscillations, however, requires $m_g \gg H_0$, which is in tension with the ultra-light masses typically needed to drive accelerated expansion $\mu_A \sim H_0 \sim 10^{-33}\,\mathrm{eV}$. Therefore, if gravitational wave oscillations were to be detected at the corresponding frequencies, they could not be attributed to these classes of dark-energy models.</description>

      <title>Curvatures and Non-metricities in the Non-Relativistic Limit of Bosonic Supergravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct a diffeomorphism-covariant formulation of the non-relativistic (NR) limit of bosonic supergravity. This formulation is particularly useful for decomposing relativistic tensors, such as powers of the Riemann tensor, in a manifest covariant form with respect to the NR degrees of freedom. The construction is purely geometrical and is based on a torsionless connection. The non-metricities are associated with the gravitational fields of the theory ($\tau_{\mu\nu}$, $h_{\mu\nu}$, $\tau^{\mu\nu}$, $h^{\mu\nu}$) and are fixed by requiring compatibility with the relativistic metric. We provide a fully covariant decomposition of the relativistic Riemann tensor, Ricci tensor, and scalar curvature. Our results establish an equivalence between the intrinsic torsion framework of string Newton--Cartan geometry and the proposed construction and. We also discuss potential applications, including a manifestly diffeomorphism-covariant rewriting of the two-derivative finite bosonic supergravity Lagrangian under the NR limit, a powerful simplification in deriving bosonic $\alpha'$-corrections under the same limit, and extensions to more general $f(R,Q)$ Newton-Cartan geometries.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Quasicrystals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07769v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Self-similar quasicrystals (like the famous Penrose and Ammann-Beenker tilings) are exceptional geometric structures in which long-range order, quasiperiodicity, non-crystallographic orientational symmetry, and discrete scale invariance are tightly interwoven in a beautiful way. In this paper, we show how such structures may be generalized from Euclidean space to Minkowski spacetime. We construct the first examples of such Lorentzian quasicrystals (the spacetime analogues of the Penrose or Ammann-Beenker tilings), and point out key novel features of these structures (compared to their Euclidean cousins). We end with some (speculative) ideas about how such spacetime quasicrystals might relate to reality. This includes an intriguing scenario in which our infinite $(3+1)$D universe is embedded (like one of our spacetime quasicrystal examples) in a particularly symmetric $(9+1)$D torus $T^{9,1}$ (which was previously found to yield the most symmetric toroidal compactification of the superstring). We suggest how this picture might help explain the mysterious seesaw relationship $M_{\rm Pl}M_{\rm vac}\approx M_{\rm EW}^{2}$ between the Planck, vacuum energy, and electroweak scales ($M_{\rm Pl}$, $M_{\rm vac}$, $M_{\rm EW}$).</description>

      <title>Constraints on $f(T)$ Gravity from Solar Neutrino Conversion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.19550v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report new constraints on the parameters of $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity, derived from its imprints on neutrino flavor oscillations. Our analysis reveals that the presence of spacetime torsion can alter both vacuum oscillations and the matter enhanced Mikheyev Smirnov Wolfenstein (MSW) resonance. By using data from solar neutrino experiments: Super-Kamiokande, SNO, Borexino, and KamLAND, we perform a combined analysis to place the first direct observational bounds on the neutrino-torsion coupling and $f(T)$ parameters. These results establish neutrino phenomenology as a novel astrophysical probe for testing fundamental modifications of gravity.</description>

      <title>Forecasting Constraints on Cosmology and Modified Gravitational-wave Propagation by Strongly Lensed Gravitational Waves Associating with Galaxy Surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21820</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.21820v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Gravitational lensing of gravitational wave (GW) will become the next frontier in studying cosmology and gravity. While time-delay cosmography using quadruply lensed GW events associated with optical images of the lens systems can provide precise measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0$), they are considered to be much rarer than doubly lensed events. In this work, we analyze time-delay cosmography with doubly lensed GW events for the first time. We generate mock doubly lensed GW events with designed sensitivity of the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) O5 network, with LIGO post-O5 upgrade, and with Einstein Telescope (ET) + Cosmic Explorer (CE) respectively, and select the events that can be associated with future galaxy surveys. Over 1000 realizations, we find an average of 0.2(2.4) qualified events with the LVK O5(post-O5) network. Whereas with the ET+CE network, we find an average of 73.2 qualified events over 100 realizations. Using the Singular Isothermal Sphere (SIS) lens model, we jointly estimate waveform parameters and the impact parameter with doubly lensed GW signals, and then forecast the constraints on cosmological parameters and modified GW propagation by combining time-delay cosmography and the standard siren approach. The average posterior gives a constraint on $H_0$ with a relative uncertainty of $14\%$, $10\%$ and $0.42\%$ in the $\Lambda$CDM model for the LVK O5, LVK post-O5, and ET+CE network, respectively. While the LVK network gives uninformative constraints on the $(w_0,w_a)$ dynamical dark energy model, the ET+CE network yields a moderate constraint of $w_0=-1.02^{+0.31}_{-0.22}$ and $w_a=0.48^{+0.99}_{-1.54}$. In addition, our method can provide precise constraints on modified GW propagation effects jointly with $H_0$.</description>

      <title>Non-minimally Coupled Running Curvaton: A Unified Approach to Early-Universe Inflation and Phantom Dark Energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) 2024, combined with CMB and SNIa data, indicate a preference for a dynamical dark energy equation of state that crosses the phantom divide ($w &lt; -1$). This finding challenges the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and minimally coupled scalar field scenarios, including the original Running Curvaton model, which is typically constrained to the quintessence regime. In this work, we propose a unified cosmological framework by extending the Running Curvaton model via a non-minimal gravitational coupling of the form $\xi \chi^2 R$. We demonstrate that this geometric modification allows the effective equation of state to naturally evolve from a quintessence-like to a phantom-like regime in the Jordan frame, thereby providing a superior fit to the DESI observational contours ($w_0 &gt; -1, w_a &lt; 0$). Crucially, we show that the introduction of non-minimal coupling does not compromise the model's success in describing the early universe. Through a parameter re-tuning mechanism involving the coupling constant ($g_0^{obs} = g_0 + 2\xi$), the predictions for the primordial power spectrum (spectral index $n_s$) and local-type non-Gaussianity ($f_{NL}$) remain strictly preserved and consistent with Planck data. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive stability analysis within the Horndeski framework, verifying that the model remains free from ghost and gradient instabilities ($c_s^2 = 1$). Our results suggest that the non-minimally coupled Running Curvaton offers a robust, stable, and unified description of inflation and late-time accelerated expansion compatible with the latest precision cosmology data.</description>
