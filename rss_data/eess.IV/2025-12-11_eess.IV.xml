      <title>Agreement Disagreement Guided Knowledge Transfer for Cross-Scene Hyperspectral Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Knowledge transfer plays a crucial role in cross-scene hyperspectral imaging (HSI). However, existing studies often overlook the challenges of gradient conflicts and dominant gradients that arise during the optimization of shared parameters. Moreover, many current approaches fail to simultaneously capture both agreement and disagreement information, relying only on a limited shared subset of target features and consequently missing the rich, diverse patterns present in the target scene. To address these issues, we propose an Agreement Disagreement Guided Knowledge Transfer (ADGKT) framework that integrates both mechanisms to enhance cross-scene transfer. The agreement component includes GradVac, which aligns gradient directions to mitigate conflicts between source and target domains, and LogitNorm, which regulates logit magnitudes to prevent domination by a single gradient source. The disagreement component consists of a Disagreement Restriction (DiR) and an ensemble strategy, which capture diverse predictive target features and mitigate the loss of critical target information. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in achieving robust and balanced knowledge transfer across heterogeneous HSI scenes.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Chest Disease Classification Using an Improved CheXNet Framework with EfficientNetV2-M and Optimization-Driven Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.08992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interpretation of Chest X-ray is an important diagnostic issue in clinical practice and especially in the resource-limited setting where the shortage of radiologists plays a role in delayed diagnosis and poor patient outcomes. Although the original CheXNet architecture has shown potential in automated analysis of chest radiographs, DenseNet-121 backbone is computationally inefficient and poorly single-label classifier. To eliminate such shortcomings, we suggest a better classification framework of chest disease that relies on EfficientNetV2-M and incorporates superior training approaches such as Automatic Mixed Precision training, AdamW, Cosine Annealing learning rate scheduling, and Exponential Moving Average regularization. We prepared a dataset of 18,080 chest X-ray images of three source materials of high authority and representing five key clinically significant disease categories which included Cardiomegaly, COVID-19, Normal, Pneumonia, and Tuberculosis. To achieve statistical reliability and reproducibility, nine independent experimental runs were run. The suggested architecture showed significant gains with mean test accuracy of 96.45 percent compared to 95.30 percent at baseline (p less than 0.001) and macro-averaged F1-score increased to 91.08 percent (p less than 0.001). Critical infectious diseases showed near-perfect classification performance with COVID-19 detection having 99.95 percent accuracy and Tuberculosis detection having 99.97 percent accuracy. Although 6.8 times more parameters are included, the training time was reduced by 11.4 percent and performance stability was increased by 22.7 percent. This framework presents itself as a decision-support tool that can be used to respond to a pandemic, screen tuberculosis, and assess thoracic disease regularly in various healthcare facilities.</description>

      <title>Causal Attribution of Model Performance Gaps in Medical Imaging Under Distribution Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep learning models for medical image segmentation suffer significant performance drops due to distribution shifts, but the causal mechanisms behind these drops remain poorly understood. We extend causal attribution frameworks to high-dimensional segmentation tasks, quantifying how acquisition protocols and annotation variability independently contribute to performance degradation. We model the data-generating process through a causal graph and employ Shapley values to fairly attribute performance changes to individual mechanisms. Our framework addresses unique challenges in medical imaging: high-dimensional outputs, limited samples, and complex mechanism interactions. Validation on multiple sclerosis (MS) lesion segmentation across 4 centers and 7 annotators reveals context-dependent failure modes: annotation protocol shifts dominate when crossing annotators (7.4% $\pm$ 8.9% DSC attribution), while acquisition shifts dominate when crossing imaging centers (6.5% $\pm$ 9.1%). This mechanism-specific quantification enables practitioners to prioritize targeted interventions based on deployment context.</description>

      <title>SITP: A High-Reliability Semantic Information Transport Protocol Without Retransmission for Semantic Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09291v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the evolution of 6G networks, modern communication systems are facing unprecedented demands for high reliability and low latency. However, conventional transport protocols are designed for bit-level reliability, failing to meet the semantic robustness requirements. To address this limitation, this paper proposes a novel Semantic Information Transport Protocol (SITP), which achieves TCP-level reliability and UDP level latency by verifying only packet headers while retaining potentially corrupted payloads for semantic decoding. Building upon SITP, a cross-layer analytical model is established to quantify packet-loss probability across the physical, data-link, network, transport, and application layers. The model provides a unified probabilistic formulation linking signal noise rate (SNR) and packet-loss rate, offering theoretical foundation into end-to-end semantic transmission. Furthermore, a cross-image feature interleaving mechanism is developed to mitigate consecutive burst losses by redistributing semantic features across multiple correlated images, thereby enhancing robustness in burst-fade channels. Extensive experiments show that SITP offers lower latency than TCP with comparable reliability at low SNRs, while matching UDP-level latency and delivering superior reconstruction quality. In addition, the proposed cross-image semantic interleaving mechanism further demonstrates its effectiveness in mitigating degradation caused by bursty packet losses.</description>

      <title>NOC4SC: A Bandwidth-Efficient Multi-User Semantic Communication Framework for Interference-Resilient Transmission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09356v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the explosive growth of connected devices and emerging applications, current wireless networks are encountering unprecedented demands for massive user access, where the inter-user interference has become a critical challenge to maintaining high quality of service (QoS) in multi-user communication systems. To tackle this issue, we propose a bandwidth-efficient semantic communication paradigm termed Non-Orthogonal Codewords for Semantic Communication (NOC4SC), which enables simultaneous same-frequency transmission without spectrum spreading. By leveraging the Swin Transformer, the proposed NOC4SC framework enables each user to independently extract semantic features through a unified encoder-decoder architecture with shared network parameters across all users, which ensures that the user's data remains protected from unauthorized decoding. Furthermore, we introduce an adaptive NOC and SNR Modulation (NSM) block, which employs deep learning to dynamically regulate SNR and generate approximately orthogonal semantic features within distinct feature subspaces, thereby effectively mitigating inter-user interference. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed NOC4SC achieves comparable performance to the DeepJSCC-PNOMA and outperforms other multi-user SemCom baseline methods.</description>

      <title>QSMnet-INR: Single-Orientation Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping via Implicit Neural Representation in k-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping (QSM) quantifies tissue magnetic susceptibility from magnetic-resonance phase data and plays a crucial role in brain microstructure imaging, iron-deposition assessment, and neurological-disease research. However, single-orientation QSM inversion remains highly ill-posed because the dipole kernel exhibits a cone-null region in the Fourier domain, leading to streaking artifacts and structural loss. To overcome this limitation, we propose QSMnet-INR, a deep, physics-informed framework that integrates an Implicit Neural Representation (INR) into the k-space domain. The INR module continuously models multi-directional dipole responses and explicitly completes the cone-null region, while a frequency-domain residual-weighted Dipole Loss enforces physical consistency. The overall network combines a 3D U-Net-based QSMnet backbone with the INR module through alternating optimization for end-to-end joint training. Experiments on the 2016 QSM Reconstruction Challenge, a multi-orientation GRE dataset, and both in-house and public single-orientation clinical data demonstrate that QSMnet-INR consistently outperforms conventional and recent deep-learning approaches across multiple quantitative metrics. The proposed framework shows notable advantages in structural recovery within cone-null regions and in artifact suppression. Ablation studies further confirm the complementary contributions of the INR module and Dipole Loss to detail preservation and physical stability. Overall, QSMnet-INR effectively alleviates the ill-posedness of single-orientation QSM without requiring multi-orientation acquisition, achieving high accuracy, robustness, and strong cross-scenario generalization-highlighting its potential for clinical translation.</description>

      <title>PathCo-LatticE: Pathology-Constrained Lattice-Of Experts Framework for Fully-supervised Few-Shot Cardiac MRI Segmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09779v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Few-shot learning (FSL) mitigates data scarcity in cardiac MRI segmentation but typically relies on semi-supervised techniques sensitive to domain shifts and validation bias, restricting zero-shot generalizability. We propose PathCo-LatticE, a fully supervised FSL framework that replaces unlabeled data with pathology-guided synthetic supervision. First, our Virtual Patient Engine models continuous latent disease trajectories from sparse clinical anchors, using generative modeling to synthesize physiologically plausible, fully labeled 3D cohorts. Second, Self-Reinforcing Interleaved Validation (SIV) provides a leakage-free protocol that evaluates models online with progressively challenging synthetic samples, eliminating the need for real validation data. Finally, a dynamic Lattice-of-Experts (LoE) organizes specialized networks within a pathology-aware topology and activates the most relevant experts per input, enabling robust zero-shot generalization to unseen data without target-domain fine-tuning. We evaluated PathCo-LatticE in a strict out-of-distribution (OOD) setting, deriving all anchors and severity statistics from a single-source domain (ACDC) and performing zero-shot testing on the multi-center, multi-vendor M&amp;Ms dataset. PathCo-LatticE outperforms four state-of-the-art FSL methods by 4.2-11% Dice starting from only 7 labeled anchors, and approaches fully supervised performance (within 1% Dice) with only 19 labeled anchors. The method shows superior harmonization across four vendors and generalization to unseen pathologies. [Code will be made publicly available].</description>

      <title>Rates and architectures for learning geometrically non-trivial operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep learning methods have proven capable of recovering operators between high-dimensional spaces, such as solution maps of PDEs and similar objects in mathematical physics, from very few training samples. This phenomenon of data-efficiency has been proven for certain classes of elliptic operators with simple geometry, i.e., operators that do not change the domain of the function or propagate singularities. However, scientific machine learning is commonly used for problems that do involve the propagation of singularities in a priori unknown ways, such as waves, advection, and fluid dynamics. In light of this, we expand the learning theory to include double fibration transforms--geometric integral operators that include generalized Radon and geodesic ray transforms. We prove that this class of operators does not suffer from the curse of dimensionality: the error decays superalgebraically, that is, faster than any fixed power of the reciprocal of the number of training samples. Furthermore, we investigate architectures that explicitly encode the geometry of these transforms, demonstrating that an architecture reminiscent of cross-attention based on levelset methods yields a parameterization that is universal, stable, and learns double fibration transforms from very few training examples. Our results contribute to a rapidly-growing line of theoretical work on learning operators for scientific machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.09664v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe SynthPix, a synthetic image generator for Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) with a focus on performance and parallelism on accelerators, implemented in JAX. SynthPix supports the same configuration parameters as existing tools but achieves a throughput several orders of magnitude higher in image-pair generation per second. SynthPix was developed to enable the training of data-hungry reinforcement learning methods for flow estimation and for reducing the iteration times during the development of fast flow estimation methods used in recent active fluids control studies with real-time PIV feedback. We believe SynthPix to be useful for the fluid dynamics community, and in this paper we describe the main ideas behind this software package.</description>

      <title>LiM-YOLO: Less is More with Pyramid Level Shift and Normalized Auxiliary Branch for Ship Detection in Optical Remote Sensing Imagery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Applying general-purpose object detectors to ship detection in satellite imagery presents significant challenges due to the extreme scale disparity and morphological anisotropy of maritime targets. Standard architectures utilizing stride-32 (P5) layers often fail to resolve narrow vessels, resulting in spatial feature dilution. In this work, we propose LiM-YOLO, a specialized detector designed to resolve these domain-specific conflicts. Based on a statistical analysis of ship scales, we introduce a Pyramid Level Shift Strategy that reconfigures the detection head to P2-P4. This shift ensures compliance with Nyquist sampling criteria for small objects while eliminating the computational redundancy of deep layers. To further enhance training stability on high-resolution inputs, we incorporate a Group Normalized Convolutional Block for Linear Projection (GN-CBLinear), which mitigates gradient volatility in micro-batch settings. Validated on SODA-A, DOTA-v1.5, FAIR1M-v2.0, and ShipRSImageNet-V1, LiM-YOLO demonstrates superior detection accuracy and efficiency compared to state-of-the-art models. The code is available at https://github.com/egshkim/LiM-YOLO.</description>

      <title>INRetouch: Context Aware Implicit Neural Representation for Photography Retouching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03848v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Professional photo editing remains challenging, requiring extensive knowledge of imaging pipelines and significant expertise. While recent deep learning approaches, particularly style transfer methods, have attempted to automate this process, they often struggle with output fidelity, editing control, and complex retouching capabilities. We propose a novel retouch transfer approach that learns from professional edits through before-after image pairs, enabling precise replication of complex editing operations. We develop a context-aware Implicit Neural Representation that learns to apply edits adaptively based on image content and context, and is capable of learning from a single example. Our method extracts implicit transformations from reference edits and adaptively applies them to new images. To facilitate this research direction, we introduce a comprehensive Photo Retouching Dataset comprising 100,000 high-quality images edited using over 170 professional Adobe Lightroom presets. Through extensive evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach not only surpasses existing methods in photo retouching but also enhances performance in related image reconstruction tasks like Gamut Mapping and Raw Reconstruction. By bridging the gap between professional editing capabilities and automated solutions, our work presents a significant step toward making sophisticated photo editing more accessible while maintaining high-fidelity results. The source code and the dataset are publicly available at https://omaralezaby.github.io/inretouch .</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05992v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning is among the recent representation learning methods that have shown performance gains in several downstream tasks including semantic segmentation. This paper evaluates strong data augmentation, one of the most important components for self-supervised contrastive learning's improved performance. Strong data augmentation involves applying the composition of multiple augmentation techniques on images. Surprisingly, we find that the existing data augmentations do not always improve performance for semantic segmentation for medical images. We experiment with other augmentations that provide improved performance.</description>

      <title>Tokenizing Motion: A Generative Approach for Scene Dynamics Compression</title>

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel generative video compression framework that leverages motion pattern priors, derived from subtle dynamics in common scenes (e.g., swaying flowers or a boat drifting on water), rather than relying on video content priors (e.g., talking faces or human bodies). These compact motion priors enable a new approach to ultra-low bitrate communication while achieving high-quality reconstruction across diverse scene contents. At the encoder side, motion priors can be streamlined into compact representations via a dense-to-sparse transformation. At the decoder side, these priors facilitate the reconstruction of scene dynamics using an advanced flow-driven diffusion model. Experimental results illustrate that the proposed method can achieve superior rate-distortion-performance and outperform the state-of-the-art conventional-video codec Enhanced Compression Model (ECM) on-scene dynamics sequences.

Abstract: Online Cardiac Monitoring (OCM) emerges as a compelling enhancement for the next-generation video streaming platforms. It enables various applications including remote health, online affective computing, and deepfake detection. Yet the physiological information encapsulated in the video streams has been long neglected. In this paper, we present the design and implementation of CardioLive, the first online cardiac monitoring system in video streaming platforms. We leverage the naturally co-existed video and audio streams and devise CardioNet, the first audio-visual network to learn the cardiac series. It incorporates multiple unique designs to extract temporal and spectral features, ensuring robust performance under realistic video streaming conditions. To enable the Service-On-Demand online cardiac monitoring, we implement CardioLive as a plug-and-play middleware service and develop systematic solutions to practical issues including changing FPS and unsynchronized streams. Extensive experiments have been done to demonstrate the effectiveness of our system. We achieve a Mean Square Error (MAE) of 1.79 BPM error, outperforming the video-only and audio-only solutions by 69.2% and 81.2%, respectively. Our CardioLive service achieves average throughputs of 115.97 and 98.16 FPS when implemented in Zoom and YouTube. We believe our work opens up new applications for video stream systems. We will release the code soon.</description>
