      <title>Perception-Consistency Multimodal Large Language Models Reasoning via Caption-Regularized Policy Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While multimodal large language models excel at tasks that integrate visual perception with symbolic reasoning, their performance is often undermined by a critical vulnerability: perception-induced errors that propagate through the reasoning chain. Current reinforcement learning (RL) fine-tuning methods, while enhancing reasoning abilities, largely fail to address the underlying misalignment between visual grounding and the subsequent reasoning process. To address this challenge, we propose \textbf{Caption-Regularized Policy Optimization (CapPO)}, a novel RL framework that explicitly enforces perceptual consistency during policy optimization. CapPO integrates two key mechanisms: (1) a caption-based consistency regularization, which minimizes the divergence between responses conditioned on raw images and those conditioned on captions, thereby anchoring reasoning to semantically faithful visual content; and (2) a KL-weighted advantage estimation scheme, which adaptively scales reinforcement signals to strengthen perceptually consistent trajectories while suppressing spurious correlations. Extensive experiments on five math-focused and five general reasoning benchmarks demonstrate that CapPO achieves competitive performance, yielding gains of +6.0% accuracy on math-related tasks and +2.4% on general reasoning tasks over the base Qwen2.5-VL-7B model. Moreover, ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of each component, while error analysis reveals that CapPO significantly reduces perception-related mistakes compared with baselines. Overall, CapPO provides a simple yet effective framework for improving multimodal reasoning.</description>

      <title>Cross-Modal Retrieval with Cauchy-Schwarz Divergence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21339</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21339v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective cross-modal retrieval requires robust alignment of heterogeneous data types. Most existing methods focus on bi-modal retrieval tasks and rely on distributional alignment techniques such as Kullback-Leibler divergence, Maximum Mean Discrepancy, and correlation alignment. However, these methods often suffer from critical limitations, including numerical instability, sensitivity to hyperparameters, and their inability to capture the full structure of the underlying distributions. In this paper, we introduce the Cauchy-Schwarz (CS) divergence, a hyperparameter-free measure that improves both training stability and retrieval performance. We further propose a novel Generalized CS (GCS) divergence inspired by H\"older's inequality. This extension enables direct alignment of three or more modalities within a unified mathematical framework through a bidirectional circular comparison scheme, eliminating the need for exhaustive pairwise comparisons. Extensive experiments on six benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in both bi-modal and tri-modal retrieval tasks. The code of our CS/GCS divergence is publicly available at https://github.com/JiahaoZhang666/CSD.</description>

      <title>MusicWeaver: Coherent Long-Range and Editable Music Generation from a Beat-Aligned Structural Plan</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21714v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current music generators capture local textures but often fail to model long-range structure, leading to off-beat outputs, weak section transitions, and limited editing capability. We present MusicWeaver, a music generation model conditioned on a beat-aligned structural plan. This plan serves as an editable intermediate between the input prompt and the generated music, preserving global form and enabling professional, localized edits. MusicWeaver consists of a planner, which translates prompts into a structural plan encoding musical form and compositional cues, and a diffusion-based generator, which synthesizes music under the plan's guidance. To assess generation and editing quality, we introduce two metrics: the Structure Coherence Score (SCS) for evaluating long-range form and timing, and the Edit Fidelity Score (EFS) for measuring the accuracy of realizing plan edits. Experiments demonstrate that MusicWeaver achieves state-of-the-art fidelity and controllability, producing music closer to human-composed works. Music results can be found on our project page: https://musicweaver.github.io/.</description>

      <title>StableDub: Taming Diffusion Prior for Generalized and Efficient Visual Dubbing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The visual dubbing task aims to generate mouth movements synchronized with the driving audio, which has seen significant progress in recent years. However, two critical deficiencies hinder their wide application: (1) Audio-only driving paradigms inadequately capture speaker-specific lip habits, which fail to generate lip movements similar to the target avatar; (2) Conventional blind-inpainting approaches frequently produce visual artifacts when handling obstructions (e.g., microphones, hands), limiting practical deployment. In this paper, we propose StableDub, a novel and concise framework integrating lip-habit-aware modeling with occlusion-robust synthesis. Specifically, building upon the Stable-Diffusion backbone, we develop a lip-habit-modulated mechanism that jointly models phonemic audio-visual synchronization and speaker-specific orofacial dynamics. To achieve plausible lip geometries and object appearances under occlusion, we introduce the occlusion-aware training strategy by explicitly exposing the occlusion objects to the inpainting process. By incorporating the proposed designs, the model eliminates the necessity for cost-intensive priors in previous methods, thereby exhibiting superior training efficiency on the computationally intensive diffusion-based backbone. To further optimize training efficiency from the perspective of model architecture, we introduce a hybrid Mamba-Transformer architecture, which demonstrates the enhanced applicability in low-resource research scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that StableDub achieves superior performance in lip habit resemblance and occlusion robustness. Our method also surpasses other methods in audio-lip sync, video quality, and resolution consistency. We expand the applicability of visual dubbing methods from comprehensive aspects, and demo videos can be found at https://stabledub.github.io.</description>

      <title>Taming Flow-based I2V Models for Creative Video Editing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21917v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although image editing techniques have advanced significantly, video editing, which aims to manipulate videos according to user intent, remains an emerging challenge. Most existing image-conditioned video editing methods either require inversion with model-specific design or need extensive optimization, limiting their capability of leveraging up-to-date image-to-video (I2V) models to transfer the editing capability of image editing models to the video domain. To this end, we propose IF-V2V, an Inversion-Free method that can adapt off-the-shelf flow-matching-based I2V models for video editing without significant computational overhead. To circumvent inversion, we devise Vector Field Rectification with Sample Deviation to incorporate information from the source video into the denoising process by introducing a deviation term into the denoising vector field. To further ensure consistency with the source video in a model-agnostic way, we introduce Structure-and-Motion-Preserving Initialization to generate motion-aware temporally correlated noise with structural information embedded. We also present a Deviation Caching mechanism to minimize the additional computational cost for denoising vector rectification without significantly impacting editing quality. Evaluations demonstrate that our method achieves superior editing quality and consistency over existing approaches, offering a lightweight plug-and-play solution to realize visual creativity.</description>

      <title>Zero-Effort Image-to-Music Generation: An Interpretable RAG-based VLM Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Image-to-Music (I2M) generation has garnered significant attention, with potential applications in fields such as gaming, advertising, and multi-modal art creation. However, due to the ambiguous and subjective nature of I2M tasks, most end-to-end methods lack interpretability, leaving users puzzled about the generation results. Even methods based on emotion mapping face controversy, as emotion represents only a singular aspect of art. Additionally, most learning-based methods require substantial computational resources and large datasets for training, hindering accessibility for common users. To address these challenges, we propose the first Vision Language Model (VLM)-based I2M framework that offers high interpretability and low computational cost. Specifically, we utilize ABC notation to bridge the text and music modalities, enabling the VLM to generate music using natural language. We then apply multi-modal Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and self-refinement techniques to allow the VLM to produce high-quality music without external training. Furthermore, we leverage the generated motivations in text and the attention maps from the VLM to provide explanations for the generated results in both text and image modalities. To validate our method, we conduct both human studies and machine evaluations, where our method outperforms others in terms of music quality and music-image consistency, indicating promising results.

      <title>WoW: Towards a World omniscient World model Through Embodied Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22642v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Humans develop an understanding of intuitive physics through active interaction with the world. This approach is in stark contrast to current video models, such as Sora, which rely on passive observation and therefore struggle with grasping physical causality. This observation leads to our central hypothesis: authentic physical intuition of the world model must be grounded in extensive, causally rich interactions with the real world. To test this hypothesis, we present WoW, a 14-billion-parameter generative world model trained on 2 million robot interaction trajectories. Our findings reveal that the model's understanding of physics is a probabilistic distribution of plausible outcomes, leading to stochastic instabilities and physical hallucinations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that this emergent capability can be actively constrained toward physical realism by SOPHIA, where vision-language model agents evaluate the DiT-generated output and guide its refinement by iteratively evolving the language instructions. In addition, a co-trained Inverse Dynamics Model translates these refined plans into executable robotic actions, thus closing the imagination-to-action loop. We establish WoWBench, a new benchmark focused on physical consistency and causal reasoning in video, where WoW achieves state-of-the-art performance in both human and autonomous evaluation, demonstrating strong ability in physical causality, collision dynamics, and object permanence. Our work provides systematic evidence that large-scale, real-world interaction is a cornerstone for developing physical intuition in AI. Models, data, and benchmarks will be open-sourced.</description>

      <title>Small Stickers, Big Meanings: A Multilingual Sticker Semantic Understanding Dataset with a Gamified Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01668v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stickers, though small, are a highly condensed form of visual expression, ubiquitous across messaging platforms and embraced by diverse cultures, genders, and age groups. Despite their popularity, sticker retrieval remains an underexplored task due to the significant human effort and subjectivity involved in constructing high-quality sticker query datasets. Although large language models (LLMs) excel at general NLP tasks, they falter when confronted with the nuanced, intangible, and highly specific nature of sticker query generation. To address this challenge, we propose a threefold solution. First, we introduce Sticktionary, a gamified annotation framework designed to gather diverse, high-quality, and contextually resonant sticker queries. Second, we present StickerQueries, a multilingual sticker query dataset containing 1,115 English and 615 Chinese queries, annotated by over 60 contributors across 60+ hours. Lastly, Through extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluation, we demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances query generation quality, retrieval accuracy, and semantic understanding in the sticker domain. To support future research, we publicly release our multilingual dataset along with two fine-tuned query generation models.</description>

      <title>MultiVox: A Benchmark for Evaluating Voice Assistants for Multimodal Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) has empowered omni models to act as voice assistants capable of understanding spoken dialogues. These models can process multimodal inputs beyond text, such as speech and visual data, enabling more context-aware interactions. However, current benchmarks fall short in comprehensively evaluating how well these models generate context-aware responses, particularly when it comes to implicitly understanding fine-grained speech characteristics, such as pitch, emotion, timbre, and volume or the environmental acoustic context such as background sounds. Additionally, they inadequately assess the ability of models to align paralinguistic cues with complementary visual signals to inform their responses. To address these gaps, we introduce MultiVox, the first omni voice assistant benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of voice assistants to integrate spoken and visual cues including paralinguistic speech features for truly multimodal understanding. Specifically, MultiVox includes 1000 human-annotated and recorded speech dialogues that encompass diverse paralinguistic features and a range of visual cues such as images and videos. Our evaluation on 10 state-of-the-art models reveals that, although humans excel at these tasks, current models consistently struggle to produce contextually grounded responses.</description>

      <title>VidCRAFT3: Camera, Object, and Lighting Control for Image-to-Video Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07531v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Controllable image-to-video (I2V) generation transforms a reference image into a coherent video guided by user-specified control signals. In content creation workflows, precise and simultaneous control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction enhances both accuracy and flexibility. However, existing approaches typically treat these control signals separately, largely due to the scarcity of datasets with high-quality joint annotations and mismatched control spaces across modalities. We present VidCRAFT3, a unified and flexible I2V framework that supports both independent and joint control over camera motion, object motion, and lighting direction by integrating three core components. Image2Cloud reconstructs a 3D point cloud from the reference image to enable precise camera motion control. ObjMotionNet encodes sparse object trajectories into multi-scale optical flow features to guide object motion. The Spatial Triple-Attention Transformer integrates lighting direction embeddings via parallel cross-attention. To address the scarcity of jointly annotated data, we curate the VideoLightingDirection (VLD) dataset of synthetic static-scene video clips with per-frame lighting-direction labels, and adopt a three-stage training strategy that enables robust learning without fully joint annotations. Extensive experiments show that VidCRAFT3 outperforms existing methods in control precision and visual coherence. Code and data will be released.
