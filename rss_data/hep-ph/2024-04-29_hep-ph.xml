      <title>Lorentz violating backgrounds from quadratic, shift-symmetric, ultralight dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an effective theory for a shift-symmetric, quadratically-coupled, ultralight spin-0 field. The leading CP-conserving interactions with Standard Model fields in the effective theory arise at dimension 8. We discuss the renormalization group evolution and positivity bounds on these operators, as well as their possible UV origins. Assuming that the spin-0 field is associated with an ultralight dark matter candidate, we discuss the effects of the dimension-8 operators on experiments searching for the oscillation of fundamental constants and Lorentz violation. We find that the direct bounds on these two effects are of similar strength but rather weak, corresponding to a UV cutoff scale of keV order, as they are mediated by dimension-8 operators.</description>

      <title>The properties of $\phi(2170)$ and its three-body nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17664v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We summarize the results we obtained for the partial decay widths of $\phi(2170)$ into two-body final states formed by a $\bar K$ and a Kaonic resonance, like $K(1460)$, $K_1(1270)$, as well as to final states constituted by a $\phi$ and an $\eta/\eta^\prime$ mesons. The results obtained are compared with the values extracted from experimental data on the corresponding branching ratios, which were determined by the BESIII collaboration. A reasonable agreement is found, which together with the previous reproduction of the mass, width, and cross section for the process $e^+ e^-\to \phi f_0$ strongly indicates the molecular nature of $\phi(2170)$ as a $\phi K\bar K$ system.</description>

      <title>The $\Xi_c^{(\prime,*)}N$ interactions and the corresponding bound states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17935</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17935v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of a one-boson-exchange model, we conduct a comprehensive investigation into the interactions between an $S-$wave charm-strange baryon $\Xi_c^{(\prime,*)}$ and a nucleon by considering the $S-D$ wave mixing effects and the coupled channel effects. Our results can predict a serial of possible $S-$wave $\Xi_c^{(\prime,*)}N$ molecular candidates. The one-pion-exchange model together with the coupled channel effects play an important role in generating the $\Xi_cN$ bound states with $I(J^P)=0(0^+)$ and $0(1^+)$, the one-pion-exchange effective potentials are strong enough to bind the $\Xi_c^{\prime}N$ states with $I(J^P)=0(0^+)$ and $0(1^+)$ and $\Xi_c^*N$ states with $I(J^P)=0(1^+)$ and $0(2^+)$, and the intermediate range and short range force originating from the scalar meson and the vector mesons exchanges interactions are essential in formative to the isovector $S-$wave $\Xi_c^{(\prime,*)}N$. We expect the experiments looking for these possible molecular candidates.</description>

      <title>Wide Binary Evaporation by Dark Solitons: Implications from the GAIA Catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18099</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18099v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An analytic calculation is given for binary star evaporation under the tidal perturbation from randomly distributed, spatially extended dark objects. In particular, the Milky Way's wide binary star population are susceptible to such disruption from dark matter solitons of comparable and larger sizes. We identify high-probability `halo-like' wide binaries in GAIA EDR3 with separations larger than 0.1 parsec. Survival of the farthest-separated candidates will provide a novel gravitational probe to dark matter in the form of solitons. In case of dilute axion-like solitons, the observational sensitivity is shown to extend into the axion mass range $m_a \sim 10^{-17}-10^{-15}$ eV.</description>

      <title>The effects of Lorentz violation on unitarity in $e^{+}e^{-} \rightarrow \mu^{+}\mu^{-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigated two models incorporating LIV with nonminimal coupling in the ( e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^- ) scattering process, employing cross-section calculations. We found that utilizing the dual electromagnetic tensor led to violations of unitarity in both vector and axial scenarios. However, in the other model the preservation of unitarity by the electromagnetic tensor in both scenarios implies its potential superiority, this implies promising prospects for this CPT and Lorentz symmetry-breaking model.</description>

      <title>Exploring Transport Properties of Quark-Gluon Plasma with a Machine-Learning assisted Holographic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18217v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the holographic model, which incorporates the equation of state (EoS) and baryon number susceptibility for different flavors, we calculate the drag force, jet quenching parameter, and diffusion coefficient of the heavy quark at finite temperature and chemical potential. The holographic results for the diffusion coefficient align with lattice data for $N_f = 0$ and $N_f = 2+1$, falling within their error margins. The holographic diffusion coefficient for heavy quark in the systems of different flavors agrees with the fitting results of ALICE data well. The jet quenching parameter in our model demonstrates strong consistency with the results from both RHIC and LHC for different flavors. By comparing the experimental data with other models, we can confirm the validity of our holographic model calculation. The work reinforces the potential of bottom-up holographic model in advancing our understanding of transport properties of hot and dense quark-gluon plasma.</description>

      <title>Electrophilic scalar hair from rotating magnetized stars and effects of cosmic neutrino background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18309v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultralight electrophilic scalar field can mediate a long-range force or radiate from a pulsar or a magnetar if the scalar field has a coupling with the Goldreich-Julian charge density or the net electron charge density of the star. The interaction of the electron with the long-range scalar profile results in a spatial variation of the electron mass. A scalar induced magnetic field is created due to such interaction. The mass of the scalar in such cases is constrained by the radius of the star. The scalar field can also radiate from a binary system or an isolated star if the mass of the scalar is less than the orbital frequency and the spin frequency respectively. The electrophilic scalar radiation can contribute to the orbital period loss of binary systems and pulsar spin-down. Comparing with existing and projected experimental sensitivities, we obtain constraints on scalar coupling with ultralight mass. Some of these bounds are stronger than the existing fifth force constraints. The constraints on the scalar coupling can be significantly screened if the scalar has a coupling with the ubiquitous cosmic neutrino background. Improvements in experimental sensitivity and observations of compact objects with stronger magnetic fields and higher angular velocities could further refine these bounds.</description>

      <title>CP violation in the CKM mixing for degenerate quark masses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18358v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CP violation in the CKM mixing is discussed for the case of quark mass degeneracy that is approximate in the quark mass hierarchy limit. Differing from the traditional understanding of CP vanishing for degenerate masses, we find degenerate symmetry plays a non-trivial role in CP violation. The minimal flavor structure model is reviewed to demonstrate the role of degenerate symmetry in quark flavor mixing, particularly in CP violation. This relation between mass hierarchy and CP violation helps us understand the origin of CP violation and assists the construction of the flavor model.</description>

      <title>Detailed derivation of the $\mathbf{^3P_0}$ strong decay model applied to baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide an in-detail derivation through the $^3P_0$ pair creation model of the transition matrix for a baryon decaying into a meson-baryon system. The meson's analysis was conducted in Ref. [1] and we extend the same formalism to the baryon sector, focusing on the $\Delta(1232)\to \pi N$ strong decay width because all hadrons involved in the reaction are very well established, the two hadrons in the final state are stable, avoiding further analysis, all quarks are light and so equivalent, and the decay width of the process is relatively well measured. Taking advantage of a Gaussian expansion method for the hadron's radial wave functions, the expression of the invariant matrix element can be related with the mean-square radii of hadrons involved in the decay. We use their experimental measures in such a way that only the strength of the quark-antiquark pair creation from the vacuum is a free parameter. This is then taken from our previous study of strong decay widths in the meson sector, obtaining a quite compatible result with experiment for the calculated $\Delta(1232)\to \pi N$ decay width.</description>

      <title>Light tetraquark states with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the masses of light tetraquark states $ud\bar{u}\bar{d}$ , $us\bar{u}\bar{s}$ and $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ with exotic quantum numbers $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$ using the method of QCD sum rules. It is found that there is no tetraquark operator with two Lorentz indices coupling to the $2^{+-}$ quantum numbers. To investigate such tetraquark states, we construct the interpolating tetraquark currents with three Lorentz indices and without derivative operator. We calculate the correlation functions up to dimension 10 condensates, and extract the $2^{+-}$ invariant functions via the projector operator. Our results show that the masses of the $ud\bar{u}\bar{d}$, $us\bar{u}\bar{s}$ and $ss\bar{s}\bar{s}$ tetraquark states with $J^{PC}=2^{+-}$ are about $3.3-3.5 ~\mathrm{GeV}$, $3.5-3.6 ~\mathrm{GeV}$ and $3.6 ~\mathrm{GeV}$, respectively. We further discuss the strong decays of these light tetraquarks into the two-meson and baryon-antibaryon final states, and suggest to search for them in the $\rho\pi, \omega\pi, \phi\pi$, $b_{1}\pi$, $h_{1}\pi$, $K\bar K^\ast, K\bar{K}_{1}$, $\Delta\bar{\Delta}$, $\Sigma^{\ast} \bar{\Sigma }^{\ast}$, $\Xi^{\ast} \bar{\Xi }^{\ast}$, $\Omega\bar{\Omega }$ channels in the future.</description>

      <title>Controlling the Flavour Changing Neutral Couplings of Multi-Higgs Doublets Models through Unitary Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18559v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Unitary Flavour Violation to produce Multi-Higgs Doublets Models where all flavour parameters are contained within three unitary matrices. After that, we identify two of its subclasses, the left and right models, which have naturally suppressed tree-level Flavour Changing Neutral Couplings that easily avoid the experimental constraints derived from neutral meson mixing. Then, we show that left models can accomodate spontaneous CP violation when all quarks have Flavour Changing Neutral Couplings. Finally, we illustrate these concepts by considering a specific implementation with three Higgs doublets.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy can tell whether $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_{cs}(3985)$ are resonances or virtual states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been extended and heated discussions on the nature of the two exotic states, $Z_c(3900)$ and $Z_{cs}(3985)$, particularly whether they are resonances or virtual states. We demonstrate for the first time that the femtoscopic technique can be used to unambiguously distinguish between such two scenarios. More concretely, we show that the $D^0D^{*-}$/$D^0D_s^{*-}$ correlation functions are significantly different in the high-momentum region, especially in small collision systems of the order of 1 fm, as produced in pp collisions at the LHC, which can unambiguously tell whether $Z_c(3900)$/$Z_{cs}(3985)$ is a resonant or a virtual state. For the $Z_{cs}(3985)$, the $D^0D_s^{*-}$ results at zero momentum are significantly different in the two scenarios. We hope all these discoveries can stimulate further experimental studies and help clarify the nature of the many exotic states discovered.</description>

Abstract: Hadron spectroscopy is an important tool towards the study of internal quark dynamics in a composite system. The present article focuses on the study of resonance spectra of strange baryons with S=-2, -3. The non-relativistic approach utilizes screened potential as hypercentral one to obtain masses.

      <title>Bayesian Active Search on Parameter Space: a 95 GeV Spin-0 Resonance in the ($B-L$)SSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18653v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the attempt to explain possible data anomalies from collider experiments in terms of New Physics (NP) models, computationally expensive scans over their parameter spaces are typically required in order to match theoretical predictions to experimental observations. Under the assumption that anomalies seen at a mass of about 95 GeV by the Large Electron-Positron (LEP) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC) experiments correspond to a NP signal, which we attempt to interpret as a spin-0 resonance in the $(B-L)$ Supersymmetric Standard Model ($(B-L)$SSM), chosen as an illustrative example, we introduce a novel Machine Learning (ML) approach based on a multi-objective active search method, called b-CASTOR, able to achieve high sample efficiency and diversity, due to the use of probabilistic surrogate models and a volume based search policy, outperforming competing algorithms, such as those based on Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods.</description>

      <title>A semi-analytical $x$-space solution for parton evolution -- Application to non-singlet and singlet DGLAP equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18667v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel semi-analytical method for parton evolution. It is based on constructing a family of analytic functions spanning $x$-space which is closed under the considered evolution equation. Using these functions as a basis, the original integro-differential evolution equation transforms into a system of coupled ordinary differential equations, which can be solved numerically by restriction to a suitably chosen finite subsystem. The evolved distributions are obtained as analytic functions in $x$ with numerically obtained coefficients, providing insight into the analytic behavior of the evolved parton distributions. As a proof-of-principle, we apply our method to the leading order non-singlet and singlet DGLAP equation. Comparing our results to traditional Mellin-space methods, we find good agreement. The method is implemented in the code $\texttt{POMPOM}$ in $\texttt{Mathematica}$ as well as in $\texttt{Python}$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational wave detection of DFSZ axion models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18703v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As a promising dark matter candidate, the axion particle can naturally solve the strong CP problem of the standard model through the U(1) Peccei-Quinn symmetry-breaking process. However, detecting this high-energy process poses a significant challenge for colliders. We precisely calculate the phase transition gravitational wave signals of this symmetry-breaking process in the popular DFSZ axion model. By comparing the signals with the expected sensitivity of Cosmic Explorer and Einstein Telescope, we demonstrate that Cosmic Explorer could detect this process with a signal-to-noise ratio higher than 8 for the benchmark points. Furthermore, by performing Fisher analysis, we find that if signals are observed, the bubble wall velocity will be the first phase transition parameter to be determined. The future gravitational wave detectors are expected to provide a new approach to exploring concrete axion models.</description>

      <title>Classical Casimir pressure in the presence of axion dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the effects of an oscillating axion field on the pressure between two metallic plates. We consider the situation where a magnetic field parallel to the plates is present and show that the electric field induced by the coupling of the axion to photons leads to resonances. When the boundary plates are perfect conductors, the resonances are infinitely thin whilst they are broadened when the conductivity of the boundary plates is taken into account. The resonances take place at the tower of distances close to dn = (2n+1){\pi}/m where m is the axion mass and have a finite width and height depending on the conductivity. The resulting resonant pressure on the plate depends on the induced polarisation at the surface of the plates. We investigate the reach of future Casimir experiments in terms of the axion mass and the conductivity of the boundary plates. We find that for large enough conductivities, the axion-induced pressure could be larger than the quantum Casimir effect between the plates.</description>

      <title>Diffusion coefficient matrix for multiple conserved charges: a Kubo approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strongly interacting matter created in relativistic heavy-ion collisions possesses several conserved quantum numbers, such as baryon number, strangeness, and electric charge. The diffusion process of these charges can be characterized by a diffusion matrix that describes the mutual influence of the diffusion of various charges. We derive the Kubo relations for evaluating diffusion coefficients as elements of a diffusion matrix. We further demonstrate that in the weak coupling limit, the diffusion matrix elements obtained through Kubo relations reduce to those obtained from kinetic theory with an appropriate identification of the relaxation times. We illustrate this evaluation in a toy model of two interacting scalar fields with two conserved charges.</description>

      <title>The Landscape of Unfolding with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18807v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent innovations from machine learning allow for data unfolding, without binning and including correlations across many dimensions. We describe a set of known, upgraded, and new methods for ML-based unfolding. The performance of these approaches are evaluated on the same two datasets. We find that all techniques are capable of accurately reproducing the particle-level spectra across complex observables. Given that these approaches are conceptually diverse, they offer an exciting toolkit for a new class of measurements that can probe the Standard Model with an unprecedented level of detail and may enable sensitivity to new phenomena.</description>

      <title>NNLL-fast 2.0: Coloured Sparticle Production at the LHC Run 3 with $\sqrt{S}$ = 13.6 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report on updated precision predictions for total cross sections of coloured supersymmetric particle production at the LHC with a centre-of-mass energy of $\sqrt S$ = 13.6 TeV, computed with the modern PDF4LHC21 set. The cross sections are calculated at an approximated NNLO accuracy in QCD and contain corrections from the threshold resummation of soft-gluon emission up to NNLL accuracy as well as Coulomb-gluon contributions including bound-state terms. The corrections are found to increase the cross sections and reduce the theoretical uncertainty as compared to the best available fixed-order calculations. These predictions constitute the state-of-the-art calculations and update the existing results for $\sqrt S$ = 13 TeV. We make our new results publicly available in the version 2.0 update to the code package NNLL-fast.</description>

Abstract: We present a QCD analysis of the twist-three parton distribution functions associated with the spin-orbit correlation of quarks and gluons in the nucleon. We derive a novel longitudinal momentum sum rule which may be regarded as the momentum version of the Jaffe-Manohar spin sum rule. The result is also applicable to spinless hadrons and nuclei with trivial modifications.</description>

      <title>The $\Omega_c \to \pi^+ \, (\pi^0,\, \eta)\, \pi \Xi^*$ reactions and the two $\Xi(1820)$ states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have studied the $\Omega_c \to \pi^+ (\pi^0, \eta) \pi \Xi^*$ decays, where the final $\pi \Xi^*$ comes from the decay of two resonances around the nominal $\Xi(1820)$, which are generated from the interaction of coupled channels made of a pseudoscalar and a baryon of the decuplet. The $\pi \Xi^*$ mass distributions obtained in the six different reactions studied are quite different and we single out four of them, which are free of a tree level contribution, showing more clearly the effect of the resonances. The lower mass resonance is clearly seen as a sharp peak, but the higher mass resonance manifests itself through an interference with the lower one that leads to a dip in the mass distribution around $1850 \, {\rm MeV}$. Such a feature is similar to the dip observed in the $s$-wave $\pi \pi$ cross section around the $980 \, {\rm MeV}$ coming from the interference of the $f_0(500)$ and $f_0(980)$ resonances. Its observation in coming upgrades of present facilities will shed light on the existence of these two resonances and their nature.</description>

      <title>Studies of $T_{cc}^+$ Decays and Transverse-Momentum-Dependent $J/\psi$ Production Using Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe the application of effective field theories for quantum chromodynamics (QCD) to two bound states involving heavy quarks: the $T_{cc}^+$ exotic meson and the $J/\psi$. We study the decay of the $T_{cc}^+$ in an effective theory for hadronic molecules, and find agreement with experiment. We also use the nonrelativistic QCD (NRQCD) factorization formalism to derive the leading-order transverse momentum dependent fragmentation functions (FFs) for quarks and gluons fragmenting to $J/\psi$. We then make use of these TMD FFs to compare the $J/\psi$ production mechanisms of light quark fragmentation and photon-gluon fusion, where the conclusions we draw can motivate future experiments at the Electron Ion Collider, shedding light on the inner structure of nucleons and testing ideas from NRQCD factorization. These results showcase the utility of effective field theories in explaining experiments and testing key concepts in nuclear/particle physics.</description>

      <title>Quintessential interpretation of the evolving dark energy in light of DESI</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.05722v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent result of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) in combination with other cosmological data shows evidence of the evolving dark energy parameterized by $w_0w_a$CDM model. We interpret this result in terms of a quintessential scalar field and demonstrate that it can explain the DESI result even though it becomes eventually phantom in the past. Relaxing the assumption on the functional form of the equation-of-state parameter $w=w(a)$, we also discuss a more realistic quintessential model. The implications of the DESI result for Swampland conjectures, cosmic birefringence, and the fate of the Universe are discussed as well.</description>

      <title>False Vacuum Decay Rate From Thin To Thick Walls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a single real scalar field in flat spacetime with a polynomial potential up to $\phi^4$, that has a local minimum, the false vacuum, and a deeper global minimum, the true vacuum. When the vacua are almost degenerate we are in the thin wall regime, while as their difference in potential energy increases, we approach the thick wall regime. We give explicit simple formulae for the decay rate of the false vacuum in 3 and 4 spacetime dimensions. Our results include a careful treatment both of the bounce action, which enters at the exponent of the decay rate, and of the functional determinant at one loop, which determines the prefactor. The bounce action is computed analytically as an expansion in the thin wall parameter in generic $D$ dimensions. We find that truncating such an expansion at second order we obtain a remarkably accurate bounce action also deep into thick wall regimes. We calculate the functional determinant numerically in 3 and 4 dimensions and fit the results with simple polynomials of the same thin wall parameter. This allows us to write the complete one-loop decay rate as a compact expression, which works accurately from thin to thick wall regimes.</description>

      <title>Ricci Reheating on the Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17654v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a non-minimally coupled (NMC) scalar spectator field in non-oscillatory inflationary scenarios, where there is a transition from inflation to kination domination (KD). Engineering a realistic finite-duration transition through a CMB-compatible inflaton potential, we calculate the initial tachyonic growth of the NMC field during KD and perform lattice simulations of the subsequent non-linear dynamics. We characterize the regularization effect on the tachyonic growth, either due to self-interactions, or via gravitational backreaction when the NMC field grows to dominate the energy of the universe. Our study provides the first realistic treatment of the dynamics, with significant improvements compared to previous work, where one or more of the following aspects were assumed: ($i$) the background expansion can be neglected during the tachyonic growth, ($ii$) coherence of the NMC field, ($iii$) coherence of the inflaton, ($iv$) instantaneous transition, and ($v$) a KD equation of state of exactly $w = 1$. Using our methodology, which requires none of the above assumptions, we determine the conditions to achieve proper reheating, i.e. energetic dominance of the NMC field over the inflaton. We characterize the time and energy scales of the problem, either for backreaction due to self-interactions, or (as a novelty of this work) due to gravitational effects. Finally, we calculate $\mathcal{O}(1)$ lattice correction factors to analytic scaling relations derived by some of us in previous work. This enables simple future studies without the need to run lattice simulations.</description>

      <title>Contribution to differential $\pi^0$ and $\gamma_\mathrm{dir}$ modification in small systems from color fluctuation effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17660v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A major complication in the search for jet quenching in proton- or deuteron-nucleus collision systems is the presence of physical effects which influence the experimental determination of collision centrality in the presence of a hard process. For example, in the proton color fluctuation picture, protons with a large Bjorken-$x$ ($x \gtrsim 0.1$) parton interact more weakly with the nucleons in the nucleus, leading to a smaller (larger) than expected yield in large (small) activity events. A recent measurement by PHENIX compared the yield of neutral pion and direct photon production in $d$+Au collisions, under the argument that the photon yields correct for such biases, and the difference between the two species is thus attributable to final-state effects (i.e., jet quenching). The main finding suggests a significant degree of jet quenching for hard processes in small systems. In this paper, I argue that the particular photon and pion events selected by PHENIX arise from proton configurations with significantly different Bjorken-$x$ distributions, and thus are subject to different magnitudes of modification in the color fluctuation model. Using the results of a previous global analysis of RHIC and LHC data, I show that potentially all of the pion-to-photon difference in PHENIX data can be described by a proton color fluctuation picture at a quantitative level before any additional physics from final-state effects is required. This finding reconciles the interpretation of the PHENIX measurement with others at RHIC and LHC, which have found no observable evidence for jet quenching in small systems.</description>

      <title>Exploring system size dependence of jet modification in heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In relativistic heavy-ion collisions, jet quenching in quark-gluon plasma (QGP) has been extensively studied, revealing important insights into the properties of the color deconfined nuclear matter. Over the past decade, there has been a surge of interest in the exploration of QGP droplets in small collision systems like $p$+$p$ or $p$+A collisions driven by the observation of collective flow phenomena. However, the absence of jet quenching, a key QGP signature, in these systems poses a puzzle. Understanding how jet quenching evolves with system size is crucial for uncovering the underlying physics. In this study, we employ the linear Boltzmann transport (LBT) model to investigate jet modification in $^{96}$Ru+$^{96}$Ru, $^{96}$Zr+$^{96}$Zr, and $^{197}$Au+$^{197}$Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}=200$ GeV. Our findings highlight the system size sensitivity exhibited by jet nuclear modification factor ($R_\mathrm{AA}$) and jet shape ($\rho$), contrasting to the relatively weak responses of jet mass ($M$), girth ($g$) and momentum dispersion ($p_\mathrm{T}{D}$) to system size variations. These results offer invaluable insights into the system size dependence of the QGP properties and to be validated experimentally at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider.</description>

      <title>The Cosmological Impact of Brane-Chern-Simons Massive Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel extension of massive gravity theory; the Brane-Chern-Simons massive gravity theory. We explore the cosmological implications of this theory by deriving the background equations and demonstrating the existence of self-accelerating solutions. Interestingly, our theory suggests the existence of self-accelerating mechanisms that originate from an effective cosmological constant, leading to intriguing possibilities for understanding the nature of cosmic acceleration. Furthermore, we perform a tensor perturbation analysis to investigate the propagation of gravitational waves in this framework. We derive the dispersion relation for gravitational waves and study their behavior in the Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Roberson-Waker cosmology within the context of Brane-Chen-Simons massive gravity. Utilizing the latest Union2 type Ia supernova dataset comprising $557$ SNIa events, we provide observational support for our theoretical framework, indicating that the Brane-Chern-Simons massive gravity theory is consistent with cosmological observations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing dark siren cosmology through multi-band gravitational wave synergetic observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-band gravitational-wave (GW) standard siren observations are poised to herald a new era in the study of cosmic evolution. These observations offer higher signal-to-noise ratios and improved localizations compared to those achieved with single-band GW detection, which are crucial for the cosmological applications of dark sirens. In this work, we explore the role multi-band GW synergetic observations will play in measuring cosmological parameters, particularly in comparison with single GW observatory data. We used mock multi-band dark siren data from third-generation GW detectors and the baseline Decihertz Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory to infer cosmological parameters. Our analysis was conservative, involving only the 89 actual GW events from the current Gravitational Wave Transient Catalogs in our data simulation, facilitating a direct comparison with existing dark siren results. Multi-band GW observations significantly improve sky localization accuracy by two to three orders of magnitude over single-band observations, although their impact on luminosity distance error remains limited. This results in a substantial improvement in the constraints on matter density and the Hubble constant, enhancing them by $75\%$ to $85\%$ and $65\%$ to $82\%$, respectively. We conclude that the significant potential of multi-band GW synergistic observations for detecting GW signals and resolving the Hubble tension is highly promising and warrants anticipation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tabular data stands out as one of the most frequently encountered types in high energy physics. Unlike commonly homogeneous data such as pixelated images, simulating high-dimensional tabular data and accurately capturing their correlations are often quite challenging, even with the most advanced architectures. Based on the findings that tree-based models surpass the performance of deep learning models for tasks specific to tabular data, we adopt the very recent generative modeling class named conditional flow matching and employ different techniques to integrate the usage of Gradient Boosted Trees. The performances are evaluated for various tasks on different analysis level with several public datasets. We demonstrate the training and inference time of most high-level simulation tasks can achieve speedup by orders of magnitude. The application can be extended to low-level feature simulation and conditioned generations with competitive performance.</description>

Abstract: We present a flow-based method for simulating and calculating nucleation rates of first-order phase transitions in scalar field theory on a lattice. Motivated by recent advancements in machine learning tools, particularly normalizing flows for lattice field theory, we propose the ``partitioning flow-based Markov chain Monte Carlo (PFMCMC) sampling" method to address two challenges encountered in normalizing flow applications for lattice field theory: the ``mode-collapse" and ``rare-event sampling" problems. Using a (2+1)-dimensional real scalar model as an example, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our PFMCMC method in modeling highly hierarchical order parameter probability distributions and simulating critical bubble configurations. These simulations are then used to facilitate the calculation of nucleation rates. We anticipate the application of this method to (3+1)-dimensional theories for studying realistic cosmological phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Dressing vs. Fixing: On How to Extract and Interpret Gauge-Invariant Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18582</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18582v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is solid consensus among physicists and philosophers that, in gauge field theory, for a quantity to be physically meaningful or real, it must be gauge-invariant. Yet, every ``elementary" field in the Standard Model of particle physics is actually gauge-variant. This has led a number of researchers to insist that new manifestly gauge-invariant approaches must be established. Indeed, in the foundational literature, dissatisfaction with standard methods for reducing gauge symmetries has been expressed: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is deemed conceptually dubious, while gauge fixing suffers the same limitations and is subject to the same criticisms as coordinate choices in General Relativity.
  An alternative gauge-invariant proposal was recently introduced in the literature, the so-called ``dressing field method" (DFM). It is a mathematically subtle tool, and unfortunately prone to be confused with simple gauge transformations, hence with standard gauge~fixings. As a matter of fact, in the physics literature the two are often conflated, and in the philosophy community some doubts have been raised about whether there is any substantial difference between them. Clarifying this issue is of special significance for anyone interested in both the foundational issues of gauge theories and their invariant formulation. It is thus our objective to establish as precisely as possible the technical and conceptual distinctions between the DFM and gauge fixing.</description>

      <title>Torsion-induced axions in string theory, quantum gravity and the cosmological tensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.18741v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss the role of torsion in string theory on inducing pseudoscalar degrees of freedom (axions), which in turn couple to (gravitational) Chern-Simons (CS) anomalous terms. Such interactions can induce inflation, of running vacuum type, not requiring external inflaton fields, through condensation of the anomalous terms as a consequence of primordial chiral gravitational-wave (GW) tensor perturbations in a weak-quantum gravity setting. The presence of an UV cutoff for the GW quantum graviton modes opens up the system, leading to a dissipative behaviour realised via the presence of non trivial imaginary parts of the gravitational CS terms. The naive estimate of the life time of inflation based on such imaginary parts, which afflict the pertinent GW Hamiltonian, is quite consistent with the estimates of the duration of inflation based on an analysis of the condensate-induced linear-axion-potential by means of dynamical systems. Such quantum-gravity effects can also contribute positively to the alleviation of cosmological tensions if they survive today. In the talk we discuss the conditions under which such a result may be achieved. We also discuss the potential role of other axions in string theory, coming from compactification, in inducing enhanced densities of primordial black holes during RVM inflation, thereby contributing to significantly increased percentages of these black holes that can play the role of dark matter components. Moreover, under certain circumstances, that we shall discuss in some detail, it is also possible that the initially massless torsion-induced axions can acquire a non-trivial mass during the radiation era, thereby providing additional dark matter components in the Universe. With regards to this aspect, we also emphasise the role of massive right-handed neutrinos, provided that such excitations exist in the relevant spectra.</description>

      <title>"Rosenbluth" separation of the $J/\psi $ near-threshold photoproduction -- an access to the gluon Gravitational Form Factors at high $t$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18776v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform analysis of the near-threshold $J/\psi $ photoproduction data off the proton based on the high skewness expansion ( $\xi \to 1$) of the cross-section in Ref. [1]. This expansion allows to separate the corresponding gluonic form factors, in much the same way as this is done in the electro-magnetic case with the Rosenbluth separation. We examine the independence of the extracted form factors with the photon beam energy. In Ref. [1] these form factors, in the leading-moment approximation, are related to the proton's gluon Gravitational Form Factors (gGFF). Using this approximation, we compare the extracted data points with lattice calculations in the region of momentum transfer squared of $1&lt;|t|&lt;2$ GeV$^{2}$, where the data and lattice results overlap. Such analysis demonstrates the possibility of extracting some combinations of the gGFFs from the data at high $t$, complementary to the lattice calculations available in the low $t$ region. However, higher statistics is needed to more accurately check the predicted $\xi$-scaling behavior of the data and compare with the lattice results, thus testing the theoretical assumptions used in Ref. [1].</description>

      <title>Weak equivalence principle and nonrelativistic limit of general dispersion relations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18811v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the weak equivalence principle in the context of modified dispersion relations, a prevalent approach to quantum gravity phenomenology. We find that generic modified dispersion relations violate the weak equivalence principle. The acceleration in general depends on the mass of the test body, unless the Hamiltonian is either two-homogeneous in the test particles' 4-momenta or the corresponding Lagrangian differs from the homogeneous case by a total derivative only. The key ingredient of this calculation is a $3+1$ decomposition of the parametrization invariant relativistic test particle action derived from the dispersion relation. Additionally, we apply a perturbative expansion in the test particle's spatial velocity and the inverse speed of light. To quantify our result, we provide a general formula for the E\"otv\'os factor of modified dispersion relations. As a specific example, we study the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e dispersion relation. Comparing the ensuing non-vanishing E\"otv\'os factor to recent data from the MICROSCOPE experiment, we obtain a bound of $\kappa^{-1}\geq10^{15}{\rm GeV}/c^2.$.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the development of collective flow in high energy proton proton collisions with a multiphase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18829v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the collective flow development in high energy proton proton (pp) collisions with a multiphase transport model (AMPT) based on PYTHIA8 initial conditions with a sub-nucleon structure. It is found that the PYTHIA8 based AMPT model can reasonably describe both the charged hadron productions and elliptic flow experimental data measured in pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV. By turning on the parton and hadron rescatterings in AMPT separately, we find that the observed collective flow in pp collisions is largely developed during the parton evolutions, while no significant flow effect can be generated with the pure hadronic rescatterings. It is also shown that the parton escape mechanism is important for describing both the magnitude of the two-particle cumulant and the sign of the four-particle cumulants. We emphasize that the strong mass ordering of the elliptic flow results from the coalescence process in the transport model can thus be regarded as unique evidence related to the creation of deconfined parton matter in high energy pp collisions.</description>

      <title>Phantom matter: a challenging solution to the cosmological tensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18845</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18845v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The idea of composite dark energy (DE) is quite natural since on general grounds we expect that the vacuum energy (associated to the cosmological term $\Lambda$) may appear in combination with other effective forms of DE, collectively denoted $X$. This was indeed the old proposal from 2006, (cf. Ref.[41]) called the `$\Lambda$XCDM model', which was primordially designed to explain the cosmic coincidence problem. We now find that it can also have far reaching consequences on the current cosmological tensions on $H_0$ and the growth of large scale structure (LSS). The $\Lambda$XCDM may involve both a phantom-like component $X$ and a constant cosmological term $\Lambda$ (positive or negative) or even a running one, $\Lambda=\Lambda(H)$. In the current work, we deal with a simplified version of the model and exploit the possibility that $X$ behaves as `phantom matter' (PM). The latter appears in stringy versions of the running vacuum model (RVM). Unlike phantom DE, it satisfies the strong energy condition like usual matter, hence bringing to bear positive pressure at the expense of negative energy. Bubbles of PM may appear in the manner of a transitory `phantom vacuum' tunneled into the late universe before it heads towards a new de Sitter era, thereby offering a crop field for the growing of structures earlier than expected. Using SNIa, cosmic chronometers, transversal BAO, LSS data and the full CMB likelihood from Planck 2018, we find that the tensions virtually disappear in this stringy RVM scenario characterized by axionic dark matter. The value of $H_0$ emerging from our analysis proves compatible with SH0ES to within less than $0.25\sigma$ and the LSS growth tension is nonexistent. The statistical information criteria point to very strong evidence in favor of the PM solution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.05392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An insightful way of presenting the LHC limits on dijet resonances is the coupling-mass plot for a $Z'$ boson that has flavor-independent quark interactions. This also illustrates the comparison of low-mass LHC sensitivity with constraints on the flavor-independent $Z'$ boson from electroweak and quarkonium measurements. To derive these constraints, we compute the $Z'$ mixing with the $Z$, the photon, and the $\Upsilon$ meson, emphasizing the logarithmic dependence on the masses of the new electroweak-charged fermions (``anomalons") required to cancel the gauge anomalies. We update the coupling-mass plot, extending it for $Z'$ masses from 5 GeV to 5 TeV.</description>

      <title>LIGO-VIRGO constraints on dark matter and leptogenesis triggered by a first order phase transition at high scale</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.08888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the possibility of constraining a scenario with high scale first order phase transition (FOPT) responsible for the cogenesis of baryon and dark matter using gravitational wave (GW) (non)-observations. While the FOPT at high scale is responsible for generating baryon asymmetry through leptogenesis and dark matter via the \textit{mass-gain} mechanism, the resulting GW spectrum falls within the ongoing LIGO-VIRGO experimental sensitivity. The dark matter is preferred to be in the non-thermal ballpark with sub-GeV masses and the criteria of successful dark matter relic rules out a large portion of the parameter space consistent with high scale FOPT and successful leptogenesis. Some part of the parameter space allowed from dark matter and leptogenesis criteria also gives rise to a large signal-to-noise ratio at ongoing experiments and hence can be disfavoured in a conservative way from the non-observation of such stochastic GW background. Future data from ongoing and planned experiments will offer a complementary and indirect probe of the remaining parameter space which is typically outside the reach of any direct experimental probe.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.03125v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the presence of electromagnetic fields, both axions and gravitational waves (GWs) induce oscillating magnetic fields: a potentially detectable fingerprint of their presence. We demonstrate that the response is largely dictated by the symmetries of the instruments used to search for it. Focussing on low mass axion haloscopes, we derive selection rules that determine the parametric sensitivity of different detector geometries to axions and GWs, and which further reveal how to optimise the experimental geometry to maximise both signals. The formalism allows us to forecast the optimal sensitivity to GWs in the range of 100 kHz to 100 MHz for instruments such as ABRACADABRA, BASE, ADMX SLIC, SHAFT, WISPLC, and DMRadio.</description>

      <title>Parton Distributions from Boosted Fields in the Coulomb Gauge</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.14960v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new method to calculate parton distribution functions (PDFs) from lattice correlations of boosted quarks and gluons in the Coulomb gauge. Compared to the widely used gauge-invariant Wilson-line operators, these correlations greatly simplify the renormalization thanks to the absence of linear power divergence. Besides, they enable access to larger off-axis momenta under preserved 3D rotational symmetry, as well as enhanced long-range precision that facilitates the Fourier transform. We verify the factorization formula that relates this new observable to the quark PDF at one-loop order in perturbation theory. Moreover, through a lattice calculation of the pion valence quark PDF, we demonstrate the aforementioned advantage and features of the Coulomb gauge correlation and show that it yields consistent result with the gauge-invariant method. This opens the door to a more efficient way to calculate parton physics on the lattice.</description>

      <title>Exploring CP Violation beyond the Standard Model and the PQ Quality with Electric Dipole Moments</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.01090v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In some models of physics beyond the Standard Model (SM), one of the leading low energy consequences of the model appears in the form of the chromo-electric dipole moments (CEDMs) of the gluons and light quarks. We examine if these CEDMs can be distinguished from the QCD $\theta$-term through the experimentally measurable nuclear and atomic electric dipole moments (EDMs) in both cases with and without the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) mechanism solving the strong CP problem. We find that the nucleon EDMs show a distinctive pattern when the EDMs are dominantly induced by the light quark CEDMs without the PQ mechanism. In the presence of the PQ mechanism, the QCD $\theta$-parameter corresponds to the vacuum value of the axion field, which might be induced either by CEDMs or by UV-originated PQ breaking other than the QCD anomaly, for instance the PQ breaking by quantum gravity effects. We find that in case with the PQ mechanism the nucleon EDMs have a similar pattern regardless of what is the dominant source of EDMs among the CEDMs and $\theta$-term, unless there is a significant cancellation between the contributions from different sources. In contrast, some nuclei or atomic EDMs can have characteristic patterns significantly depending on the dominant source of EDMs, which may allow identifying the dominant source among the CEDMs and $\theta$-term. Yet, discriminating the gluon CEDM from the QCD $\theta$-parameter necessitates additional knowledge of low energy parameters induced by the gluon CEDM, which is not available at the moment. Our results imply that EDMs can reveal unambiguous sign of CEDMs while identifying the origin of the axion vacuum value, however it requires further knowledge of low energy parameters induced by the gluon CEDM.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Implications of Gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ in the CMB and BBN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.07955</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.07955v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We calculate the effects of a light, very weakly-coupled boson $X$ arising from a spontaneously broken $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry on $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ as measured by the CMB and $Y_p$ from BBN. Our focus is the mass range $1 \; {\rm eV} \lesssim m_X \lesssim 100 \; {\rm MeV}$; masses lighter than about an ${\rm eV}$ have strong constraints from fifth-force law constraints, while masses heavier than about 100 MeV are constrained by other probes. We do not assume $X$ began in thermal equilibrium with the SM; instead, we allow $X$ to freeze-in from its very weak interactions with the SM. We find $U(1)_{B-L}$ is more strongly constrained by $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ than previously considered. The bounds arise from the energy density in electrons and neutrinos slowly siphoned off into $X$ bosons, which become nonrelativistic, redshift as matter, and then decay, dumping their slightly larger energy density back into the SM bath causing $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &gt; 0$. While some of the parameter space has complementary constraints from stellar cooling, supernova emission, and terrestrial experiments, we find future CMB observatories can access regions of mass and coupling space not probed by any other method. In gauging $U(1)_{B-L}$, we assume the $[U(1)_{B-L}]^3$ anomaly is canceled by right-handed neutrinos, and so our $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ calculations have been carried out in two scenarios: neutrinos have Dirac masses, or, right-handed neutrinos acquire Majorana masses. In the latter scenario, we comment on the additional implications of thermalized right-handed neutrinos decaying during BBN. We also briefly consider the possibility that $X$ decays into dark sector states. If these states behave as radiation, we find weaker constraints, whereas if they are massive, there are stronger constraints, though now from $\Delta N_{\rm eff} &lt; 0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.03889v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cores of dense stars are a powerful laboratory for studying feebly coupled particles such as axions. Some of the strongest constraints on axionlike particles and their couplings to ordinary matter derive from considerations of stellar axion emission. In this work we study the radiation of axionlike particles from degenerate neutron star matter via a lepton-flavor-violating coupling that leads to muon-electron conversion when an axion is emitted. We calculate the axion emission rate per unit volume (emissivity) and by comparing with the rate of neutrino emission, we infer upper limits on the lepton-flavor-violating coupling that are at the level of $|g_{ae\mu}| \lesssim 10^{-6}$. For the hotter environment of a supernova, such as SN 1987A, the axion emission rate is enhanced and the limit is stronger, at the level of $|g_{ae\mu}| \lesssim 10^{-11}$, competitive with laboratory limits. Interestingly, our derivation of the axion emissivity reveals that axion emission via the lepton-flavor-violating coupling is suppressed relative to the familiar lepton-flavor-preserving channels by the square of the plasma temperature to muon mass ratio, which is responsible for the relatively weaker limits.</description>

Abstract: We compare the relative importance of different mechanisms for polarized $J/\psi$ production in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering processes at large $Q^2$. The transverse momentum dependent (TMD) factorization framework and nonrelativistic quantum chromodynamics are used to study the leading contributions from light quark fragmentation to polarized $J/\psi$, and compared to direct production via photon-gluon fusion, which can proceed through color-singlet as well as color-octet mechanisms. We identify kinematic regimes where light quark fragmentation dominates, allowing for the extraction of the $^3S_1^{[8]}$ matrix element, as well as regimes where photon gluon fusion dominates, suggesting that the gluon TMD parton distribution function can be probed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09005v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a leptogenesis scenario where baryon asymmetry generation is assisted by the kinetic motion of the majoron, $J$, in the process of lepton-number violating inverse decays of a right-handed neutrino, $N$. We investigate two distinct scenarios depending on the sources of majoron kinetic motion: 1) the misalignment mechanism, and 2) the kinetic misalignment mechanism. The former case can naturally generate the observed baryon asymmetry for the majoron mass $m_J \gtrsim \,{\rm TeV}$ and the right-handed neutrino's mass $M_{N} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,{\rm GeV}$. However, an additional decay channel of the majoron is required to avoid the overclosure problem of the majoron oscillation. The later scenario works successfully for $m_J \lesssim 100\,{\rm keV}$, and $M_{N} \lesssim 10^9\,{\rm GeV}$ while $M_N$ can be even far below the temperature of the electroweak phase transition as long as sufficiently large kinetic misalignment is provided. We also find that a sub-$100\,{\rm keV}$ majoron is a viable candidate for dark matter.</description>

Abstract: We examine the sensitivity reaches of several LHC far detectors, such as FASER2, MATHUSLA, ANUBIS, SND@LHC, and FACET, to five simplified quirk scenarios. We include the next-to-leading order QCD corrections in our simulation of quirk events, which enhance the total production rate and increase the fraction of events in the forward direction for most cases. We calculate the time scales for the quirk pair to lose energy through radiations and for the quirk pair annihilation. Our results show that these far detectors can offer promising probes to the quirk scenario, complementing the searches at the main detectors. Especially, FACET and FASER2 detectors can surpass the majority of searches conducted at the LHC main detector, with the exception of the HSCP search, for the color-neutral quirk $\mathcal{E}$.</description>

Abstract: It was recently proposed that five-dimensional inflation can relate the causal size of the observable universe to the present weakness of gravitational interactions by blowing up an extra compact dimension from the microscopic fundamental length of gravity to a large size in the micron range, as required in the Dark Dimension proposal. Here, we compute the power spectrum of all primordial fluctuations emerging from a 5-dimensional inflaton in a slow-roll region of its potential, showing an interesting change of behaviour at large scales corresponding to angles larger than about 10 degrees in the sky.</description>

      <title>SKA Sensitivity to Sub-GeV Dark Matter Decay: Synchrotron Radio Emissions in White Dwarf Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02707v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) in detecting synchrotron radiation emitted from the decay of sub-GeV dark matter (dark matter with masses below the GeV scale) in the presence of strong magnetic fields. As a concrete setup, we consider scenarios where the magnetosphere of a magnetic white dwarf overlaps with dense dark matter environments, such as those surrounding a primordial black hole. Our study reveals that the encounters of compact objects such as white dwarfs and black holes offer a promising avenue for upcoming radio telescopes to probe the properties of light dark matter, which has been less explored compared with more conventional heavier (masses above the GeV scale) dark matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.11327v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the effects of renormalisation group running of the Wilson coefficients in Standard Model Effective Field Theory, using the process $pp \to t \bar{t}h$ as a showcase. We consider both strong and top Yukawa running effects, since the latter can be relevant in presence of large Wilson coefficients. We study the difference between the use of a dynamical and fixed renormalisation scale by exploring different scenarios for the higher-dimensional operators at the high energy scale of new physics, assumed to be at the TeV scale.</description>

      <title>The Minimal Massive Majoron Seesaw Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.13417v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A convincing explanation of the smallness of neutrino masses is represented by the Type-I Seesaw mechanism, where the two measured neutrino mass differences can be generated by introducing at least two right-handed neutrinos. In an ultraviolet complete model, it is possible to dynamically generate the heavy Majorana scale through the spontaneous symmetry breaking of a global Abelian symmetry and the most economical realisation consists in coupling the two exotic neutral leptons to a singlet complex scalar field. The associated Goldstone boson is often dubbed as Majoron, which may achieve a non-vanishing mass by means of a small term that explicitly breaks the Abelian symmetry. In a generic model, the neutrino and Majoron mass generation mechanisms are completely uncorrelated. In this paper, instead, we reduce the landscape of possible models proposing a unique, minimal and predictive framework in which these two types of masses are strictly tied and arise from the same source. Bounds from various terrestrial and astrophysical experiments are discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.09331v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: I show that if a dimensionless parameter is tuned to be close to the boundary of the positivity domain and symmetry breaking is driven by a cubic term in the Lagrangian, the scale of the physics of symmetry breaking in a quantum field theory as measured by the Higgs mass can be much greater than the dimensional scales in the classical Lagrangian. Radiative corrections produce large and physically important corrections, helping to stabilize the large VEV. The resulting picture contrasts sharply with the "modern" view of QFT as an effective field theory. I describe how this mechanism might produce the GUT scale in an SU(5) model in which the dimensional parameters in the Lagrangian are at the low scale.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.12830v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss the spectrum and the internal composition of ground and excited four-quark states in the charm and bottom energy region. To this end we extend previous calculations within the framework of the relativistic four-body Faddeev-Yakubovsky equation to include quantum numbers with $J^{P C} = 0^{++} , 0^{-+} , 1^{--} , 1^{+-}$ and $1^{+ +}$ and study their internal composition in terms of heavy-light meson pairs, hadroquarkonia and diquark-antidiquark clusters. We observe similar patterns in the charm and bottom energy region with different compositions of the four-quark states depending on $J^{P C}$ quantum numbers. Most notably, we find that all states with $C \cdot P = +1$ are dominated by heavy-light meson contributions, whereas for axialvector states with $J^{P C} = 1^{+-}$ including the $Z_c (3900)$ we find a much more complicated picture depending on the flavour content. We systematically compare our results for the spectrum with existing experimental results and provide predictions for future analyses.</description>

Abstract: Taking the tri-bimaximal flavor mixing pattern as a particular basis, we propose a new way to expand the $3\times 3$ unitary Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS) lepton flavor mixing matrix $U$ in powers of the magnitude of its smallest element $\xi \equiv \left|U^{}_{e 3}\right| \simeq 0.149$. Such a Wolfenstein-like parametrization of $U$ allows us to easily describe the salient features and fine structures of flavor mixing and CP violation, both in vacuum and in matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the differential equations for the two remaining integral topologies contributing to the leading colour two-loop amplitudes for $pp \rightarrow t\bar{t}j$. We derive differential equations for the master integrals by solving the integration-by-parts identities over finite fields. Of the two systems of differential equations, one is presented in canonical '${\rm d} \log$' form, while the other is found to have an elliptic sector. For the elliptic topology we identify the relevant elliptic curve, and present the differential equations in a more general form which depends quadratically on $\epsilon$ and contains non-logarithmic one-forms in addition to the canonical ${\rm d} \log$'s. We solve the systems of differential equations numerically using generalised series expansions with the boundary terms obtained using the auxiliary mass flow method. A summary of all one-loop and two-loop planar topologies is presented including the list of alphabet letters for the '${\rm d} \log$' form systems and high-precision boundary values.</description>

      <title>Holography for Sp(2$N_c$) Gauge Dynamics: from Composite Higgs to Technicolour</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.14480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study Sp(2$N_c$) gauge dynamics with two Dirac fermion flavours in the fundamental representation. These strongly coupled systems underlie some composite Higgs models with a global symmetry breaking pattern SU(4)$\rightarrow$Sp(4), leading to a light quartet of pseudo-Goldstone bosons that can play the role of the Higgs. Including four-fermion interactions can rotate the vacuum to a technicolour breaking pattern. Using gauge/gravity duality, we study the underlying gauge dynamics. Our model incorporates the $N_c$-specific running of the fermion anomalous dimension and can thus distinguish between specific gauge groups. We determine the bound-state spectrum of the UV SU(4)$\rightarrow$Sp(4) symmetry breaking model, also including fermion masses and mass splitting, and display the $N_c$ dependence. The inclusion of a four-fermion interaction shows the emergence of three Goldstone bosons on the path to technicolour dynamics.</description>

Abstract: This article is based on a pair of lectures given at the 2005 SLAC Summer Institute. Our goal is to motivate why most physicists and astrophysicists accept the hypothesis that the most massive, compact objects seen in many astrophysical systems are described by the black hole solutions of general relativity. We describe the nature of the most important black hole solutions, the Schwarzschild and the Kerr solutions. We discuss gravitational collapse and stability in order to motivate why such objects are the most likely outcome of realistic astrophysical collapse processes. Finally, we discuss some of the observations which -- so far at least -- are totally consistent with this viewpoint, and describe planned tests and observations which have the potential to falsify the black hole hypothesis, or sharpen still further the consistency of data with theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2304.13617v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work we probe the QCD Anderson transition by studying spectral distributions of the massless overlap operator on gauge configurations created by the twisted mass at finite temperature collaboration (tmfT) with 2+1+1 flavors of dynamical quarks and the Iwasaki gauge action. We assess finite-size and discretization effects by considering two different lattice spacings and several physical volumes, and mimic the approach to the continuum limit through stereographic projection. Fitting the inflection points of the participation ratios of the overlap Dirac eigenmodes, we obtain estimates of the temperature dependence of the mobility edge, below which quark modes are localized. We observe that it is well-described by a quadratic polynomial and systematically vanishes at temperatures below the pseudocritical one of the chiral transition. In fact, our best estimates within errors overlap with that of the chiral phase transition temperature of QCD in the chiral limit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17112v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: If the Universe has non-trivial spatial topology, observables depend on both the parameters of the spatial manifold and the position and orientation of the observer. In infinite Euclidean space, most cosmological observables arise from the amplitudes of Fourier modes of primordial scalar curvature perturbations. Topological boundary conditions replace the full set of Fourier modes with specific linear combinations of selected Fourier modes as the eigenmodes of the scalar Laplacian. We present formulas for eigenmodes in orientable Euclidean manifolds with the topologies $E_{1}-E_{6}$, $E_{11}$, $E_{12}$, $E_{16}$, and $E_{18}$ that encompass the full range of manifold parameters and observer positions, generalizing previous treatments. Under the assumption that the amplitudes of primordial scalar curvature eigenmodes are independent random variables, for each topology we obtain the correlation matrices of Fourier-mode amplitudes (of scalar fields linearly related to the scalar curvature) and the correlation matrices of spherical-harmonic coefficients of such fields sampled on a sphere, such as the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB). We evaluate the detectability of these correlations given the cosmic variance of the observed CMB sky. We find that topologies where the distance to our nearest clone is less than about 1.2 times the diameter of the last scattering surface of the CMB give a correlation signal that is larger than cosmic variance noise in the CMB. This implies that if cosmic topology is the explanation of large-angle anomalies in the CMB, then the distance to our nearest clone is not much larger than the diameter of the last scattering surface. We argue that the topological information is likely to be better preserved in three-dimensional data, such as will eventually be available from large-scale structure surveys.</description>

      <title>Effects of Annihilation with Low-Energy Neutrinos on High-Energy Neutrinos from Binary Neutron Star Mergers and Rare Core-Collapse Supernovae</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.05137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the possibility that high-energy (HE) neutrinos produced from choked jets can be annihilated with low-energy (LE) neutrinos emitted from the accretion disk around a black hole in binary neutron star mergers and rare core-collapse supernovae. For HE neutrinos produced close to the stellar center ($\lesssim 10^{9}-10^{12}$ cm), we find that the emerging all-flavor spectrum for neutrinos of $E\gtrsim 0.1-1$ PeV could be modified by a factor $E^{-n}$ with $n\gtrsim 0.4-0.5$ under realistic conditions. Flavor evolution of LE neutrinos does not affect this result but can change the emerging flavor composition of HE neutrinos. As a consequence, the above annihilation effect may need to be considered for HE neutrinos produced from choked jets at small radii. We briefly discuss the annihilation effects for different HE neutrino production models and point out that such effects could be tested through precise measurements of the diffuse neutrino spectrum and flavor composition.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.01930v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a novel effective-field-theory-based approach for extracting two-body scattering information from finite volume energies, serving as an alternative to L\"uscher's method. By explicitly incorporating one-pion exchange, we overcome the challenging left-hand cut problem in L\"uscher's method and can handle finite volume energy levels both below and above the left-hand cut. Applied to the lattice data for $DD^*$ scattering at a pion mass of 280 MeV, as an illustrative example, our results reveal the significant impact of the one-pion exchange on P-wave and S-wave phase shifts. The pole position of the $T_{cc}(3875)^+$ state, extracted from the finite-volume energy levels at this pion mass while taking into account left-hand cut effects, range corrections and partial-wave mixing, is consistent with a near-threshold resonance. This study demonstrates, for the first time, that two-body scattering information can be reliably extracted from lattice spectra including the left-hand cut.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.05733v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by quantum field theory (QFT) considerations, we present new representations of the Euler-Beta function and tree-level string theory amplitudes using a new two-channel, local, crossing symmetric dispersion relation. Unlike standard series representations, the new ones are analytic everywhere except at the poles, sum over poles in all channels and include contact interactions, in the spirit of QFT. This enables us to consider mass-level truncation, which preserves all the features of the original amplitudes. By starting with such expansions for generalized Euler-Beta functions and demanding QFT like features, we single out the open superstring amplitude. We demonstrate the difficulty in deforming away from the string amplitude and show that a class of such deformations can be potentially interesting when there is level truncation. Our considerations also lead to new QFT-inspired, parametric representations of the Zeta function and $\pi$, which show fast convergence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06847v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Perturbative renormalization provides the bedrock of understanding quantum field theories. In this work, I point out an alternative way of renormalizing quantum field theories, which is naturally encountered and well known for the case of large N scalar field theories. In terms of bare parameters, this non-perturbative alternative renormalization differs qualitatively from its perturbative cousin: in the continuum limit, the bare coupling constant goes to zero instead of infinity, and there is no wave-function counterterm. Despite these differences, the resulting n-point functions of the theory are finite. I provide explicit results for alternative renormalization for the O(N) model and QCD with $N_f=12$ flavors in 3+1 dimensions.</description>

Abstract: We perform a lattice calculation on the radiative decay of $D_s^*$ using the (2+1)-flavor Wilson-clover gauge ensembles generated by CLQCD collaboration. A method allowing us to calculate the form factor with zero transfer momentum is proposed and applied to the radiative transition $D_s^*\rightarrow D_s\gamma$ and the Dalitz decay $D_s^*\rightarrow D_s e^+e^-$. After a continuum extrapolation using three lattice spacings, we obtain $\Gamma(D_s^*\rightarrow D_s \gamma)=0.0549(54)$ keV, where the error is purely statistical. The result is consistent with previous lattice calculations but with a error reduced to only a fifth of the before. The Dalitz decay rate is also calculated for the first time and the ratio with the radiative transition is found to be $R_{ee}=0.624(3)\%$. A total decay width of $D_s^*$ can then be determined as 0.0587(54) keV taking into account the experimental branching fraction. Combining with the most recent experimental measurement on the branching fraction of the purely leptonic decay $D_s^{+,*}\rightarrow e^+\nu_e$, we obtain the quantity $f_{D_s^*}|V_{cs}|=(190.5^{+55.1}_{-41.7_{\textrm{stat.}}}\pm 12.6_{\textrm{syst.}})$ MeV, where the stat. is only the statistical error from the experiment, and syst. results from the experimental systematic uncertainty and the lattice statistical error. Our result leads to an improved systematic uncertainty compared to $42.7_{\textrm{syst.}}$ obtained using previous lattice prediction of total decay width $0.070(28)$ keV as the input.</description>

      <title>Constraints on an Anisotropic Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15782v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the possibility of global anisotropy of the universe. We consider an altered Friedmann Lemaitre Robertson Walker metric in which there are different scale factors along the three different axes of space. We construct the corresponding altered Friedmann equations. We show that any initial anisotropies decrease into the future. At late times, the difference in Hubble parameters changes as $1/\sqrt{t}$ in a radiation dominated era and as $1/t$ in a matter dominated era. We use constraints from Big Bang Nucleosynthesis and the Cosmic Microwave Background to constrain the level of anisotropies at early times. We also examine how the approach back in time to the singularity is radically altered; happening much more abruptly, as a function of density, in an anisotropic universe. We also mention improved bounds that can arise from measurements of primordial gravitons, Weakly interacting massive particles, and neutrinos.</description>

      <title>Pauli-Villars regularization of Kaluza-Klein Casimir energy with Lorentz symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00056</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00056v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Pauli-Villars regularization is appropriate to discuss the UV sensitivity of low-energy observables because it mimics how the contributions of new particles at high energies cancel large quantum corrections from the light particles in the effective field theory. We discuss the UV sensitivity of the Casimir energy density and pressure in an extra-dimensional model in this regularization scheme, and clarify the condition on the regulator fields to preserve the Lorentz symmetry of the vacuum state. Some of the conditions are automatically satisfied in spontaneously-broken supersymmetric models, but supersymmetry is not enough to ensure the Lorentz symmetry. We show that the necessary regulators can be introduced as bulk fields. We also evaluate the Casimir energy density with such regulators, and its deviation from the result obtained in the analytic regularization.</description>

      <title>Brightest Cluster Galaxy Offsets in Cold Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00928</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.00928v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The distribution of offsets between the brightest cluster galaxies of galaxy clusters and the centroid of their dark matter distributions is a promising probe of the underlying dark matter physics. In particular, since this distribution is sensitive to the shape of the potential in galaxy cluster cores, it constitutes a test of dark matter self-interaction on the largest mass scales in the universe. We examine these offsets in three suites of modern cosmological simulations; IllustrisTNG, MillenniumTNG and BAHAMAS. For clusters above $10^{14}\rm{M_\odot}$, we examine the dependence of the offset distribution on gravitational softening length, the method used to identify centroids, redshift, mass, baryonic physics, and establish the stability of our results with respect to various nuisance parameter choices. We find that offsets are overwhelmingly measured to be smaller than the minimum converged length scale in each simulation, with a median offset of $\sim 1\rm{kpc}$ in the highest resolution simulation considered, TNG300-1, which uses a gravitational softening length of $1.48\rm{kpc}$. We also find that centroids identified via source extraction on smoothed dark matter and stellar particle data are consistent with the potential minimum, but that observationally relevant methods sensitive to cluster strong gravitational lensing scales, or those using the the "light traces mass" approach, in this context meaning gas is used as a tracer for the potential, can overestimate offsets by factors of $\sim10$ and $\sim30$, respectively. This has the potential to reduce tensions with existing offset measurements which have served as evidence for a nonzero dark matter self-interaction cross section.</description>

      <title>First-order phase transitions in the cores of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05637v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I explore various scenarios for the phase transition within neutron-star matter. I do so by generating large model-agnostic ensemble using Gaussian Processes, both with and without explicit inclusion of first-order phase transitions (FOPTs). The ensemble is conditioned with state-of-the-art astrophysical and theoretical inputs in a fully Bayesian approach. I study how the current data affect the posterior probability of the location and the strength of FOPT. I find that the previously observed peak structure of the sound speed remains stable against inclusion of FOPTs. While the current data cannot differentiate between a smooth crossover and a first-order phase transition, 95% of the total evidence consists of equations of state with some form of phase changes, such as FOPT occurring within or terminating the stable branch of neutron stars, or an indication of a crossover to quark matter.</description>

      <title>Does DESI 2024 Confirm $\Lambda$CDM?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that a $\sim 2 \sigma$ discrepancy with the Planck-$\Lambda$CDM cosmology in DESI Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ translates into an unexpectedly large $\Omega_m$ value, $\Omega_m = 0.668^{+0.180}_{-0.169}$. We independently confirm that this anomaly drives the preference for $w_0 &gt; -1$ in DESI data confronted to the $w_0 w_a$CDM model. We show that redshift bins of DESI constraints allow $\Omega_m$ to wiggle at the $\sim 2 \sigma$ level with increasing effective redshift in the $\Lambda$CDM model. Given that LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ is at odds with Type Ia supernovae in overlapping redshifts, we expect that this anomaly will decrease in statistical significance with future DESI data releases leaving an increasing $\Omega_m$ trend with effective redshift at higher redshifts. We estimate the significance of the latter in DESI data at $\sim 1.8 \sigma$ and comment on how it dovetails with independent observations. It is imperative to understand what makes DESI LRG data at $z_{\textrm{eff}} = 0.51$ an outlier when it comes to $\Omega_m$ determinations.</description>

      <title>Hypernuclear constraints on the existence and lifetime of a deeply bound $H$ dibaryon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12801v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study to what extent the unique observation of $\Lambda\Lambda$ hypernuclei by their weak decay into known $\Lambda$ hypernuclei, with lifetimes of order 10$^{-10}$ s, rules out the existence of a deeply bound doubly-strange (${\cal S}$=$-$2) $H$ dibaryon. Treating ${_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{~~6}}{\rm He}$ (the Nagara emulsion event) in a realistic $\Lambda-\Lambda-{^4}$He three-body model, we find that the ${_{\Lambda\Lambda}^{~~6}}{\rm He}\to H + {^4{\rm He}}$ strong-interaction lifetime increases beyond 10$^{-10}$ s for $m_H &lt; m_{\Lambda}+m_n$, about 176 MeV below the $\Lambda\Lambda$ threshold, so that such a deeply bound $H$ is not in conflict with hypernuclear data. Constrained by $\Lambda$ hypernuclear $\Delta{\cal S}$=1 nonmesonic weak-interaction decay rates, we follow EFT methods to evaluate the $\Delta{\cal S}$=2 $H\to nn$ weak-decay lifetime of $H$ in the mass range $2m_n \lesssim m_H &lt; m_{\Lambda}+m_n$. The resulting $H$ lifetime is of order 10$^5$ s, many orders of magnitude shorter than required to qualify for a dark-matter candidate.</description>
