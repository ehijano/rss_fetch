      <title>On reduced basis methods for eigenvalue problems, with an application to eigenvector continuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide inequalities enabling to bound the error between the exact solution and an approximated solution of an eigenvalue problem, obtained by subspace projection, as in the reduced basis method. We treat self-adjoint operators and degenerate cases. We apply the bounds to the eigenvector continuation method, which consists in creating the reduced space by using basis vectors extracted from perturbation theory.</description>

      <title>Analysis of nearly planar defects using the Thomas--Fermi--von Weiszacker model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze the convergence of the electron density and relative energy with respect to a perfect crystal of a class of volume defects that are compactly contained along one direction while being of infinite extent along the other two using the Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker (TFW) model. We take advantage of prior work on the thermodynamic limit and stability estimates in the TFW setting, and specialize it to the case of nearly planar defects. In particular, we prove that the relative energy of the defective crystal, with respect to a perfect crystal, is finite, and in fact conforms to a well-posed minimization problem. We also establish convergence of the electronic fields to the perturbation caused by the nearly planar defect. Our main finding is that perturbations to both the density and electrostatic potential due to the presence of the nearly planar defect decay exponentially away from the defect, in agreement with the known locality property of the TFW model. We use these results to infer bounds on the generalized stacking fault energy, in particular the finiteness of this energy, and discuss its implications for numerical calculations. We conclude with a brief presentation of numerical results on the (non-convex) Thomas-Fermi-von Weiszacker-Dirac (TFWD) model that includes the Dirac exchange in the universal functional, and discuss its implications for future work.</description>

      <title>A strange five vertex model and multispecies ASEP on a ring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of constructing the stationary states of the multispecies asymmetric simple exclusion process on a one-dimensional periodic lattice. Central to our approach is a quantum oscillator weighted five vertex model which features a strange weight conservation distinct from the conventional one. Our results clarify the interrelations among several known results and refine their derivations. For instance, the stationary probability derived from the multiline queue construction by Martin (2020) and Corteel--Mandelshtam--Williams (2022) is identified with the partition function of a three-dimensional system. The matrix product operators by Prolhac--Evans--Mallick (2009) acquire a natural diagrammatic interpretation as corner transfer matrices (CTM). The origin of their recursive tensor structure, as questioned by Aggarwal--Nicoletti--Petrov (2023), is revealed through the CTM diagrams. Finally, the derivation of the Zamolodchikov--Faddeev algebra by Cantini--de Gier--Wheeler (2015) is made intrinsic by elucidating its precise connection to a solution to the Yang--Baxter equation originating from quantum group representations.</description>

      <title>Two-Time Measurement of Entropy Transfer in Markovian Quantum Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a protocol for the two-time measurement of entropic observables in quantum open systems driven out of thermal equilibrium by coupling to several heat baths. We concentrate on the Markovian approximation of the time-evolution and relate the expected value of the so defined entropy variations with the well-known expression of entropy production due to Lebowitz and Spohn. We do so under the detailed balance condition and, as a byproduct, we show that the probabilities of outcomes of two-time measurements are given by a continuous time Markov process determined by the Lindblad generator of the Markovian quantum dynamics.</description>

      <title>Bihamiltonian structure of the DR hierarchy in the semisimple case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12397</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12397v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the double ramification (DR) hierarchy of a homogeneous semisimple cohomological field theory (CohFT) with metric $\eta$ is bihamiltonian with respect to the Poisson operator $\eta^{-1} \partial_x$ and a second Poisson operator introduced in a previous work of ours in collaboration with S. Shadrin. This second Poisson operator has a simple and explicit expression in terms of the generating function of intersection numbers of the CohFT with the DR cycle and the top Hodge class $\lambda_g$. Our proof is based on two recently proved results: the equivalence of the double ramification hierarchy and the Dubrovin-Zhang hierarchy of a semisimple CohFT under Miura transformation and the polynomiality of the second Poisson bracket of the DZ hierarchy of a homogeneous semisimple CohFT. In particular our second Poisson bracket coincides through DR/DZ equivalence with the second Poisson bracket of the DZ hierarchy, hence providing a remarkably explicit approach to their bihamiltonian structure.</description>

      <title>Note on the attraction of an ellipsoid in a spherical universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical theorem states that two confocal ellipsoids, each of them endowed with a surface distribution of mass which is called homeoidal, exert the same Newtonian force on an exterior point if they have the same total mass. We extend this theorem to the spherical geometry by adapting a forgotten proof by Chasles of the classical theorem. Compared to the existing results, this is a slightly stronger statement with a much shorter proof.</description>

      <title>Third-Quantized Master Equations as a classical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck Process and its Entropy Production Rate</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Third quantization is used in open quantum systems to construct a superoperator basis in which quadratic Lindbladians can be turned into a normal form. From it follows the spectral properties of the Lindbladian, including eigenvalues and eigenvectors. However, the connection between third quantization and the semiclassical representations usually employed to obtain the dynamics of open quantum systems remains opaque. We introduce a new basis for third quantization that bridges this gap between third quantization and the $Q$ representation by projecting the master equation onto a superoperator coherent state basis. The equation of motion reduces to a multidimensional complex Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process, which facilitates a clear definition of the entropy production and heat dissipation rate in quantum systems. As an example, we investigate the entropy production rate of a harmonic oscillator in a squeezed thermal bath.</description>

      <title>Abelian Anyons on Flux-Quantized M5-Branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While fractional quantum Hall systems provide the best experimental evidence yet of (abelian) anyons plausibly necessary for future fault-tolerant quantum computation, like all strongly-coupled quantum systems their physics is not deeply understood. However, generally a promising approach is to (holographically) realize such systems on branes in string/M-theory; and specifically an old argument by Hellerman &amp; Susskind gives a sketch of fractional quantum Hall states arising via discrete light cone quantization of M5/M9-brane intersections.
  Here we present a rigorous derivation of abelian anyon quantum states on M5$\perp$MO9-branes ("open M5-branes") on the discrete light cone, after globally completing the traditional local field content on the M5-worldvolume via a flux-quantization law compatible with the ambient 11d supergravity, specifically taken to be in the unstable co-Homotopy cohomology ("Hypothesis H").
  The main step in the proof uses a theorem of Okuyama to identify co-Homotopy moduli spaces with configuration spaces of strings with charged endpoints, and identifies their loop spaces with cobordism of framed links that, under topological light cone quantization, turn out to be identified with the regularized Wilson loops of abelian Chern-Simons theory.</description>

      <title>Stationary states of aggregation-diffusion equations with compactly supported attraction kernels: radial symmetry and mass-independent boundedness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11921v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a nonlocal aggregation diffusion equation incorporating repulsion modelled by nonlinear diffusion and attraction modelled by nonlocal interaction. When the attractive interaction kernel is radially symmetric and strictly increasing on its domain it is previously known that all stationary solutions are radially symmetric and decreasing up to a translation; however, this result has not been extended to accommodate attractive kernels that are non-decreasing, for instance, attractive kernels with bounded support. For the diffusion coefficient $m&gt;1$, we show that, for attractive kernels that are radially symmetric and non-decreasing, all stationary states are radially symmetric and decreasing up to a translation on each connected subset of their support. Furthermore, for $m&gt;2$, we prove analytically that stationary states have an upper-bound independent of the initial data, confirming previous numerical results given in the literature.</description>

      <title>Multipreconditioning with directional sweeping methods for high-frequency Helmholtz problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11929v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the use of multipreconditioning, which allows for multiple preconditioners to be applied in parallel, on high-frequency Helmholtz problems. Typical applications present challenging sparse linear systems which are complex non-Hermitian and, due to the pollution effect, either very large or else still large but under-resolved in terms of the physics. These factors make finding general purpose, efficient and scalable solvers difficult and no one approach has become the clear method of choice. In this work we take inspiration from domain decomposition strategies known as sweeping methods, which have gained notable interest for their ability to yield nearly-linear asymptotic complexity and which can also be favourable for high-frequency problems. While successful approaches exist, such as those based on higher-order interface conditions, perfectly matched layers (PMLs), or complex tracking of wave fronts, they can often be quite involved or tedious to implement. We investigate here the use of simple sweeping techniques applied in different directions which can then be incorporated in parallel into a multipreconditioned GMRES strategy. Preliminary numerical results on a two-dimensional benchmark problem will demonstrate the potential of this approach.</description>

Abstract: We present a method for computing the generic degree of a period map defined on a quasi-projective surface. As an application, we explicitly compute the generic degree of three period maps underlying families of Calabi-Yau 3-folds coming from toric hypersurfaces. As a consequence, we show that the generic Torelli theorem holds for these cases.</description>

      <title>On certain classes of mild solutions of the scalar Li\'enard equation revised</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we revisit the existence, uniqueness and exponential decay of some classes of mild solutions which are almost periodic (AP-), asymptotically almost periodic (AAP-) and pseudo almost periodic (PAP-) of the scalar Lin\'eard equation by employing the notion of Green function and Massera-type principle. First, by changing variable we convert this equation to a system of first order differential equations. Then, we transform the problem into a framework of an abstract parabolic evolution equation which associates with an evolution family equipped an exponential dichtonomy and the corresponding Green function is exponentially almost periodic. After that, we prove a Massera-type principle that the corresponding linear equation has a uniqueness AP-, AAP- and PAP- mild solution if the right hand side and the coefficient functions are AP-, AAP- and PAP- functions, respectively. The well-posedness of semilinear equation is proved by using fixed point arguments and the exponential decay of mild solutions are obtained by using Gronwall's inequality and the exponentially stable assumption of evolution family. Although our work revisits some previous works on well-posedness of the Lin\'eard equation on these type solutions but provide a difference view by using Green function and go farther on the aspects of asymptotic behaviour of solutions and the construction of abstract theory. Our abstract results can be also applied to other parabolic evolution equations.</description>

      <title>On the infrared limit of the O(3) nonlinear $\sigma$-model at $\theta = \pi$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12215v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 2D nonlinear sigma models with Hermitian symmetric target admit a theta-term, which couples the field theory to the topological charge of its instanton gas. At the special coupling theta = pi, by what is nowadays attributed to a coupling-constant anomaly of Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type, such models have a degenerate ground state. Yet, the details of their non-trivial infrared limit have remained open in general. Here we suggest that non-perturbative renormalization group flow into the strong-coupling regime induces strong fluctuations of the theta-parameter, with the consequence that the instanton density is suppressed, the target-space topology effectively altered, and the target-space metric driven off reality and into geometrostasis. Assuming this heuristic scenario and combining it with a Cauchy process of target-space deformation, we present a detailed argument that the O(3) nonlinear sigma model at theta = pi, known to be the effective field theory for critical antiferromagnetic quantum spin chains with large half-integer spin, renormalizes to the conformal field theory of a U(1) boson compactified at a special radius with SU(2) symmetry. A closely related scenario applies to Pruisken's nonlinear sigma model for the integer quantum Hall transition.</description>

      <title>Classifying Entanglement by Algebraic Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum Entanglement is one of the key manifestations of quantum mechanics that separate the quantum realm from the classical one. Characterization of entanglement as a physical resource for quantum technology became of uppermost importance. While the entanglement of bipartite systems is already well understood, the ultimate goal to cope with the properties of entanglement of multipartite systems is still far from being realized. This dissertation covers characterization of multipartite entanglement using algebraic-geometric tools. Firstly, we establish an algorithm to classify multipartite entanglement by $k$-secant varieties of the Segre variety and $\ell$-multilinear ranks that are invariant under Stochastic Local Operations with Classical Communication (SLOCC). We present a fine-structure classification of multiqubit and tripartite entanglement based on this algorithm. Another fundamental problem in quantum information theory is entanglement transformation that is quite challenging regarding to multipartite systems. It is captivating that the proposed entanglement classification by algebraic geometry can be considered as a reference to study SLOCC and asymptotic SLOCC interconversions among different resources based on tensor rank and border rank, respectively. In this regard, we also introduce a new class of tensors that we call \emph{persistent tensors} and construct a lower bound for their tensor rank. We further cover SLOCC convertibility of multipartite systems considering several families of persistent tensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.12284v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the quantum phase transitions in strongly correlated electronic systems at $T=0^0K$ by the example of the 2D Hubbard model. The model for numerical calculations were formalized in terms of the integral equations previously obtained for the half--filled paramagnetic Hubbard model by means of the variational derivatives technique and subsequent Legendre transformation. For principal results we submit in series the momentum distribution functions $n(k)$ which display distinct attributes for the incipient regimes: the pure doublon phase, the metal phase, Weyl semimetal phase, and Weyl excitonic insulator phase at the sequential increasing the onsite Coulomb interaction $U$.</description>

      <title>Waves beneath a drop levitating over a moving wall</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In recent experiments, Sawaguchi et al. directly probed the lubrication layer of air beneath a droplet levitating inside a rotating cylindrical drum. For small rotation rates of the drum, the lubrication film beneath the drop adopted a steady shape, while at higher rotation rates, travelling waves propagated along the drop's lower surface with roughly half the wall velocity. We here rationalize the physical origin of these waves. We begin with a simplified model of the lubrication flow beneath the droplet, and examine the linear stability of this base state to perturbations of the Tollmien--Schlichting type. Our developments lead to the Orr-Sommerfeld equation (OSE), whose eigenvalues give the growth rates and phase speeds of the perturbations. By considering wavelengths long relative to the lubrication film thickness, we solve the OSE perturbatively and so deduce the wavelength and phase velocity of the most unstable mode. We find satisfactory agreement between experiment and theory over the parameter regime considered in the laboratory.</description>

      <title>Determinantal structure of the overlaps for induced spherical unitary ensemble</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.12690v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this note, we study the determinantal structure of the $k$-th conditional expectation of the overlap for induced spherical unitary ensemble. We will show the universality for the scaling limits of the $k$-the conditional expectation of the overlap in the three regimes, strongly non-unitary, weakly non-unitary, and the singular origin regimes. As a consequence, we will confirm the universality for the overlap.</description>

      <title>Lagrangian Relations and Quantum $L_\infty$ Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06110v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum $L_\infty$ algebras are higher loop generalizations of cyclic $L_\infty$ algebras. Motivated by the problem of defining morphisms between such algebras, we construct a linear category of $(-1)$-shifted symplectic vector spaces and distributional half-densities, originally proposed by \v{S}evera. Morphisms in this category can be given both by formal half-densities and Lagrangian relations; we prove that the composition of such morphisms recovers the construction of homotopy transfer of quantum $L_\infty$ algebras. Finally, using this category, we propose a new notion of a relation between quantum $L_\infty$ algebras.</description>

      <title>Method of Filtration in first passage time problems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Statistics of stochastic processes are crucially influenced by the boundary conditions. In one spatial dimension, for example, the first passage time distribution in semi-infinite space (one absorbing boundary) is markedly different from that in a finite interval with two absorbing boundaries. Here, we propose a method, which we refer to as a method of filtration, that allows us to construct the latter from only the knowledge of the former. We demonstrate that our method yields two solution forms, a method of eigenfunction expansion-like form and a method of image-like form. In particular, we argue that the latter solution form is a generalization of the method of image applicable to a stochastic process for which the method of image generally does not work, e.g., the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process.</description>

      <title>Gaussian beta ensembles: the perfect freezing transition and its characterization in terms of Beurling-Landau densities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.15054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.15054v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Gaussian $\beta$-ensemble is a real $n$-point configuration $\{x_j\}_1^n$ picked randomly with respect to the Boltzmann factor $e^{-\frac\beta 2H_n}$, $H_n=\sum_{i\ne j}\log\frac 1{|x_i-x_j|}+n\sum_{i=1}^n\tfrac 12x_i^2.$ The point process $\{x_j\}_1^n$ tends to follow the semicircle law $\sigma(x)=\tfrac 1{2\pi}\sqrt{(4-x^2)_+}$ in certain average senses.
  A Fekete configuration (minimizer of $H_n$) is spread out in a much more uniform way in the interval $[-2,2]$ with respect to the regularization $\sigma_n(x)=\max\{\sigma(x),n^{-\frac 1 3}\}$ of the semicircle law. In particular, Fekete configurations are "equidistributed" with respect to $\sigma_n(x)$, in a certain technical sense of Beurling-Landau densities.
  We consider the problem of characterizing sequences $\beta_n$ of inverse temperatures, which guarantee almost sure equidistribution as $n\to\infty$. We find that a necessary and sufficient condition is that $\beta_n$ grows at least logarithmically in $n$: $$\beta_n\gtrsim \log n.$$ We call this growth rate the perfect freezing regime. We give several further results on the distribution of particles when $\beta_n\gtrsim\log n$, for example on minimal spacing, discrepancies, and sampling and interpolation for weighted polynomials.
  The condition $\beta_n\gtrsim\log n$ was introduced by some of the authors in the context of two-dimensional Coulomb gas ensembles, where it is shown to be sufficient for equidistribution. Although the technical implementation requires some considerable modifications, the strategy from dimension two adapts well to prove sufficiency also for one-dimensional Gaussian ensembles. On a technical level, we use estimates for weighted polynomials due to Levin, Lubinsky, Gustavsson and others. The other direction (necessity) involves estimates due to Ledoux and Rider on the distribution of particles which fall near or outside the boundary.</description>

      <title>Sharp upper tail behavior of line ensembles via the tangent method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.08922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a new probabilistic and geometric method to obtain several sharp results pertaining to the upper tail behavior of continuum Gibbs measures on infinite ensembles of random continuous curves, also known as line ensembles, satisfying some natural assumptions. The arguments make crucial use of Brownian resampling invariance properties of such Gibbs measures. We obtain sharp one-point upper tail estimates showing that the probability of the value at zero being larger than $\theta$ is $\exp(-\frac{4}{3}\theta^{3/2}(1+o(1)))$. A key intermediate step is developing a precise understanding of the profile when conditioned on the value at zero equaling $\theta$. Our method further allows one to obtain multi-point asymptotics which were out of reach of previous approaches. As an example, we prove sharp explicit two-point upper tail estimates. All of our assumptions are shown to hold for the zero-temperature case of the Airy$_2$ process, thus yielding new proofs for one-point estimates already known due to its connections to random matrix theory, as well as new two-point asymptotics. To showcase the reach of the method, we obtain the same results in a purely non-integrable setting under only assumptions of stationarity and extremality in the class of Gibbs measures. Finally, all the assumptions are also shown to hold for the KPZ equation, except for a correlation inequality which remains an interesting open question. Our method bears resemblance to the tangent method introduced by Colomo-Sportiello and mathematically realized by Aggarwal in the context of the six-vertex model.</description>

      <title>Dynamic phases induced by two-level system defects on driven qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.07677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.07677v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent experimental evidences point to two-level defects, located in the oxides and on the interfaces of the Josephson junctions, as the major constituents of decoherence in superconducting qubits. How these defects affect the qubit evolution with the presence of external driving is less well understood since the semiclassical qubit-field coupling renders the Jaynes-Cummings model for qubit-defect coupling undiagonalizable. We analyze the decoherence dynamics in the continuous coherent state space induced by the driving and solve the master equation endowed with an extra decay-cladded driving term via a Fokker-Planck equation. The solutions for diffusion propagators as Gaussian distributions show four distinct dynamic phases: four types of convergence paths to limit cycles of varying radius by the distribution mean, which are determined by the competing external driving and the defect decays. The qubit trajectory resulted from these solutions is a super-Poissonian over displac ed Fock states, which reduces to a Gibbs state of effective temperature decided by the defect at zero driving limit. Further, the Poincare map shows the dependence of the rate of convergence on the initial state. In other words, the qubit evolution can serve as an indicator of the defect coupling strength through the variation of the driving strength as a parameter.</description>

      <title>Tautological relations and integrable systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.07552v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a family of conjectural relations in the tautological cohomology of the moduli spaces of stable algebraic curves of genus $g$ with $n$ marked points. A large part of these relations has a surprisingly simple form: the tautological classes involved in the relations are given by stable graphs that are trees and that are decorated only by powers of the psi-classes at half-edges. We show that the proposed conjectural relations imply certain fundamental properties of the Dubrovin-Zhang (DZ) and the double ramification (DR) hierarchies associated to F-cohomological field theories. Our relations naturally extend a similar system of conjectural relations, which were proposed in an earlier work of the first author together with Gu\'er\'e and Rossi and which are responsible for the normal Miura equivalence of the DZ and the DR hierarchy associated to an arbitrary cohomological field theory. Finally, we prove all the above mentioned relations in the case $n=1$ and arbitrary $g$ using a variation of the method from a paper by Liu and Pandharipande, this can be of independent interest. In particular, this proves the main conjecture from our previous joined work together with Hern\'andez Iglesias. We also prove all the above mentioned relations in the case $g=0$ and arbitrary $n$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present new families of quantum channels for which corresponding minimum output R\'enyi $p$-entropy is not additive. Our manuscript is motivated by the results of Grudka et al., J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 43 425304 and we focus on channels characterized by both extensions and subspaces of the antisymmetric subspace in $\mathbb{C}^d \otimes \mathbb{C}^d$, which exhibit additivity breaking for $p&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Time arrow without past hypothesis: a toy model explanation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.07121v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The laws of Physics are time-reversible, making no qualitative distinction between the past and the future -- yet we can only go towards the future. This apparent contradiction is known as the "arrow of time problem". Its current resolution states that the future is the direction of increasing entropy. But entropy can only increase towards the future if it was low in the past, and past low entropy is a very strong assumption to make, because low entropy states are rather improbable, non-generic. Recent works from the Physics literature suggest, however, we may do away with this so-called "past hypothesis", in the presence of reversible dynamical laws featuring expansion. We prove that this can be the case in principle, within a toy model. It consists in graphs upon which particles circulate and interact according to local reversible rules. Some rules locally shrink or expand the graph. We prove that almost all states expand; entropy always increases as a consequence of expansion -- thereby providing a local explanation for the rise of an entropic arrow of time without the need for a past hypothesis. The discrete setting of this toy model allows us to deploy the full rigour of theoretical Computer Science proof techniques. It also allows for the numerical exploration of several physically-motivated variants: a time-symmetric variant; two inflationary variants; and a damping variant -- which slows down thermal death. The fact that all of these models exhibit similar behaviours suggests that local reversible expansion mechanisms constitute a robust recipe for a time arrow without past hypothesis. In this qualitative sense, the explanation may therefore also be relevant at the cosmological level.</description>

      <title>A family of integrable maps associated with the Volterra lattice</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.02336v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently Gubbiotti, Joshi, Tran and Viallet classified birational maps in four dimensions admitting two invariants (first integrals) with a particular degree structure, by considering recurrences of fourth order with a certain symmetry. The last three of the maps so obtained were shown to be Liouville integrable, in the sense of admitting a non-degenerate Poisson bracket with two first integrals in involution. Here we show how the first of these three Liouville integrable maps corresponds to genus 2 solutions of the infinite Volterra lattice, being the $g=2$ case of a family of maps associated with the Stieltjes continued fraction expansion of a certain function on a hyperelliptic curve of genus $g\geqslant 1$. The continued fraction method provides explicit Hankel determinant formulae for tau functions of the solutions, together with an algebro-geometric description via a Lax representation for each member of the family, associating it with an algebraic completely integrable system. In particular, in the elliptic case ($g=1$), as a byproduct we obtain Hankel determinant expressions for the solutions of the Somos-5 recurrence, but different to those previously derived by Chang, Hu and Xin. By applying contraction to the Stieltjes fraction, we recover integrable maps associated with Jacobi continued fractions on hyperelliptic curves, that one of us considered previously, as well as the Miura-type transformation between the Volterra and Toda lattices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15364v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that Shakirov's non-stationary difference equation, when it is truncated, implies the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov ($q$-KZ) equation for $U_{\mathsf v}\bigl(A_1^{(1)}\bigr)$ with generic spins. Namely, we can tune mass parameters so that the Hamiltonian acts on the space of finite Laurent polynomials. Then the representation matrix of the Hamiltonian agrees with the $R$-matrix, or the quantum $6j$ symbols. On the other hand, we prove that the $K$ theoretic Nekrasov partition function from the affine Laumon space is identified with the well-studied Jackson integral solution to the $q$-KZ equation. Combining these results, we establish that the affine Laumon partition function gives a solution to Shakirov's equation, which was a conjecture in our previous paper. We also work out the base-fiber duality and four-dimensional limit in relation with the $q$-KZ equation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02149v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the solutions of three-dimensional gravity obtained by gluing two copies of a spacetime across a junction constituted of a tensile string are in one-to-one correspondence with the solutions of the Nambu-Goto equation in the same spacetime up to a finite number of rigid deformations related to worldsheet and spacetime isometries. The non-linear Nambu-Goto equation satisfied by the average of the embedding coordinates of the junction emerges directly from the junction conditions along with the rigid deformations and corrections due to the tension. Therefore, the equivalence principle generalizes non-trivially to the string. Our results are valid both in three-dimensional flat and AdS spacetimes. In the context of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$ correspondence, our setup could be used to describe a class of interfaces in the conformal field theory featuring relative time reparametrization at the interface which encodes the solution of the Nambu-Goto equation corresponding to the bulk junction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We initiate a systematic study of integrable models for spin chains with constrained Hilbert spaces; we focus on spin-1/2 chains with the Rydberg constraint. We extend earlier results for medium-range spin chains to the constrained Hilbert space, and formulate an integrability condition. This enables us to construct new integrable models with fixed interaction ranges. We classify all time- and space-reflection symmetric integrable Rydberg-constrained Hamiltonians of range 3 and 4. At range 3, we find a single family of integrable Hamiltonians: the so-called RSOS quantum chains, which are related to the well-known RSOS models of Andrews, Baxter, and Forrester. At range 4 we find two families of models, the first of which is the constrained XXZ model. We also find a new family of models depending on a single coupling $z$. We provide evidence of two critical points related to the golden ratio $\phi$, at $z=\phi^{-1/2}$ and $z=\phi^{3/2}$. We also perform a partial classification of integrable Hamiltonians for range 5.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04310v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is well-known that the critical gravitational collapse produces continuous self-similar solutions characterized by the Choptuik critical exponent, $\gamma$. We examine the solutions in the domains of the linear perturbation equations, considering the numerical measurement errors. Specifically, we study quantum perturbation theory for the four-dimensional Einstein-axion-dilaton system of the elliptic class of $\text{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ transformations. We develop a novel artificial neural network-assisted Metropolis-Hastings algorithm based on quantum perturbation theory to find the distribution of the critical exponent in a Bayesian framework. Unlike existing methods, this new probabilistic approach identifies the available deterministic solution and explores the range of physically distinguishable critical exponents that may arise due to numerical measurement errors.</description>

      <title>Approximating the eigenvalues of self-adjoint trace-class operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04478</link>

Abstract: Spectral properties of bounded linear operators play a crucial role in several areas of mathematics and physics. For each self-adjoint, trace-class operator $O$ we define a set $\Lambda_n\subset \mathbb{R}$, and we show that it converges to the spectrum of $O$ in the Hausdorff metric under mild conditions. Our set $\Lambda_n$ only depends on the first $n$ moments of $O$. We show that it can be effectively calculated for physically relevant operators, and it approximates the spectrum well.
  We prove that using the above method we can converge to the minimal and maximal eigenvalues with super-exponential speed.
  We also construct monotone increasing lower bounds $q_n$ for the minimal eigenvalue (or decreasing upper bounds for the maximal eigenvalue). This sequence only depends on the moments of $O$ and a concrete upper estimate of its $1$-norm; we also demonstrate that $q_n$ can be effectively calculated for a large class of physically relevant operators. This rigorous lower bound $q_n$ tends to the minimal eigenvalue with super-exponential speed provided that $O$ is not positive semidefinite. As a by-product, we obtain computable upper bounds for the $1$-norm of $O$, too.</description>

      <title>RBMD: A molecular dynamics package enabling to simulate 10 million all-atom particles in a single graphics processing unit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09315v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces a random-batch molecular dynamics (RBMD) package for fast simulations of particle systems at the nano/micro scale. Different from existing packages, the RBMD uses random batch methods for nonbonded interactions of particle systems. The long-range part of Coulomb interactions is calculated in Fourier space by the random batch Ewald algorithm, which achieves linear complexity and superscalability, surpassing classical lattice-based Ewald methods. For the short-range part, the random batch list algorithm is used to construct neighbor lists, significantly reducing both computational and memory costs. The RBMD is implemented on GPU-CPU heterogeneous architectures, with classical force fields for all-atom systems. Benchmark systems are used to validate accuracy and performance of the package. Comparison with the particle-particle particle-mesh method and the Verlet list method in the LAMMPS package is performed on three different NVIDIA GPUs, demonstrating high efficiency of the RBMD on heterogeneous architectures. Our results also show that the RBMD enables simulations on a single GPU with a CPU core up to 10 million particles. Typically, for systems of one million particles, the RBMD allows simulating all-atom systems with a high efficiency of 8.20 ms per step, demonstrating the attractive feature for running large-scale simulations of practical applications on a desktop machine.</description>

      <title>Relaxation model for a homogeneous plasma with spherically symmetric velocity space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.01613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.01613v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive the transport equations from the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation when the velocity space is spherically symmetric. The Shkarofsky form of Fokker-Planck-Rosenbluth collision operator is employed in the Vlasov-Fokker-Planck equation. A relaxation model for homogeneous plasma could be presented in closed form in terms of Gauss HyperGeometric2F1 functions. This has been accomplished based on the Maxwellian mixture model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that classic models such as two-temperature thermal equilibrium model, Braginskii model and thermodynamic equilibrium model are special cases of our relaxation model. The present relaxation model is a nonequilibrium model which is under the assumption that the plasma system possesses finitely distinguishable independent features, but it is not relying on the conventional near-equilibrium assumption.</description>
