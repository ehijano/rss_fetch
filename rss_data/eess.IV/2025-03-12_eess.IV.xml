      <title>AdaptSR: Low-Rank Adaptation for Efficient and Scalable Real-World Super-Resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recovering high-frequency details and textures from low-resolution images remains a fundamental challenge in super-resolution (SR), especially when real-world degradations are complex and unknown. While GAN-based methods enhance realism, they suffer from training instability and introduce unnatural artifacts. Diffusion models, though promising, demand excessive computational resources, often requiring multiple GPU days, even for single-step variants. Rather than naively fine-tuning entire models or adopting unstable generative approaches, we introduce AdaptSR, a low-rank adaptation (LoRA) framework that efficiently repurposes bicubic-trained SR models for real-world tasks. AdaptSR leverages architecture-specific insights and selective layer updates to optimize real SR adaptation. By updating only lightweight LoRA layers while keeping the pretrained backbone intact, it captures domain-specific adjustments without adding inference cost, as the adapted layers merge seamlessly post-training. This efficient adaptation not only reduces memory and compute requirements but also makes real-world SR feasible on lightweight hardware. Our experiments demonstrate that AdaptSR outperforms GAN and diffusion-based SR methods by up to 4 dB in PSNR and 2% in perceptual scores on real SR benchmarks. More impressively, it matches or exceeds full model fine-tuning while training 92% fewer parameters, enabling rapid adaptation to real SR tasks within minutes.</description>

      <title>Modifying Range-Doppler geometry frameworks to process Spotlight SAR imagery in Polar Format</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07889v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a simple method to enable processing of Spotlight Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery distributed in Polar Format (PFA) using standard Range-Doppler (RDA) geometry algorithms. Our approach is applicable to PFA SAR images characterized by a constant value of the Center of Aperture (COA) time. We present simplified expressions for forward (image-to-ground) and inverse (ground-to-image) geometry mapping using Sensor Independent Complex Data (SICD) conventions. We discuss simple changes needed to current open source SAR software that implement Range-Doppler algorithms, to enable support within them for Spotlight data distributed in SICD format. We include a proof-of-concept script that utilizes the Python packages sarpy and isce3 to demonstrate the correctness of the proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Deep Perceptual Enhancement for Medical Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08027v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to numerous hardware shortcomings, medical image acquisition devices are susceptible to producing low-quality (i.e., low contrast, inappropriate brightness, noisy, etc.) images. Regrettably, perceptually degraded images directly impact the diagnosis process and make the decision-making manoeuvre of medical practitioners notably complicated. This study proposes to enhance such low-quality images by incorporating end-to-end learning strategies for accelerating medical image analysis tasks. To the best concern, this is the first work in medical imaging which comprehensively tackles perceptual enhancement, including contrast correction, luminance correction, denoising, etc., with a fully convolutional deep network. The proposed network leverages residual blocks and a residual gating mechanism for diminishing visual artefacts and is guided by a multi-term objective function to perceive the perceptually plausible enhanced images. The practicability of the deep medical image enhancement method has been extensively investigated with sophisticated experiments. The experimental outcomes illustrate that the proposed method could outperform the existing enhancement methods for different medical image modalities by 5.00 to 7.00 dB in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) metrics and 4.00 to 6.00 in DeltaE metrics. Additionally, the proposed method can drastically improve the medical image analysis tasks' performance and reveal the potentiality of such an enhancement method in real-world applications.

      <title>Denoising via Repainting: an image denoising method using layer wise medical image repainting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08094v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Medical image denoising is essential for improving the reliability of clinical diagnosis and guiding subsequent image-based tasks. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale approach that integrates anisotropic Gaussian filtering with progressive Bezier-path redrawing. Our method constructs a scale-space pyramid to mitigate noise while preserving critical structural details. Starting at the coarsest scale, we segment partially denoised images into coherent components and redraw each using a parametric Bezier path with representative color. Through iterative refinements at finer scales, small and intricate structures are accurately reconstructed, while large homogeneous regions remain robustly smoothed. We employ both mean square error and self-intersection constraints to maintain shape coherence during path optimization. Empirical results on multiple MRI datasets demonstrate consistent improvements in PSNR and SSIM over competing methods. This coarse-to-fine framework offers a robust, data-efficient solution for cross-domain denoising, reinforcing its potential clinical utility and versatility. Future work extends this technique to three-dimensional data.</description>

      <title>Posterior-Mean Denoising Diffusion Model for Realistic PET Image Reconstruction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08546v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positron Emission Tomography (PET) is a functional imaging modality that enables the visualization of biochemical and physiological processes across various tissues. Recently, deep learning (DL)-based methods have demonstrated significant progress in directly mapping sinograms to PET images. However, regression-based DL models often yield overly smoothed reconstructions lacking of details (i.e., low distortion, low perceptual quality), whereas GAN-based and likelihood-based posterior sampling models tend to introduce undesirable artifacts in predictions (i.e., high distortion, high perceptual quality), limiting their clinical applicability. To achieve a robust perception-distortion tradeoff, we propose Posterior-Mean Denoising Diffusion Model (PMDM-PET), a novel approach that builds upon a recently established mathematical theory to explore the closed-form expression of perception-distortion function in diffusion model space for PET image reconstruction from sinograms. Specifically, PMDM-PET first obtained posterior-mean PET predictions under minimum mean square error (MSE), then optimally transports the distribution of them to the ground-truth PET images distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that PMDM-PET not only generates realistic PET images with possible minimum distortion and optimal perceptual quality but also outperforms five recent state-of-the-art (SOTA) DL baselines in both qualitative visual inspection and quantitative pixel-wise metrics PSNR (dB)/SSIM/NRMSE.</description>

      <title>Vision Transformer for Intracranial Hemorrhage Classification in CT Scans Using an Entropy-Aware Fuzzy Integral Strategy for Adaptive Scan-Level Decision Fusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08609v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a critical medical emergency caused by the rupture of cerebral blood vessels, leading to internal bleeding within the skull. Accurate and timely classification of hemorrhage subtypes is essential for effective clinical decision-making. To address this challenge, we propose an advanced pyramid vision transformer (PVT)-based model, leveraging its hierarchical attention mechanisms to capture both local and global spatial dependencies in brain CT scans. Instead of processing all extracted features indiscriminately, A SHAP-based feature selection method is employed to identify the most discriminative components, which are then used as a latent feature space to train a boosting neural network, reducing computational complexity. We introduce an entropy-aware aggregation strategy along with a fuzzy integral operator to fuse information across multiple CT slices, ensuring a more comprehensive and reliable scan-level diagnosis by accounting for inter-slice dependencies. Experimental results show that our PVT-based framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art deep learning architectures in terms of classification accuracy, precision, and robustness. By combining SHAP-driven feature selection, transformer-based modeling, and an entropy-aware fuzzy integral operator for decision fusion, our method offers a scalable and computationally efficient AI-driven solution for automated ICH subtype classification.</description>

      <title>Retrieval Augmented Generation with Multi-Modal LLM Framework for Wireless Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Future wireless networks aim to deliver high data rates and lower power consumption while ensuring seamless connectivity, necessitating robust optimization. Large language models (LLMs) have been deployed for generalized optimization scenarios. To take advantage of generative AI (GAI) models, we propose retrieval augmented generation (RAG) for multi-sensor wireless environment perception. Utilizing domain-specific prompt engineering, we apply RAG to efficiently harness multimodal data inputs from sensors in a wireless environment. Key pre-processing pipelines including image-to-text conversion, object detection, and distance calculations for multimodal RAG input from multi-sensor data are proposed to obtain a unified vector database crucial for optimizing LLMs in global wireless tasks. Our evaluation, conducted with OpenAI's GPT and Google's Gemini models, demonstrates an 8%, 8%, 10%, 7%, and 12% improvement in relevancy, faithfulness, completeness, similarity, and accuracy, respectively, compared to conventional LLM-based designs. Furthermore, our RAG-based LLM framework with vectorized databases is computationally efficient, providing real-time convergence under latency constraints.</description>

      <title>Visual and Text Prompt Segmentation: A Novel Multi-Model Framework for Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07911v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pixel-level segmentation is essential in remote sensing, where foundational vision models like CLIP and Segment Anything Model(SAM) have demonstrated significant capabilities in zero-shot segmentation tasks. Despite their advances, challenges specific to remote sensing remain substantial. Firstly, The SAM without clear prompt constraints, often generates redundant masks, and making post-processing more complex. Secondly, the CLIP model, mainly designed for global feature alignment in foundational models, often overlooks local objects crucial to remote sensing. This oversight leads to inaccurate recognition or misplaced focus in multi-target remote sensing imagery. Thirdly, both models have not been pre-trained on multi-scale aerial views, increasing the likelihood of detection failures. To tackle these challenges, we introduce the innovative VTPSeg pipeline, utilizing the strengths of Grounding DINO, CLIP, and SAM for enhanced open-vocabulary image segmentation. The Grounding DINO+(GD+) module generates initial candidate bounding boxes, while the CLIP Filter++(CLIP++) module uses a combination of visual and textual prompts to refine and filter out irrelevant object bounding boxes, ensuring that only pertinent objects are considered. Subsequently, these refined bounding boxes serve as specific prompts for the FastSAM model, which executes precise segmentation. Our VTPSeg is validated by experimental and ablation study results on five popular remote sensing image segmentation datasets.</description>

      <title>BUFFER-X: Towards Zero-Shot Point Cloud Registration in Diverse Scenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.07940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in deep learning-based point cloud registration have improved generalization, yet most methods still require retraining or manual parameter tuning for each new environment. In this paper, we identify three key factors limiting generalization: (a) reliance on environment-specific voxel size and search radius, (b) poor out-of-domain robustness of learning-based keypoint detectors, and (c) raw coordinate usage, which exacerbates scale discrepancies. To address these issues, we present a zero-shot registration pipeline called BUFFER-X by (a) adaptively determining voxel size/search radii, (b) using farthest point sampling to bypass learned detectors, and (c) leveraging patch-wise scale normalization for consistent coordinate bounds. In particular, we present a multi-scale patch-based descriptor generation and a hierarchical inlier search across scales to improve robustness in diverse scenes. We also propose a novel generalizability benchmark using 11 datasets that cover various indoor/outdoor scenarios and sensor modalities, demonstrating that BUFFER-X achieves substantial generalization without prior information or manual parameter tuning for the test datasets.

Abstract: Autonomous stores leverage advanced sensing technologies to enable cashier-less shopping, real-time inventory tracking, and seamless customer interactions. However, these systems face significant challenges, including occlusion in vision-based tracking, scalability of sensor deployment, theft prevention, and real-time data processing. To address these issues, researchers have explored multi-modal sensing approaches, integrating computer vision, RFID, weight sensing, vibration-based detection, and LiDAR to enhance accuracy and efficiency. This survey provides a comprehensive review of sensing technologies used in autonomous retail environments, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and integration strategies. We categorize existing solutions across inventory tracking, environmental monitoring, people-tracking, and theft detection, discussing key challenges and emerging trends. Finally, we outline future directions for scalable, cost-efficient, and privacy-conscious autonomous store systems.</description>

      <title>Controlling Latent Diffusion Using Latent CLIP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instead of performing text-conditioned denoising in the image domain, latent diffusion models (LDMs) operate in latent space of a variational autoencoder (VAE), enabling more efficient processing at reduced computational costs. However, while the diffusion process has moved to the latent space, the contrastive language-image pre-training (CLIP) models, as used in many image processing tasks, still operate in pixel space. Doing so requires costly VAE-decoding of latent images before they can be processed. In this paper, we introduce Latent-CLIP, a CLIP model that operates directly in the latent space. We train Latent-CLIP on 2.7B pairs of latent images and descriptive texts, and show that it matches zero-shot classification performance of similarly sized CLIP models on both the ImageNet benchmark and a LDM-generated version of it, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing both real and generated content. Furthermore, we construct Latent-CLIP rewards for reward-based noise optimization (ReNO) and show that they match the performance of their CLIP counterparts on GenEval and T2I-CompBench while cutting the cost of the total pipeline by 21%. Finally, we use Latent-CLIP to guide generation away from harmful content, achieving strong performance on the inappropriate image prompts (I2P) benchmark and a custom evaluation, without ever requiring the costly step of decoding intermediate images.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Co-Design of Communication, Computing, and Control for Edge-Enabled Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper proposes a task-oriented co-design framework that integrates communication, computing, and control to address the key challenges of bandwidth limitations, noise interference, and latency in mission-critical industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS). To improve communication efficiency and robustness, we design a task-oriented Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) using Information Bottleneck (IB) to enhance data transmission efficiency by prioritizing task-specific information. To mitigate the perceived End-to-End (E2E) delays, we develop a Delay-Aware Trajectory-Guided Control Prediction (DTCP) strategy that integrates trajectory planning with control prediction, predicting commands based on E2E delay. Moreover, the DTCP is co-designed with task-oriented JSCC, focusing on transmitting task-specific information for timely and reliable autonomous driving. Experimental results in the CARLA simulator demonstrate that, under an E2E delay of 1 second (20 time slots), the proposed framework achieves a driving score of 48.12, which is 31.59 points higher than using Better Portable Graphics (BPG) while reducing bandwidth usage by 99.19%.</description>

      <title>Convex Hull Prediction Methods for Bitrate Ladder Construction: Design, Evaluation, and Comparison</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.15163v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) has emerged as a prevalent approach for over-the-top (OTT) video streaming services due to its ability to deliver a seamless user experience. A fundamental component of HAS is the bitrate ladder, which comprises a set of encoding parameters (e.g., bitrate-resolution pairs) used to encode the source video into multiple representations. This adaptive bitrate ladder enables the client's video player to dynamically adjust the quality of the video stream in real-time based on fluctuations in network conditions, ensuring uninterrupted playback by selecting the most suitable representation for the available bandwidth. The most straightforward approach involves using a fixed bitrate ladder for all videos, consisting of pre-determined bitrate-resolution pairs known as one-size-fits-all. Conversely, the most reliable technique relies on intensively encoding all resolutions over a wide range of bitrates to build the convex hull, thereby optimizing the bitrate ladder by selecting the representations from the convex hull for each specific video. Several techniques have been proposed to predict content-based ladders without performing a costly, exhaustive search encoding. This paper provides a comprehensive review of various convex hull prediction methods, including both conventional and learning-based approaches. Furthermore, we conduct a benchmark study of several handcrafted- and DL-based approaches for predicting content-optimized convex hulls across multiple codec settings. The considered methods are evaluated on our proposed large-scale dataset, which includes 300 UHD video shots encoded with software and hardware encoders using three state-of-the-art video standards, including AVC/H.264, HEVC/H.265, and VVC/H.266, at various bitrate points. Our analysis provides valuable insights and establishes baseline performance for future research in this field.</description>

      <title>Beyond Subspace Isolation: Many-to-Many Transformer for Light Field Image Super-resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The effective extraction of spatial-angular features plays a crucial role in light field image super-resolution (LFSR) tasks, and the introduction of convolution and Transformers leads to significant improvement in this area. Nevertheless, due to the large 4D data volume of light field images, many existing methods opted to decompose the data into a number of lower-dimensional subspaces and perform Transformers in each sub-space individually. As a side effect, these methods inadvertently restrict the self-attention mechanisms to a One-to-One scheme accessing only a limited subset of LF data, explicitly preventing comprehensive optimization on all spatial and angular cues. In this paper, we identify this limitation as subspace isolation and introduce a novel Many-to-Many Transformer (M2MT) to address it. M2MT aggregates angular information in the spatial subspace before performing the self-attention mechanism. It enables complete access to all information across all sub-aperture images (SAIs) in a light field image. Consequently, M2MT is enabled to comprehensively capture long-range correlation dependencies. With M2MT as the pivotal component, we develop a simple yet effective M2MT network for LFSR. Our experimental results demonstrate that M2MT achieves state-of-the-art performance across various public datasets. We further conduct in-depth analysis using local attribution maps (LAM) to obtain visual interpretability, and the results validate that M2MT is empowered with a truly non-local context in both spatial and angular subspaces to mitigate subspace isolation and acquire effective spatial-angular representation.</description>

      <title>Physics-informed Score-based Diffusion Model for Limited-angle Reconstruction of Cardiac Computed Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14770v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cardiac computed tomography (CT) has emerged as a major imaging modality for the diagnosis and monitoring of cardiovascular diseases. High temporal resolution is essential to ensure diagnostic accuracy. Limited-angle data acquisition can reduce scan time and improve temporal resolution, but typically leads to severe image degradation and motivates for improved reconstruction techniques. In this paper, we propose a novel physics-informed score-based diffusion model (PSDM) for limited-angle reconstruction of cardiac CT. At the sampling time, we combine a data prior from a diffusion model and a model prior obtained via an iterative algorithm and Fourier fusion to further enhance the image quality. Specifically, our approach integrates the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) algorithm with score-based diffusion models, thereby enabling us to reconstruct high-quality cardiac CT images from limited-angle data. The numerical simulations and real data experiments confirm the effectiveness of our proposed approach.</description>

      <title>Co-learning Single-Step Diffusion Upsampler and Downsampler with Two Discriminators and Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07663v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Super-resolution (SR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution (HR) images from their low-resolution (LR) counterparts, often relying on effective downsampling to generate diverse and realistic training pairs. In this work, we propose a co-learning framework that jointly optimizes a single-step diffusion-based upsampler and a learnable downsampler, enhanced by two discriminators and a cyclic distillation strategy. Our learnable downsampler is designed to better capture realistic degradation patterns while preserving structural details in the LR domain, which is crucial for enhancing SR performance. By leveraging a diffusion-based approach, our model generates diverse LR-HR pairs during training, enabling robust learning across varying degradations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on both general real-world and domain-specific face SR tasks, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both fidelity and perceptual quality. Our approach not only improves efficiency with a single inference step but also ensures high-quality image reconstruction, bridging the gap between synthetic and real-world SR scenarios.</description>

      <title>AtlasSeg: Atlas Prior Guided Dual-U-Net for Cortical Segmentation in Fetal Brain MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02867v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Accurate automatic tissue segmentation in fetal brain MRI is a crucial step in clinical diagnosis but remains challenging, particularly due to the dynamically changing anatomy and tissue contrast during fetal development. Existing segmentation networks can only implicitly learn age-related features, leading to a decline in accuracy at extreme early or late gestational ages (GAs). To improve segmentation performance throughout gestation, we introduce AtlasSeg, a dual-U-shape convolution network that explicitly integrates GA-specific information as guidance. By providing a publicly available fetal brain atlas with segmentation labels corresponding to relevant GAs, AtlasSeg effectively extracts age-specific patterns in the atlas branch and generates precise tissue segmentation in the segmentation branch. Multi-scale spatial attention feature fusions are constructed during both encoding and decoding stages to enhance feature flow and facilitate better information interactions between two branches. We compared AtlasSeg with six well-established networks in a seven-tissue segmentation task, achieving the highest average Dice similarity coefficient of 0.91. The improvement was particularly evident in extreme early or late GA cases, where training data was scare. Furthermore, AtlasSeg exhibited minimal performance degradation on low-quality images with contrast changes and noise, attributed to its anatomical shape priors. Overall, AtlasSeg demonstrated enhanced segmentation accuracy, better consistency across fetal ages, and robustness to perturbations, making it a powerful tool for reliable fetal brain MRI tissue segmentation, particularly suited for diagnostic assessments during early gestation.</description>

      <title>Cell as Point: One-Stage Framework for Efficient Cell Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conventional multi-stage cell tracking approaches rely heavily on detection or segmentation in each frame as a prerequisite, requiring substantial resources for high-quality segmentation masks and increasing the overall prediction time. To address these limitations, we propose CAP, a novel end-to-end one-stage framework that reimagines cell tracking by treating Cell as Point. Unlike traditional methods, CAP eliminates the need for explicit detection or segmentation, instead jointly tracking cells for sequences in one stage by leveraging the inherent correlations among their trajectories. This simplification reduces both labeling requirements and pipeline complexity. However, directly processing the entire sequence in one stage poses challenges related to data imbalance in capturing cell division events and long sequence inference. To solve these challenges, CAP introduces two key innovations: (1) adaptive event-guided (AEG) sampling, which prioritizes cell division events to mitigate the occurrence imbalance of cell events, and (2) the rolling-as-window (RAW) inference strategy, which ensures continuous and stable tracking of newly emerging cells over extended sequences. By removing the dependency on segmentation-based preprocessing while addressing the challenges of imbalanced occurrence of cell events and long-sequence tracking, CAP demonstrates promising cell tracking performance and is 10 to 55 times more efficient than existing methods. The code and model checkpoints will be available soon.</description>

      <title>MambaIRv2: Attentive State Space Restoration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15269v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Mamba-based image restoration backbones have recently demonstrated significant potential in balancing global reception and computational efficiency. However, the inherent causal modeling limitation of Mamba, where each token depends solely on its predecessors in the scanned sequence, restricts the full utilization of pixels across the image and thus presents new challenges in image restoration. In this work, we propose MambaIRv2, which equips Mamba with the non-causal modeling ability similar to ViTs to reach the attentive state space restoration model. Specifically, the proposed attentive state-space equation allows to attend beyond the scanned sequence and facilitate image unfolding with just one single scan. Moreover, we further introduce a semantic-guided neighboring mechanism to encourage interaction between distant but similar pixels. Extensive experiments show our MambaIRv2 outperforms SRFormer by even 0.35dB PSNR for lightweight SR even with 9.3\% less parameters and suppresses HAT on classic SR by up to 0.29dB.

      <title>PromptHSI: Universal Hyperspectral Image Restoration with Vision-Language Modulated Frequency Adaptation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15922v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in All-in-One (AiO) RGB image restoration have demonstrated the effectiveness of prompt learning in handling multiple degradations within a single model. However, extending these approaches to hyperspectral image (HSI) restoration is challenging due to the domain gap between RGB and HSI features, information loss in visual prompts under severe composite degradations, and difficulties in capturing HSI-specific degradation patterns via text prompts. In this paper, we propose PromptHSI, the first universal AiO HSI restoration framework that addresses these challenges. By incorporating frequency-aware feature modulation, which utilizes frequency analysis to narrow down the restoration search space and employing vision-language model (VLM)-guided prompt learning, our approach decomposes text prompts into intensity and bias controllers that effectively guide the restoration process while mitigating domain discrepancies. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our unified architecture excels at both fine-grained recovery and global information restoration across diverse degradation scenarios, highlighting its significant potential for practical remote sensing applications.

      <title>Self Pre-training with Adaptive Mask Autoencoders for Variable-Contrast 3D Medical Imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09096v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Masked Autoencoder (MAE) has recently demonstrated effectiveness in pre-training Vision Transformers (ViT) for analyzing natural images. By reconstructing complete images from partially masked inputs, the ViT encoder gathers contextual information to predict the missing regions. This capability to aggregate context is especially important in medical imaging, where anatomical structures are functionally and mechanically linked to surrounding regions. However, current methods do not consider variations in the number of input images, which is typically the case in real-world Magnetic Resonance (MR) studies. To address this limitation, we propose a 3D Adaptive Masked Autoencoders (AMAE) architecture that accommodates a variable number of 3D input contrasts per subject. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset of 45,364 subjects was used for pretraining and a subset of 1648 training, 193 validation and 215 test subjects were used for finetuning. The performance demonstrates that self pre-training of this adaptive masked autoencoders can enhance the infarct segmentation performance by 2.8%-3.7% for ViT-based segmentation models.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking Self-Supervised Methods for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.14009v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reconstructing MRI from highly undersampled measurements is crucial for accelerating medical imaging, but is challenging due to the ill-posedness of the inverse problem. While supervised deep learning approaches have shown remarkable success, they rely on fully-sampled ground truth data, which is often impractical or impossible to obtain. Recently, numerous self-supervised methods have emerged that do not require ground truth, however, the lack of systematic comparison and standard experimental setups have hindered research. We present the first comprehensive review of loss functions from all feedforward self-supervised methods and the first benchmark on accelerated MRI reconstruction without ground truth, showing that there is a wide range in performance across methods. In addition, we propose Multi-Operator Equivariant Imaging (MO-EI), a novel framework that builds on the imaging model considered in existing methods to outperform all state-of-the-art and approaches supervised performance. Finally, to facilitate reproducible benchmarking, we provide implementations of all methods in the DeepInverse library (https://deepinv.github.io) and easy-to-use demo code at https://andrewwango.github.io/deepinv-selfsup-fastmri.</description>

      <title>Prediction of Frozen Region Growth in Kidney Cryoablation Intervention Using a 3D Flow-Matching Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04966</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a 3D flow-matching model designed to predict the progression of the frozen region (iceball) during kidney cryoablation. Precise intraoperative guidance is critical in cryoablation to ensure complete tumor eradication while preserving adjacent healthy tissue. However, conventional methods, typically based on physics driven or diffusion based simulations, are computationally demanding and often struggle to represent complex anatomical structures accurately. To address these limitations, our approach leverages intraoperative CT imaging to inform the model. The proposed 3D flow matching model is trained to learn a continuous deformation field that maps early-stage CT scans to future predictions. This transformation not only estimates the volumetric expansion of the iceball but also generates corresponding segmentation masks, effectively capturing spatial and morphological changes over time. Quantitative analysis highlights the model robustness, demonstrating strong agreement between predictions and ground-truth segmentations. The model achieves an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.61 and a Dice coefficient of 0.75. By integrating real time CT imaging with advanced deep learning techniques, this approach has the potential to enhance intraoperative guidance in kidney cryoablation, improving procedural outcomes and advancing the field of minimally invasive surgery.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.05475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Capturing images with enough details to solve imaging tasks is a long-standing challenge in imaging, particularly due to the limitations of standard dynamic range (SDR) images which often lose details in underexposed or overexposed regions. Traditional high dynamic range (HDR) methods, like multi-exposure fusion or inverse tone mapping, struggle with ghosting and incomplete data reconstruction. Infrared (IR) imaging offers a unique advantage by being less affected by lighting conditions, providing consistent detail capture regardless of visible light intensity. In this paper, we introduce the HDRT dataset, the first comprehensive dataset that consists of HDR and thermal IR images. The HDRT dataset comprises 50,000 images captured across three seasons over six months in eight cities, providing a diverse range of lighting conditions and environmental contexts. Leveraging this dataset, we propose HDRTNet, a novel deep neural method that fuses IR and SDR content to generate HDR images. Extensive experiments validate HDRTNet against the state-of-the-art, showing substantial quantitative and qualitative quality improvements. The HDRT dataset not only advances IR-guided HDR imaging but also offers significant potential for broader research in HDR imaging, multi-modal fusion, domain transfer, and beyond. The dataset is available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/jingchao-peng/HDRTDataset.</description>

      <title>Surgical SAM 2: Real-time Segment Anything in Surgical Video by Efficient Frame Pruning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07931v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surgical video segmentation is a critical task in computer-assisted surgery and is vital for enhancing surgical quality and patient outcomes. Recently, the Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2) framework has shown superior advancements in image and video segmentation. However, SAM2 struggles with efficiency due to the high computational demands of processing high-resolution images and complex and long-range temporal dynamics in surgical videos. To address these challenges, we introduce Surgical SAM 2 (SurgSAM2), an advanced model to utilize SAM2 with an Efficient Frame Pruning (EFP) mechanism, to facilitate real-time surgical video segmentation. The EFP mechanism dynamically manages the memory bank by selectively retaining only the most informative frames, reducing memory usage and computational cost while maintaining high segmentation accuracy. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that SurgSAM2 significantly improves both efficiency and segmentation accuracy compared to the vanilla SAM2. Remarkably, SurgSAM2 achieves a 3$\times$ FPS compared with SAM2, while also delivering state-of-the-art performance after fine-tuning with lower-resolution data. These advancements establish SurgSAM2 as a leading model for surgical video analysis, making real-time surgical video segmentation in resource-constrained environments a reality. Our source code is available at https://github.com/jinlab-imvr/Surgical-SAM-2.</description>

      <title>ASMA: An Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm for Vision-Language Drone Navigation via Scene-Aware Control Barrier Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.10283v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of vision-language navigation (VLN), ensuring safety for physical agents remains an open challenge. For a human-in-the-loop language-operated drone to navigate safely, it must understand natural language commands, perceive the environment, and simultaneously avoid hazards in real time. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) are formal methods that enforce safe operating conditions. Model Predictive Control (MPC) is an optimization framework that plans a sequence of future actions over a prediction horizon, ensuring smooth trajectory tracking while obeying constraints. In this work, we consider a VLN-operated drone platform and enhance its safety by formulating a novel scene-aware CBF that leverages ego-centric observations from a camera which has both Red-Green-Blue as well as Depth (RGB-D) channels. A CBF-less baseline system uses a Vision-Language Encoder with cross-modal attention to convert commands into an ordered sequence of landmarks. An object detection model identifies and verifies these landmarks in the captured images to generate a planned path. To further enhance safety, an Adaptive Safety Margin Algorithm (ASMA) is proposed. ASMA tracks moving objects and performs scene-aware CBF evaluation on-the-fly, which serves as an additional constraint within the MPC framework. By continuously identifying potentially risky observations, the system performs prediction in real time about unsafe conditions and proactively adjusts its control actions to maintain safe navigation throughout the trajectory. Deployed on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor in the Gazebo environment using the Robot Operating System (ROS), ASMA achieves 64%-67% increase in success rates with only a slight increase (1.4%-5.8%) in trajectory lengths compared to the baseline CBF-less VLN.</description>

      <title>Fast Inexact Bilevel Optimization for Analytical Deep Image Priors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The analytical deep image prior (ADP) introduced by Dittmer et al. (2020) establishes a link between deep image priors and classical regularization theory via bilevel optimization. While this is an elegant construction, it involves expensive computations if the lower-level problem is to be solved accurately. To overcome this issue, we propose to use adaptive inexact bilevel optimization to solve ADP problems. We discuss an extension of a recent inexact bilevel method called the method of adaptive inexact descent of Salehi et al.(2024) to an infinite-dimensional setting required by the ADP framework. In our numerical experiments we demonstrate that the computational speed-up achieved by adaptive inexact bilevel optimization allows one to use ADP on larger-scale problems than in the previous literature, e.g. in deblurring of 2D color images.</description>

      <title>End-to-End Action Segmentation Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06316v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Existing approaches to action segmentation use pre-computed frame features extracted by methods which have been trained on tasks that are different from action segmentation. Also, recent approaches typically use deep framewise representations that lack explicit modeling of action segments. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the first end-to-end solution to action segmentation -- End-to-End Action Segmentation Transformer (EAST). Our key contributions include: (1) a simple and efficient adapter design for effective backbone fine-tuning; (2) a segmentation-by-detection framework for leveraging action proposals initially predicted over a coarsely downsampled video toward labeling of all frames; and (3) a new action-proposal based data augmentation for robust training. EAST achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, including GTEA, 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly-101. The model and corresponding code will be released.</description>
