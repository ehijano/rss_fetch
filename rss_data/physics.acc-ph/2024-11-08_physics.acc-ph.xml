      <title>Monochromatization interaction region optics design for direct s-channel Higgs production at FCC-ee</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FCC-ee offers the potential to measure the electron Yukawa coupling via direct s-channel Higgs production, e+ e- -&gt; H, at a centre-of-mass (CM) energy of 125 GeV. This measurement is significantly facilitated if the CM energy spread of e+ e- collisions can be reduced to a level comparable to the natural width of the Higgs boson, {\Gamma}_H = 4.1 MeV, without substantial loss in luminosity. Achieving this reduction in collision-energy spread is possible through the "monochromatization" concept. The basic idea is to create opposite correlations between spatial position and energy deviation within the colliding beams, which can be accomplished in beam optics by introducing a nonzero dispersion function with opposite signs for the two beams at the interaction point. Since the first proposal in 2016, the implementation of monochromatization at the FCC-ee has been continuously improved, starting from preliminary parametric studies. In this paper, we present a detailed study of the interaction region optics design for this newly proposed collision mode, exploring different potential configurations and their implementation in the FCC-ee global lattice, along with beam dynamics simulations and performance evaluations including the impact of "beamstrahlung."</description>

      <title>Harnessing the Power of Gradient-Based Simulations for Multi-Objective Optimization in Particle Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Particle accelerator operation requires simultaneous optimization of multiple objectives. Multi-Objective Optimization (MOO) is particularly challenging due to trade-offs between the objectives. Evolutionary algorithms, such as genetic algorithm (GA), have been leveraged for many optimization problems, however, they do not apply to complex control problems by design. This paper demonstrates the power of differentiability for solving MOO problems using a Deep Differentiable Reinforcement Learning (DDRL) algorithm in particle accelerators. We compare DDRL algorithm with Model Free Reinforcement Learning (MFRL), GA and Bayesian Optimization (BO) for simultaneous optimization of heat load and trip rates in the Continuous Electron Beam Accelerator Facility (CEBAF). The underlying problem enforces strict constraints on both individual states and actions as well as cumulative (global) constraint for energy requirements of the beam. A physics-based surrogate model based on real data is developed. This surrogate model is differentiable and allows back-propagation of gradients. The results are evaluated in the form of a Pareto-front for two objectives. We show that the DDRL outperforms MFRL, BO, and GA on high dimensional problems.</description>

      <title>Relativistic reference frame PIC simulations for electron beam dynamics with meter-scale propagation inside plasma and under external fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04703</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04703v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Particle in cell simulations are widely used in most fields of physics to investigate known and new phenomena which cannot be directly observed or measured yet. However, the computational and time resources needed for PICs make them impractical when high resolution and long time/distance simulations are required. In this work, we present a new PIC simulation code that takes advantage of the use of a relativistic reference frame and consequent time dilation and length contraction. These properties make a simulation capable of long (meter length) and high resolution simulations without the need of supercomputers. This new code is a step forward with regards to the previous tries enabling complex multiple body situations without additional filtering and smoothing of fields and currents. The usefulness of the relativistic frame PIC code is displayed by simulating electron beam bunching obtained in long undulator propagation and also the potential as a beam "buncher" of 10s of cm long low density plasmas.</description>
