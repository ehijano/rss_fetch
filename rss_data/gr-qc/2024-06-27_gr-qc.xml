      <title>Most general isotropic charged fluid solution for Buchdahl model in $\mathscr{F}(Q)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18604</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18604v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigated a most general isotropic charged fluid solution for the Buchdahl model via a two-step method in $\mathscr{F}(Q)$-gravity framework for the first time. In this context, a linear function of the form $\mathscr{F}(Q)=\zeta_1 Q+\zeta_2$ and a particular transformation is used to solve the Einstein-Maxwell Equations (EMEs) employing the Buchdahl ansatz: $ e^{\Upsilon(r)}=\frac{\mu(1+\lambda r^2)}{\mu+\lambda r^2}$, where $\zeta_1$, $\zeta_2$, $\lambda$ and $\mu$ are constant parameters. The Schwarzschild de Sitter~(AdS) exterior solution is joined to the interior solution at the boundary to determine the constant parameters. It should be emphasized that, for a given transformation, the Buchdahl ansatz only offers a mathematically feasible solution in the context of electric charge, where pressure and density are maximum at the center and decrease monotonically towards the boundary when $0&lt;\mu&lt;1$. We taken into account the compact star EX01785-248 with $M=(1.3\pm 0.2)M_{\odot}$; Radius $=12.02^{+0.55}_{-0.55}$~km for graphical analysis. The physical acceptability of the model in the context of $\mathscr{F}(Q)$ has been evaluated by looking at the necessary physical properties, including energy conditions, causality, hydrostatic equilibrium, pressure-density ratio, etc. Additionally, we predicted the maximum mass limit of different compact objects for various parameter values along with the mass-radius relation. The maximum masses range (1.927 - 2.321)~$M_\odot$ are obtained for our solution. It can be observed that when the coupling parameter $\zeta_1$ for $\mathscr{F}(Q)$ gravity is smaller, then our solution yields massive stars. The present investigation provides novel insights and realistic implications regarding the formation of compact astrophysical objects.</description>

      <title>Kantowski-Sachs spherically symmetric solutions in teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18659v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate time-dependent spherically symmetric Kantowski-Sachs teleparallel $F(T)$ gravity in vacuum and in a perfect isotropic fluid. We first find the field equations and solve for new teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. By using a power-law ansatz for the coframe functions, we find some new non-trivial teleparallel $F(T)$ vacuum solutions. We then proceed to find new non-trivial teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions in a perfect isotropic fluid with both linear and non-linear equation of state. We find several new exact and approximate teleparallel $F(T)$ solutions. These classes of new solutions are relevant for future cosmological applications.</description>

      <title>Effects of Two Quantum Correction Parameters on Chaotic Dynamics of Particles Near Renormalized Group Improved Schwarzschild Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18943v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A renormalized group improved Schwarzschild black hole spacetime contains two quantum correction parameters. One parameter $\gamma$ represents the identification of cutoff of the distance scale, and another parameter $\Omega$ stems from nonperturbative renormalization group theory. The two parameters are constrained by the data from the shadow of M87* central black hole. The dynamics of electrically charged test particles around the black hole are integrable. However, when the black hole is immersed in an external asymptotically uniform magnetic field, the dynamics are not integrable and may allow for the occurrence of chaos. % English Editor: %Please verify that the intended meaning has been retained. Employing an explicit symplectic integrator, we survey the contributions of the two parameters to the chaotic dynamical behavior. It is found that a small change of the parameter $\gamma$ constrained by the shadow of M87* black hole has an almost negligible effect on the dynamical transition of particles from order to chaos. However, a small decrease in the parameter $\Omega$ leads to an enhancement in the strength of chaos from the global phase space structure. A theoretical interpretation is given to the different contributions. The term with the parameter $\Omega$ dominates the term with the parameter $\gamma$, even if the two parameters have same values. % English Editor: Please verify %that the intended meaning has been retained. In particular, the parameter $\Omega$ acts as a repulsive force, and its decrease means a weakening of the repulsive force or equivalently enhancing the attractive force from the black hole. On the other hand, there is a positive Lyapunov exponent that is universally given by the surface gravity of the black hole when $\Omega\geq 0$ is small and the external magnetic field vanishes.</description>

      <title>Attractive voids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the well know mass deficit/surplus phenomenon in General Relativity to suggest that it could play a part in the dark matter conundrum. Specifically in collapses and condensations of matter associated with negative intrinsic curvature of the foliation associated with the asymptotic boundary conditions, the external (ADM) mass can vastly exceed the integrated local energy over the internal volume. This can be phrased in terms of a deficit of volume for a given surface area (with respect to zero curvature). We explore the phenomenon in the context of generalizations of the Oppenheimer-Snyder models and other "cut and paste" models, the Lemaitre-Bondi-Tolman metric and several others. We produce constructions where the internal object is contracting or expanding, has a life time different from the asymptotic Universe, as well as a volume different than the escavated volume from the Universe. These are purely relativistic constructions and they could play a role in the puzzle of dark matter: attraction without visible or indeed any matter.</description>

      <title>Binary neutron star mergers using a discontinuous Galerkin-finite difference hybrid method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19038v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a discontinuous Galerkin-finite difference hybrid scheme that allows high-order shock capturing with the discontinuous Galerkin method for general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics in dynamical spacetimes. We present several optimizations and stability improvements to our algorithm that allow the hybrid method to successfully simulate single, rotating, and binary neutron stars. The hybrid method achieves the efficiency of discontinuous Galerkin methods throughout almost the entire spacetime during the inspiral phase, while being able to robustly capture shocks and resolve the stellar surfaces. We also use Cauchy-Characteristic evolution to compute the first gravitational waveforms at future null infinity from binary neutron star mergers. The simulations presented here are the first successful binary neutron star inspiral and merger simulations using discontinuous Galerkin methods.</description>

      <title>A new class of non-Einstein pp-wave solutions to quadratic gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain a new family of exact vacuum solutions to quadratic gravity that describe pp-waves with two-dimensional wave surfaces that can have any prescribed constant curvature. When the wave surfaces are flat we recover the Peres waves obtained by Madsen, a subset of which forms precisely the vacuum pp-waves of general relativity. If, on the other hand, the wave surfaces have non-vanishing constant curvature then all our solutions are non-Einstein (i.e. they do not solve Einstein's equations in vacuum, with or without cosmological constant) and we find that the curvature is linearly related to the value of the cosmological constant. We show that the vacuum field equations reduce to a simple linear biharmonic equation on the curved wave surfaces, and as consequence, the general solution can be written down. We also provide some simple explicit examples.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waveforms from inspiral compact binaries in Hybrid metric-Palatini gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, gravitational waveforms emitted by inspiralling compact binary systems on quasicircular orbits in hybrid metric-Palatini gravity are computed in the lowest post-Newtonian approximation. By applying the stationary phase approximation, Fourier transforms of tensor polarization modes are obtained, and correction terms in the amplitude and phase of gravitational waves relative to General Relativity results are derived. Moreover, post-Einsteinian parameters are identified, and potential constraints on the background value of the scalar field are obtained based on possible observations of the gravitational waves by the future ground based gravitational wave detectors. Additionally, constraints on the background value of the scalar field are derived using updated observational data from the PSR J0737-3039 system. The last rescrictions are comparable in order of magnitude to the best currently existing constraints, which were derived from observational data within the solar system.</description>

      <title>Spikes and spines in 3D Lorentzian simplicial quantum gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simplicial approaches to quantum gravity such as Quantum Regge Calculus and Spin Foams include configurations where bulk edges can become arbitrarily large while keeping the lengths of the boundary edges small. Such configurations pose significant challenges in Euclidean Quantum Regge Calculus, as they lead to infinities for the partition function and length expectation values. Here we investigate such configurations in three-dimensional Lorentzian Quantum Regge Calculus, and find that the partition function and length expectation values remain finite. This shows that the Lorentzian approach can avoid a key issue of the Euclidean approach. We also find that the space of configurations, for which bulk edges can become very large, is much richer than in the Euclidean case. In particular, it includes configurations with irregular light-cone structures, which lead to imaginary terms in the Regge action and branch cuts along the Lorentzian path integral contour. Hence, to meaningfully define the Lorentzian Regge path integral, one needs to clarify how such configurations should be handled.</description>

      <title>Time evolution of Von Neumann entropy for a Kerr-Taub-NUT black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the evolution of an evaporating black hole, described by the Kerr--Taub--NUT metric, which emits scalar particles. We found that allowing the black hole to radiate massless scalar particles increases the angular momentum loss rate while decreasing the loss rate of the NUT parameter and black hole mass. In fact, it means that angular momentum will disappear faster than the other black hole parameters (mass and NUT parameter) during the evaporation process. We also calculate the time evolution of the mass, angular momentum, and NUT parameter in order to get the evolution of the Von Neumann entropy of the black hole. We found that the entropy follows approximately the so-called Page curve, where the $\beta$ parameter, which quantifies the amount of radiation, affects the evaporation process. Implying that high $\beta$ values accelerate the evaporation process of a Kerr--Taub--NUT black hole.</description>

      <title>Preserving quantum information in $f(Q)$ cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effects of cosmological expansion on quantum bosonic states are investigated, using quantum information theory. In particular, a generic Bogoliubov transformation of bosonic field modes is considered and the state change on a single mode is regarded as the effect of a quantum channel. Properties and capacities of this channel are thus explored in the framework of $f(Q)$ theories. As immediate result, we obtain that the information on a single-mode state appears better preserved, whenever the number of particles produced by the cosmological expansion is small. Hence, similarly to general relativity, we show that analogous particle productions result even if we consider symmetric teleparallel gravity theories. Thus, we investigate a power law $f(Q)$ model, leaving unaltered the effective gravitational coupling, and minimise the corresponding particle production. We thus show how to optimise the preservation of classical and quantum information, stored in a bosonic mode states in the remote past. Finally, we compare our findings with those obtained in general relativity.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopy of magnetized black holes and topological stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19327</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19327v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the linear response of four dimensional magnetized black holes and regular topological stars arising from dimensional compactification of Einstein-Maxwell theory in five dimensions. We consider both radial and nonradial perturbations and study the stability of these solutions, both in the frequency and in the time domain. Due to the presence of magnetic fluxes in the background, axial (i.e., odd-parity) gravitational perturbations are coupled to polar (i.e., even-parity) electromagnetic perturbations (Type-I sector) whereas polar gravitational and scalar perturbations are coupled to axial electromagnetic ones (Type-II sector). We provide a comprehensive analytical and numerical study of the radial perturbations and of the Type I sector, finding no evidence of linear instabilities (besides the already known Gregory-Laflamme instability of black strings occurring only in a certain range of the parameters), even despite the fact that the effective potential for radial perturbations of topological stars is negative and divergent near the inner boundary. Ultracompact topological stars exhibit long-lived trapped modes that give rise to echoes in the time-domain response. Their prompt response is very similar to that of the corresponding black hole with comparable charge-to-mass ratio. This provides a concrete realization of ultracompact objects arising from a well-defined theory. The numerical analysis of the Type-II sector will appear in a companion paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19355v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Theories formulated in the arena of teleparallel geometries are generically plagued by ghost-like instabilities or other pathologies that are ultimately caused by the breaking of some symmetries. In this work, we construct a class of ghost-free theories based on a symmetry under Transverse Diffeomorphisms that is naturally realised in symmetric teleparallelism. We explicitly show their equivalence to a family of theories with an extra scalar field plus a global degree of freedom and how Horndeski theories and healthy couplings to matter fields can be readily accommodated.</description>

      <title>Resonant Conversion of Gravitational Waves in Neutron Star Magnetospheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: High frequency gravitational waves are the subject of rapidly growing interest in the theoretical and experimental community. In this work we calculate the resonant conversion of gravitational waves into photons in the magnetospheres of neutron stars via the inverse Gertsenshtein mechanism. The resonance occurs in regions where the vacuum birefringence effects cancel the classical plasma contribution to the photon dispersion relation, leading to a massless photon in the medium which becomes kinematically matched to the graviton. We set limits on the amplitude of a possible stochastic background of gravitational waves using X-ray and IR flux measurements of neutron stars. Using Chandra ($2-8\,\text{keV}$) and NuSTAR ($3-79\,\text{keV}$) observations of RX J1856.6-3754, we set strain limits $h_c^{\rm lim} \simeq 10^{-26} - 10^{-24}$ in the frequency range $ 5\times 10^{17}\, {\rm Hz} \lesssim f \lesssim 2\times 10^{19}\,\text{Hz}$. Our limits are many orders of magnitude stronger than existing constrains from individual neutron stars at the same frequencies. We also use recent JWST observations of the Magnetar 4U 0142+61 in the range $2.7\times 10^{13}\, {\rm Hz} \lesssim f \lesssim 5.9\times 10^{13}\, {\rm Hz} $, setting a limit $h_{\rm c}^{\rm lim} \simeq 5 \times 10^{-19}$. These constraints are in complementary frequency ranges to laboratory searches with CAST, OSQAR and ALPS II. We expect these limits to be improved both in reach and breadth with a more exhaustive use of telescope data across the full spectrum of frequencies and targets.</description>

      <title>Insights into Gravitinos Abundance, Cosmic Strings and Stochastic Gravitational Wave Background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18828v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate D-term inflation within the framework of supergravity, employing the minimal Kahler potential. Our study reveals that this model can overcome the {\eta}-problem found in F-term models. Additionally, we explore reheating dynamics and gravitino production, emphasizing the interplay between reheating temperature, spectral index, and gravitino abundance. Our analysis indicates that gravitino production is sensitive to the equation of state during reheating, affecting the reheating temperature and subsequent dark matter relic density. Perturbation theory reveals that Primordial Gravitational Waves (PGWs) evolve according to second-order effects arising from first-order curvature perturbations. In fact, the spectral energy density of these waves is particularly relevant to Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) observations. Furthermore, we analyze gravitational waves generated by cosmic strings, providing critical constraints on early Universe dynamics and cosmic string properties. The dimensionless string tension significantly influences the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings post-inflation. Finally, the stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) produced by cosmic strings is influenced by the energy scales of inflation and string formation.</description>

      <title>Witnessing mass-energy equivalence with trapped atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19037v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: State-of-the-art atom interferometers can keep atoms in a superposition of heights in Earth's gravitational field for times reaching minute-scale, allowing for precise measurements of the gravitational potential. Yet, the phase shifts measured in such experiments can always be explained with a non-relativistic theory of gravity. There is therefore growing interest in finding feasible ways to use such new experimental capabilities to go beyond the non-relativistic regime. Here we propose modifying the existing experimental setups to probe both the quantum and the general relativistic effects on the atom's dynamics. Our proposal consists of adding two additional laser pulses in a trapped atom interferometer that would set up a quantum clock trapped at a superposition of heights reading a quantum superposition of relativistic proper times. We derive the phases acquired by different trajectories in the interferometer and demonstrate that the effect of superposition of proper times would manifest itself in two ways in the interference pattern: as visibility modulations, and as a shift of the resonant frequency of the atom. We argue that the latter might be observable with current technology.</description>

Abstract: In this paper we consider a high energy scattering of free scalar particles through a gravitational field. The amplitude of the scattering in this limit is governed by reggeized gravitons. Therefore, we discuss an appearance of the reggeized gravitons in the framework of Einstein-Hilbert gravity and consider Lipatov's effective action for the reggeized gravitons. We calculate the trajectory of the corresponding $t$-channel amplitude in the framework and thereafter define the leading order amplitude of scattering of two massive scalar particles. A difference of the amplitude obtained at high energy limit from the amplitude in Newton's (low energy) limit is discussed. It is demonstrated, that the graviton's propagator reggeization leads to the amplification of the high energy amplitude. Effectively, this enhancement of the amplitude appears as a redefinition of the masses of particles involved in the scattering. An impact factor of the interaction of scalar particle with the reggeized gravitons is also calculated and possible applications of the approach are discussed as well.</description>

Abstract: The cosmological horizon has an associated entropy suggesting that it might encode a quantum mechanical system on its surface. This has motivated extending the principles of the anti-de Sitter (AdS) space/ conformal field theory (CFT) correspondence to static patch holography. Some of our understanding of the AdS/CFT holography has been catalyzed by exploring the geometric duals to quantum information observables in the CFT side of the correspondence. In particular, holographic complexity captures the evolution of the black hole interior, which is conjectured to be dual to a measure of the difficulty in preparing a quantum circuit on the CFT side. Motivated by these developments, we will propose complexity observables defined in geometric terms for an asymptotically dS spacetime and its putative quantum mechanical dual system. To sharply define complexity observables in the static patch of dS space, they will be anchored to a time-like Dirichlet surface where the dual theory is located, called the stretched horizon. While static patch holography needs much more development in order to reach a level of understanding of the likes of the AdS/CFT correspondence, we hope that the work reported in this thesis allows for crucial steps in this direction.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19268v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the stability of fracton gravity, a variant of linearized gravity where the gauge symmetry is restricted to longitudinal diffeomorphisms. These transformations can be connected to a spacetime generalization of dipole symmetry, hence the tag fracton. We find that fracton gravity features an instability in the spin-1 sector corresponding to solutions with growing amplitude. This dynamical instability can be removed by tuning the couplings of the theory. Nonetheless, the Hamiltonian for the spin-1 modes remains always unbounded from below when evaluated on the classical solutions. We find no other sources of instability in the spin-2 or spin-0 sectors. We analyze in detail the canonical formulation and the constraints arguing that neither auxiliary fields nor gauge-fixing conditions can be employed to remove the problematic vector modes or stabilize them.</description>

Abstract: We study the effects of superfluid dark matter on the structure of a cosmic string wake, considering both the effects of regular and quantum pressure terms. We consider the total fluid to consist of a combination of baryons and dark matter. Hence, we are also able to study the effects of superfluid dark matter on the distribution of baryons inside the wake. We focus on parameter values for the superfluid dark matter which allow a MONDian explanation of galaxy rotation curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carrollian amplitudes are flat space amplitudes written in position space at null infinity which can be re-interpreted as correlators in a putative dual Carrollian CFT. We argue that these amplitudes are the natural objects obtained in the flat space limit of AdS Lorentzian boundary correlators. The flat limit is taken entirely in position space by introducing Bondi coordinates in the bulk. From the bulk perspective, this procedure makes it manifest that the flat limit of any Witten diagram is the corresponding flat space Feynman diagram. It also makes explicit the fact that the flat limit in the bulk is implemented by a Carrollian limit at the boundary. We systematically analyse tree-level two, three and four-point correlators. Familiar features such as the distributional nature of Carrollian amplitudes and the presence of a bulk point singularity arise naturally as a consequence of requiring a finite and non-trivial Carrollian limit.</description>

Abstract: In asymptotically flat spacetimes, bearing the null geodesics reaching the future null infinity in mind, we propose new concepts, the "dark horizons" as generalizations of the photon sphere. They are defined in terms of the structure of escape/capture cones of photons with respect to a unit timelike vector field. More specifically, considering a two-sphere that represents a set of emission directions of photons, the dark horizons are located at positions where a hemisphere is marginally included in the capture and escape cones, respectively. We show that both of them are absent in the Minkowski spacetime, while they exist in spacetimes with black hole(s) under a certain condition. We derive the general properties of the dark horizons in spherically symmetric spacetimes and explicitly calculate the locations of the dark horizons in the Vaidya spacetime and the Kerr spacetime.</description>

      <title>Stochastic gravitational wave background: birth from string-wall death</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.08185v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a new source of stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) from the final collapse of a network of topological defects. Typically, the final collapse is considered negligible for generating gravitational waves (GWs) due to its subdominance compared with the network's long-term evolution in the scaling regime. However, in some cases, a network can be driven outside of horizon by inflation and later re-enter horizon. Then, the network's final collapse after re-entering horizon becomes the dominant GW source and therefore cannot be neglected. We demonstrate this phenomenon in the context of $N_{\rm DW}=1$ string-wall networks which naturally arise in axion models, although the framework can be generalized to other types of topological networks. The final collapse of walls bounded by strings releases GWs. Our calculation of the corresponding GW spectrum suggests it could be related to the first few bins of the nano-Hertz SGWB signal possibly detected by various Pulsar Timing Array (PTA) collaborations. However, it is important to note that such GW spectrum falls within a relatively narrow frequency range, which may not completely account for the PTA signal that spans more than one order of magnitude in frequency. Furthermore, with different parameter choices, the resultant GWs generated in this mechanism could be probed by various GW interferometry experiments.</description>

      <title>Mass Ratio of Binary Black Holes Determined from LIGO/Virgo Data Restricted to Small False Alarm Rate</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.14042v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We focus on gravitational-wave events of binary black-hole mergers up to the third observing run with the minimum false alarm rate smaller than $10^{-5}\,{\rm yr}^{-1}$. These events tell us that the mass ratio of two black holes follows $m_2/m_1=0.723$ with the chance probability of 0.00301% for the chirp mass $M_{\rm chirp} &gt; 18\,M_{\odot}$. We show that the relation of $m_2/m_1=0.723$ is consistent with the binaries originated from population III stars which are the first stars in the universe. On the other hand, it is found for ${\rm chirp} &lt; 18 M_{\odot}$ that the mass ratio follows $m_2/m_1=0.601$ with the chance probability of 0.117% if we ignore GW190412 with $m_2/m_1\sim 0.32$. This suggests a different origin from that for $M_{\rm chirp} &gt; 18 M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration for TDiff scalar fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.17422v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the idea of restoring the full diffeomorphism (Diff) invariance in theories with only transverse diffeomorphisms (TDiff) by the introduction of additional fields. In particular, we consider in detail the case of a TDiff invariant scalar field and how Diff symmetry can be restored preserving locality by introducing an additional vector field. We reobtain the corresponding dynamics and energy-momentum tensor from the covariantized action and analyze the potential and kinetic domination regimes. For the former, the theory describes a cosmological constant-type behaviour, while for the latter we show that the theory can describe an adiabatic perfect fluid whose equation of state and speed of sound is obtained in a straightforward way. Furthermore, the reformulation with the full symmetry allows us to analyze the gravitational properties of the theory beyond those particular regimes. In particular, we find the general expression for the effective speed of sound of the non-adiabatic perfect fluid, which provides us with physically reasonable conditions that should be satisfied by the coupling functions. Finally, we investigate the particular models leading to an adiabatic fluid.</description>

      <title>The complete exterior spacetime of spherical Brans-Dicke stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.13887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the complete expression for the Brans Class I exterior spacetime explicitly in terms of the energy and pressures profiles of a stationary spherisymmetric gravity source. This novel and generic expression is achieved in a parsimonious manner, requiring only a subset of the Brans-Dicke field equation and the scalar equation. For distant orbiting test particles, this expression promptly provides a simple, closed and exact formula of the [textgreek]&lt;LaTeX&gt;\textgreek{g}&lt;/LaTeX&gt; Eddington parameter, which reads {\gamma}_{exact}=(({\omega}+1+({\omega}+2){\Theta})/({\omega}+2+({\omega}+1){\Theta})), where {\Theta} is the ratio of the star's "total pressure" integral over its energy integral. This non-perturbative result reproduces the usual Post-Newtonian (({\omega}+1)/({\omega}+2)) expression in the case of a "Newtonian star", in which the pressure is negligible with respect to the energy density. Furthermore, it converges to the General Relativity value ({\gamma}_{GR}=1) as the star's equation of state approaches that of ultra-relativistic matter (in which case {\Theta} approaches 1), a behavior consistent with broader studies on scalar-tensor gravity. Our derivation underscores the essence of these results involving (1) the key relevant portion of the Brans-Dicke field equations, (2) the uniqueness of the Brans Class I vacuum solution for the non-phantom action, viz. {\omega}&gt;-3/2, and (3) the involvement of only two free parameters in this solution, hence requiring two quantities (energy and pressure integrals) of the mass source to fully characterize the solution. From a practical standpoint, it elucidates how a given stellar interior structure model determines the star's exterior gravitational field and impacts the motions of light objects (such as planets and accretion disks) orbiting it.</description>

Abstract: We study the propagation of the quantum field perturbations in the interior of the Schwarzschild black hole. The interior of the black hole is like an anisotropic cosmological background which expands in one extended direction while contracting in azimuthal directions. Solving the quantum mode functions approximately, we calculate the expectation values of physical quantities such as the energy density $\langle \rho \rangle$ and pressure $\langle P\rangle$ as measured by an observer in the interior of the black hole. We employ a combination of the $\zeta$ function regularization and dimensional regularization schemes to regularize the UV divergences in the energy momentum tensor associated to these quantum perturbations. By solving the Einstein field equations, we calculate the quantum backreactions induced in the background geometry. We speculate that the effects of quantum fluctuations in the interior of the black hole can be measured by the exterior observer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07957v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study observational signatures of nonsingular ultracompact objects regularized by nonlinear electrodynamics. The phenomenon of birefringence causes photons of different polarizations to propagate with respect to two distinct metrics, which manifests itself in the appearance of additional light rings surrounding the ultracompact object. We analyze the observational consequences of this result and illustrate our findings based on three regular black hole models commonly considered in the literature. We find that nonsingular horizonless ultracompact objects sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics possess an odd number of light rings and discuss the viability of this effective description of their properties. In addition, we compare the phase velocities of polarized light rays propagating in nonsingular geometries sourced by nonlinear electrodynamics to the corresponding phase velocity in the Schwarzschild spacetime and demonstrate that regularizing the singularity by means of a theory that does not adhere to the Maxwell weak-field limit may lead to the emergence of acausal regions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2211.06486v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Context. Motivated by the recent achievements of a full general relativistic method in determining black hole (BH) parameters, we continue to estimate the mass-to-distance ratio of the supermassive BHs hosted at the core of the active galactic nuclei (AGNs) of the megamaser galaxies NGC 1320, NGC 1194, NGC 5495, and Mrk 1029. Aims. Our aim is to study the properties of super massive BHs at the centers of the selected AGNs by using a full general relativistic method that allows us to address the potential detection of relativistic effects within such astrophysical systems. Methods. In order to perform statistical estimations with publicly available observational data, we used a general relativistic model that describes BH rotation curves and further employed a Bayesian fitting method. Results. We estimated the mass-to-distance ratio of the aforementioned BHs, their position and the recessional redshifts of the host galaxies produced by both peculiar motion and cosmological expansion of the Universe. Finally, we calculated the gravitational redshift of the closest maser to the BH for each AGN. This gravitational redshift is a general relativistic effect produced by the gravitational field of the BH properly included in the modelling.</description>

Abstract: The bound on the proton lifetime is one of a small handful of observations that constrains physics not far from the Planck scale. This calls for a calculation of the proton lifetime in quantum gravity. Here, we calculate how quantum fluctuations of the metric impact four-fermion interactions which mediate proton decay. We find that quantum gravity lowers the scaling dimension of the four-fermion interaction, suppressing proton decay and raising the proton lifetime significantly. As a special case, we analyze asymptotically safe quantum gravity, in which we discover that proton-decay-mediating four-fermion interactions are strictly zero.</description>

      <title>Generalized Black Hole Entropy is von Neumann Entropy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.15897v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown that the von Neumann algebras of observables dressed to the mass of a Schwarzschild-AdS black hole or an observer in de Sitter are Type II, and thus admit well-defined traces. The von Neumann entropies of "semi-classical" states were found to be generalized entropies. However, these arguments relied on the existence of an equilibrium (KMS) state and thus do not apply to, e.g., black holes formed from gravitational collapse, Kerr black holes, or black holes in asymptotically de Sitter space. In this paper, we present a general framework for obtaining the algebra of dressed observables for linear fields on any spacetime with a Killing horizon. We prove, assuming the existence of a stationary (but not necessarily KMS) state and suitable decay of solutions, a structure theorem that the algebra of dressed observables always contains a Type II factor "localized" on the horizon. These assumptions have been rigorously proven in most cases of interest. Applied to the algebra in the exterior of an asymptotically flat Kerr black hole, where the fields are dressed to the black hole mass and angular momentum, we find a product of a Type II$_{\infty}$ algebra on the horizon and a Type I$_{\infty}$ algebra at past null infinity. In Schwarzschild-de Sitter, despite the fact that we introduce an observer, the quantum field observables are dressed to the perturbed areas of the black hole and cosmological horizons and is the product of Type II$_{\infty}$ algebras on each horizon. In all cases, the von Neumann entropy for semiclassical states is given by the generalized entropy. Our results suggest that in all cases where there exists another "boundary structure" (e.g., an asymptotic boundary or another Killing horizon) the algebra of observables is Type II$_{\infty}$ and in the absence of such structures (e.g., de Sitter) the algebra is Type II$_{1}$.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Symphony from Oscillating Spectator Scalar Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.13060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.13060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a generic source of stochastic gravitational wave background due to the parametric resonance of oscillating scalar fields in the early Universe. By systematically analyzing benchmark models through lattice simulations and considering a wide range of parameters, we demonstrate that such a scenario can lead to detectable signals in gravitational wave detectors over a broad frequency range and potentially address the recent findings by pulsar timing array experiments. Furthermore, these models naturally yield ultralight dark matter candidates or dark radiation detectable by cosmic microwave background observatories.</description>

      <title>Gravitational R\'enyi entropy from corner terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.06765</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.06765v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide a consistent first principles prescription to compute gravitational R\'enyi entropy using Hayward corner terms. For Euclidean solutions to Einstein gravity, we compute R\'enyi entropy of Hartle--Hawking and fixed--area states by cutting open a manifold containing a conical singularity into a wedge with a corner. The entropy functional for fixed--area states is equal to the corner term itself, having a flat-entanglement spectrum, while extremization of the functional follows from the variation of the corner term under diffeomorphisms. Notably, our method does not require regularization of the conical singularity, and naturally extends to higher-curvature theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>The Surprising Effectiveness of Weyl Gravity in Probing Quantum Corrections to AdS Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computing leading higher curvature contributions to thermodynamic quantities of AdS black hole is drastically simplified once the higher curvature terms are expressed in terms of powers of Weyl tensor by applying proper field redefinitions, avoiding the usual complications caused by higher derivative Gibbons-Hawking-York (GHY) term or surface counterterms. We establish the method by computing the Euclidean action of general rotating AdS black holes in five dimensional quadratic curvature theories with or without supersymmetry and verifying the results numerically. Our result is the state of the art for charged rotating AdS black holes in five dimensional minimal gauged supergravity including corrections from all three supersymmetric curvature squared terms. Our approach facilitates precision tests in the AdS/CFT correspondence and should be applicable in diverse dimensions.</description>

      <title>A Covariant and Manifestly Projective Invariant Formulation of Thomas-Whitehead Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04813v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thomas-Whitehead (TW) gravity is a recently formulated projectively invariant extension of Einstein-Hilbert gravity. Projective geometry was used long ago by Thomas et. al. to succinctly package equivalent paths encoded by the geodesic equation. Projective invariance in gravity has further origins in string theory through a geometric action constructed from the method of coadjoint orbits using the Virasoro Algebra. A projectively invariant connection arises from this construction, a part of which is known as the diffeomorphism field. TW gravity exploits projective Gauss-Bonnet terms in the action functional to endow the diffeomorphism field with dynamics, while allowing the theory to collapse to general relativity in the limit that the diffeomorphism field vanishes and the connection becomes Levi-Civita. In the original formulation of TW gravity, the diffeomorphism field is projectively invariant but not tensorial and the connection is projectively invariant but not affine. In this paper we reformulate TW gravity in terms of projectively invariant tensor fields and a projectively invariant covariant derivative, derive field equations respecting these symmetries, and show that the field equations obtained are classically equivalent across formulations. This provides a 'Rosetta Stone' between this newly constructed covariant and projective invariant formulation of TW gravity and the original formulation that was manifestly projective invariant, but not covariant.</description>

      <title>Structure of Massive Gauge/Gravity Scattering Amplitudes, Equivalence Theorems, and Extended Double-Copy with Compactified Warped Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12713v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the structure of scattering amplitudes of massive Kaluza-Klein (KK) states in the compactified 5-dimensional warped gauge and gravity theories. We present systematic formulations of the gauge theory equivalence theorem (GAET) and the gravitational equivalence theorem (GRET) for warped KK theories in $R_\xi^{}$ gauge, where the GAET connects the scattering amplitudes of longitudinal KK gauge bosons to that of the corresponding KK Goldstone bosons and the GRET connects the scattering amplitudes of KK gravitons of helicity-zero (helicity-one) to that of the corresponding gravitational KK Goldstone bosons. We analyze the structure of 3-point and 4-point scattering amplitudes of massive KK gauge bosons and of massive KK gravitons as well as their corresponding Goldstone bosons. We first prove the GAET and GRET explicitly for the fundamental 3-point KK gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes. We then demonstrate that the validity of the GAET and GRET for 4-point gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes can be reduced to the validity of GAET and GRET for 3-point gauge/gravity scattering amplitudes at tree level. With these, we study the double-copy construction of KK scattering amplitudes in the warped gauge/gravity theories. We newly realize the double-copy for massive 3-point full gauge/gravity amplitudes at tree level under proper correspondences of color-kinematics and of gauge/gravity couplings, whereas we can construct the double-copy for 4-point KK gauge/gravity amplitudes to the leading order (LO) of high energy expansion. We further demonstrate that this LO double-copy construction can be extended to $N$-point KK scattering amplitudes with $N\geqslant 4$.</description>
