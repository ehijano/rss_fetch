      <title>Single track orbit determination analysis for low Earth orbit with approximated J2 dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the domain of Space Situational Awareness (SSA), the challenges pertaining to orbit determination and catalog correlation are notably pronounced, partly attributable to the escalating presence of non-cooperative satellites engaging in unspecified maneuvers at irregular intervals. This study introduces an initial orbit determination methodology reliant upon data obtained from a single surveillance radar, such as the Spanish Space Surveillance and Tracking Surveillance Radar (S3TSR). The need for fast algorithms within an operational context is considered here as the main design driver. The result is a least-squares fitting procedure that incorporates an analytically formulated approximation of the dynamics under the J2 perturbation, valid for short-term propagation. The algorithm makes use of all available observables, including range-rate, which makes it distinct from other similar methods. The method is compared in a battery of synthetic tests against a classical range and angles fitting method (GTDS) to study the effect of the track length and density of measurements on the full state estimation. The presented methodology is quite versatile, and it is leveraged to improve the estimation quality by adding information of the object's orbital plane obtained from predictions. The resulting method has been named OPOD.</description>

      <title>Language Models are Spacecraft Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00413</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00413v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent trends are emerging in the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as autonomous agents that take actions based on the content of the user text prompts. We intend to apply these concepts to the field of Guidance, Navigation, and Control in space, enabling LLMs to have a significant role in the decision-making process for autonomous satellite operations. As a first step towards this goal, we have developed a pure LLM-based solution for the Kerbal Space Program Differential Games (KSPDG) challenge, a public software design competition where participants create autonomous agents for maneuvering satellites involved in non-cooperative space operations, running on the KSP game engine. Our approach leverages prompt engineering, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning techniques to create an effective LLM-based agent that ranked 2nd in the competition. To the best of our knowledge, this work pioneers the integration of LLM agents into space research. Code is available at https://github.com/ARCLab-MIT/kspdg.</description>

      <title>Diagnostics of the solar coronal plasmas by magnetohydrodynamic waves: Magnetohydrodynamic seismology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00105v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Macroscopic wave and oscillatory phenomena ubiquitously detected in the plasma of the corona of the Sun are interpreted in terms of magnetohydrodynamic theory. Fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves are clearly distinguished in observations. Properties of coronal magnetohydrodynamic waves are determined by local parameters of the plasma, including the field-aligned filamentation typical for the corona. It makes coronal magnetohydrodynamic waves reliable probes of the coronal plasma structures by the method of magnetohydrodynamic seismology. For example, propagating slow waves indicate the local direction of the guiding magnetic field. Standing, sloshing and propagating slow waves can be used for probing the coronal heating function and the polytropic index. Kink oscillations of coronal plasma loops provide us with the estimations of the absolute value of the magnetic field in oscillating plasma loops. This tutorial introduces several techniques of magnetohydrodynamic seismology of solar coronal plasmas. It includes the description of practical steps in the data acquisition, pre-processing, and processing using the open-access data of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on the Solar Dynamics Observatory spacecraft, and elaborated data analysis techniques of motion magnification and Bayesian statistics.</description>

      <title>Analytic Model and Magnetohydrodynamic Simulations of Three-dimensional Magnetic Switchbacks</title>

Abstract: Parker Solar Probe observations reveal that the near-Sun space is almost filled with magnetic switchbacks (``switchbacks'' hereinafter), which may be a major contributor to the heating and acceleration of solar wind. Here, for the first time, we develop an analytic model of an axisymmetric switchback with uniform magnetic field strength. In this model, three parameters control the geometry of the switchback: height (length along the background magnetic field), width (thickness along radial direction perpendicular to the background field), and the radial distance from the center of switchback to the central axis, which is a proxy of the size of the switchback along the third dimension. We carry out three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to investigate the dynamic evolution of the switchback. Comparing simulations conducted with compressible and incompressible codes, we verify that compressibility, i.e. parametric decay instability, is necessary for destabilizing the switchback. Our simulations also reveal that the geometry of the switchback significantly affects how fast the switchback destabilizes. The most stable switchbacks are 2D-like (planar) structures with large aspect ratios (length to width), consistent with the observations. We show that when plasma beta ($\beta$) is smaller than one, the switchback is more stable as $\beta$ increases. However, when $\beta$ is greater than one, the switchback becomes very unstable as the pattern of the growing compressive fluctuations changes. Our results may explain some of the observational features of switchbacks, including the large aspect ratios and nearly constant occurrence rates in the inner heliosphere.</description>

      <title>A Virtual Solar Wind Monitor at Mars with Uncertainty Quantification using Gaussian Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01932</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.01932v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single spacecraft missions do not measure the pristine solar wind continuously because of the spacecrafts' orbital trajectory. The infrequent spatiotemporal cadence of measurement fundamentally limits conclusions about solar wind-magnetosphere coupling throughout the solar system. At Mars, such single spacecraft missions result in limitations for assessing the solar wind's role in causing lower altitude observations such as auroral dynamics or atmospheric loss. In this work, we detail the development of a virtual solar wind monitor from the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile Evolution (MAVEN) mission; a single spacecraft. This virtual solar wind monitor provides a continuous estimate of the solar wind upstream from Mars with uncertainties. We specifically employ Gaussian process regression to estimate the upstream solar wind and uncertainty estimations that scale with the data sparsity of our real observations. This proxy enables continuous solar wind estimation at Mars with representative uncertainties for the majority of the time since since late 2014. We conclude by discussing suggested uses of this virtual solar wind monitor for statistical studies of the Mars space environment and heliosphere.</description>
