      <title>Turquoise Magic Wavelength of the ${}^{87}$Sr Clock Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optical lattice clocks of fermionic strontium offer a versatile platform for probing fundamental physics and developing quantum technologies. The bivalent electronic structure of strontium gives rise to a doubly-forbidden atomic transition that is accessible due to hyperfine mixing in fermionic strontium-87, thus resulting in a sub-millihertz natural linewidth. Currently, the most accurate optical lattice clocks operate on this narrow transition by tightly trapping strontium-87 atoms in a {\em magic} optical lattice at 813~nm. {\em Magic} wavelengths occur where the Stark shifts of both the ground and excited states are equivalent, thus eliminating any position and intensity-dependent broadening of the corresponding transition. Theoretical calculations of the electronic structure of strontium-87 have also predicted another {\em magic} wavelength of the clock transition at 497.01(57)~nm. In this work, we experimentally measure the novel {\em magic} wavelength to be $497.4363(3)$~nm. Compared to the 813~nm {\em magic} wavelength, 497~nm is closer to the strong 461~nm dipolar transition of strontium, resulting in larger atomic polarizability by an order of magnitude, providing deeper traps with less optical power. The proximity to the 461~transition also leads to an enhanced sensitivity of 334(10)~Hz/(nm\,$E_{R}$) at the {\em magic} wavelength.</description>

      <title>2D transverse laser cooling of a hexapole focused beam of cold BaF molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19069v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A cryogenic buffer gas beam, an electrostatic hexapole lens, and 2D transverse Doppler laser cooling are combined to produce a bright beam of barium monofluoride ($^{138}$Ba$^{19}$F) molecules. Experimental results and trajectory simulations are used to study the laser cooling effect as a function of laser detuning, laser power, laser alignment, and interaction time. A scattering rate of 6.1(1.4) $\times 10^{5}$ s$^{-1}$ on the laser cooling transition is obtained; this is $14 \%$ of the expected maximum, which is attributed to limited control of the magnetic field used to remix dark states. Using 3 tuneable lasers with appropriate sidebands and detuning, each molecule scatters approximately 400 photons during 2D laser cooling, limited by the interaction time and scattering rate. Leaks to dark states are less than 10$\%$. The experimental results are used to benchmark the trajectory simulations to predict the achievable flux 3.5 m downstream for a planned $e$EDM experiment.</description>

      <title>Long-Range Interacting Particles on a Helix: A Statistical and Correlation Analysis of Equilibrium Configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a statistical and correlational analysis of the spatial and energetic properties of
  equilibrium configurations of
  a few-body system of two to eight equally charged classical particles that are confined
  on a one-dimensional helical manifold. The two-body system has been demonstrated to yield an oscillatory
  effective potential, thus providing stable equilibrium configurations despite the repulsive
  Coulomb interactions. As the system size grows, the number of equilibria increases, approximately
  following a power-law.
  This can be attributed to the increasing complexity in the highly non-linear oscillatory
  behavior of the potential energy surface.
  This property is reflected in a crossover from a spatially regular distribution of equilibria
  for the two-body system to a heightened degree of disorder upon the addition of particles.
  However, in accordance with the repulsion within a helical winding, the
  observed interparticle distances in equilibrium configurations cluster around
  values of odd multiples of half a helical winding, thus maintaining an underlying regularity.
  Furthermore, an energetic hierarchy exists based on the spatial location of the local equilibria,
  which is subject to increasing fluctuations as the system size grows.</description>

      <title>Narrow-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling in the $^{3}\mathrm{P}_{2}$ metastable state of strontium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19701v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate narrow-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling of magnetically trapped strontium (Sr) in the $5s5p\,^{3}\textrm{P}_{2}$ state. A 641 nm standing-wave, blue-detuned from the $5s4d\,^{3}\textrm{D}_{3}$$\,\rightarrow$ $\,5p4d\,^{3}\textrm{F}_{4}$ transition, creates a dissipative optical lattice in the $^{3}\textrm{D}_{3}$ state. By combining Doppler cooling and Sisyphus cooling on the $5s5p\,^{3}\textrm{P}_{2}$$\,\rightarrow$ $5s4d\,^{3}\textrm{D}_{3}$ transition at 2.92 ${\mu}$m, we observed efficient cooling of magnetically trapped atoms. By optically pumping the atoms to the $5s5p\,^{3}\textrm{P}_{0}$ state, we facilitate continuous outcoupling via a moving optical lattice with two fold improvement in atom number. Our scheme applies to next-generation quantum sensors using continuous ultracold atomic beams.</description>

      <title>Transversal Surface-Code Game Powered by Neutral Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutral atom technologies have opened the door to novel theoretical advances in surface-code protocols for fault-tolerant quantum computation (FTQC), offering a compelling alternative to lattice surgery by leveraging transversal gates. However, a crucial gap remains between the theory of FTQC and its practical realization on neutral atom systems; most critically, a key theoretical requirement -- that syndrome extraction must be performed frequently enough to keep error accumulation below a threshold constant -- is difficult to satisfy in a scalable manner in conventional zoned approach. In this work, we develop a comprehensive theoretical framework that closes such a gap, bridging theoretical advances in surface-code fault-tolerant protocols with capabilities of neutral atoms. Building on the "game of surface code" framework originally developed for superconducting qubits, we introduce an alternative game-based paradigm for transversal-gate FTQC that harnesses the unique strengths of neutral atom arrays. The game rules are designed to enable syndrome extraction at any intermediate step during logical gate implementation, ensuring compatibility with the threshold theorem. We further present an efficient method for designing resource state factories tailored to transversal-gate FTQC. As an application, our framework offers a systematic methodology and high-level abstraction for resource estimation and optimization, demonstrating that space-time performance competitive with a baseline lattice-surgery-based approach on superconducting qubits is possible, even when physical operations on neutral atoms are orders of magnitude slower. These results establish a solid foundation that bridges the theory and experiment of FTQC powered by neutral atoms, charting a well-founded pathway toward scalable, fault-tolerant quantum computers and setting practical directions for technological development.</description>

      <title>Localization and splitting of a quantum droplet by immersing a heavy impurity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We unravel the existence and nonequilibrium response of one-dimensional harmonically trapped droplet configurations in the presence of a central repulsive or attractive potential well mimicking the effect of a heavy impurity. For fixed negative chemical potentials, it is shown that droplets fragment into two for increasing repulsive potential heights, a process that occurs faster for larger widths. However, atoms from the droplet accumulate at the attractive potential, especially for wider ones, leading to a deformed droplet and eventually to the termination of the solution. Linearization analysis yields the underlying excitation spectrum which dictates stability and the behavior of the ensuing collective modes. Quenches in the potential height are used to demonstrate dynamical fragmentation of the droplet for repulsive potentials as well as self-evaporation along with droplet localization and eventual relaxation for longer evolution times in the case of attractive potential wells. The many-body character of the dynamics is explicated by evaluating the participating single-particle eigenstates manifesting the superposition nature of the droplet state. Our results should be detectable by current ultracold atom experiments and may inspire engineered droplet dynamics with the aid of external potentials.</description>

      <title>Imaging valence electron rearrangement in a chemical reaction using hard X-ray scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have observed the signatures of valence electron rearrangement in photoexcited ammonia using ultrafast hard X-ray scattering. Time-resolved X-ray scattering is a powerful tool for imaging structural dynamics in molecules because of the strong scattering from the core electrons localized near each nucleus. Such core-electron contributions generally dominate the differential scattering signal, masking any signatures of rearrangement in the chemically important valence electrons. Ammonia represents an exception to the typically high core-to-valence electron ratio. We measured 9.8 keV X-ray scattering from gas-phase deuterated ammonia following photoexcitation via a 200 nm pump pulse to the 3s Rydberg state. We observed changes in the recorded scattering patterns due to the initial photoexcitation and subsequent deuterium dissociation. Ab initio calculations confirm that the observed signal is sensitive to the rearrangement of the single photoexcited valence electron as well as the interplay between adiabatic and nonadiabatic dissociation channels. The use of ultrafast hard X-ray scattering to image the structural rearrangement of single valence electrons constitutes an important advance in tracking valence electronic structure in photoexcited atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of Giant Atom Coupled with Disordered Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While ideal lattice models have been widely used to study giant-atom-lattice systems, they often neglect the disorder induced by defects during experimental fabrication. This work systematically explores the dynamics of a giant atom coupled to a disordered lattice characterized by random eigenfrequency fluctuations. By analyzing atomic excitation probabilities, photon dynamics, and energy spectra, we reveal that the system exhibits remarkable robustness when disorder is confined within a specific range. The atomic excitation probability remains stable, the lattice evolution process shows reproducibility, and the energy spectrum structure is minimally distorted. Notably, we introduce a quantitative parameter to measure non-Markovianity and demonstrate that disorder significantly influences the system's memory effects. These findings provide insights into the interplay between disorder, non-Markovianity, and photon dynamics, with potential applications in quantum information processing and the design of robust quantum devices.</description>

      <title>Effect of Berry connection on attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy in gapped graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated the attosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (ATAS) in gapped graphene by numerically solving the four-band density-matrix equations. Our results reveal that, in contrast to graphene whose fishbone-shaped spectra primarily oscillates at twice the frequency of the pump laser, the ATAS of gapped graphene exhibits a first-order harmonic component induced by the Berry connection. To gain insight into this interesting results, we employ a simplified model that considers only the nonequivalent electrons at $\Gamma$ and $\textrm{M}$ points in the Brillouin zone. This model allows us to derive an analytical expression for the ATAS contribution stemming from the Berry connection. Our analytical results qualitatively reproduce the key features observed in the numerical simulations, and reveal that the first-order harmonic component of spectra arises ont only from the Berry connections but also from the energy shifts associated with the effective mass of electrons at the $\Gamma$ and $\textrm{M}$ points. These results shed light on the complex generation mechanism of the ATAS in symmetry-broken materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Classical Computing for Time-Dependent Ion-Atom Collision Dynamics: Applications to Charge Transfer Cross Section Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The simulation of ion-atom collisions remains a formidable challenge due to the complex interplay between electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom. We present a hybrid quantum-classical computing framework for simulating time-dependent ion-atom collision dynamics, within which two variational quantum time evolution algorithms are implemented. To validate our framework, we simulate the charge transfer dynamics and compute the corresponding cross sections for the proton-hydrogen collision system across an energy range of 1--25~keV. Our results accurately reproduce the charge transfer dynamics with high fidelity and exhibit very good agreement with available experimental and theoretical cross section data across the entire energy range. These results highlight the accuracy and applicability of our hybrid quantum-classical framework for scattering cross section calculations. Our work demonstrates an effective approach for mapping time-dependent many-body collision problems onto near-term quantum computing devices, and also provides promising directions for practical applications of universal quantum computing in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era.</description>

      <title>Scalable entangling gates on ion qubits via structured light addressing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19535</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19535v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A central challenge in developing practical quantum processors is maintaining low control complexity while scaling to large numbers of qubits. Trapped-ion systems excel in small-scale operations and support rapid qubit scaling via long-chain architectures. However, their performance in larger systems is hindered by spectral crowding in radial motional modes, a problem that forces reliance on intricate pulse-shaping techniques to maintain gate fidelities. Here, we overcome this challenge by developing a novel trapped-ion processor with an individual-addressing system that generates steerable Hermite-Gaussian beam arrays. The transverse gradient of these beams couples qubits selectively to sparse axial motional modes, enabling to isolate a single mode as entanglement mediator. Leveraging this capability, we demonstrate addressable two-qubit entangling gates in chains up to six ions with fidelities consistently around 0.97, achieved without complex pulse shaping. Our method significantly reduces control overhead while preserving scalability, providing a crucial advance toward practical large-scale trapped-ion quantum computing.</description>

      <title>Discovery of entanglement generation by elastic collision to realise the original Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen thought experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09721</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09721v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The amazing quantum effect of `entanglement' was discovered in the 1935 thought experiment by Albert Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen (`EPR'). The ensuing research opened up fundamental questions and led to experiments that proved that quantum theory cannot be completed by local hidden variables. Remarkably, EPR did not discuss how to create the entanglement in their thought experiment. Here I add this part. What is required in the original EPR thought experiment is a simple elastic particle collision, an unbalanced mass ratio of e.g. 1:3 and initial states that are position and momentum squeezed, respectively. In the limiting case of infinite squeeze factors, the measurement of the position or momentum of one particle allows an absolutely precise conclusion to be drawn about the value of the same quantity of the other particle. The EPR idea has never been tested in this way. I outline a way to do this.</description>

      <title>Two dimensional sub-wavelength topological dark state lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.</description>
