      <title>Spiking Manifesto</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Practically everything computers do is better, faster, and more power-efficient than the brain. For example, a calculator crunches numbers more energy-efficiently than any human. Yet AI models are a thousand times less efficient than the brain. These models use artificial neural networks (ANNs) and require GPUs for the multiplication of huge matrices. In contrast, spiking neural networks (SNNs) of the brain have no matrix multiplication and much smaller energy requirements. This manifesto proposes a framework for thinking about popular AI models in terms of spiking networks and polychronization, and for interpreting spiking activity as nature's way of implementing look-up tables. This offers a way to convert AI models into a novel type of architecture with the promise of a thousandfold improvement in efficiency.

      <title>Evolving Deep Learning Optimizers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11853v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a genetic algorithm framework for automatically discovering deep learning optimization algorithms. Our approach encodes optimizers as genomes that specify combinations of primitive update terms (gradient, momentum, RMS normalization, Adam-style adaptive terms, and sign-based updates) along with hyperparameters and scheduling options. Through evolutionary search over 50 generations with a population of 50 individuals, evaluated across multiple vision tasks, we discover an evolved optimizer that outperforms Adam by 2.6% in aggregate fitness and achieves a 7.7% relative improvement on CIFAR-10. The evolved optimizer combines sign-based gradient terms with adaptive moment estimation, uses lower momentum coefficients than Adam ($\beta_1$=0.86, $\beta_2$=0.94), and notably disables bias correction while enabling learning rate warmup and cosine decay. Our results demonstrate that evolutionary search can discover competitive optimization algorithms and reveal design principles that differ from hand-crafted optimizers.

      <title>Self-Motivated Growing Neural Network for Adaptive Architecture via Local Structural Plasticity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Control policies in deep reinforcement learning are often implemented with fixed-capacity multilayer perceptrons trained by backpropagation, which lack structural plasticity and depend on global error signals. This paper introduces the Self-Motivated Growing Neural Network (SMGrNN), a controller whose topology evolves online through a local Structural Plasticity Module (SPM). The SPM monitors neuron activations and edge-wise weight update statistics over short temporal windows and uses these signals to trigger neuron insertion and pruning, while synaptic weights are updated by a standard gradient-based optimizer. This allows network capacity to be regulated during learning without manual architectural tuning.
  SMGrNN is evaluated on control benchmarks via policy distillation. Compared with multilayer perceptron baselines, it achieves similar or higher returns, lower variance, and task-appropriate network sizes. Ablation studies with growth disabled and growth-only variants isolate the role of structural plasticity, showing that adaptive topology improves reward stability. The local and modular design of SPM enables future integration of a Hebbian plasticity module and spike-timing-dependent plasticity, so that SMGrNN can support both artificial and spiking neural implementations driven by local rules.</description>

      <title>OPAL: Operator-Programmed Algorithms for Landscape-Aware Black-Box Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black-box optimization often relies on evolutionary and swarm algorithms whose performance is highly problem dependent. We view an optimizer as a short program over a small vocabulary of search operators and learn this operator program separately for each problem instance. We instantiate this idea in Operator-Programmed Algorithms (OPAL), a landscape-aware framework for continuous black-box optimization that uses a small design budget with a standard differential evolution baseline to probe the landscape, builds a $k$-nearest neighbor graph over sampled points, and encodes this trajectory with a graph neural network. A meta-learner then maps the resulting representation to a phase-wise schedule of exploration, restart, and local search operators. On the CEC~2017 test suite, a single meta-trained OPAL policy is statistically competitive with state-of-the-art adaptive differential evolution variants and achieves significant improvements over simpler baselines under nonparametric tests. Ablation studies on CEC~2017 justify the choices for the design phase, the trajectory graph, and the operator-program representation, while the meta-components add only modest wall-clock overhead. Overall, the results indicate that operator-programmed, landscape-aware per-instance design is a practical way forward beyond ad hoc metaphor-based algorithms in black-box optimization.</description>

      <title>Reproducing and Dissecting Denoising Language Models for Speech Recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.13576v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Denoising language models (DLMs) have been proposed as a powerful alternative to traditional language models (LMs) for automatic speech recognition (ASR), motivated by their ability to use bidirectional context and adapt to a specific ASR model's error patterns. However, the complexity of the DLM training pipeline has hindered wider investigation. This paper presents the first independent, large-scale empirical study of DLMs. We build and release a complete, reproducible pipeline to systematically investigate the impact of key design choices. We evaluate dozens of configurations across multiple axes, including various data augmentation techniques (e.g., SpecAugment, dropout, mixup), different text-to-speech systems, and multiple decoding strategies. Our comparative analysis in a common subword vocabulary setting demonstrates that DLMs outperform traditional LMs, but only after a distinct compute tipping point. While LMs are more efficient at lower budgets, DLMs scale better with longer training, mirroring behaviors observed in diffusion language models. However, we observe smaller improvements than those reported in prior character-based work, which indicates that the DLM's performance is conditional on factors such as the vocabulary. Our analysis reveals that a key factor for improving performance is to condition the DLM on richer information from the ASR's hypothesis space, rather than just a single best guess. To this end, we introduce DLM-sum, a novel method for decoding from multiple ASR hypotheses, which consistently outperforms the previously proposed DSR decoding method. We believe our findings and public pipeline provide a crucial foundation for the community to better understand, improve, and build upon this promising class of models. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/rwth-i6/2025-denoising-lm/.</description>

      <title>A Monad-Based Clause Architecture for Artificial Age Score (AAS) in Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are often deployed as powerful yet opaque systems, leaving open how their internal memory and "self-like" behavior should be governed in a principled and auditable way. The Artificial Age Score (AAS) was previously introduced and mathematically justified through three theorems that characterise it as a metric of artificial memory aging. Building on this foundation, the present work develops an engineering-oriented, clause-based architecture that imposes law-like constraints on LLM memory and control. Twenty selected monads from Leibniz's Monadology are grouped into six bundles: ontology, dynamics, representation and consciousness, harmony and reason, body and organisation, and teleology, and each bundle is realised as an executable specification on top of the AAS kernel. Across six minimal Python implementations, these clause families are instantiated in numerical experiments acting on channel-level quantities such as recall scores, redundancy, and weights. Each implementation follows a four-step pattern: inputs and setup, clause implementation, numerical results, and implications for LLM design, emphasising that the framework is not only philosophically motivated but also directly implementable. The experiments show that the clause system exhibits bounded and interpretable behavior: AAS trajectories remain continuous and rate-limited, contradictions and unsupported claims trigger explicit penalties, and hierarchical refinement reveals an organic structure in a controlled manner. Dual views and goal-action pairs are aligned by harmony terms, and windowed drift in perfection scores separates sustained improvement from sustained degradation. Overall, the monad-based clause framework uses AAS as a backbone and provides a transparent, code-level blueprint for constraining and analyzing internal dynamics in artificial agents.</description>

      <title>KV Cache Recycling to Expand Usable Context Capacity in Low Parameter LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11851</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.11851v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Whether attention key value (KV) states computed for one prompt for a small LLM can be reused to accelerate inference on a new similar prompt, giving an increase to the space to its context memory using an approach called token recycling. Using a standard Hugging Face setup with DialoGPT-medium (a 345M parameter GPT-2 style decoder trained on 147M Reddit exchanges, 2005 to 2017) as the testbed, we build a cache of past activations and get entries by sentence embeddings, then reuse cached past key values when the cached prompt is an exact prefix of the new input. We compare recycled vs. baseline runs on latency and output fidelity, and log reuse depth in tokens. Reproducibility requires no model modifications, cached KVs are serialized to the CPU, reloaded, and supplied to the generate function to continue decoding from the cached prefix. In tests, we observe consistent speedups when prefix overlap exists, with no material degradation in output semantics, and when overlap is absent, behavior matches baseline.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Volatility Modelling with LSTM Networks: A Hybrid Approach for S&amp;P 500 Index Volatility Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate volatility forecasting is essential in banking, investment, and risk management, because expectations about future market movements directly influence current decisions. This study proposes a hybrid modelling framework that integrates a Stochastic Volatility model with a Long Short Term Memory neural network. The SV model improves statistical precision and captures latent volatility dynamics, especially in response to unforeseen events, while the LSTM network enhances the model's ability to detect complex nonlinear patterns in financial time series. The forecasting is conducted using daily data from the S and P 500 index, covering the period from January 1 1998 to December 31 2024. A rolling window approach is employed to train the model and generate one step ahead volatility forecasts. The performance of the hybrid SV-LSTM model is evaluated through both statistical testing and investment simulations. The results show that the hybrid approach outperforms both the standalone SV and LSTM models and contributes to the development of volatility modelling techniques, providing a foundation for improving risk assessment and strategic investment planning in the context of the S and P 500.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12428v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Memristor-based in-memory computing has emerged as a promising paradigm to overcome the constraints of the von Neumann bottleneck and the memory wall by enabling fully parallelisable and energy-efficient vector-matrix multiplications. We investigate the effect of nonlinear, memristor-driven weight updates on the convergence behaviour of neural networks trained with equilibrium propagation (EqProp). Six memristor models were characterised by their voltage-current hysteresis and integrated into the EBANA framework for evaluation on two benchmark classification tasks. EqProp can achieve robust convergence under nonlinear weight updates, provided that memristors exhibit a sufficiently wide resistance range of at least an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>Optimized Architectures for Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12448v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Efforts to improve Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) with architectural enhancements have been stymied by the complexity those enhancements bring, undermining the interpretability that makes KANs attractive in the first place. Here we study overprovisioned architectures combined with sparsification to learn compact, interpretable KANs without sacrificing accuracy. Crucially, we focus on differentiable sparsification, turning architecture search into an end-to-end optimization problem. Across function approximation benchmarks, dynamical systems forecasting, and real-world prediction tasks, we demonstrate competitive or superior accuracy while discovering substantially smaller models. Overprovisioning and sparsification are synergistic, with the combination outperforming either alone. The result is a principled path toward models that are both more expressive and more interpretable, addressing a key tension in scientific machine learning.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15175v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we present the physics-informed neural network (PINN) model applied particularly to dynamic problems in solid mechanics. We focus on forward and inverse problems. Particularly, we show how a PINN model can be used efficiently for material identification in a dynamic setting. In this work, we assume linear continuum elasticity. We show results for two-dimensional (2D) plane strain problem and then we proceed to apply the same techniques for a three-dimensional (3D) problem. As for the training data we use the solution based on the finite element method. We rigorously show that PINN models are accurate, robust and computationally efficient, especially as a surrogate model for material identification problems. Also, we employ state-of-the-art techniques from the PINN literature which are an improvement to the vanilla implementation of PINN. Based on our results, we believe that the framework we have developed can be readily adapted to computational platforms for solving multiple dynamic problems in solid mechanics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.14982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Metaheuristic algorithms are widely used for solving complex problems due to their ability to provide near-optimal solutions. But the execution time of these algorithms increases with the problem size and/or solution space. And, to get more promising results, we have to execute these algorithms for a large number of iterations, requiring a large amount of time and this is one of the main issues found with these algorithms. To handle the same, researchers are now-a-days working on design and development of parallel versions of state-of-the-art metaheuristic optimization algorithms. We, in this paper, present a CUDA-based parallelization of state-of-the-art Artificial Protozoa Optimizer leveraging GPU acceleration. We implement both the existing sequential version and the proposed parallel version of Artificial Protozoa Optimizer for a performance comparison. Our experimental results calculated over a set of CEC2022 benchmark functions demonstrate a significant performance gain i.e. up to 6.7 times speed up is achieved with proposed parallel version. We also use a real world application, i.e., Image Thresholding to compare both algorithms.</description>

Abstract: AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025) is a generic evolutionary coding agent that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with automated evaluation in an iterative evolutionary framework that proposes, tests, and refines algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific and practical problems. In this paper we showcase AlphaEvolve as a tool for autonomously discovering novel mathematical constructions and advancing our understanding of long-standing open problems.
  To demonstrate its breadth, we considered a list of 67 problems spanning mathematical analysis, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. The system rediscovered the best known solutions in most of the cases and discovered improved solutions in several. In some instances, AlphaEvolve is also able to generalize results for a finite number of input values into a formula valid for all input values. Furthermore, we are able to combine this methodology with Deep Think and AlphaProof in a broader framework where the additional proof-assistants and reasoning systems provide automated proof generation and further mathematical insights.
  These results demonstrate that large language model-guided evolutionary search can autonomously discover mathematical constructions that complement human intuition, at times matching or even improving the best known results, highlighting the potential for significant new ways of interaction between mathematicians and AI systems. We present AlphaEvolve as a powerful new tool for mathematical discovery, capable of exploring vast search spaces to solve complex optimization problems at scale, often with significantly reduced requirements on preparation and computation time.</description>

      <title>Wasserstein Evolution : Evolutionary Optimization as Phase Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel framework linking evolutionary computation to statistical physics by formulating optimization as a statistical phase transition. We propose Wasserstein Evolution (WE), an algorithm based on the Wasserstein gradient flow of a free energy functional, translating the physical competition between exploitative potential gradient forces and explorative entropic forces into an adaptive search mechanism. Theoretical analysis confirms WE's convergence to the Boltzmann distribution, ensuring a principled performance-diversity balance.Experiments compare WE against five established algorithms, including GA, DE, CMA-ES, JADE, and SaDE, on benchmark and physical potential functions. Results demonstrate that WE consistently achieves the lowest free energy and maintains the highest entropy, excelling in both solution quality and diversity preservation. Additional invariance tests using transformed Schwefel 2.22 functions verify that WE possesses translation, scale, and rotation invariance, proving its robustness and intrinsic alignment with the problem's geometry rather than its coordinate representation.Thus, this work delivers not only an effective and robust optimizer but also a new theoretical paradigm for understanding population-based search through statistical physics, viewing convergence as a disorder-to-order phase transition and opening new avenues for designing intelligent optimization methods.</description>

      <title>BENNS: A Surrogate Model for Hybrid Online-Offline Evolution of SFC Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Service Function Chains (SFCs) enable programmatic control of the functions and services in a computer network. By leveraging Software Defined Networking to control the links between virtualised network functions, SFCs provide a scalable approach to dealing with the increased pressures on network operation and management. However, embedding SFCs onto the underlying physical network and compute infrastructure is an NP-hard problem. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been used to address this issue, but they require significant time to evaluate solution quality (fitness) online, with most existing approaches instead adopting offline simulations or analytical evaluations.
  To enable online use of GAs in solving the SFC embedding problem, we introduce a hybrid online-offline approach to efficiently evaluate the fitness of generated solutions. At the core of this is BENNS: a surrogate model that approximates fitness and is agnostic to topology, traffic, and SFC-embedding. We evaluate our approach in a static environment across five experiments, varying available resources and traffic loads, and in a dynamic network environment. Our results demonstrate that our approach is capable of exploring thousands of potential configurations and generating deployable solutions in 19.1 minutes on average, compared to online-only approaches, which take 17.8 hours on average to explore ten solutions in our experiments and do not converge on an optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Spectral Concentration at the Edge of Stability: Information Geometry of Kernel Associative Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.23083v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-capacity kernel Hopfield networks exhibit a \textit{Ridge of Optimization} characterized by extreme stability. While previously linked to \textit{Spectral Concentration}, its origin remains elusive. Here, we analyze the network dynamics on a statistical manifold, revealing that the Ridge corresponds to the Edge of Stability, a critical boundary where the Fisher Information Matrix becomes singular. We demonstrate that the apparent Euclidean force antagonism is a manifestation of \textit{Dual Equilibrium} in the Riemannian space. This unifies learning dynamics and capacity via the Minimum Description Length principle, offering a geometric theory of self-organized criticality.</description>

      <title>GraphBench: Next-generation graph learning benchmarking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.04475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning on graphs has recently achieved impressive progress in various domains, including molecular property prediction and chip design. However, benchmarking practices remain fragmented, often relying on narrow, task-specific datasets and inconsistent evaluation protocols, which hampers reproducibility and broader progress. To address this, we introduce GraphBench, a comprehensive benchmarking suite that spans diverse domains and prediction tasks, including node-level, edge-level, graph-level, and generative settings. GraphBench provides standardized evaluation protocols -- with consistent dataset splits and performance metrics that account for out-of-distribution generalization -- as well as a unified hyperparameter tuning framework. Additionally, we benchmark GraphBench using message-passing neural networks and graph transformer models, providing principled baselines and establishing a reference performance. See www.graphbench.io for further details.</description>

      <title>Symphony: A Heuristic Normalized Calibrated Advantage Actor and Critic Algorithm in application for Humanoid Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our work we not explicitly hint that it is a misconception to think that humans learn fast. Learning process takes time. Babies start learning to move in the restricted liquid area called placenta. Children often are limited by underdeveloped body. Even adults are not allowed to participate in complex competitions right away. However, with robots, when learning from scratch, we often don't have the privilege of waiting for dozen millions of steps. "Swaddling" regularization is responsible for restraining an agent in rapid but unstable development penalizing action strength in a specific way not affecting actions directly. The Symphony, Transitional-policy Deterministic Actor and Critic algorithm, is a concise combination of different ideas for possibility of training humanoid robots from scratch with Sample Efficiency, Sample Proximity and Safety of Actions in mind. It is no secret that continuous increase in Gaussian noise without appropriate smoothing is harmful for motors and gearboxes. Compared to Stochastic algorithms, we set a limited parametric noise and promote a reduced strength of actions, safely increasing entropy, since the actions are kind of immersed in weaker noise. When actions require more extreme values, actions rise above the weak noise. Training becomes empirically much safer for both the environment around and the robot's mechanisms. We use Fading Replay Buffer: using a fixed formula containing the hyperbolic tangent, we adjust the batch sampling probability: the memory contains a recent memory and a long-term memory trail. Fading Replay Buffer allows us to use Temporal Advantage when we improve the current Critic Network prediction compared to the exponential moving average. Temporal Advantage allows us to update Actor and Critic in one pass, as well as combine Actor and Critic in one Object and implement their Losses in one line.</description>

      <title>Phythesis: Physics-Guided Evolutionary Scene Synthesis for Energy-Efficient Data Center Design via LLMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10611v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Data center (DC) infrastructure serves as the backbone to support the escalating demand for computing capacity. Traditional design methodologies that blend human expertise with specialized simulation tools scale poorly with the increasing system complexity. Recent studies adopt generative artificial intelligence to design plausible human-centric indoor layouts. However, they do not consider the underlying physics, making them unsuitable for the DC design that sets quantifiable operational objectives and strict physical constraints. To bridge the gap, we propose Phythesis, a novel framework that synergizes large language models (LLMs) and physics-guided evolutionary optimization to automate simulation-ready (SimReady) scene synthesis for energy-efficient DC design. Phythesis employs an iterative bi-level optimization architecture, where (i) the LLM-driven optimization level generates physically plausible three-dimensional layouts and self-criticizes them to refine the scene topology, and (ii) the physics-informed optimization level identifies the optimal asset parameters and selects the best asset combination. Experiments on three generation scales show that Phythesis achieves 57.3% generation success rate increase and 11.5% power usage effectiveness (PUE) improvement, compared with the vanilla LLM-based solution.</description>
