      <title>The spectral map for weighted Cauchy matrices is an involution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $N$ be a natural number. We consider weighted Cauchy matrices of the form \[ \mathcal{C}_{a,A}=\left\{\frac{\sqrt{A_j A_k}}{a_k+a_j}\right\}_{j,k=1}^N, \] where $A_1,\dots,A_N$ are positive real numbers and $a_1,\dots,a_N$ are distinct positive real numbers, listed in increasing order. Let $b_1,\dots,b_N$ be the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{C}_{a,A}$, listed in increasing order. Let $B_k$ be positive real numbers such that $\sqrt{B_k}$ is the Euclidean norm of the orthogonal projection of the vector \[ v_A=(\sqrt{A_1},\dots,\sqrt{A_N}) \] onto the $k$'th eigenspace of $\mathcal{C}_{a,A}$. We prove that the spectral map $(a,A)\mapsto (b,B)$ is an involution and discuss simple properties of this map.</description>

      <title>Cotype zeta functions enumerating subalgebras of $R$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study subalgebra cotype zeta functions, multivariate zeta functions enumerating fixed-index subalgebras of $R$-algebras of a given cotype. This generalizes and unifies previous works on subalgebra zeta functions and cotype zeta functions of $R$-algebras. We prove the local functional equations for the generic Euler factors of these zeta functions, and give an explicit formula for the subalgebra cotype zeta function of a general $\mathbb{Z}$-Lie algebra $L$ of rank 3. We also give an asymptotic formula for the number of subalgebras $\Lambda$ of $L$ of index at most $X$ for which $L/\Lambda$ has rank at most, answering a question of Chinta, Kaplan, and Koplewitz. In particular, we show that unlike $\mathbb{Z}^3$, $\mathbb{Z}$-Lie algebras of rank 3 with additional multiplication structure exhibit different distribution of cocyclic subalgebras.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19168</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19168v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study several classes of operadic ideals of the unital associative algebra operad $\uas$. As an application, we classify quotient operads of $\uas$ of GK-dimension $\leq 6$. This corresponds to a classification of all T-ideals of codimension growth $n^g$ with $g\leq 5$ (or equivalently, varieties of grade $g$ with $g\leq 5$).</description>

      <title>Skew Generalized Power Series Rings With the McCoy Property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19241</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19241v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a ring, $(S,\preceq)$ a strictly totally ordered monoid and suppose also $\omega:S\rightarrow \text{End}(R)$ is a monoid homomorphism. A skew generalized power series ring $R[[S,\omega,\preceq]]$ consists of all functions from a monoid $S$ to a coefficient ring $R$ whose support contains neither infinite descending chains nor infinite anti-chains, equipped with point-wise addition and with multiplication given by convolution twisted by an action $\omega$ of the monoid $S$ on the ring $R$.
  Special cases of the skew generalized power series ring construction are the skew polynomial rings, skew Laurent polynomial rings, skew power series rings, skew Laurent series rings, skew monoid rings, skew group rings, skew Malcev-Neumann series rings and generalized power series rings as well as the untwisted versions of all of these objects.
  In the present article, we study the so-termed $(S,\omega)$-McCoy condition on $R$, that is a generalization of the standard McCoy condition from polynomials to skew generalized power series, thus generalizing some of the existing results in the literature relevant to the subject.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to introduce and study the concepts of the Rota-Baxter operator and Reynolds operator within the framework of trusses. Moreover, we introduce and discuss dendriform trusses, tridendriform trusses, and NS-trusses as fundamental algebraic structures underlying these classes of operators. Furthermore, we consider the notions of Nijenhuis operator and averaging operator to trusses, exploring their properties and applications to uncover new algebraic structures.</description>

      <title>Stochastic matrices and majorization in max algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and characterize max-doubly stochastic matrices within the framework of max algebra, where the operations are defined as $x \oplus y = \max(x, y)$ and $x \otimes y = xy$. We explore the fundamental properties of max-doubly stochastic matrices and their role in vector majorization. Specifically, we establish that for vectors $x$ and $y$ in max algebra, $x$ is majorized by $y$ if there exists a max-doubly stochastic matrix $D$ such that $x = D \otimes y$. This provides a new approach to majorization theory within tropical mathematics and enhances the understanding of vector relations in max algebra.</description>

      <title>Characterisation of quadratic spaces over the Hilbert field by means of the orthogonality relation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An orthoset is a set equipped with a symmetric, irreflexive binary relation. With any (anisotropic) Hermitian space $H$, we may associate the orthoset $(P(H),\perp)$, consisting of the set of one-dimensional subspaces of $H$ and the usual orthogonality relation. $(P(H),\perp)$ determines $H$ essentially uniquely.
  We characterise in this paper certain kinds of Hermitian spaces by imposing transitivity and minimality conditions on their associated orthosets. By gradually considering stricter conditions, we restrict the discussion to a more and more narrow class of Hermitian spaces. We are eventually interested in quadratic spaces over countable subfields of $\mathbb R$.
  A line of an orthoset is the orthoclosure of two distinct element. For an orthoset to be line-symmetric means roughly that its automorphism group acts transitively both on the collection of all lines as well as on each single line. Line-symmetric orthosets turn out to be in correspondence with transitive Hermitian spaces. Furthermore, quadratic orthosets are defined similarly, but are required to possess, for each line $\ell$, a group of automorphisms acting on $\ell$ transitively and commutatively. We show the correspondence of quadratic orthosets with transitive quadratic spaces over ordered fields. We finally specify those quadratic orthosets that are, in a natural sense, minimal: for a finite $n \geq 4$, the orthoset $(P(R^n),\perp)$, where $R$ is the Hilbert field, has the property of being embeddable into any other quadratic orthoset of rank $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note, we consider the monoid $\mathcal{PIM}_{n}$ of all partial monotone transformations on a chain with $n$ elements whose domains and ranges are intervals and its submonoid $\mathcal{IM}_{n}$ constituted by the full transformations. For both of these monoids, our aim is to determine their cardinalities and ranks and define them by means of presentations. We also calculate the number of nilpotent elements of $\mathcal{PIM}_{n}$.</description>

      <title>On Commutative Analogues of Clifford Algebras and Their Decompositions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19763</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19763v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate commutative analogues of Clifford algebras - algebras whose generators square to $\pm1$ but commute, instead of anti-commuting as they do in Clifford algebras. We observe that commutativity allows for elegant results. We note that these algebras generalise multicomplex spaces - we show that a commutative analogue of Clifford algebra are either isomorphic to a multicomplex space or to `multi split-complex space' (space defined just like multicomplex numbers but uses split-complex numbers instead of complex numbers). We do a general study of commutative analogues of Clifford algebras and use tools like operations of conjugation and idempotents to give a tensor product decomposition and a direct sum decomposition for them. Tensor product decomposition follows relatively easily from the definition. For the direct sum decomposition, we give explicit basis using new techniques.</description>

      <title>Independence Polynomials of 2-step Nilpotent Lie Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the Dani-Mainkar construction, we extend the notion of independence polynomial of graphs to arbitrary 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras. After establishing efficiently computable upper and lower bounds for the independence number, we discuss a metric-dependent generalization motivated by a quantum mechanical interpretation of our construction. As an application, we derive elementary bounds for the dimension of abelian subalgebras of 2-step nilpotent Lie algebras.</description>

      <title>Homotopy theory of post-Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19998v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the homotopy theory of post-Lie algebras. Guided by Koszul duality theory, we consider the graded Lie algebra of coderivations of the cofree conilpotent graded cocommutative cotrialgebra generated by $V$. We show that in the case of $V$ being a shift of an ungraded vector space $W$, Maurer-Cartan elements of this graded Lie algebra are exactly post-Lie algebra structures on $W$. The cohomology of a post-Lie algebra is then defined using Maurer-Cartan twisting. The second cohomology group of a post-Lie algebra has a familiar interpretation as equivalence classes of infinitesimal deformations. Next we define a post-Lie$_\infty$ algebra structure on a graded vector space to be a Maurer-Cartan element of the aforementioned graded Lie algebra. Post-Lie$_\infty$ algebras admit a useful characterization in terms of $L_\infty$-actions (or open-closed homotopy Lie algebras). Finally, we introduce the notion of homotopy Rota-Baxter operators on open-closed homotopy Lie algebras and show that certain homotopy Rota-Baxter operators induce post-Lie$_\infty$ algebras.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $R$ be a commutative local ring. We provide an explicit presentation of the symmetric Grothendieck-Witt ring $\mathrm{GW}^{\mathrm{s}}(R)$ of $R$ as an abelian group when $R$ has residue field $\mathbb{F}_2$. This completes a recent work by Rogers and Schlichting, where an explicit presentation of $\mathrm{GW}^{\mathrm{s}}(R)$ is given when the residue field is different from $\mathbb{F}_2$. We then use this result to compute the symmetric Grothendieck-Witt rings for the sequences of local rings $\mathbb{Z}/2^n\mathbb{Z}$ and $\mathbb{F}_2[x]/(x^n)$.</description>

Abstract: Let $R$ be a regular ring of dimension $d$ and $L$ be a $c$-divisible monoid. If ${K}_1{Sp}(R)$ is trivial and $k \geq d+2,$ then we prove that the symplectic group ${Sp}_{2k}(R[L])$ is generated by elementary symplectic matrices over $R[L]$. When $d \leq 1$ or $R$ is a geometrically regular ring containing a field, then improved bounds have been established. We also discuss the linear case, extending the work of Gubeladze.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The computation of time dynamics arising in nonlinear time-dependent partial differential equations is an ongoing challenge in numerical analysis, especially once roughness comes into play. Classical numerical schemes in general fail to resolve the oscillatory behaviour in the solution which leads to numerical instabilities and loss of convergence. Dispersive equations, e.g., nonlinear Schr\"odinger, Korteweg--de Vries and wave equations, thereby pose in particular a big problem as in contrast to the parabolic setting, no strong smoothing can be expected, i.e., if the initial data is rough, the solution stays rough which makes their approximation a delicate task. In this review we give an overview on a new numerical ansatz which aims to tackle the time dynamics of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations even for very rough data. This is achieved by a resonance analysis and decorated tree formalism that draws its inpiration from the combinatorics used in the theory of regularity structures for solving singular SPDEs. One can hope to see this formalism applied in other contexts for dispersive PDEs and beyond.</description>

      <title>On post-Lie structures for free Lie algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study post-Lie structures on free Lie algebras, the Grossman-Larson product on their enveloping algebras, and provide an abstract formula for its dual coproduct. This might be of interest for the general theory of post-Hopf algebras. Using a magmatic approach, we explore post-Lie algebras connected to multiple zeta values and their $q$-analogues. For multiple zeta values, this framework yields an algebraic interpretation of the Goncharov coproduct. Assuming that the Bernoulli numbers satisfy the so called threshold shuffle identities, we present a post-Lie structure, whose induced Lie bracket we expect to restrict to the dual of indecomposables of multiple $q$-zeta values. Our post-Lie algebras align with Ecalle's theory of bimoulds: we explicitly identify the ari bracket with a post-Lie structure on a free Lie algebra, and conjecture a correspondence for the uri bracket.</description>

      <title>On Unitary Groups in Ternary and Generalized Clifford Algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19689</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19689v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss a generalization of Clifford algebras known as generalized Clifford algebras (in particular, ternary Clifford algebras). In these objects, we have a fixed higher-degree form (in particular, a ternary form) instead of a quadratic form in ordinary Clifford algebras. We present a natural realization of unitary Lie groups, which are important in physics and other applications, using only operations in generalized Clifford algebras and without using the corresponding matrix representations. Basis-free definitions of the determinant, trace, and characteristic polynomial in generalized Clifford algebras are introduced. Explicit formulas for all coefficients of the characteristic polynomial and inverse in generalized Clifford algebras are presented. The operation of Hermitian conjugation (or Hermitian transpose) in generalized Clifford algebras is introduced without using the corresponding matrix representations.</description>

      <title>Semi-abelian by Design: Johnstone Algebras Unifying Implication and Division</title>

Abstract: Johnstone demonstrated that Heyting semilattices form a semi-abelian category via a specific triple of terms. Inspired by this work, we introduce \emph{Johnstone algebras} or J-algebras. The algebraic $(*,\to,e)$-theory $J$ of arities $(2,2,0)$ consists of three axioms carefully chosen to ensure protomodularity in alignment with Johnstone's terms. Johnstone algebras generalize well-known structures such as groups (division) and Heyting semilattices (implication) providing a unified framework within the well-behaved setting of semi-abelian categories.
  We present two primary contributions. First, we identify the M-axiom, \[ (t(x,y)\to x)\to (t(x,y)\to z) \approx x\to z, \text{ where }t(x,y) = (x\to y)\to y. \] The M-axiom is satisfied by residuated Johnstone algebras, and it can be considered a weakening of the H-axiom to comparable elements. We show that $t(x,y)$ defines a \emph{relative closure term} in MBC-algebras, and it implies that MBC-algebras form a variety of algebras, thereby generalizing the corresponding theorem related to HBCK-algebras. Second, we prove several no-go results, demonstrating that balanced theories or theories admitting non-discrete monotone or inflationary algebras cannot possess Malcev terms.
  Together, these results establish Johnstone algebras as significant structures that achieve desirable categorical properties by carefully integrating both logical and symmetric features, while closely avoiding the constraints imposed by our no-go results.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{M}$-ideals: from Banach spaces to rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14829v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce and investigate a class of ring ideals, termed ring $\mathrm{M}$-ideals, inspired by the Alfsen--Effros theory of $\mathrm{M}$-ideals in Banach spaces. We show that $\mathrm{M}$-ideals extend the classical notion of essential ideals and subsume them as a subclass. The central theorem provides a full characterization: an ideal is an $\mathrm{M}$-ideal if and only if it is either essential or relatively irreducible. This dichotomy reveals the abundant and diverse nature of $\mathrm{M}$-ideals, encompassing both essential and minimal ideals, and admits natural generalizations in rings beyond the commutative and unital settings.
  We systematically study the algebraic stability of $\mathrm{M}$-ideals under standard constructions such as intersection, quotient, direct product, and Morita equivalence and establish their behavior in topological rings and operator algebras. In certain rings such as $\mathbb{Z}_n$ and C*-algebras, we completely classify $\mathrm{M}$-ideals and relate them to algebraically minimal projections and central idempotents. The ring $\mathrm{M}$-ideals in $C(K)$ are shown to be precisely the essential ideals or those minimal ideals corresponding to isolated points.
  Structurally, we show that the absence of proper $\mathrm{M}$-ideals characterizes simplicity, while rings in which every proper $\mathrm{M}$-ideal is a direct summand must decompose as finite direct sums of simple rings. In closing, we introduce the notion of $\mathrm{M}$-complements, drawing an analogy with essential extensions in module theory, and demonstrate their existence.</description>

      <title>On the length of generating sets with conditions on minimal polynomial</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.17348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linear upper bounds may be derived by imposing specific structural conditions on a generating set, such as additional constraints on ranks, eigenvalues, or the degree of the minimal polynomial of the generating matrices. This paper establishes a linear upper bound of \(3n-5\) for generating sets that contain a matrix whose minimal polynomial has a degree exceeding \(\frac{n}{2}\), where \(n\) denotes the order of the matrix. Compared to the bound provided in \cite[Theorem 3.1]{r2}, this result reduces the constraints on the Jordan canonical forms. Additionally, it is demonstrated that the bound \(\frac{7n}{2}-4\) holds when the generating set contains a matrix with a minimal polynomial of degree \(t\) satisfying \(2t\le n\le 3t-1\). The primary enhancements consist of quantitative bounds and reduced reliance on Jordan form structural constraints.</description>

      <title>On Rank of Multivectors in Geometric Algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.02681v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of rank of multivector in Clifford geometric algebras of arbitrary dimension without using the corresponding matrix representations and using only geometric algebra operations. We use the concepts of characteristic polynomial in geometric algebras and the method of SVD. The results can be used in various applications of geometric algebras in computer science, engineering, and physics.</description>

      <title>Frobenius subalgebra lattices in tensor categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19876v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper examines Frobenius subalgebra posets within abelian monoidal categories, demonstrating that under certain general conditions--satisfied in all semisimple tensor categories--these posets are lattices. Building on this, we extend Watatani's finiteness theorem for intermediate subfactors by proving that, under a weak positivity assumption--met by all semisimple tensor categories over the complex field--and a compatibility condition--fulfilled by all pivotal ones--the lattices arising from connected Frobenius algebras are finite. We also derive a non-semisimple version via semisimplification. Our approach relies on the concept of a formal angle, and the extension of key results--such as the planar algebraic exchange relation and Landau's theorems--to linear monoidal categories.
  Major applications of our findings include a stronger version of the Ino-Watatani result: we show that the finiteness of intermediate C*-algebras holds in a finite-index unital irreducible inclusion of C*-algebras without requiring the simple assumption. Moreover, for a finite-dimensional semisimple Hopf algebra H, we demonstrate that H* contains a finite number of Frobenius subalgebra objects in Rep(H). Finally, we explore a range of applications, including abstract spin chains, vertex operator algebras, and speculations on quantum arithmetic involving the generalization of Ore's theorem, Euler's totient and sigma functions, and RH.</description>

      <title>Finiteness of Pythagoras numbers of finitely generated real algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17751v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish two finiteness results and propose a conjecture concerning the Pythagoras number $P(A)$ of a finitely generated real algebra $A$. Let $X \hookrightarrow \mathbb{P}^n$ be an integral projective surface over $\mathbb{R}$, let $\widetilde{X}$ be the normalization of $X$, and let $s \in \Gamma(X,\mathcal{O}_X(1))$ be a nonzero section such that $\bigl(\widetilde{X}_{s=0}\bigr)^{\mathrm{red}}$ is formally real. We prove $P\bigl(\Gamma(X_{s\neq 0})\bigr)=\infty$. As a corollary, the Pythagoras numbers of integral smooth affine curves over $\mathbb{R}$ are shown to be unbounded. For any finitely generated $\mathbb{R}$-algebra $A$, if the Zariski closure of the real points of $\mathrm{Spec}(A)$ has dimension less than two, we demonstrate $P(A)&lt;\infty$.</description>
