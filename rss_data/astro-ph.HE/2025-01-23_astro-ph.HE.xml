      <title>Survey of Radiative, Two-Temperature Magnetically Arrested Simulations of the Black Hole M87* I: Turbulent Electron Heating</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a set of eleven two-temperature, radiative, general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic (2TGRRMHD) simulations of the black hole M87* in the magnetically arrested (MAD) state, surveying different values of the black hole spin $a_*$. Our 3D simulations self-consistently evolve the temperatures of separate electron and ion populations under the effects of adiabatic compression/expansion, viscous heating, Coulomb coupling, and synchrotron, bremsstrahlung, and inverse Compton radiation. We adopt the Kawazura+ 2019 sub-grid heating prescription from gyrokinetic simulations of plasma turbulence. Our simulations have accretion rates $\dot{M}=(0.5-1.5)\times10^{-6}\dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$ and radiative efficiencies $\epsilon_{\rm rad}=2-14\%$. We compare our simulations to a fiducial set of otherwise identical single-fluid GRMHD simulations and find no significant changes in the outflow efficiency or black hole spindown parameter. Our simulations produce an effective adiabatic index for the two-temperature plasma of $\Gamma_{\rm gas}\approx1.55$, larger than the $\Gamma_{\rm gas}=13/9$ value often adopted in single-fluid GRMHD simulations. We find moderate ion-to-electron temperature ratios in the 230 GHz emitting region of $R=T_{\rm i}/T_{\rm e}{\approx}5$. While total intensity 230 GHz images from our simulations are consistent with Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) results, our images have significantly more beam-scale linear polarization ($\langle|m|\rangle\approx 30\%$) than is observed in EHT images of M87* ($\langle|m|\rangle&lt;10\%$). We find a trend of the average linear polarization pitch angle $\angle\beta_2$ with black hole spin consistent with what is seen in single-fluid GRMHD simulations, and we provide a simple fitting function for $\angle\beta_2(a_*)$ motivated by the wind-up of magnetic field lines by black hole spin in the Blandford-Znajek mechanism.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the fundamental parameters for the black hole X-ray transient Swift J1753.5-0127</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12463v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present time-resolved Gran Telescopio Canarias optical spectroscopy and William Herschel Telescope $i$-band photometry of the X-ray transient SWIFT J1753.5-0127 in quiescence. The $i$-band light curve is dominated by flickering with an amplitude of $\sim 0.5$ mag and shows no evidence of the ellipsoidal modulation of the companion star. The telluric-corrected average spectrum, on the other hand, reveals the presence of weak (strongly veiled) TiO bands at $7055$ \.A and $7589$ \.A. We used them for a spectral classification, finding an M4-5 V companion star. However, as velocity shifts are not clearly detected in the individual spectra, we turned the analysis to the double-peaked H$\alpha$ emission line from the accretion disc. By exploiting the empirical correlations established for quiescent X-ray transients between the line morphology and fundamental binary parameters, we estimated the radial velocity semi-amplitude of the companion $K_2 = 820 \pm 36$ km s$^{-1}$, a mass ratio $q = 0.023 \pm 0.006$ and an inclination $i = 79 \pm 5$ deg. Moreover, an orbital period of $3.26 \pm 0.02$ h was measured from the modulation of the centroid velocities and the double-peak trough depth of the H$\alpha$ profile. These quantities yielded a mass function $f(M_1) = 7.8 \pm 1.0$ M$_\odot$ and black hole and companion star masses of $M_1 = 8.8 \pm 1.3$ M$_\odot$ and $M_2 = 0.20 \pm 0.06$ M$_\odot$, respectively. The companion star mass is in line with the spectral classification obtained from the relative depth of the TiO bands. Based on the mean quiescent magnitude ($i = 21.4 \pm 0.1$), orbital period, and interstellar extinction, we estimate the distance to the source to be $3.9 \pm 0.7$ kpc and a Galactic plane elevation of $0.8 \pm 0.2$ kpc, supporting the case for a large natal kick.</description>

      <title>Constraining Proper Motion of Strongly Lensed Eccentric Binary Mergers using Doppler Triangulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong lensing of gravitational wave (GW) sources allows the observer to see the GW source from different lines-of-sight (LOS) through the corresponding images, which provides a way for constraining the relative proper motion of the GW source. This is possible as the GW signals received from each image will have slightly different projected velocity components, from which one can `Doppler-Triangulate' for the GW source velocity vector. The difference in projected velocity between the different images can be observationally inferred through pairwise GW phase measurements that accumulate over the time-of-observation. In this paper we study lensed eccentric GW sources and explore how the observable GW phase shift between images evolve as a function of time, eccentricity, lens- and binary parameters. Next generation GW observatories, including the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will see $\sim $hundreds/year of lensed GW sources, where a significant fraction of these are expected to be eccentric. We discuss the expected unique observables for such eccentric lensed GW sources, and the relation to their observable relative linear motion, which otherwise is exceedingly difficult to constrain in general.</description>

      <title>X-ray emission from helium star+black hole binaries as probes of tidally induced spin-up of second-born black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidally induced spin-up of stripped helium stars in short-period (&lt;\,1\,d) binaries with black holes has been presented as one of the possible mechanisms to reproduce the high-spin tail of the black hole spin distribution derived from gravitational wave (GW) merger observations. At such short periods, a fraction of the strong stellar wind from the stripped helium stars may be accreted by the black holes, and its gravitational potential energy may be released as observable radiation in the X-ray regime. We estimate the X-ray luminosity and its observability from black holes in orbit with stripped helium stars, which evolve into binary black hole or black hole+neutron star binaries that merge within Hubble time. We post-process recent advancements for estimating X-ray luminosities (via wind accretion onto stellar mass black holes) into two rapid population synthesis codes, BSE and StarTrack. We derive lower limits on the X-ray luminosity distribution from populations of stripped helium+black hole binaries at four metallicities (0.01, 0.1, 0.5, 1 $Z_{\odot}$) and two mass transfer stability criteria. We find that a large fraction (0.1-0.5) of stripped-helium stars that get spun up by tides also transfer enough wind matter onto the black hole to produce X-ray luminosities above $10^{35}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$, up to $\sim10^{39}$\,erg\,s$^{-1}$. Such binaries should be observable as X-ray bright systems at 0.1\,$Z_{\odot}$, 0.5\,$Z_{\odot}$ and $Z_{\odot}$, representative of Sextans A, the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and the Solar neighbourhood, respectively. The formation efficiency of these systems increases with decreasing metallicity. However, accounting for the local star formation rates, our population synthesis predicts $\sim$2 and $\sim$1 such observable binaries in the Milky Way and LMC, respectively, that will produce a binary compact object merger within a Hubble time.

      <title>New TeV-emitting BL Lac candidates from the eROSITA X-ray survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: TeV-emitting BL Lac type blazars represent the extreme end of the blazar population. They are characterized by relatively weak jets and radiatively inefficient accretion disks. Particles accelerated in these jets experience fewer radiative losses, allowing them to reach energies beyond the TeV scale and produce TeV gamma-ray emission. The study of TeV blazars is constrained by the limited number of known sources in this category. Currently, only 56 high synchrotron-peaked BL Lacs have been detected at energies above 0.1\,TeV. Searches for TeV emission from BL~Lacs typically target sources with bright X-ray emission and a synchrotron peak at or above 1\,keV. The recently released eRASS1 catalog by the eROSITA collaboration, which covers half of the sky, represents the deepest X-ray survey in the soft X-ray band to date. Utilizing the eROSITA survey, combined with infrared data from WISE and archival radio observations, we have identified 135 TeV-emitting blazar candidates. Our search introduces selection criteria based on the radio to infrared that remove quasar-like objects that have similar infrared spectra and X-ray fluxes as TeV-emitting BL~Lacs. In our search, we find 26 objects that had not been detected in the ROSAT X-ray survey and 20 that have not been previously associated with blazars. The candidates resulting from our search are suitable for follow-up observations with currently operating imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes, as well as future facilities like the CTAO Observatory.</description>

      <title>Detection of Unresolved Strongly Lensed Supernovae with 7-Dimensional Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitationally lensed supernovae (glSNe) are a powerful tool for exploring the realms of astronomy and cosmology. Time-delay measurements and lens modeling of glSNe can provide a robust and independent method for constraining the expansion rate of the universe. The study of unresolved glSNe light curves presents a unique opportunity for utilizing small telescopes to investigate these systems. In this work, we investigate diverse observational strategies for the initial detection of glSNe using the 7-Dimensional Telescope (7DT), a multi-telescope system composed of twenty 50-cm telescopes. We implement different observing strategies on a subset of 5807 strong lensing systems and candidates identified within the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS), as reported in various publications. Our simulations under ideal observing conditions indicate the maximum expected annual detection rates for various glSNe types (Type Ia and core-collapse (CC)) using the 7DT target observing mode in the $r$-band at a depth of 22.04 mag, as follows: 8.25 events for type Ia, 3.06 for type Ic, 1.04 for type IIb, 0.66 for type IIL, 0.89 for type IIn, 5.26 for type IIP, and 1.44 for type Ib. Furthermore, in the case of medium-band filter observations (m6000) at a depth of 20.61 in the Wide-Field Survey (WFS) program, the predicted detection rate for glSNe Ia is 3.30 $yr^{-1}$. Given targeted follow-up observations of these initially detected systems with more powerful telescopes, we can apply a model-independent approach to forecast the ability to measure $H_{0}$ using a Gaussian process from Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) data and time-delay distance information derived from glSNe systems, which include both Ia and CC types. We forecast that the expected detection rate of glSNe systems can achieve a $2.4\%$ precision in estimating the Hubble constant.</description>

      <title>Two repeated quasi-periodic oscillations in the FSRQ S5 1044+71 observed by TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report for the first time two repeated quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the light curve of the Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ) S5 1044+71. This source was observed by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) in multiple sectors. We used the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram method and weighted wavelet Z-transform method to search for significant periodic signals. The main results are as follows: We found QPOs of $\sim$ 7.0 days (persisted for 4 cycles, with a significance of $\sim3.5\sigma$) and $\sim$ 7.3 days (persisted for 5 cycles, with a significance of $\sim3.8\sigma$) in the light curves of Sector 47 and EP1, respectively. Considering range of error, we consider them to be the same. We discussed two likely models of these rapid quasi-periodic variations: One comes from the jet and the other from the accretion disk. For the first one, we consider kink instability of the jet as a plausible explanation. Second, the QPO is probable to come from the main hot spots in the accretion disk, which is located approximately within the innermost stable circular orbit allowed by general relativity. Based on this model, we estimate the mass of the black hole in S5 1044+71 to be $3.49 \times 10^9 M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Study of the IC 443 region with the HAWC observatory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. Supernova remnants are one potential source class considered a PeVatron (i.e. capable of accelerating cosmic rays above PeV energies). The shock fronts produced after the explosion of the supernova are ideal regions for particle acceleration. IC 443 is a supernova remnant that has been studied extensively at different wavelengths. We study this region using very-high-energy gamma-ray data.
  Aims. We explore the region of IC 443 using 2966 days of gamma-ray data from the HAWC observatory. We study the emission of this supernova remnant and search for signatures that would show acceleration of (hadronic) cosmic rays at the PeV range.
  Methods. We use the maximum likelihood estimation and a likelihood ratio test to perform a multi-source fitting search. We find the best-fit morphology and spectrum of the IC 443 region above $\sim$300 GeV that best describes the HAWC data.
  Results. We observe a point source located at ($\alpha$=94.42$^{\circ}$, $\delta$=22.35$^{\circ}$) that we associate with IC 443. The measured spectrum is a simple power law with an index of -3.14$\pm$0.18, which is consistent with previous TeV observations. We also find a new extended component in the region whose emission is described by a simple power law with an index of -2.49$\pm$0.08 and which we call HAWC J0615+2213.
  Conclusions. Although we cannot confirm that IC 443 is a hadronic PeVatron, we do not find any sign that the spectrum has a cut off at tens of TeV energies, with the spectrum extending to $\sim$30 TeV. Furthermore, we find a new extended source in the region. While we show evidence that this new source might be a new TeV halo, we defer a detailed analysis of this new source to another publication.</description>

      <title>Forecasting of the time-dependent fluxes of antiprotons in the AMS-02 era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12625</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12625v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectra of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) contain crucial information about their origin and propagation through the interstellar medium. When GCRs reach Earth, they are significantly influenced by the solar wind and the heliospheric magnetic field, a phenomenon known as solar modulation. This effect introduces time-dependent variations in GCR fluxes. The AMS-02 experiment has released time-dependent flux data for protons, electrons, and positrons, revealing clear correlations with solar modulation. Studies suggest that cosmic rays with the same charge, such as protons and helium nuclei, exhibit similar/same solar modulation parameters. In this work, we derive the LIS for protons and positrons under the assumption of a common solar modulation potential, using data from Voyager 1 and a 7-year average from AMS-02. Similarly, the LIS for antiprotons and electrons is derived by assuming they are governed by a separate solar modulation potential. We demonstrate that the time-dependent fluxes of positrons and protons can be accurately modeled using the same set of solar modulation parameters within a modified force-field approximation framework. Based on this, we predict the time-dependent fluxes of antiprotons using the corresponding electron flux data.</description>

      <title>A Synthetic Population of Ultra-Luminous X-ray Sources: Optical-X-ray Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of the predicted optical-to-X-ray spectral index ($\alpha_{\rm ox}$) within the context of ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs) associated with stellar mass black holes and neutron stars. We use the population synthesis code COSMIC to simulate the evolution of binary systems and investigate the relationship between UV and X-ray emission during the ULX phase, namely the $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ relation. The study investigates the impact of metallicity on $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ values. Notably, it predicts a significant anti-correlation between $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ and UV luminosity ($L_{\rm UV}$), consistent with observations, with the slope of this relationship varying with metallicity for BH-ULXs. The NS-ULX population shows a relatively consistent slope around $-0.33$ across metallicities, with minor variations. The number of ULXs decreases with increasing metallicity, consistent with observational data, and the X-ray luminosity function shows a slight variation in its slope with metallicity, exhibiting a relative excess of high-luminosity ULXs at lower metallicities. Inclusion of beaming effect in the analysis shows a significant impact on the XLF and $\alpha_{\rm ox}$, particularly at high accretion rates, where the emission is focused into narrower cones. Furthermore, the study finds that UV emission in ULXs is predominantly disk-dominated, which is the likely origin of the $\alpha_{\rm ox}$ relation, with the percentage of disk-dominated ULXs increasing as metallicity rises.</description>

Abstract: Supernova remnants (SNRs) are among the most important sources of non-thermal X-rays in the sky and likely contributors to Galactic cosmic rays and represent ideal targets to showcase the capabilities of the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in performing spatially-resolved X-ray polarimetry. For the first time, we can determine the turbulence level (through the measurement of polarization degree) and the orientation (through polarization direction) of the magnetic field near the shocks, where particle acceleration occurs. IXPE reported so far the results of the observations of four SNRs: Cas A, Tycho, SN 1006 and RX J1713.7-3946. These objects exhibit a wide range of characteristics, including dynamical age, spectral composition of emission, and progenitor type. Aptly, they revealed significantly different results among them in terms of magnetic field properties and morphology, providing unexpected insights and shedding light on the particle acceleration mechanisms in astrophysical shocks.</description>

      <title>Massive star clusters in the gamma-ray sky: the role of HII regions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Massive Star Clusters (SCs) have been proposed as important CR sources, with the potential of explaining the high-energy end of the Galactic cosmic-ray (CR) spectrum, that Supernova Remnants (SNRs) seem unable to account for. Thanks to fast mass losses due to the collective stellar winds, the environment around SCs is potentially suitable for particle acceleration up to PeV energies and the energetics is enough to account for a large fraction of the Galactic CRs, if the system is efficient enough. A handful of star clusters have been detected in gamma-rays confirming the idea that particle acceleration is taking place in this environment. However, contamination by other sources often makes it difficult to constrain the contribution arising from SCs only. Here we present a new analysis of Fermi-LAT data collected towards a few massive young star clusters. The young age (&lt; 3 Myr) of the clusters guarantees that no SN has exploded in the region, allowing us to determine the power contributed by the stellar component alone, and to quantify the contribution of this type of sources to the bulk of CRs. Moreover, we will present a recent statistical investigation that quantifies the degree of correlation between gamma-ray sources and these astrophysical objects and briefly discuss the observational prospect for ASTRI and CTAO.</description>

      <title>X-ray reverberation black hole mass and distance estimates of Cygnus X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12788v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We fit X-ray reverberation models to Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data from the X-ray binary Cygnus X-1 in its hard state to yield estimates for the black hole mass and the distance to the system. The rapid variability observed in the X-ray signal from accreting black holes provides a powerful diagnostic to indirectly map the ultra-compact region in the vicinity of the black hole horizon. X-ray reverberation mapping exploits the light crossing delay between X-rays that reach us directly from the hard X-ray emitting 'corona', and those that first reflect off the accretion disc. Here we build upon a previous reverberation mass measurement of Cygnus X-1 that used the RELTRANS software package. Our new analysis enhances signal to noise with an improved treatment of the statistics, and implements new RELTRANS models that are sensitive to distance. The reduced uncertainties uncover evidence of mass accretion rate variability in the inner region of the disc that propagates towards the corona. We fit two different distance-sensitive models, and both return reasonable values of distance and mass within a factor 2 of the accepted values. The models both employ a point-like 'lamppost' corona and differ only in their treatment of the angular emissivity of the corona. The two models return different mass and distance estimates to one another, indicating that future reverberation models that include an extended corona geometry can be used to constrain the shape of the corona if the known mass and distance are utilised via Bayesian priors.</description>

      <title>The impact of hyperons on neutron star mergers: gravitational waves, mass ejection and black hole formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the influence of hyperons in binary neutron star (NS) mergers considering a total of 14 temperature dependent equations of state (EoSs) models which include hyperonic degrees of freedom and partly delta resonances. Thermally produced hyperons induce a higher heat capacity and a lower thermal index, i.e. a reduced thermal pressure for a given amount of thermal energy, compared to purely nucleonic models. We run a large set of relativistic hydrodynamics simulations of NS mergers to explore the impact on observables of these events. In symmetric binaries, we describe a characteristic increase of the dominant postmerger gravitational-wave (GW) frequency by a few per cent, which is specifically linked to the occurrence of hyperons and can thus be potentially used as a discriminator between purely nucleonic and hyperonic systems. We corroborate that this effect occurs similarly for asymmetric binaries and becomes more prominent with increasing total binary mass. Hyperonic models tend to stick out in relations between the dominant postmerger GW frequency and the tidal deformability of massive stars providing a signature to identify the presence of hyperons. Distinct secondary postmerger GW spectral features are differently affected by the presence of hyperons, in the sense that one feature exhibits a characteristic frequency shift due to the specific thermal properties of hyperonic EoSs while the other does not. The dynamical mass ejection of mergers is tentatively enhanced for hyperonic models in comparison to nucleonic EoSs which yield roughly the same stellar properties of cold NSs. This may serve useful to identify exotic degrees of freedom in these systems by kilonova observations. Also, for hyperonic EoSs the threshold mass for prompt black hole formation is reduced by about 0.05 $M_{\odot}$ in comparison to nucleonic systems with the same stellar parameters of cold NSs.</description>

      <title>The AGILE space mission: an Italian success story and its legacy for future space astronomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AGILE (Astrorivelatore Gamma ad Immagini LEggero) has been a unique and hugely successful mission of Italian Space Agency (ASI), built and operated with the programmatic and technical support of the National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF), the National Institute for Nuclear Physics (INFN), several universities and Italian industries. During almost 17 years of observations in orbit (from April 23, 2007, to January 18, 2024), AGILE contributed to high-energy astrophysics and terrestrial physics with many discoveries and detections. Two co-aligned X- and gamma-ray detectors, a silicon-strip-based tracker, a wide field of view gamma-ray imager and the fast-reaction ground segment were the AGILE innovative solutions with respect to the previous generation of gamma-ray satellites. With the AGILE's re-entry, the in-orbit operational phase ends, but a new phase of scientific work on the satellite legacy data archive opens: AGILE may still hold future surprises.</description>

      <title>eROSITA X-ray Analysis of the PeVatron Candidate Westerlund 1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is unclear which fraction of cosmic rays above an energy of 1 PeV is accelerated by the observed Galactic PeVatron population. These sources' gamma-ray data is typically degenerate between hadronic and leptonic emission scenarios, which hinders their straightforward association with the cosmic ray population. Here, we aimed to distinguish between leptonic and hadronic particle acceleration scenarios for the PeVatron candidate HESS J1646-458, associated with the star cluster Westerlund 1 (Wd 1). We first studied the diffuse X-ray emission from Wd 1 to better understand if its origin is of thermal or nonthermal nature. In addition, we searched for X-ray synchrotron emission from the associated PeVatron candidate HESS J1646-458 to put new constraints on the magnetic field strength and the leptonic particle population of this source. We used data from eROSITA on board the SRG orbital platform to spectrally analyze the diffuse emission from Wd 1 and HESS J1646-458. For Wd 1, we compared a purely thermal model and a model with a thermal and a nonthermal component. Next, we analyzed the spectra of four annuli around Wd 1 which coincide with HESS J1646-458 to search for synchrotron radiation. We find that eROSITA data cannot distinguish between thermal and nonthermal source scenarios for the diffuse emission from Wd 1 itself. In the case of HESS J1646-458, we find no evidence of synchrotron emission. We estimated an upper confidence bound of the synchrotron flux up to 40' around Wd 1 of 1.9e-3 keV-1 cm-2 s-1, which we used to study the spectral energy distribution of the source. From this, we obtained an upper 1 sigma bound on the magnetic field strength of HESS J1646-458 of 7 uG. This is compatible with a previous estimate in the literature for a fully leptonic source scenario. A purely leptonic emission scenario, a hadronic, and a hybrid one are compatible with our results.</description>

      <title>High-Frequency Power Spectrum of AGN NGC 4051 Revealed by NICER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variability studies offer a compelling glimpse into black hole dynamics, and NICER's (Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer) remarkable temporal resolution propels us even further. NICER observations of an Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN), NGC 4051, have charted the geometry of the emission region of the central supermassive black hole. Our investigation of X-ray variability in NGC 4051 has detected extreme variations spanning a factor of 40 to 50 over a mere 10 to 12 hours. For the first time, we have constrained the X-ray Power Spectral Density (PSD) of the source to 0.1 Hz, corresponding to a temporal frequency of 10,000 Hz in a galactic X-ray binary (GXRB) with a mass of 10 M_{\odot}. No extra high-frequency break/bend or any quasi-periodic oscillations are found. Through detailed analysis of energy-dependent PSDs, we found that the PSD normalization, the high-frequency PSD slope as well as the bending frequency remains consistent across all energies within the 0.3-3 keV band, revealing the presence of a constant temperature corona. These significant findings impose critical constraints on current models of X-ray emission and variability in AGN.</description>

      <title>Pulse and Polarization Structures in Axion-Converted X-rays from Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12440v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Neutron stars (NS's) with their strong magnetic fields and hot dense cores could be powerful probes of axions, a classic benchmark of feebly-coupled new particles, through abundant production of axions with the axion-nucleon coupling and subsequent conversion into X-rays due to the axion-photon coupling. In this article, we point out that the pulsation structures in both the intensity and polarization of X-rays from NS's could provide us additional information about axions and their couplings. We develop new analytical formalisms of pulsation-polarization structure applicable to a wide range of NS's in the axion scenario and argue that they hold in complicated astrophysical environments. As a case study, we apply our formalism to a representative X-ray Dim Isolated Neutron Star, RX J1856.6-3754, with an unexpected hard X-ray excess which might be axion-induced. We show with an updated fit that the axion explanation is compatible with both the intensity and pulsation data available. Yet the preferred parameter space is close to being excluded by other astrophysical constraints. With an achievable reduction of the uncertainties in the pulsation data, we could potentially draw a definite conclusion on the axion-induced X-rays.</description>

      <title>Intervening nuclear obscuration changing the X-ray look of the $z\approx6$ QSO CFHQS J164121+375520</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12449v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: X-ray observations of the optically selected $z=6.025$ QSO CFHQS J164121+375520 (hereafter J1641) revealed that its flux dropped by a factor $\gtrsim7$ from 2018, when it was a bright and soft X-ray source, to 2021. Such a strong variability amplitude has not been observed before among $z&gt;6$ QSOs, and the underlying physical mechanism was unclear. We carried out a new X-ray and rest-frame UV monitoring campaign of J1641 over 2022-2024. We detected J1641 with Chandra in the 2-7 keV band, while no significant emission is detected at softer X-ray energies, making J1641 an X-ray changing look QSO at $z&gt;6$. Comparing with the 2018 epoch, the 0.5-2 keV flux dropped dramatically by a factor $&gt;20$. We ascribe this behaviour to intervening, and still ongoing, obscuration by Compton-thick gas intercepting our line of sight between 2018 and 2021. The screening material could be an inner disk or a failed nuclear wind that increased their thickness. Another possibility is that we have witnessed an occultation event due to dust-free clouds located at sub-pc/pc scales, similar to those recently invoked to explain the remarkable X-ray weakness of AGN discovered by JWST. These interpretations are also consistent with the lack of strong variations of the QSO rest-frame UV lightcurve over the same period. Future monitoring of J1641 and the possible discovery of other X-ray changing look QSOs at $z&gt;6$ will provide us with precious information about the physics of rapid supermassive black-hole growth at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Extending Israel-Stewart theory: Causal bulk viscosity at large gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a class of relativistic fluid models for cold and dense matter with bulk viscosity, whose equilibrium equation of state is polytropic. These models reduce to Israel-Stewart theory for small values of the viscous stress $\Pi$. However, when $\Pi$ becomes comparable to the equilibrium pressure $P$, the evolution equations "adjust" to prevent the onset of far-from-equilibrium pathologies that would otherwise plague Israel-Stewart. Specifically, the equations of motion remain symmetric hyperbolic and causal at all times along any continuously differentiable flow, and across the whole thermodynamic state space. This means that, no matter how fast the fluid expands or contracts, the hydrodynamic equations are always well-behaved (away from singularities). The second law of thermodynamics is enforced exactly. Near equilibrium, these models can accommodate an arbitrarily complicated dependence of the bulk viscosity coefficient $\zeta$ on both density and temperature.</description>

      <title>Constraints on flavor-dependent long-range interactions of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical neutrinos with energy in the TeV-PeV range traverse megaparsecs (Mpc) to gigaparsecs (Gpc) scale distances before they reach the Earth. Tiny physics effects that get accumulated over these large propagation paths during their journey may become observable at the detector. If there is some new interaction between neutrinos and the background matter, that can potentially affect the propagation of the astrophysical neutrinos. One such possible case is the flavor-dependent long-range interaction of neutrinos, which can affect the standard neutrino flavor transition, modifying the flavor composition of the astrophysical neutrinos at Earth. Using the present-day and future projection of the flavor-composition measurements of IceCube and IceCube-Gen2 along with the present and future measurement of the oscillation parameters, we explore the sensitivity of these experiments to probe long-range neutrino interaction with matter.</description>

      <title>Radio and Optical Properties of the blazar PKS 1614+051 at z=3.21</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a study of the radio and optical properties of the high-frequency peaker (HFP) blazar PKS 1614+051 at $z=3.21$ based on the data covering the time period of 1997-2024. The radio data are represented by the almost instantaneous 1-22 GHz measurements from the SAO RAS RATAN-600 radio telescope, the 5 and 8 GHz data from the IAA RAS RT-32 telescopes, and the 37 GHz data from the RT-22 telescope of CrAO RAS. The optical measurements in the $R$ band were collected with the SAO RAS 1-m Zeiss-1000 and 0.5-m AS-500/2 telescopes and the ZTF archive data. We have found low overall variability indices (0.1-0.2) and a spectral peak around 4.6 GHz, which is stable during the long-term period of monitoring. An analysis of the radio light curves reveals significant time delays (0.6 to 6.4 years) between the radio frequencies along with variability timescales ranging from 0.2 to 1.8 years in the source's rest frame, which is similar to the blazars at lower redshifts. Spectral modeling suggests the presence of both synchrotron-self absorption (SSA) and free-free absorption (FFA) processes. Based on the SSA model, we provide estimates of the magnetic field strength, which peaks at $\sim\!30$ mG. A spectroscopic study with the BTA SCORPIO-I spectrograph has found signs of the regular motion of a neutral hydrogen envelope around the blazar center, which confirms the presence of enough gaseous matter to form an external FFA screen. The results highlight the importance of multiwavelength and long-term monitoring to understand the physical mechanisms driving the variability in high-redshift blazars.</description>

Abstract: Recent advancements in stellar evolution modeling offer unprecedented accuracy in predicting the evolution and deaths of stars. We present new stellar evolutionary models computed with the updated PARSEC V2.0 code for a comprehensive and homogeneous grid of metallicities and initial masses. Nuclear reaction networks, mass loss prescriptions, and the treatment of elemental mixing have all been updated in PARSEC V2.0. We computed models for thirteen initial metallicities spanning $Z = 10^{-11}$ to $Z = 0.03$, with masses ranging from 2.0 M$_{\odot}$ to 2000 M$_{\odot}$, consisting of a library of over 1,100 ($\sim 2100$ tracks including pure-He models) full stellar evolution tracks. For each track, the evolution is followed from the pre-main-sequence to the most advanced early-asymptotic-giant-branch or the pre-supernova phases, depending on the stellar mass. Here, we describe the properties of the tracks and their chemical and structural evolution. We computed the final fates and the remnant masses and built the mass spectrum for each metallicity, finding that the combined black hole (BH) pair-instability mass gap spans just between 100 and 130 M$_{\odot}$. Moreover, the remnant masses provide models consistent with observed BH masses, such as those from the primaries of GW190521, Cygnus X-1, and $\textit{Gaia}$ BH3 binary systems. We computed and provided the chemical ejecta from stellar winds and explosive final fates, along with the ionizing photon rates. Our results show strong overall consistency with other tracks computed with different codes. A comparison with a large sample of observed massive stars in the Tarantula Nebula of the Large Magellanic Cloud shows that our tracks nicely reproduce the majority of stars that lie on the main sequence. All the models are publicly available and can be retrieved on the PARSEC database.</description>

      <title>Predictions of a simple parametric model of hierarchical black hole mergers</title>

Abstract: Hierarchical mergers of black holes are proposed as a mechanism to explain the observations of binary black holes with component masses between $\sim 50M_{\odot}\hbox{--}130M_{\odot}$ by LIGO/Virgo, often referred to as "upper mass gap". We study the efficiency with which hierarchical mergers can produce higher and higher masses using a simple model of the forward evolution of binary black hole populations in gravitationally bound systems like stellar clusters. The model relies on pairing probability and initial mass functions for the black hole population, along with numerical relativity fitting formulas for the mass, spin, and kick speed of the merger remnant. We carry out an extensive comparison of the predictions of our model with clusterBHBdynamics (cBHBd) model, a fast method for the evolution of star clusters and black holes therein. For this comparison, we consider three different pairing functions of black holes and consider simulations from high- and low-metallicity cluster environments from cBHBd. We find good agreements between our model and the cBHBd results when the pairing probability of binaries depends on both total mass and mass ratio. We also assess the efficiency of hierarchical mergers as a function of merger generation and derive the mass distribution of black holes using our model. We find that the multi-modal features in the observed binary black hole mass spectrum -- revealed by the non-parametric population models -- can be interpreted by invoking the hierarchical merger scenario in dense, metal-rich, stellar environments. Further, the two subdominant peaks in the GWTC-3 component mass spectrum are consistent with second and third-generation mergers in metal-rich, dense environments. With more binary black hole detections, our model could be used to infer the black hole initial mass function and pairing probability exponent.</description>

      <title>Updated Proper Motion of the Neutron Star in the Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.19879v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present updated estimates of the velocity of the neutron star (NS) in the supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A using over two decades of Chandra observations. We use two methods: 1.) recording NS positions from dozens of Chandra observations, including the astrometric uncertainty estimates on the data points but not correcting the astrometry of the observations, and 2.) correcting the astrometry of the 13 Chandra observations that have a sufficient number of point sources with identified Gaia counterparts. For method #1, we observe a heliocentric velocity of 275 $\pm$ 121 km/s, with an angle of 177 $\pm$ 22 degrees east of north. For method #2, we observe a heliocentric velocity of 436 $\pm$ 89 km s$^{-1}$ at an angle of 158 $\pm$ 12 degrees. Correcting for galactic rotation and the sun's peculiar motion decreases these estimates to 256 km s$^{-1}$ at 167$^\circ$ and 433 km s$^{-1}$ at 151$^\circ$, respectively. Both of our estimates match with the explosion-center-estimated velocity of $\sim$350 km s$^{-1}$ and the previous 10--year baseline proper motion measurement of 570 $\pm$ 260 km s$^{-1}$, but our use of additional data over a longer baseline has led to a smaller uncertainty by a factor of 2--3. Our estimates rule out velocities $\gtrsim$600 km s$^{-1}$ and better match with simulations of Cassiopeia~A that include NS kick mechanisms.</description>

      <title>SN 2023zaw: the low-energy explosion of an ultra-stripped star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Most stripped-envelope supernova progenitors are thought to be formed through binary interaction, losing hydrogen and/or helium from their outer layers. Ultra-stripped supernovae are an emerging class of transient which are expected to be produced through envelope-stripping by a NS companion. However, relatively few examples are known and the outcomes of such systems can be diverse and are poorly understood at present. Here, we present spectroscopic observations and high-cadence, multi-band photometry of SN 2023zaw, a rapidly evolving supernova with a low ejecta mass discovered in a nearby spiral galaxy at D = 39.7 Mpc. It has significant Milky Way extinction, $E(B-V)_{\rm MW} = 0.21$, and significant (but uncertain) host extinction. Bayesian evidence comparison reveals that nickel is not the only power source and an additional energy source is required to explain our observations. Our models suggest an ejecta mass of $M_{\rm ej} \sim 0.07$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ and a synthesized nickel mass of $M_{\rm Ni} \sim 0.007$ $\rm M_{\odot}$ are required to explain the observations. We find that additional heating from a central engine, or interaction with circumstellar material can power the early light curve.</description>

      <title>The Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transient incoherent-sum survey</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.02083v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With wide-field phased array feed technology,the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) is ideally suited to search for seemingly rare radio transient sources that are difficult to discover previous-generation narrow-field telescopes. The Commensal Real-time ASKAP Fast Transient (CRAFT) Survey Science Project has developed instrumentation to continuously search for fast radio transients (duration &lt; 1 second) with ASKAP, with a particular focus on finding and localising Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs). Since 2018, the CRAFT survey has been searching for FRBs and other fast transients by incoherently adding the intensities received by individual ASKAP antennas, and then correcting for the impact of frequency dispersion on these short-duration signals in the resultant incoherent sum (ICS) in real-time. This low-latency detection enables the triggering of voltage buffers, which facilitates the localisation of the transient source and the study of spectro-polarimetric properties at high time resolution. Here we report the sample of 43 FRBs discovered in this CRAFT/ICS survey to date. This includes 22 FRBs that had not previously been reported: 16 FRBs localised by ASKAP to &lt; 1 arcsec and 6 FRBs localised to ~ 10 arcmin. Of the new arcsecond-localised FRBs, we have identified and characterised host galaxies (and measured redshifts) for 11. The median of all 30 measured host redshifts from the survey to date is z=0.23. We summarise results from the searches, in particular those contributing to our understanding of the burst progenitors and emission mechanisms, and on the use of bursts as probes of intervening media. We conclude by foreshadowing future FRB surveys with ASKAP using a coherent detection system that is currently being commissioned. This will increase the burst detection rate by a factor of approximately ten and also the distance to which ASKAP can localise FRBs.</description>

      <title>Giant Hall Waves Launched by Superconducting Phase Transition in Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The cores of pulsars are expected to become superconducting soon after birth. The transition to type-II superconductivity is associated with the bunching of magnetic field lines into discrete superconducting flux tubes which possess enormous tension. The coupling of the crust to the flux tubes implies the existence of huge tangential magnetic fields at the crust-core interface. We show that the transition to superconductivity triggers a highly non-linear response in the Hall drift of the crustal magnetic field, an effect which was neglected in previous numerical modelling. We argue that at the time of the phase transition giant Hall waves are launched from the crust-core interface toward the surface. Our models show that if the crust contains a multipolar magnetic field $\sim 10^{13}$ G, the amplitude of the Hall waves is $\sim 10^{15}$ G. The elastic deformation of the lattice is included in our models, which allows us to track the time-dependent shear stresses everywhere in the crust. The simulations indicate that the Hall waves may be strong enough to break the crust, and could cause star quakes which trigger rotation glitches and changes in the radio pulse profile. The Hall waves also couple to slow magnetospheric changes which cause anomalous braking indices. The emission of the giant Hall waves from the crust-core interface facilitates fast flux expulsion from the superconducting core, provided that the flux tubes in the core are themselves sufficiently mobile. For all of the flux tube mobility prescriptions implemented in this work, the core approaches the Meissner state with B=0 at late times.</description>

      <title>The Puzzling Superorbital Period Variation of the Low-mass X-ray Binary 4U 1820-30</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08451v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Because of the previously observed stability of the 171-day period, the superorbital modulation of the low-mass X-ray binary 4U 1820-30 was considered a consequence of a third star orbiting around the binary. This study aims to further verify this triple model by testing the stability of superorbital period using the light curves collected by X-ray sky monitoring/scanning telescopes from 1987 to 2023. Both power spectral and phase analysis results indicate a significant change in the superorbital period from 171 days to 167 days over this 36-year span. The evolution of the superorbital phase suggests that the superorbital period may have experienced an abrupt change between early 2001 and mid-2003 or changed gradually with a period derivative of $\dot P_{sup}=(-4.20 \pm 0.72) \times 10^{-4}$ day/day. We conclude that the superorbital period of 4U 1820-30 was not as stable as anticipated by the triple model, which strongly challenges this hypothesis. Instead, we propose an irradiation-induced mass transfer instability scenario to explain the superorbital modulation of 4U 1820-30.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Key Features of Repeating Fast Radio Bursts with Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11173</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11173v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Fast radio bursts (FRBs) are enigmatic high-energy events with unknown origins, which are observationally divided into two categories, i.e., repeaters and non-repeaters. However, there are potentially a number of non-repeaters that may be misclassified, as repeating bursts are missed due to the limited sensitivity and observation periods, thus misleading the investigation of their physical properties. In this work, we propose a repeater identification method based on the t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) algorithm and apply the classification to the first Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment Fast Radio Burst (CHIME/FRB) catalog. We find that the spectral morphology parameters, specifically spectral running ($r$), represent the key features for identifying repeaters from the non-repeaters. Also, the results suggest that repeaters are more biased towards narrowband emission, whereas non-repeaters are inclined toward broadband emission. We provide a list of 163 repeater candidates, 5 of which are confirmed with an updated repeater catalog from CHIME/FRB. Our findings improve our understanding of the various properties underlying repeaters and non-repeaters, as well as guidelines for future FRB detection and categorization.</description>

Abstract: In this chapter, we provide an overview of the physics of colliding black holes and neutron stars and of the impact of neutrinos on these systems. Observations of colliding neutron stars play an important role in nuclear astrophysics today. They allow us to study the properties of cold nuclear matter and the origin of many heavy elements (gold, platinum, uranium). We show that neutrinos significantly impact the observable signals powered by these events as well as the outcome of nucleosynthesis in the matter that they eject into the surrounding intergalactic medium.</description>

      <title>Systematic collapse of the accretion disc in AGN confirmed by UV photometry and broad line spectra</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06730v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A recent study on the spectral energy distribution (SED) of AGN combined unobscured X-ray sources from the eROSITA eFEDS Survey with high quality optical imaging from Subaru's Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC). The HSC data enabled accurate host galaxy subtraction as well as giving a uniform black hole mass estimator from the stellar mass. The resulting stacked optical/X-ray SEDs for black holes at fixed mass show a dramatic transition, where the dominating disc component in bright AGN evaporates into an X-ray hot plasma below $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$. The models fit to these datasets predicted the largest change in SED in the rest frame UV ($&lt; 3000\,\r{A}$), but this waveband was not included in the original study. Here we use archival $u$-band and UV photometry to extend the SEDs into this range, and confirm the UV is indeed intrinsically faint in AGN below $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$ as predicted. This dramatic drop in UV photo-ionising flux is also seen from its effect on the broad emission lines. We stack the recently released SDSS DR18 optical spectra for this sample, and show that the broad H$\beta$ line disappears along with the UV bright component at $L/L_{\rm Edd}\sim 0.01$. This shows that there is a population of unobscured, X-ray bright, UV faint AGN which lack broad emission lines (true type 2 Seyferts).</description>

      <title>Steady-State Solutions for a Geometrically Thin Accretion Disk with Magnetically-Driven Winds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present steady-state solutions for a one-dimensional, magnetically-driven accretion disk wind model based on magnetohydrodynamic equations. We assume a geometrically thin, gas-pressure-dominated accretion disk, incorporating both magnetic braking and turbulent viscosity introduced by an extended alpha-viscosity prescription. Additionally, the vertical stress parameter is assumed to scale with the disk aspect ratio. We confirm that the derived solutions result in standard disk solutions when the wind is absent. We find that the mass accretion rate decreases as the disk mass falls inward, while the mass loss rate increases with radius. The disk spectrum emitted from the magnetically-driven disk wind can be observed without interference from the wind medium because the wind is significantly optically thin. The spectral luminosity is proportional to $\nu^{1/3}$ in the intermediate, multicolor-blackbody wavebands, in the absence of wind, as predicted by standard disk theory. However, in the presence of wind, it follows a different power-law dependence on frequency over the same range. A deviation from the spectral slope of $1/3$, particularly a negative spectral slope, is a clear indicator of the presence of a magnetically driven wind. We also discuss an observational strategy to test our model with multi-wavelength observations.</description>

      <title>Revision of two-temperature magnetically arrested flows onto a black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06492v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We revisit the radiative properties of three-dimensional GRMHD two-temperature magnetically arrested disk (MAD) models in which electrons are heated by a magnetic turbulent cascade. We focus on studying the model emission, whose characteristics include variability in both total intensity and linear/circular polarizations as well as rotation measures at energies around synchrotron emission peak in millimeter waves. We find that radiative properties of MAD models with turbulent electron heating are well converged with respect to the numerical grid resolution, which has not been demonstrated before. We compare radiation from two-temperature simulations with turbulent heating to single-temperature models with electron temperatures calculated based on commonly used $R(\beta)$ prescription. We find that the self-consisitent two-temperature models with turbulent heating do not significantly outperform the $R(\beta)$ models and, in practice, may be indistinguishable from the $R(\beta)$ models. Accounting for physical effects such as radiative cooling and non-thermal electron distribution function makes a weak impact on properties of millimeter emission. Models are scaled to Sgr~A* - an accreting black hole in the center of our galaxy, and compared to the most complete observational datasets. We point out the consistencies and inconsistencies between the MAD models and observations of this source and discuss future prospects for GRMHD simulations.</description>

Abstract: Axion-like particles (ALP) are promising candidates to comprise all the dark matter in the universe. We investigate the ALP couplings to photons and electrons via astrophysical measurements through the search for very-high-energy gamma rays arising from high-energy cosmic-ray scattering off ALP populating the halo of the Milky Way. We show that gamma-ray signals from ALP couplings to photons and electrons via inverse Primakoff and Compton processes respectively, can be probed by very-high-energy ($\gtrsim$100 GeV) gamma-ray ground-based observatories, providing an alternative and complementary avenue to probe ALP couplings in the eV mass range. Sensitivities of current and near-future ground-based gamma-ray observatories improves upon one order of magnitude the current constraints from gamma-ray satellite experiments for the ALP-photon couplings in the region of masses below 10$^{-9}$ GeV. Their sensitivities reached on the ALP-electron couplings allow probing masses below 10$^{-8}$ GeV, which are lower than the masses probed in gamma-ray satellite experiments.</description>

      <title>A multi-frequency census of 100 pulsars below 100 MHz with LWA: a systematic study of flux density, spectra, timing, dispersion, polarization, and its variation from a decade of observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11862v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a census of 100 pulsars, the largest below 100 MHz, including 94 normal pulsars and six millisecond pulsars, with the Long Wavelength Array (LWA). Pulse profiles are detected across a range of frequencies from 26 to 88 MHz, including new narrow-band profiles facilitating profile evolution studies and breaks in pulsar spectra at low frequencies. We report mean flux density, spectral index, curvature, and low-frequency turnover frequency measurements for 97 pulsars, including new measurements for 61 sources. Multi-frequency profile widths are presented for all pulsars, including component spacing for 27 pulsars with two components. Polarized emission is detected from 27 of the sources (the largest sample at these frequencies) in multiple frequency bands, with one new detection. We also provide new timing solutions for five recently-discovered pulsars. Low-frequency observations with the LWA are especially sensitive to propagation effects arising in the interstellar medium. We have made the most sensitive measurements of pulsar dispersion measures (DMs) and rotation measures (RMs), with median uncertainties of 2.9x10^-4 pc cm^-3 and 0.01 rad m^-2, respectively, and can track their variations over almost a decade, along with other frequency-dependent effects. This allows stringent limits on average magnetic fields, with no variations detected above ~20 nG. Finally, the census yields some interesting phenomena in individual sources, including the detection of frequency and time-dependent DM variations in B2217+47, and the detection of highly circularly polarized emission from J0051+0423.</description>

      <title>Conditional variational autoencoder inference of neutron star equation of state from astrophysical observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14266v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new inference framework for neutron star astrophysics based on conditional variational autoencoders. Once trained, the generator block of the model reconstructs the neutron star equation of state from a given set of mass-radius observations. While the pressure of dense matter is the focus of the present study, the proposed model is flexible enough to accommodate the reconstructing of any other quantity related to dense matter equation of state. Our results show robust reconstructing performance of the model, allowing to make instantaneous inference from any given observation set.</description>

      <title>Effective-one-body waveform model for noncircularized, planar, coalescing black hole binaries II:high accuracy by improving logarithmic terms in resummations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Effective-one-body (EOB) models are based on analytical building blocks that, mathematically, are truncated Taylor series with logarithms. These functions are usually resummed using Pad\'e approximants obtained first assuming that the logarithms are constant, and then replacing them back into the resulting rational functions. A recent study pointed out that this procedure introduces spurious logarithmic terms when the resummed functions are reexpanded. Here we update the TEOBResumS-Dal\'i waveform model for spin-aligned, noncircularized coalescing black hole binaries by systematically implementing new (still Pad\'e based) resummations for all EOB functions (that is, the metric potentials $A, D$ and the residual waveform amplitude corrections $\rho_{\ell m}$ up to $\ell=8$). Once the model is informed by 50 Numerical Relativity simulations, this new approach proves key in lowering the maximum EOB/NR unfaithfulness $\bar{F}_{\rm EOBNR}^{\rm max}$ for the $\ell=m=2$ mode (with the Advanced LIGO noise in the total mass range $10-200M_{\odot}$) over 530 spin-aligned waveforms of the Simulating eXtreme Spacetimes catalog. A median unfaithfulness equal to $3.09\times 10^{-4}$ is achieved, which is a marked improvement over the previous value, $1.06\times 10^{-3}$. The largest value, ${\rm Max}[\bar{F}^{\rm max}_{\rm EOBNR}]= 6.80\times 10^{-3}$, is found for an equal-mass, equal-spin simulation with dimensionless spins $\sim +0.998$; only five configurations have $\bar{F}^{\rm max}_{\rm EOBNR} &gt; 5\times 10^{-3}$ (four of which equal-mass and with equal spins larger than $\sim +0.98$). Results for eccentric binaries are similarly excellent (well below $10^{-2}$ and mostly around $10^{-3}$).</description>

      <title>Next-generation global gravitational-wave detector network: Impact of detector orientation on compact binary coalescence and stochastic gravitational-wave background searches</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06032v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Next-generation gravitational-wave detectors like the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, currently in their preparatory phase, have the potential to significantly improve our understanding of astrophysics, cosmology and fundamental physics. We examine how the arm orientations of the proposed detectors influence the sensitivity of a combined Einstein Telescope - Cosmic Explorer network with respect to the sensitivity to the stochastic gravitational-wave background and compact binary coalescences, where measuring both gravitational-wave polarizations is favorable. We present a method to optimize the arm orientations in the network for these two targets, and also demonstrate how to achieve a balanced configuration for both stochastic background and compact binary coalescence searches. For five specific network configurations, we explicitly compare the sensitivity to the stochastic background and binary neutron star mergers. For the latter, we conduct Bayesian parameter estimation on the extrinsic parameters of a reference binary neutron star system to assess sky localization and distance estimation capabilities. These are illustrated through efficiency curves showing the fraction of events meeting sky localization and distance uncertainty criteria as a function of redshift. Our findings suggest that globally coordinating efforts towards the next-generation gravitational-wave detector network is advantageous.</description>

      <title>Detecting Hyperons in neutron stars -- a machine learning approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.12684v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a neural network classification model for detecting the presence of hyperonic degrees of freedom in neutron stars. The models take radii and/or tidal deformabilities as input and give the probability for the presence of hyperons in the neutron star composition. Different numbers of observations and different levels of uncertainty in the neutron star properties are tested. The models have been trained on a dataset of well-calibrated microscopic equations of state of neutron star matter based on a relativistic mean-field formalism. Real data and data generated from a different description of hyperonic matter are used to test the performance of the models.</description>

      <title>Early formation of supermassive black holes from the collapse of strongly self-interacting dark matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17480v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Evidence for high-redshift supermassive black holes challenges standard scenarios for how such objects form in the early universe. Here, we entertain the possibility that a fraction of the cosmological dark matter could be ultra-strongly self interacting. This would imply that gravothermal collapse occur at early times in the cores of dark matter halos, followed by accretion. We study under which conditions on the abundance and interaction strength and structure of such ultra self-interacting dark matter the black holes resulting from the end-point of gravothermal core collapse can seed the observed, early-forming supermassive black holes. We find, depending on the velocity dependence of the self-interaction cross section, a bimodal structure in the favored parameter space, where data points to either a small collapsing dark matter fraction with a large cross section, or a large fraction and a relatively small cross section. While self-interaction cross sections with different velocity dependence can explain observations, we find that the best, self-consistent results correspond to a Rutherford-like self-interaction, typical of long-range dark-sector forces with light mediators. We discuss complementary observational probes if this scenario is realized in nature, focusing especially on the expected intermediate mass black holes predicted to exist in smaller galaxies.</description>
