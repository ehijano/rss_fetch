      <title>A Framework for Simulating the Path-level Residual Stress in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion Process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06293v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) additive manufacturing has revolutionized industries with its capability to create intricate and customized components. The LPBF process uses moving heat sources to melt and solidify metal powders. The fast melting and cooling leads to residual stress, which critically affects the part quality. Currently, the computational intensity of accurately simulating the residual stress on the path scale remains a significant challenge, limiting our understanding of the LPBF processes.
  This paper presents a framework for simulating the LPBF process residual stress based on the path-level thermal history. Compared with the existing approaches, the path-level simulation requires discretization only to capture the scanning path rather than the details of the melt pools, thus requiring less dense mesh and is more computationally efficient. We develop this framework by introducing a new concept termed effective thermal strain to capture the anisotropic thermal strain near and around the melt pool. We validate our approach with the high-fidelity results from the literature. We use the proposed approach to simulate various single-island scanning patterns and layers with multiple full and trimmed islands. We further investigate the influence of the path-level thermal history and the layer shape on the residual stress by analyzing their simulation results.</description>

      <title>Using Graph Neural Networks and Frequency Domain Data for Automated Operational Modal Analysis of Populations of Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06492v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Population-Based Structural Health Monitoring (PBSHM) paradigm has recently emerged as a promising approach to enhance data-driven assessment of engineering structures by facilitating transfer learning between structures with some degree of similarity. In this work, we apply this concept to the automated modal identification of structural systems. We introduce a Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based deep learning scheme to identify modal properties, including natural frequencies, damping ratios, and mode shapes of engineering structures based on the Power Spectral Density (PSD) of spatially-sparse vibration measurements. Systematic numerical experiments are conducted to evaluate the proposed model, employing two distinct truss populations that possess similar topological characteristics but varying geometric (size, shape) and material (stiffness) properties. The results demonstrate that, once trained, the proposed GNN-based model can identify modal properties of unseen structures within the same structural population with good efficiency and acceptable accuracy, even in the presence of measurement noise and sparse measurement locations. The GNN-based model exhibits advantages over the classic Frequency Domain Decomposition (FDD) method in terms of identification speed, as well as against an alternate Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) architecture in terms of identification accuracy, rendering this a promising tool for PBSHM purposes.</description>

      <title>Multi-person eye tracking for real-world scene perception in social settings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06345v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eye movements provide a window into human behaviour, attention, and interaction dynamics. Previous research suggests that eye movements are highly influenced by task, setting, and social others; however, most eye tracking research is conducted in single-person, in-lab settings and is yet to be validated in multi-person, naturalistic contexts. One such prevalent real-world context is the collective viewing of a shared scene in social settings, for example, viewing a concert, film, lecture, sports, etc. Here, we apply mobile eye tracking in a real-world multi-person setup and develop a system to stream, record, and analyse synchronised data. We tested our proposed, open-source system while participants (N=60) watched a live concert and a documentary film screening during a public event. We tackled challenges related to networking bandwidth requirements, real-time monitoring, and gaze projection from individual egocentric perspectives to a common coordinate space for shared gaze analysis. Our system achieves precise time synchronisation and accurate gaze projection in challenging dynamic scenes. Further, to illustrate the potential of collective eye-tracking data, we introduce and evaluate novel analysis metrics and visualisations. Overall, our approach contributes to the development and application of versatile multi-person eye tracking systems in real-world social settings. This advancement enables insight into collaborative behaviour, group dynamics, and social interaction, with high ecological validity. Moreover, it paves the path for innovative, interactive tools that promote collaboration and coordination in social contexts.</description>

      <title>LETS-C: Leveraging Language Embedding for Time Series Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06533</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06533v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in language modeling have shown promising results when applied to time series data. In particular, fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs) for time series classification tasks has achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on standard benchmarks. However, these LLM-based models have a significant drawback due to the large model size, with the number of trainable parameters in the millions. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach to leveraging the success of language modeling in the time series domain. Instead of fine-tuning LLMs, we utilize a language embedding model to embed time series and then pair the embeddings with a simple classification head composed of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and multilayer perceptron (MLP). We conducted extensive experiments on well-established time series classification benchmark datasets. We demonstrated LETS-C not only outperforms the current SOTA in classification accuracy but also offers a lightweight solution, using only 14.5% of the trainable parameters on average compared to the SOTA model. Our findings suggest that leveraging language encoders to embed time series data, combined with a simple yet effective classification head, offers a promising direction for achieving high-performance time series classification while maintaining a lightweight model architecture.</description>

      <title>TeVAE: A Variational Autoencoder Approach for Discrete Online Anomaly Detection in Variable-state Multivariate Time-series Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06849v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As attention to recorded data grows in the realm of automotive testing and manual evaluation reaches its limits, there is a growing need for automatic online anomaly detection. This real-world data is complex in many ways and requires the modelling of testee behaviour. To address this, we propose a temporal variational autoencoder (TeVAE) that can detect anomalies with minimal false positives when trained on unlabelled data. Our approach also avoids the bypass phenomenon and introduces a new method to remap individual windows to a continuous time series. Furthermore, we propose metrics to evaluate the detection delay and root-cause capability of our approach and present results from experiments on a real-world industrial data set. When properly configured, TeVAE flags anomalies only 6% of the time wrongly and detects 65% of anomalies present. It also has the potential to perform well with a smaller training and validation subset but requires a more sophisticated threshold estimation method.</description>

      <title>Measuring Sustainability Intention of ESG Fund Disclosure using Few-Shot Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06893v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Global sustainable fund universe encompasses open-end funds and exchange-traded funds (ETF) that, by prospectus or other regulatory filings, claim to focus on Environment, Social and Governance (ESG). Challengingly, the claims can only be confirmed by examining the textual disclosures to check if there is presence of intentionality and ESG focus on its investment strategy. Currently, there is no regulation to enforce sustainability in ESG products space. This paper proposes a unique method and system to classify and score the fund prospectuses in the sustainable universe regarding specificity and transparency of language. We aim to employ few-shot learners to identify specific, ambiguous, and generic sustainable investment-related language. Additionally, we construct a ratio metric to determine language score and rating to rank products and quantify sustainability claims for US sustainable universe. As a by-product, we publish manually annotated quality training dataset on Hugging Face (ESG-Prospectus-Clarity-Category under cc-by-nc-sa-4.0) of more than 1K ESG textual statements. The performance of the few-shot finetuning approach is compared with zero-shot models e.g., Llama-13B, GPT 3.5 Turbo etc. We found that prompting large language models are not accurate for domain specific tasks due to misalignment issues. The few-shot finetuning techniques outperform zero-shot models by large margins of more than absolute ~30% in precision, recall and F1 metrics on completely unseen ESG languages (test set). Overall, the paper attempts to establish a systematic and scalable approach to measure and rate sustainability intention quantitatively for sustainable funds using texts in prospectus. Regulatory bodies, investors, and advisors may utilize the findings of this research to reduce cognitive load in investigating or screening of ESG funds which accurately reflects the ESG intention.</description>

      <title>Limits of isotropic damage models for complex load paths -- beyond stress triaxiality and Lode angle parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01659v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The stress triaxiality and the Lode angle parameter are two well established stress invariants for the characterization of damage evolution. This work assesses the limits of this tuple by using it for damage predictions in a continuum damage mechanics framework. Isotropic and anisotropic formulations of two well-established models are used to avoid model-specific restrictions. The damage evolution is analyzed for different load paths, while the stress triaxiality and the Lode angle parameter are controlled. The equivalent plastic strain is moreover added as a third parameter, but still does not suffice to uniquely define the damage state. As a consequence, well-established concepts such as fracture surfaces depending on this triple have to be taken with care, if complex paths are to be investgated. These include, e.g., load paths observed during metal forming applications with varying load directions or multiple stages.</description>

      <title>Quantum Computing and Tensor Networks for Laminate Design: A Novel Approach to Stacking Sequence Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.06455v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: As with many tasks in engineering, structural design frequently involves navigating complex and computationally expensive problems. A prime example is the weight optimization of laminated composite materials, which to this day remains a formidable task, due to an exponentially large configuration space and non-linear constraints. The rapidly developing field of quantum computation may offer novel approaches for addressing these intricate problems. However, before applying any quantum algorithm to a given problem, it must be translated into a form that is compatible with the underlying operations on a quantum computer. Our work specifically targets stacking sequence retrieval with lamination parameters. To adapt this problem for quantum computational methods, we map the possible stacking sequences onto a quantum state space. We further derive a linear operator, the Hamiltonian, within this state space that encapsulates the loss function inherent to the stacking sequence retrieval problem. Additionally, we demonstrate the incorporation of manufacturing constraints on stacking sequences as penalty terms in the Hamiltonian. This quantum representation is suitable for a variety of classical and quantum algorithms for finding the ground state of a quantum Hamiltonian. For a practical demonstration, we performed state-vector simulations of two variational quantum algorithms and additionally chose a classical tensor network algorithm, the DMRG algorithm, to numerically validate our approach. Although this work primarily concentrates on quantum computation, the application of tensor network algorithms presents a novel quantum-inspired approach for stacking sequence retrieval.</description>

      <title>Bayesian grey-box identification of nonlinear convection effects in heat transfer dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a computational procedure for identifying convection in heat transfer dynamics. The procedure is based on a Gaussian process latent force model, consisting of a white-box component (i.e., known physics) for the conduction and linear convection effects and a Gaussian process that acts as a black-box component for the nonlinear convection effects. States are inferred through Bayesian smoothing and we obtain approximate posterior distributions for the kernel covariance function's hyperparameters using Laplace's method. The nonlinear convection function is recovered from the Gaussian process states using a Bayesian regression model. We validate the procedure by simulation error using the identified nonlinear convection function, on both data from a simulated system and measurements from a physical assembly.</description>
