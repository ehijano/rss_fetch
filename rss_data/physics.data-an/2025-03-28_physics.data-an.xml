      <title>A General Solution for Network Models with Pairwise Edge Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20805</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20805v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Network Models with couplings between link pairs are the simplest models for a class of networks with Higher Order interactions. In this paper we give an analytic, general solution to this family of Random Graph Models extending previous results obtained for specific interaction structures. We use the Hubbard-Stratonovich transform to show that such higher order models can be decoupled into families of effectively separable random graph models, which might be enhanced with auxiliary, possibly multi-valued, parameters identifying the thermodynamical phase of the system. Moreover, given the diagonalizability of couplings between links, we carry out the full computation of the partition functions and discuss why in some cases they can effectively reduce to the one for the Mean-Field case.</description>

      <title>Least Squares as Random Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Linear least squares (LLS) is perhaps the most common method of data analysis, dating back to Legendre, Gauss and Laplace. Framed as linear regression, LLS is also a backbone of mathematical statistics. Here we report on an unexpected new connection between LLS and random walks. To that end, we introduce the notion of a random walk based on a discrete sequence of data samples (data walk). We show that the slope of a straight line which annuls the net area under a residual data walk equals the one found by LLS. For equidistant data samples this result is exact and holds for an arbitrary distribution of steps.</description>

      <title>Reconstructing Gridded Data from Higher Autocorrelations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The higher-order autocorrelations of integer-valued or rational-valued gridded data sets appear naturally in X-ray crystallography, and have applications in computer vision systems, correlation tomography, correlation spectroscopy, and pattern recognition. In this paper, we consider the problem of reconstructing a gridded data set from its higher-order autocorrelations. We describe an explicit reconstruction algorithm, and prove that the autocorrelations up to order 3r + 3 are always sufficient to determine the data up to translation, where r is the dimension of the grid. We also provide examples of rational-valued gridded data sets which are not determined by their autocorrelations up to order 3r + 2.</description>

      <title>Data-Driven Extreme Response Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A method to rapidly estimate extreme ship response events is developed in this paper. The method involves training by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to correct a lower-fidelity hydrodynamic model to the level of a higher-fidelity simulation. More focus is placed on larger responses by isolating the time-series near peak events identified in the lower-fidelity simulations and training on only the shorter time-series around the large event. The method is tested on the estimation of pitch time-series maxima in Sea State 5 (significant wave height of 4.0 meters and modal period of 15.0 seconds,) generated by a lower-fidelity hydrodynamic solver known as SimpleCode and a higher-fidelity tool known as the Large Amplitude Motion Program (LAMP). The results are also compared with an LSTM trained without special considerations for large events.</description>

      <title>Structure and Melting of Fe, MgO, SiO2, and MgSiO3 in Planets: Database, Inversion, and Phase Diagram</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.21734v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present globally inverted pressure-temperature (P-T) phase diagrams up to 5,000 GPa for four fundamental planetary materials, Fe, MgO, SiO2, and MgSiO3, derived from logistic regression and supervised learning, together with an experimental phase equilibria database. These new P-T phase diagrams provide a solution to long-standing disputes about their melting curves. Their implications extend to the melting and freezing of rocky materials in the interior of giant planets and super-Earth exoplanets, contributing to the refinement of their internal structure models.</description>

      <title>On the recent seismic activity at Ioannina (Greece): Pre-earthquake electromagnetic emissions with critical and tricritical behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.06220</link>
      <description>arXiv:1610.06220v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this short paper we report that the dynamics of the earthquake (EQ) preparation processes, as embedded in the observed fracture-induced electromagnetic emissions (EME), were characterized by critical and then tricritical behavior a few days before the occurrence of the recent Ioannina (Greece) earthquake [($39.79^o N, 20.69^o E$), 15 October 2016, $M_L=5.3$]. Specifically, an excerpt of the MHz EME recorded by our remote telemetric station near the city of Ioannina five days before the EQ was found to possess critical characteristics, followed by an excerpt possessing tricritical characteristics. The analysis was performed by means of the method of critical fluctuations (MCF). Interestingly, spontaneous symmetry breaking was identified between critical and tricritical behavior.</description>

      <title>GD-VAEs: Geometric Dynamic Variational Autoencoders for Learning Nonlinear Dynamics and Dimension Reductions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.05183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2206.05183v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop data-driven methods incorporating geometric and topological information to learn parsimonious representations of nonlinear dynamics from observations. The approaches learn nonlinear state-space models of the dynamics for general manifold latent spaces using training strategies related to Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). Our methods are referred to as Geometric Dynamic (GD) Variational Autoencoders (GD-VAEs). We learn encoders and decoders for the system states and evolution based on deep neural network architectures that include general Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), and other architectures. Motivated by problems arising in parameterized PDEs and physics, we investigate the performance of our methods on tasks for learning reduced dimensional representations of the nonlinear Burgers Equations, Constrained Mechanical Systems, and spatial fields of Reaction-Diffusion Systems. GD-VAEs provide methods that can be used to obtain representations in manifold latent spaces for diverse learning tasks involving dynamics.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Inference of Plate Bending from Heterogeneous Data: Physics-informed Gaussian Processes via Kirchhoff-Love Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12802v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Advancements in machine learning and an abundance of structural monitoring data have inspired the integration of mechanical models with probabilistic models to identify a structure's state and quantify the uncertainty of its physical parameters and response. In this paper, we propose an inference methodology for classical Kirchhoff-Love plates via physics-informed Gaussian Processes (GP). A probabilistic model is formulated as a multi-output GP by placing a GP prior on the deflection and deriving the covariance function using the linear differential operators of the plate governing equations. The posteriors of the flexural rigidity, hyperparameters, and plate response are inferred in a Bayesian manner using Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling from noisy measurements. We demonstrate the applicability with two examples: a simply supported plate subjected to a sinusoidal load and a fixed plate subjected to a uniform load. The results illustrate how the proposed methodology can be employed to perform stochastic inference for plate rigidity and physical quantities by integrating measurements from various sensor types and qualities. Potential applications of the presented methodology are in structural health monitoring and uncertainty quantification of plate-like structures.</description>
