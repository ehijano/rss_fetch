      <title>Avoiding spectral pollution for transfer operators using residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Koopman operator theory enables linear analysis of nonlinear dynamical systems by lifting their evolution to infinite-dimensional function spaces. However, finite-dimensional approximations of Koopman and transfer (Frobenius--Perron) operators are prone to spectral pollution, introducing spurious eigenvalues that can compromise spectral computations. While recent advances have yielded provably convergent methods for Koopman operators, analogous tools for general transfer operators remain limited. In this paper, we present algorithms for computing spectral properties of transfer operators without spectral pollution, including extensions to the Hardy-Hilbert space. Case studies--ranging from families of Blaschke maps with known spectrum to a molecular dynamics model of protein folding--demonstrate the accuracy and flexibility of our approach. Notably, we demonstrate that spectral features can arise even when the corresponding eigenfunctions lie outside the chosen space, highlighting the functional-analytic subtleties in defining the "true" Koopman spectrum. Our methods offer robust tools for spectral estimation across a broad range of applications.</description>

      <title>Reduction theory for Fuchsian groups with cusps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16958v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a family of Bowen-Series-like maps associated to any finitely generated Fuchsian group of the first kind with at least one cusp. These maps act on the boundary of the hyperbolic plane in a piecewise manner by generators of the group. We show that the two-dimensional natural extension (reduction map) of the boundary map has a domain of bijectivity and global attractor with a finite rectangular structure, confirming a conjecture of Don Zagier. Our work is based on the construction of a special fundamental polygon, related to the free product structure of the group, whose marking is preserved by "Teichm\"uller deformation."</description>

      <title>Analytic Theory on the Space of Blaschke Products: Simultaneous Uniformization and Pressure Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17077</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17077v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study complex analytic aspects of the moduli space $\Bcal_d^{fm}$ of degree $d\ge2$ fixed-point-marked Blaschke products. We define a complex structure on $\Bcal_d^{fm}$ and prove the simultaneous uniformization theorem for fixed-point-marked quasi-Blaschke products. As an application, we show that the pressure semi-norms on the space of Blaschke products are non-degenerate outside of the super-attracting locus $\mathcal{SA}^{fm}_d$, which is a codimension-1 subspace of $\Bcal^{fm}_d$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For endomorphisms of projective varieties, we prove that the arithmetic degree of a point with Zariski dense orbit must be a cohomological Lyapunov multiplier of the dynamical system. We will apply our result to deduce a corollary towards the dynamical Mordell--Lang conjecture.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of stationary compatible probability measure for chains of infinite order with forbidden transitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider chains of infinite order on countable state spaces with prohibited transitions. We give a set of sufficient conditions on the structure of the probability kernels of the chains to have at most one stationary probability measure compatible with the kernel. Our main result extends the uniqueness $\ell^2$ criterion from Johansson and \"Oberg (2003) which was obtained for strongly non-null chains. A particular attention is given to concrete examples, illustrating the main theorem and its corollaries, with comparison to results of the existing literature.</description>

      <title>Continued fractions with large prime partial quotients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the Lebesgue measure and Hausdorff dimension of various sets of real numbers with infinitely many partial quotients that are both large and prime, thus extending the well-known theorems by {\L}uczak (1997) and Huang-Wu-Xu (2020). To this end, we obtain new asymptotics on the tail end of the almost prime zeta function. Our results include some recent work by Schindler-Zweim{\"u}ller (2023).</description>

Abstract: We tour several Euclidean properties of Poncelet triangles inscribed in an ellipse and circumscribing the incircle, including loci of triangle centers and envelopes of key objects. We also show that a number of degenerate behaviors are triggered by the presence of an equilateral triangle in the family.</description>

      <title>Synchrony and canards in two coupled FitzHugh--Nagumo equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.12596v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We describe the fast-slow dynamics of two FitzHugh--Nagumo equations coupled symmetrically through the slow equations.
  We use symmetry arguments to find a non-empty open set of parameter values for which the two equations synchronise, and another set with antisynchrony -- where the solution of one equation is minus the solution of the other.
  By combining the dynamics within the synchrony and antisynchrony subspaces, we also obtain bistability -- where these two types of solution coexist as hyperbolic attractors. They persist under small perturbation of the parameters.
  Canards are shown to give rise to mixed-mode oscillations.
  They also initiate small amplitude transient oscillations before the onset of large amplitude relaxation oscillations. We also discuss briefly the effect of asymmetric coupling, with periodic forcing of one of the equations by the other. We illustrate our results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.02133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of dynamical systems involves analyzing how functions behave under iteration in different mathematical spaces. In the context of complex dynamics, tools such as Julia sets and filled Julia sets are used to understand the long-term behavior of functions in the complex Euclidean field. In this paper, we will present a review of Julia sets and filled Julia sets, provide an overview of the mathematical formulation of the alternated Julia sets introduced in the work of Danca-Romera-Pastor, extend it to the $p$-adic setting, and propose a tool that can potentially be used to study the arithmetic dynamics of various types of functions. Additionally, we will summarize key results on connectivity properties and visualization techniques as discussed in the work of Danca-Bourke-Romera and provide a visualization algorithm and pseudocode that enable the visualization of alternated Julia sets with various connectivity properties.</description>

      <title>Bayesian Generalized Nonlinear Models Offer Basis Free SINDy With Model Uncertainty</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.06776v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (SINDy) has become a standard methodology for inferring governing equations of dynamical systems from observed data using statistical modeling. However, classical SINDy approaches rely on predefined libraries of candidate functions to model nonlinearities, which limits flexibility and excludes robust uncertainty quantification. This paper proposes Bayesian Generalized Nonlinear Models (BGNLMs) as a principled alternative for more flexible statistical modeling. BGNLMs employ spike-and-slab priors combined with binary inclusion indicators to automatically discover relevant nonlinearities without predefined basis functions. Moreover, BGNLMs quantify uncertainty in selected bases and final model predictions, enabling robust exploration of the model space. In this paper, the BGNLM framework is applied to several three-dimensional (3D) SINDy problems.</description>
