      <title>Propellant Discovery For Electrospray Thrusters Using Machine Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study introduces a machine learning framework to predict the suitability of ionic liquids with unknown physical properties as propellants for electrospray thrusters based on their molecular structure. We construct a training dataset by labeling ionic liquids as suitable (+1) or unsuitable (-1) for electrospray thrusters based on their density, viscosity, and surface tension. The ionic liquids are represented by their molecular descriptors calculated using the Mordred package. We evaluate four machine learning algorithms: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), with SVM demonstrating superior predictive performance. The SVM predicts 193 candidate propellants from a dataset of ionic liquids with unknown physical properties. Further, we employ Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) to assess and rank the impact of individual molecular descriptors on model decisions.</description>

      <title>General Quantum Alchemical Free Energy Simulations via Hamiltonian Interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17002v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an implementation of alchemical free energy simulations at the quantum mechanical level by directly interpolating the electronic Hamiltonian. The method is compatible with any level of electronic structure theory and requires only one quantum calculation for each molecular dynamics step in contrast to multiple energy evaluations that would be needed when interpolating the ground-state energies. We demonstrate the correctness and applicability of the technique by computing alchemical free energy changes of gas-phase molecules, with both nuclear and electron creation/annihilation. We also show an initial application to first-principles pKa calculation for solvated molecules where we quantum mechanically annihilate a bonded proton.</description>

      <title>Machine learning for predicting control landscape maps of quantum molecular dynamics: Laser-induced three-dimensional alignment of asymmetric top molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17089</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17089v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning for predicting control landscape maps of full quantum molecular dynamics is examined through a case study of the laser-induced three-dimensional (3D) alignment of asymmetric top molecules, an essential technique for observing and/or manipulating molecular dynamics in a molecule-fixed frame. We consider the "prolate-type" asymmetryic top molecules with the asymmetry parameters $-1 &lt; \kappa &lt; 0$ and the C2v symmetry in the low-temperature limiting case, which are aligned by using mutually orthogonal linearly polarized double laser pulses. The landscape map for each molecule consists of 6000 pixels, each pixel of which represents the maximum degree of alignment achieved by each set of control parameters. After examining ways to deal with the markedly different molecular parameters in a unified manner for suitably training a convolutional neural network (CNN) model, we train the CNN model by using 55 training sample molecules to predict the control landscape maps of 35 test sample molecules with reasonably high accuracy. As the predicted landscape maps provide a big picture of the alignment control, we show, for example, that the double pulse control scheme is especially effective for a molecule having a polarizability component that is much larger in value than the other two components.</description>

      <title>On the key kinetic interactions between NOx and unsaturated hydrocarbons: H-atom abstraction from C3-C7 alkynes and dienes by NO2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17277v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An adequate understanding of NOx interacting chemistry is a prerequisite for a smoother transition to carbon lean and carbon free fuels such as ammonia and hydrogen. In this regard, this study presents a comprehensive study on the H atom abstraction by NO2 from C3 to C7 alkynes and dienes forming 3 HNO2 isomers (i.e., TRANS HONO, HNO2, and CIS HONO), encompassing 8 hydrocarbons and 24 reactions. Through a combination of high level quantum chemistry computation, the rate coefficients for all studied reactions, over a temperature range from 298 to 2000 K, are computed based on Transition State Theory using the Master Equation System Solver program with considering unsymmetric tunneling corrections. Comprehensive analysis of branching ratios elucidates the diversity and similarities between different species, different HNO2 isomers, and different abstraction sites. Incorporating the calculated rate parameters into a recent chemistry model reveals the significant influences of this type of reaction on model performance, where the updated model is consistently more reactive for all the alkynes and dienes studied in predicting autoignition characteristics. Sensitivity and flux analyses are further conducted, through which the importance of H atom abstractions by NO2 is highlighted. With the updated rate parameters, the branching ratios in fuel consumption clearly shifts towards H atom abstractions by NO2 while away from H atom abstractions by OH. The obtained results emphasize the need for adequately representing these kinetics in new alkyne and diene chemistry models to be developed by using the rate parameters determined in this study, and call for future efforts to experimentally investigate NO2 blending effects on alkynes and dienes.</description>

      <title>Including photoexcitation explicitly in trajectory-based nonadiabatic dynamics at no cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Over the last decades, theoretical photochemistry has produced multiple techniques to simulate the nonadiabatic dynamics of molecules. Surprisingly, much less effort has been devoted to adequately describing the first step of a photochemical or photophysical process: photoexcitation. Here, we propose a formalism to include the effect of a laser pulse in trajectory-based nonadiabatic dynamics at the level of the initial conditions, with no additional cost. The promoted density approach (PDA) decouples the excitation from the nonadiabatic dynamics by defining a new set of initial conditions, which include an excitation time. PDA with surface hopping leads to nonadiabatic dynamics simulations in excellent agreement with quantum dynamics using an explicit laser pulse and highlights the strong impact of a laser pulse on the resulting photodynamics and the limits of the (sudden) vertical excitation. Combining PDA with trajectory-based nonadiabatic methods is possible for any arbitrary-sized molecules using a code provided in this work.</description>

      <title>1.5-Femtosecond Delay in Charge Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17402</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17402v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The transfer of population between two intersecting quantum states is the most fundamental dynamical event that governs a broad variety of processes in physics, chemistry, biology and material science. Whereas any two-state description implies that population leaving one state instantaneously appears in the other state, we show that coupling to additional states, present in all real-world systems, can cause a measurable delay in population transfer. Using attosecond spectroscopy supported by advanced quantum-chemical calculations, we measure a delay of 1.46$\pm$0.41 fs at a charge-transfer state crossing in CF$_3$I$^+$, where an electron hole moves from the fluorine atoms to iodine. Our measurements also fully resolve the other fundamental quantum-dynamical processes involved in the charge-transfer reaction: a vibrational rearrangement time of 9.38$\pm$0.21 fs (during which the vibrational wave packet travels to the state crossing) and a population-transfer time of 2.3-2.4 fs. Our experimental results and theoretical simulations show that delays in population transfer readily appear in otherwise-adiabatic reactions and are typically on the order of 1 fs for intersecting molecular valence states. These results have implications for many research areas, such as atomic and molecular physics, charge transfer or light harvesting.</description>

      <title>Molecular interaction volume model of mixing enthalpy for molten salt system: An integrated calorimetry-model case study of LaCl$_3$-(LiCl-KCl)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.16943v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Calorimetric determination of enthalpies of mixing ($\Delta$H$_{\rm mix}$) of multicomponent molten salts often employs empirical models that lack parameters with clear physical interpretation (e.g., coordination numbers, molar volumes, and pair potentials). Although such physics informed models are not always needed, a thermodynamic understanding of the relationships between excess energies of mixing and local to intermediate solvation structures is particularly important for pyrochemical separation, as is the case for lanthanides (Ln), which are common neutron poisons and critical industrial elements found in spent nuclear fuels. Here we implement the molecular interaction volume model (MIVM) to synthesize information from experimentally measured $\Delta$H$_{\rm mix}$ (using high temperature melt drop calorimetry) and the distribution of solvation structures from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations. This was demonstrated by a case study of molten salt system consisted of LaCl$_3$ mixing with a eutectic LiCl-KCl (58mol% to 42mol%) at 873 K and 1133 K. The parameters modelled from MIVM were used to extrapolate excess Gibbs energy ($\Delta$G$_{\rm mix}$), and compositional dependence of La$^{3+}$ activity in the LaCl$_3$-(LiCl-KCl) system. In contrast, by AIMD or polarizable ion model (PIM) simulations, a significant deviation regarding the predicted $\Delta$H$_{\rm mix}$ was seen if computed directly from the molecular dynamic trajectories. The integrated experimental and simulation data within the MIVM formalism are generalizable to a wide variety of molten salts and demonstrate a significant improvement over currently employed methods to study molten salts for nuclear and separations sciences.</description>

      <title>Reaction Coordinates are Optimal Channels of Energy Flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17086v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reaction coordinates (RCs) are the few essential coordinates of a protein that control its functional processes, such as allostery, enzymatic reaction, and conformational change. They are critical for understanding protein function and provide optimal enhanced sampling of protein conformational changes and states. Since the pioneering works in the late 1990s, identifying the correct and objectively provable RCs has been a central topic in molecular biophysics and chemical physics. This review summarizes the major advances in identifying RCs over the past 25 years, focusing on methods aimed at finding RCs that meet the rigorous committor criterion, widely accepted as the true RCs. Importantly, the newly developed physics-based energy flow theory and generalized work functional method provide a general and rigorous approach for identifying true RCs, revealing their physical nature as the optimal channels of energy flow in biomolecules.</description>

      <title>Frequency-Dependent Conductivity of Concentrated Electrolytes: A Stochastic Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.17427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.17427v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The response of ionic solutions to time-varying electric fields, quantified by a frequency-dependent conductivity, is essential in many electrochemical applications. Yet, it constitutes a challenging problem due to the combined effect of Coulombic interactions, hydrodynamics, and thermal fluctuations. Here, we study the frequency-dependent conductivity of ionic solutions using a stochastic density functional theory. In the limit of small concentrations, we recover the classical Debye and Falkenhagen (DF) result, predicting an increase in conductivity with field frequency. At higher concentrations, we use a modified Coulomb interaction potential that accounts for the hard-core repulsion between the ions, which was recently employed in the zero-frequency case. Consequently, we extend the DF result to concentrated electrolytes. We discuss experimental and numerical studies and the complexity of observing the DF effect in such setups.</description>

      <title>Equivalent circuit modeling of electron-hole recombination in semiconductor and mixed ionic-electronic conductor based devices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10477v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The understanding and optimization of solar energy conversion and light emitting devices can greatly benefit from equivalent circuit models describing their response. However, a general model of electron-hole recombination in semiconductors is currently missing. This study presents equivalent circuit models of radiative and non-radiative electron-hole recombination based on their linearized analytical treatment. These are integrated in a circuit model of complete devices that is equivalent to the linearized drift-diffusion equations in one dimension. The analysis of the model shows that, for most situations involving semiconductors without mobile ions, approximated models that do not account for local electrostatics are sufficient to describe the contribution of recombination to the device response. The influence of local electrostatics on non-radiative trap-mediated and Auger recombination becomes essential in mixed conducting devices, and it should be included explicitly in equivalent circuit models. Resistors used for traditional semiconductors are indeed a special case of the general model of non-radiative recombination, for which transistors gated by the local change in electrostatic potential implement a more accurate representation. For mixed conducting devices, such as halide perovskite solar cells, appropriate simplifications of the complete model provide analytical solutions describing the bulk and interfacial polarization effects that influence the small signal electrostatics, recombination currents and overall impedance. The resulting analysis is relevant to a wide range of materials and devices used for solar energy conversion as well as other optoelectronic and photo-electrochemical applications.</description>
