      <title>Optical modeling for the evaluation of HOWFSC on embedded processors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18660</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18660v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The correction of quasi-static wavefront errors within a coronagraphic optical system will be a key challenge to overcome in order to directly image exoplanets in reflected light. These quasi-static errors are caused by mid to high-order surface errors on the optical elements as a result of manufacturing processes. Using high-order wavefront sensing and control (HOWFSC) techniques that do not introduce non-common path aberrations, the quasi-static errors can be corrected within the desired region of interest designated as the dark hole. For the future Habitable Worlds Observatory (HWO), HOWFSC algorithms will be key to attaining the desired contrasts.
  To simulate the performance of HOWFSC with space rated processors, optical models for a 6 m class space-borne observatory and a coronagraph have been developed. Phenomena such as the Talbot effect and beamwalk are included in the simulations using combinations of ray-based modeling and end-to-end propagation techniques. After integrating the optical models with the embedded processors, simulations with realistic computation times can be performed to understand the computational hardware performance that will be needed to maintain the desired contrasts. Here, the details of the optical models are presented along with the HOWFSC methods utilized. Initial results of the HOWFSC methods are also included as a demonstration of how system drifts will degrade the contrast and require dark hole maintenance.</description>

      <title>Curved detectors for future X-ray astrophysics missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future X-ray astrophysics missions will survey large areas of the sky with unparalleled sensitivity, enabled by lightweight, high-resolution optics. These optics inherently produce curved focal surfaces with radii as small as 2 m, requiring a large area detector system that closely conforms to the curved focal surface. We have embarked on a project using a curved charge-coupled device (CCD) detector technology developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory to provide large-format, curved detectors for such missions, improving performance and simplifying design. We present the current status of this work, which aims to curve back-illuminated, large-format (5 cm x 4 cm) CCDs to 2.5-m radius and confirm X-ray performance. We detail the design of fixtures and the curving process, and present intial results on curving bare silicon samples and monitor devices and characterizing the surface geometric accuracy. The tests meet our accuracy requirement of &lt;5 $\mu$m RMS surface non-conformance for samples of similar thickness to the functional detectors. We finally show X-ray performance measurements of planar CCDs that will serve as a baseline to evaluate the curved detectors. The detectors exhibit low noise, good charge-transfer efficiency, and excellent, uniform spectroscopic performance, including in the important soft X-ray band.</description>

      <title>The space coronagraph optical bench (SCoOB): 4. vacuum performance of a high contrast imaging testbed</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18885v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB) is a high-contrast imaging testbed built to demonstrate starlight suppression techniques at visible wavelengths in a space-like vacuum environment. The testbed is designed to achieve ${&lt;}10^{-8}$ contrast from $3-10\lambda/D$ in a one-sided dark hole using a liquid crystal vector vortex waveplate and a 952-actuator Kilo-C deformable mirror (DM) from Boston Micromachines (BMC). We have recently expanded the testbed to include a field stop for mitigation of stray/scattered light, a precision-fabricated pinhole in the source simulator, a Minus K passive vibration isolation table for jitter reduction, and a low-noise vacuum-compatible CMOS sensor. We report the latest contrast performance achieved using implicit electric field conjugation (iEFC) at a vacuum of ${\sim}10^{-6}$ Torr and over a range of bandpasses with central wavelengths from 500 to 650nm and bandwidths (BW) from $\ll 1\%$ to 15\%. Our jitter in vacuum is $&lt;3\times10^{-3} \lambda/D$, and the best contrast performance to-date in a half-sided D-shaped dark hole is $2.2\times10^{-9}$ in a $\ll 1 \%$ BW, $4\times10^{-9}$ in a 2\% BW, and $2.5\times10^{-8}$ in a 15\% BW.</description>

      <title>The Space Coronagraph Optical Bench (SCoOB): 5. End-to-end simulations of polarization aberrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18886v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polarization aberrations originating from the telescope and high-contrast imaging instrument optics introduce polarization-dependent speckles and associated errors in the image plane, affecting the measured exoplanet signal. Understanding this effect is critical for future space-based high-contrast imaging instruments that aim to image the Earth analogs with 1e-10 raw contrast and characterize their atmospheres. We present end-to-end modeling of the polarization aberrations for a high-contrast imaging testbed, SCoOB. We use a vector vortex coronagraph (VVC) as the focal plane mask, incorporate polarization filtering, and estimate the peak contrast in the dark hole region. The dominant polarization aberrations in the system are retardance defocus and tilt due to the OAPs and fold mirrors. Although the mean contrast in the dark hole region remains unaffected by the polarization aberrations, we see brighter speckles limiting the contrast to 1e-9 at smaller inner working angles. We extend the simulations using the measured retardance maps for the VVC. We find that the mean contrast in SCoOB is more sensitive to the VVC and the QWP retardance errors than the polarization aberrations.</description>

      <title>Design and Implementation of a Scalable Correlator Based on ROACH2+GPU Cluster for Tianlai 96-Dual-Polarization Antenna Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19013v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The digital correlator is one of the most crucial data processing components of a radio telescope array. With the scale of radio interferometeric array growing, many efforts have been devoted to developing a cost-effective and scalable correlator in the field of radio astronomy. In this paper, a 192-input digital correlator with six CASPER ROACH2 boards and seven GPU servers has been deployed as the digital signal processing system for Tianlai cylinder pathfinder located in Hongliuxia observatory. The correlator consists of 192 input signals (96 dual-polarization), 125-MHz bandwidth, and full-Stokes output. The correlator inherits the advantages of the CASPER system, for example, low cost, high performance, modular scalability, and a heterogeneous computing architecture. With a rapidly deployable ROACH2 digital sampling system, a commercially expandable 10 Gigabit switching network system, and a flexible upgradable GPU computing system, the correlator forms a low-cost and easily-upgradable system, poised to support scalable large-scale interferometeric array in the future.</description>

      <title>Black Silicon BRDF and Polarization for Coronagraphic Pupil Masks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Future space observatories will likely have segmented primaries, causing diffraction effects that reduce coronagraph performance. Reflective binary pupil apodizer masks can mitigate these, with the metamaterial black silicon (BSi) showing promise as a strong absorber. To bring contrast ratios to the $10^-{10}$ level as needed to observe Earth-like exoplanets, feature sizes on these BSi masks will need to be less than $5$ microns when paired with MEMS (micro-electromechanical systems) deformable mirrors. As scalar diffraction cannot reliably model this feature size, we developed a Finite-Difference Time-Domain (FDTD) model of BSi masks using Meep software. We characterize the FDTD-derived polarization-dependent bidirectional reflectance distribution function of BSi and discuss the model's shortcomings.</description>

      <title>FiberPol-6D: Spectropolarimetric Integral Field mode for the SAAO 1.9 m Telescope using fibers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19124</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19124v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most optical spectropolarimeters built to date operate as long-slit or point-source instruments; they are inefficient for observations of extended objects such as galaxies and nebulae. 2D spectropolarimetry technique development is a major challenge in astronomical instrumentation. At the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO) FiberLab, we are developing a spectropolarimetry capable Integral Field front-end called FiberPol(-6D) for the existing SpUpNIC spectrograph on the SAAO 1.9 m telescope. SpUpNIC is a general purpose 2 arc-minute long-slit spectrograph with a grating suite covering the wavelength range from 350 to 1000 nm and at spectral resolutions between 500 and 6000. FiberPol generates 6D observational data: x-y spatial dimensions, wavelength, and the three linear Stokes parameters $I$, $q$ and $u$. Using a rotating half-wave plate and a Wollaston prism, FiberPol executes two-channel polarimetry, and each channel is fed to an array of 14 fibers, corresponding to a field of view of $10\times20~arcseconds^2$ sampled with 2.9 arcsecond diameter fiber cores. These fiber arrays are then rerouted to form a pseudo-slit input to SpUpNIC. FiberPol aims to achieve a polarimetric accuracy of 0.1 % per spectral resolution bin. Further, it can also function as a non-polarimetric integral-field unit. The instrument design has been completed and it is currently being assembled and characterized in the lab. It is scheduled for on-sky commissioning in the second half of 2024. In this paper, we present the scientific and technical goals of FiberPol, its overall design and initial results from the lab assembly and testing. FiberPol is a low cost technology demonstrator, and the entire system predominantly employs small size, commercial off-the-shelve optics and optomechanical components. It can be modified and replicated for use on any existing spectrograph, especially on bigger telescopes.</description>

      <title>Using 3.4-$\mu$m Variability towards White Dwarfs as a Signpost of Remnant Planetary Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18646v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Roughly 2% of white dwarfs harbor planetary debris disks detectable via infrared excesses, but only a few percent of these disks show a gaseous component, distinguished by their double-peaked emission at the near-infrared calcium triplet. Previous studies found most debris disks around white dwarfs are variable at 3.4 and 4.5 $\mu$m, but they analyzed only a few of the now 21 published disks showing calcium emission. To test if most published calcium emission disks exhibit large-amplitude stochastic variability in the near-infrared, we use light curves generated from the unWISE images at 3.4 $\mu$m that are corrected for proper motion to characterize the near-infrared variability of these disks against samples of disks without calcium emission, highly variable cataclysmic variables, and 3215 isolated white dwarfs. We find most calcium emission disks are extremely variable: 6/11 with sufficient signal-to-noise show high-amplitude variability in their 3.4-$\mu$m light curves. These results lend further credence to the notion that disks showing gaseous debris in emission are the most collisionally active. Under the assumption that 3.4-$\mu$m variability is characteristic of white dwarfs with dusty debris disks, we generate a catalog of 104 high-confidence near-infrared variable white dwarfs, 84 of which are published as variable for the first time. We do near-infrared spectroscopic follow-up of seven new candidate 3.4-$\mu$m variables, confirming at least one new remnant planetary system, and posit that empirical near-infrared variability can be a discovery engine for debris disks showing gaseous emission.</description>

      <title>Picometer Sensitive Prototype of the Optical Truss Interferometer for LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18705v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The optical truss interferometer (OTI) is a contingent subsystem proposed for the LISA telescopes to aid in the verification of a $1 \frac{\mathrm{pm}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}$ optical path length stability. Each telescope would be equipped with three pairs of compact fiber-coupled units, each forming an optical cavity with a baseline proportional to the telescope length at different points around the aperture. Employing a Pound-Drever-Hall approach to maintain a modulated laser field on resonance with each cavity, the dimensional stability of the telescope can be measured and verified. We have designed and developed prototype OTI units to demonstrate the capability of measuring stable structures, such as the LISA telescope, with a $1 \frac{\mathrm{pm}}{\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}}$ sensitivity using a set of freely mountable fiber-injected cavities. Aside from its initial motivation for the telescope, the OTI can also be readily integrated with other systems to aid in ground testing experiments. In this paper, we outline our experimental setup, measurement results, and analyses of the noise limitations.</description>

      <title>Bayesian inference: More than Bayes's theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bayesian inference gets its name from *Bayes's theorem*, expressing posterior probabilities for hypotheses about a data generating process as the (normalized) product of prior probabilities and a likelihood function. But Bayesian inference uses all of probability theory, not just Bayes's theorem. Many hypotheses of scientific interest are *composite hypotheses*, with the strength of evidence for the hypothesis dependent on knowledge about auxiliary factors, such as the values of nuisance parameters (e.g., uncertain background rates or calibration factors). Many important capabilities of Bayesian methods arise from use of the law of total probability, which instructs analysts to compute probabilities for composite hypotheses by *marginalization* over auxiliary factors. This tutorial targets relative newcomers to Bayesian inference, aiming to complement tutorials that focus on Bayes's theorem and how priors modulate likelihoods. The emphasis here is on marginalization over parameter spaces -- both how it is the foundation for important capabilities, and how it may motivate caution when parameter spaces are large. Topics covered include the difference between likelihood and probability, understanding the impact of priors beyond merely shifting the maximum likelihood estimate, and the role of marginalization in accounting for uncertainty in nuisance parameters, systematic error, and model misspecification.</description>

Abstract: In our research, we have developed a novel mechanism that allows for a significant reduction in the smallest sampling unit of digital image sensors (DIS) to as small as 1/16th of a pixel, through measuring the intra-pixel quantum efficiency for the first time and recomputing the image. Employing our method, the physical sampling resolution of DIS can be enhanced by 16 times. The method has undergone rigorous testing in real-world imaging scenarios.</description>

      <title>Capella: A Space-only High-frequency Radio VLBI Network Formed by a Constellation of Small Satellites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06482v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Very long baseline radio interferometry (VLBI) with ground-based observatories is limited by the size of Earth, the geographic distribution of antennas, and the transparency of the atmosphere. In this whitepaper, we present Capella, a tentative design of a space-only VLBI system. Using four small (&lt;500 kg) satellites in two orthogonal polar low-Earth orbit planes, and single-band heterodyne receivers operating at frequencies around 690 GHz, the interferometer is able to achieve angular resolutions of approximately 7 microarcsec. Within a total observing time of three days, a near-complete uv plane coverage can be reached. The technology for all key components required for Capella - radio telescope, receiver, sampler, recorder, frequency standard, positioning system, data downlink, and pointing control system - is already available, partially off-the-shelf. Making realistic assumptions, the science payload of each satellite has a mass of about 190 kg and consumes about 460 W of power. The data from the telescopes can be correlated on the ground using dedicated versions of existing Fourier transform (FX) software correlators. With the specifications assumed in this whitepaper, Capella will be able to address a range of science cases, including: photon rings around supermassive black holes; the acceleration and collimation zones of plasma jets emitted from the vicinity of supermassive black holes; the chemical composition of accretion flows into active galactic nuclei through observations of molecular absorption lines; mapping supermassive binary black holes; the magnetic activity of stars; and nova eruptions of symbiotic binary stars - and, like any substantially new observing technique, has the potential for unexpected discoveries.</description>

      <title>Shrinkage MMSE estimators of covariances beyond the zero-mean and stationary variance assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.07104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.07104v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We tackle covariance estimation in low-sample scenarios, employing a structured covariance matrix with shrinkage methods. These involve convexly combining a low-bias/high-variance empirical estimate with a biased regularization estimator, striking a bias-variance trade-off. Literature provides optimal settings of the regularization amount through risk minimization between the true covariance and its shrunk counterpart. Such estimators were derived for zero-mean statistics with i.i.d. diagonal regularization matrices accounting for the average sample variance solely. We extend these results to regularization matrices accounting for the sample variances both for centered and non-centered samples. In the latter case, the empirical estimate of the true mean is incorporated into our shrinkage estimators. Introducing confidence weights into the statistics also enhance estimator robustness against outliers. We compare our estimators to other shrinkage methods both on numerical simulations and on real data to solve a detection problem in astronomy.</description>

      <title>JAXbind: Bind any function to JAX</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08847v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: JAX is widely used in machine learning and scientific computing, the latter of which often relies on existing high-performance code that we would ideally like to incorporate into JAX. Reimplementing the existing code in JAX is often impractical and the existing interface in JAX for binding custom code either limits the user to a single Jacobian product or requires deep knowledge of JAX and its C++ backend for general Jacobian products. With JAXbind we drastically reduce the effort required to bind custom functions implemented in other programming languages with full support for Jacobian-vector products and vector-Jacobian products to JAX. Specifically, JAXbind provides an easy-to-use Python interface for defining custom, so-called JAX primitives. Via JAXbind, any function callable from Python can be exposed as a JAX primitive. JAXbind allows a user to interface the JAX function transformation engine with custom derivatives and batching rules, enabling all JAX transformations for the custom primitive.</description>

      <title>Polarimetry of $\gamma$-Rays Converting to $e^+e^-$ Pairs with Silicon-Pixel-Based Telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: There are serious prospects that the next $\gamma$-ray space mission could use a telescope based on silicon pixel detectors. I characterize the potential of such active targets for polarimetry with gamma-ray conversions to pairs and find it excellent both in terms of selection efficiency and of effective polarization asymmetry.</description>

      <title>Searching anomalies using nonlinear dimensionality reduction techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18148</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18148v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We have searched for anomalous events using 2,520 hours of archival observations from Murriyang, CSIRO's Parkes radio telescope. These observations were originally undertaken to search for pulsars. We used a machine learning algorithm based on ResNet and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) in order to identify parts of the data stream that potentially contain anomalous signals. Many of these anomalous events are radio frequency interference, which were subsequently filtered using multibeam information. We detected 202 anomalous events and provide their positions and event times. One of the events could potentially come from a white dwarf. Some of them may originate from stellar flares, lightning, or be true anomalies, which are currently of an unknown type.</description>

      <title>$P_{tail}^{\alpha}$: a high resolution gamma/hadron and composition discriminant variable for Water-Cherenkov Detector cosmic-ray observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.17217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.17217v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The precise and efficient identification of the nature of the primary cosmic rays on an event-by-event basis stands as a fundamental aspiration for any cosmic ray observatory. In particular, the detection and characterization of gamma ray events are challenged by their occurrence within an overwhelmingly greater flux of charged cosmic rays spanning several orders of magnitude. The intricacies of distinguishing between cosmic ray compositions and the inherent uncertainties associated with hadronic interactions present formidable challenges, which, if not properly addressed, can introduce significant sources of systematic errors. This work introduces a novel composition discriminant variable, $P_{tail}^{\alpha}$, which quantifies the number of Water Cherenkov Detectors with a signal well above the mean signal observed in WCDs located at an equivalent distance from the shower core, in events with approximately the same energy at the ground. This new event variable is then shown to be, in the reconstructed energy range $10\,{\rm TeV}$ to $1.6\,{\rm PeV}$, well correlated with the total number of muons that hit, in the same event, all the observatory stations located at a distance greater than $200\,{\rm m}$ from the shower core. The two variables should thus have similar efficiencies in the selection of high-purity gamma event samples and in the determination of the nature of charged cosmic ray events.</description>

      <title>Combining reference-star and angular differential imaging for high-contrast imaging of extended sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14444v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-contrast imaging (HCI) is a technique designed to observe faint signals near bright sources, such as exoplanets and circumstellar disks. The primary challenge in revealing the faint circumstellar signal near a star is the presence of quasi-static speckles, which can produce patterns on the science images that are as bright, or even brighter, than the signal of interest. Strategies such as angular differential imaging (ADI) or reference-star differential imaging (RDI) aim to provide a means of removing the quasi-static speckles in post-processing. In this paper, we present and discuss the adaptation of state-of-the-art algorithms, initially designed for ADI, to jointly leverage angular and reference-star differential imaging (ARDI) for direct high-contrast imaging of circumstellar disks. Using a collection of high-contrast imaging data sets, we assess the performance of ARDI in comparison to ADI and RDI based on iterative principal component analysis (IPCA). These diverse data sets are acquired under various observing conditions and include the injection of synthetic disk models at various contrast levels. Our results demonstrate that ARDI with IPCA improves the quality of recovered disk images and the sensitivity to planets embedded in disks, compared to ADI or RDI individually. This enhancement is particularly pronounced when dealing with extended sources exhibiting highly ambiguous structures that cannot be accurately retrieved using ADI alone, and when the quality of the reference frames is suboptimal, leading to an underperformance of RDI. We finally apply our method to a sample of real observations of protoplanetary disks taken in star-hopping mode, and propose to revisit the protoplanetary claims associated with these disks.</description>
