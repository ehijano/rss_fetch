      <title>Spatial Encoding of Flow Spaces for Intelligent SDN Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16485v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient encoding of network flow spaces while preserving spatial locality is essential for intelligent Software-Defined Networking (SDN) applications, particularly those employing reinforcement learning (RL) methods in a reactive manner. In this work, we introduce a spatially aware Bloom Filter-based approach to encode IP flow pairs, leveraging their inherent geographical locality. Through controlled experiments using IoT traffic data, we demonstrate that Bloom Filters effectively preserve spatial relationships among flows. Our findings show that Bloom Filters degrade gracefully, maintaining predictable spatial correlations critical for RL state representation. We integrate this encoding into a DQN-based eviction strategy for reactive SDN forwarding. Experiments show that Bloom Filter-encoded, spatially aware flow representation enables up to 7% and 8% reduction in normalized miss rate over LRU and LFU, respectively, across 10 hours of traffic, demonstrating potential for low-latency applications. This experiment justifies the usefulness of preserving spatial correlation by encoding the flow space into a manageable size, opening a novel research direction for RL-based SDN applications.</description>

      <title>Kalman Filtering-Assisted Node Deployment for Distributed OTFS-ISAC: A Geometry-Aware Design for the Joint Sensing and Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a key enabler for next-generation wireless networks, offering spectrum efficiency and reduced hardware complexity. While monostatic ISAC has been well studied, its limited spatial diversity reduces reliability in high-mobility scenarios. Distributed ISAC alleviates this via cooperative nodes, but conventional OFDM-based designs remain vulnerable to Doppler shifts and multipath fading. Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation has recently emerged as a resilient alternative, as its delay-Doppler domain representation enables robust communication and high-resolution sensing. Motivated by this, we extend OTFS to distributed ISAC and address the underexplored problem of spatial node deployment. We propose a triangulation-based framework that leverages spatial diversity to improve target localization, velocity estimation, and communication rates, and analytically characterize the role of deployment geometry in minimizing estimation error. Furthermore, we integrate Kalman filtering (KF) into distributed OTFS-ISAC to enhance tracking of moving targets, and design novel algorithms for active sensing, passive sensing, and joint sensing-communication. Closed-form expressions are derived for localization error under general topologies, and a near-optimal deployment strategy is identified by aligning receivers along orthogonal axes. Numerical evaluations show significant reductions in localization error and bit error rate (BER), while capturing the trade-offs between sensing accuracy and communication reliability. These results highlight the potential of KF-assisted node placement in distributed OTFS-ISAC for reliable, high-performance operation in dynamic wireless environments.</description>

      <title>BeNNS: A Surrogate Model for Hybrid Online-Offline Evolution of SFC Embedding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Service Function Chains (SFCs) enable programmatic control of the functions and services in a computer network. By leveraging Software Defined Networking to control the links between virtualised network functions, SFCs provide a scalable approach to dealing with the increased pressures on network operation and management. Unfortunately, the challenge of embedding SFCs onto the underlying physical network and compute infrastructure is an NP-hard problem. Genetic Algorithms (GAs) have been used to address this issue, but they require significant time to evaluate solution quality (fitness) \textit{online}, with most solutions instead adopting \textit{offline} simulations or analytical evaluations.
  To enable online use of GAs in solving the SFC embedding problem, we introduce a hybrid online-offline approach to evaluate generated solutions. At the core of this is BeNNS--a topology, traffic, and SFC-embedding agnostic surrogate model that approximates fitness. We evaluate our approach across six experiments, varying available resources and traffic loads. Our results demonstrate that our approach is capable of exploring thousands of potential configurations and generating deployable solutions in 36.8 minutes on average, compared to online-only approaches, which take 17.9 hours on average to explore tens of solutions, which do not converge on an optimal solution.</description>

      <title>Analysis of an Architecture for Integrated Sensing and Communication in 5G OpenRAN</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper analyzes the functional requirements and architectural considerations for Integrated Sensing and Communication ( ISAC) in a 5G Open Radio Access Network (OpenRAN) environment, with emphasis on secure and modular deployment. Focusing on a mono-static, half-duplex sensing approach, it evaluates radar setup options, signal types, and processing placement within the Radio Access Network ( RAN), considering performance and security implications. The proposed architecture minimizes hardware modifications by leveraging sniffer Radio Units (RU s) and existing OpenRAN fronthaul interfaces, while protecting sensitive In-phase and Quadrature (I/Q) data and control traffic against potential attacks. Security threats, such as passive sensing, spoofing, and privacy violations, are mapped to mitigation strategies within the OpenRAN framework. The result is a deployment blueprint applicable to both Public Land Mobile Networks ( PLMNs) and Non-Public Networks (NPNs), supporting future 6G ISAC capabilities in a standards-compliant manner.</description>

      <title>System Relaxation for Interpretable and Adaptive Network Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prevailing network control strategies, which rely on static shortest-path logic, suffer from catastrophic "stress concentration" on critical nodes. This paper introduces the System Relaxation Algorithm (SRA), a new control paradigm inspired by physical relaxation that guides a network toward an emergent equilibrium of load balance. SRA is an interpretable, 'white-box' dynamical system whose behavior is profoundly topology-dependent: in heterogeneous networks, it acts as a proactive performance optimizer, reducing peak centrality by over 80\% and increasing high-load throughput by more than 45\%; in homogeneous topologies, its objective intelligently shifts to resilience enhancement. We rigorously prove its global convergence and practical stability using the theory of non-smooth dynamical systems, establishing a predictable paradigm for network governance that intelligently trades off performance and resilience.</description>

      <title>Impact of Packetization on Network Calculus Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17028v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For packet-switched networks, when the packetization effect is overlooked, network calculus analysis can produce faulty results. To exemplify, network calculus analysis is applied in this paper to two basic systems that are fundamental or default settings in Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) and Deterministic Networking (DetNet). Through counterexamples, it is revealed that for the two fundamental settings, some widely adopted, network calculus-based service characterization results, known as service curves, which ignore packetization, are faulty. In addition, for performance bounds derived from the faulty service curves, it is shown that the validity of the bounds can be arguable. In particular, the output bound, backlog bound and concatenation service curve results are shown to be also faulty: counterexamples can be constructed. By factoring the packetization effect directly into the service models, corrected service curves and performance bounds are derived for the two basic systems. These results remind that special care is needed when applying network calculus analysis to packet-switched networks.</description>

      <title>Optimizing Split Federated Learning with Unstable Client Participation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17398v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To enable training of large artificial intelligence (AI) models at the network edge, split federated learning (SFL) has emerged as a promising approach by distributing computation between edge devices and a server. However, while unstable network environments pose significant challenges to SFL, prior schemes often overlook such an effect by assuming perfect client participation, rendering them impractical for real-world scenarios. In this work, we develop an optimization framework for SFL with unstable client participation. We theoretically derive the first convergence upper bound for SFL with unstable client participation by considering activation uploading failures, gradient downloading failures, and model aggregation failures. Based on the theoretical results, we formulate a joint optimization problem for client sampling and model splitting to minimize the upper bound. We then develop an efficient solution approach to solve the problem optimally. Extensive simulations on EMNIST and CIFAR-10 demonstrate the superiority of our proposed framework compared to existing benchmarks.</description>

      <title>GLo-MAPPO: A Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization for Energy Efficiency in UAV-Assisted LoRa Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Long Range (LoRa) based low-power wide area networks (LPWANs) are crucial for enabling next-generation IoT (NG-IoT) applications in 5G/6G ecosystems due to their long-range, low-power, and low-cost characteristics. However, achieving high energy efficiency in such networks remains a critical challenge, particularly in large-scale or dynamically changing environments. Traditional terrestrial LoRa deployments often suffer from coverage gaps and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation losses, while satellite-based IoT solutions consume excessive energy and introduce high latency, limiting their suitability for energy-constrained and delay-sensitive applications. To address these limitations, we propose a novel architecture using multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as flying LoRa gateways to dynamically collect data from ground-based LoRa end devices. Our approach aims to maximize the system's weighted global energy efficiency by jointly optimizing spreading factors, transmission powers, UAV trajectories, and end-device associations. Additionally, we formulate this complex optimization problem as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP) and propose green LoRa multi-agent proximal policy optimization (GLo-MAPPO), a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework based on centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE). Simulation results show that GLo-MAPPO significantly outperforms benchmark algorithms, achieving energy efficiency improvements of 71.25%, 18.56%, 67.00%, 59.73%, and 49.95% for networks with 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 LoRa end devices, respectively.</description>

      <title>Building Transparency in Deep Learning-Powered Network Traffic Classification: A Traffic-Explainer Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in deep learning have significantly enhanced the performance and efficiency of traffic classification in networking systems. However, the lack of transparency in their predictions and decision-making has made network operators reluctant to deploy DL-based solutions in production networks. To tackle this challenge, we propose Traffic-Explainer, a model-agnostic and input-perturbation-based traffic explanation framework. By maximizing the mutual information between predictions on original traffic sequences and their masked counterparts, Traffic-Explainer automatically uncovers the most influential features driving model predictions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Traffic-Explainer improves upon existing explanation methods by approximately 42%. Practically, we further apply Traffic-Explainer to identify influential features and demonstrate its enhanced transparency across three critical tasks: application classification, traffic localization, and network cartography. For the first two tasks, Traffic-Explainer identifies the most decisive bytes that drive predicted traffic applications and locations, uncovering potential vulnerabilities and privacy concerns. In network cartography, Traffic-Explainer identifies submarine cables that drive the mapping of traceroute to physical path, enabling a traceroute-informed risk analysis.</description>

      <title>Detection of Misreporting Attacks on Software-Defined Immersive Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.18040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ability to centrally control network infrastructure using a programmable middleware has made Software-Defined Networking (SDN) ideal for emerging applications, such as immersive environments. However, such flexibility introduces new vulnerabilities, such as switch misreporting led load imbalance, which in turn make such immersive environment vulnerable to severe quality degradation. In this paper, we present a hybrid machine learning (ML)-based network anomaly detection framework that identifies such stealthy misreporting by capturing temporal inconsistencies in switch-reported loads, and thereby counter potentially catastrophic quality degradation of hosted immersive application. The detection system combines unsupervised anomaly scoring with supervised classification to robustly distinguish malicious behavior. Data collected from a realistic testbed deployment under both benign and adversarial conditions is used to train and evaluate the model. Experimental results show that the framework achieves high recall in detecting misreporting behavior, making it effective for early and reliable detection in SDN environments.</description>

      <title>B5GRoam: A Zero Trust Framework for Secure and Efficient On-Chain B5G Roaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16390</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16390v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Roaming settlement in 5G and beyond networks demands secure, efficient, and trustworthy mechanisms for billing reconciliation between mobile operators. While blockchain promises decentralization and auditability, existing solutions suffer from critical limitations-namely, data privacy risks, assumptions of mutual trust, and scalability bottlenecks. To address these challenges, we present B5GRoam, a novel on-chain and zero-trust framework for secure, privacy-preserving, and scalable roaming settlements. B5GRoam introduces a cryptographically verifiable call detail record (CDR) submission protocol, enabling smart contracts to authenticate usage claims without exposing sensitive data. To preserve privacy, we integrate non-interactive zero-knowledge proofs (zkSNARKs) that allow on-chain verification of roaming activity without revealing user or network details. To meet the high-throughput demands of 5G environments, B5GRoam leverages Layer 2 zk-Rollups, significantly reducing gas costs while maintaining the security guarantees of Layer 1. Experimental results demonstrate a throughput of over 7,200 tx/s with strong privacy and substantial cost savings. By eliminating intermediaries and enhancing verifiability, B5GRoam offers a practical and secure foundation for decentralized roaming in future mobile networks.</description>

      <title>A Comprehensive Protocol Stack for Quantum Networks with a Global Entanglement Module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16817v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The development of large-scale quantum networks requires not only advances in physical-layer technologies but also a comprehensive protocol stack that integrates communication, control, and resource management across all layers. We present the first such protocol stack, which introduces a Global Entanglement Module (GEM) that maintains a consistent, network-wide view of entanglement resources through distributed synchronization strategies. By enabling real-time adaptive execution of entanglement distribution plans, GEM bridges the gap between static planning and dynamic operation. The stack naturally supports pre-distributed entanglement, purification, and multi-partite state generation, making it applicable to a broad range of quantum networking applications. We design and evaluate multiple adaptive heuristics for real-time execution and show that a lightweight scoring-based strategy consistently achieves the best performance, improving entanglement generation rates by about 20% over a globally optimal but non-adaptive fixed-tree baseline and achieving more than a two-fold improvement relative to recent connectionless approaches. Across all scenarios-including predistribution and fidelity analysis-GEM consistently enables lower latency and robust operation. These results establish a practical pathway toward scalable, adaptive quantum internet systems.</description>

      <title>Task-Oriented Communications for 3D Scene Representation: Balancing Timeliness and Fidelity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17282</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17282v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real-time Three-dimensional (3D) scene representation is a foundational element that supports a broad spectrum of cutting-edge applications, including digital manufacturing, Virtual, Augmented, and Mixed Reality (VR/AR/MR), and the emerging metaverse. Despite advancements in real-time communication and computing, achieving a balance between timeliness and fidelity in 3D scene representation remains a challenge. This work investigates a wireless network where multiple homogeneous mobile robots, equipped with cameras, capture an environment and transmit images to an edge server over channels for 3D representation. We propose a contextual-bandit Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) framework incorporating both Age of Information (AoI) and semantic information to optimize image selection for representation, balancing data freshness and representation quality. Two policies -- the $\omega$-threshold and $\omega$-wait policies -- together with two benchmark methods are evaluated, timeliness embedding and weighted sum, on standard datasets and baseline 3D scene representation models. Experimental results demonstrate improved representation fidelity while maintaining low latency, offering insight into the model's decision-making process. This work advances real-time 3D scene representation by optimizing the trade-off between timeliness and fidelity in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>BiLCNet : BiLSTM-Conformer Network for Encrypted Traffic Classification with 5G SA Physical Channel Records</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.17495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient traffic classification is vital for wireless network management, especially under encrypted payloads and dynamic application behavior, where traditional methods such as port-based identification and deep packet inspection (DPI) are increasingly inadequate. This work explores the feasibility of using physical channel data collected from the air interface of 5G Standalone (SA) networks for traffic sensing. We develop a preprocessing pipeline to transform raw channel records into structured representations with customized feature engineering to enhance downstream classification performance. To jointly capture temporal dependencies and both local and global structural patterns inherent in physical channel records, we propose a novel hybrid architecture: BiLSTM-Conformer Network (BiLCNet), which integrates the sequential modeling capability of Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (BiLSTM) with the spatial feature extraction strength of Conformer blocks. Evaluated on a noise-limited 5G SA dataset, our model achieves a classification accuracy of 93.9%, outperforming a series of conventional machine learning and deep learning algorithms. Furthermore, we demonstrate its generalization ability under zero-shot transfer settings, validating its robustness across traffic categories and varying environmental conditions.</description>

Abstract: Translating configurations between different network devices is a common yet challenging task in modern network operations. This challenge arises in typical scenarios such as replacing obsolete hardware and adapting configurations to emerging paradigms like Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). Engineers need to thoroughly understand both source and target configuration models, which requires considerable effort due to the complexity and evolving nature of these specifications. To promote automation in network configuration translation, we propose INTA, an intent-based translation framework that leverages Large Language Model (LLM) agents. The key idea of INTA is to use configuration intent as an intermediate representation for translation. It first employs LLMs to decompose configuration files and extract fine-grained intents for each configuration fragment. These intents are then used to retrieve relevant manuals of the target device. Guided by a syntax checker, INTA incrementally generates target configurations. The translated configurations are further verified and refined for semantic consistency. We implement INTA and evaluate it on real-world configuration datasets from the industry. Our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods in translation accuracy and exhibits strong generalizability. INTA achieves an accuracy of 98.15% in terms of both syntactic and view correctness, and a command recall rate of 84.72% for the target configuration. The semantic consistency report of the translated configuration further demonstrates its practical value in real-world network operations.</description>

      <title>RIDAS: A Multi-Agent Framework for AI-RAN with Representation- and Intention-Driven Agents</title>

Abstract: Sixth generation (6G) networks demand tight integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into radio access networks (RANs) to meet stringent quality of service (QoS) and resource efficiency requirements. Existing solutions struggle to bridge the gap between high level user intents and the low level, parameterized configurations required for optimal performance. To address this challenge, we propose RIDAS, a multi agent framework composed of representation driven agents (RDAs) and an intention driven agent (IDA). RDAs expose open interface with tunable control parameters (rank and quantization bits, enabling explicit trade) offs between distortion and transmission rate. The IDA employs a two stage planning scheme (bandwidth pre allocation and reallocation) driven by a large language model (LLM) to map user intents and system state into optimal RDA configurations. Experiments demonstrate that RIDAS supports 36.47% more users than WirelessAgent under equivalent QoS constraints. These results validate ability of RIDAS to capture user intent and allocate resources more efficiently in AI RAN environments.</description>

      <title>All-to-all Routing on Digraph Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.10537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.10537v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss an open problem and its converse first posed by Dougherty and Faber in [3], "Network routing on regular directed graphs from spanning factorizations." Does every vertex transitive digraph have a spanning 1=factorization? We show relationships between various properties a regular digraph might have: vertex transitivity, left or right cancellation, tree-like or neighborhood preserving spanning factorizations.</description>
