      <title>Local Baryon Number at the LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06341v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The minimal theory in which baryon number is spontaneously broken at the low scale predicts new fermions, one of which is a dark matter candidate, from gauge anomaly cancellation. We discuss the production mechanisms and decays of these new fermions, which include channels with multi-leptons, and channels with long-lived charged fermions that can give rise to exotic signatures with 'kinked' tracks at the Large Hadron Collider. We evaluate the contraints on the theory from current LHC searches and measurements, and briefly comment on the excess in top pair production at threshold recently reported by CMS. We also discuss predictions for the $h \to \gamma Z_B$ decay, where $h$ is the SM-like Higgs and $Z_B$ is the new gauge boson associated with baryon number.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Standard Model contributions to dipole moments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06345</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06345v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal of this work is to provide a pedagogical introduction to dipole moments and dipole transitions in theories beyond the Standard Model, with a focus on the lepton sector. We emphasize the exceptional sensitivity of dipole observables to new physics, analyzing the most sensitive processes, such as the muon anomalous magnetic moment, the electric dipole moment of the electron, and the branching ratio $\text{BR}(\mu \to e \gamma)$. This review is intended for PhD students, early-career researchers, and anyone entering the field for the first time. It does not aim to provide a complete overview of all models in the literature, but rather to serve as an accessible guide, using simple and representative examples from the most well-studied extensions of the Standard Model.</description>

      <title>Probing light neutralinos from pair-produced sleptons with displaced vertices at the high-luminosity LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study light neutralinos ($\tilde \chi_1^0$) with masses ranging from 10 GeV to several hundred GeV within the framework of R-parity-violating (RPV) supersymmetry. These light neutralinos can be long-lived, decaying with a macroscopic displacement (order cm) inside the LHC main detectors. Complementing previous works on the subject, here we focus on their production through the electroweak pair production of left-chiral sleptons ($\tilde e_{L}$), with the signal process $pp\to \tilde e^+_{L} \tilde e^-_{L} \to e^+ \tilde \chi_1^0 e^- \tilde \chi_1^0$. In contrast to the previous study with a singly produced slepton, where the RPV coupling $\lambda'_{111}$ induces both the production and decay of the light neutralino, in our scenario the production proceeds through Drell-Yan-like processes that are essentially independent of RPV couplings. Correspondingly, we implement a displaced-vertex search strategy for which our numerical analysis shows that the high-luminosity LHC can probe $\lambda'_{111}$ values up to three orders of magnitude smaller, and neutralino masses up to about four times larger than those accesible in the previously studied single-slepton production scenario.</description>

      <title>Electroweak Triplet Scalar Contribution to $SO(10)$ Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06391v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that electroweak triplet scalar can significantly impact baryogenesis via leptogenesis in concrete and predictive $SO(10)$ GUTs, even when light neutrino masses arise predominantly from the type-I seesaw mechanism. This is illustrated within a minimal renormalisable $SO(10)$ model with $\mathbf{10}$ and $\overline{\mathbf{126}}$ scalars in the Yukawa sector and a global Peccei-Quinn-like symmetry. The quark-lepton unification and the flavour structure of the fundamental Yukawa couplings enforce type-I dominance in the light neutrino masses, also suppressing the triplet-induced CP asymmetries in the right-handed neutrino decays. However, the triplet's own decays introduce a new CP-violating source, which can enhance or suppress the total baryon asymmetry. For triplet mass near the right-handed neutrino mass scale, this contribution can dominate, making it essential in assessing the viability of $SO(10)$ leptogenesis scenarios.</description>

      <title>RGE solver for the complete dim-7 SMEFT interactions and its application to $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an automatic renormalization group equations (RGEs) solver, D7RGESolver, designed for the precise numerical solution of one-loop RGEs of dimension-7 (dim-7) operators within the standard model effective field theory (SMEFT). This tool is capable of calculating the RGE effects of dim-5 and dim-7 SMEFT operators between any two scales above the electroweak scale. We take the nuclear neutrinoless double beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay process as an example to appreciate the importance of the running effects in phenomenological studies. Our analysis demonstrates that $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay can constrain nearly all dim-7 SMEFT operators involving first-generation leptons that violate lepton number by two units, after accounting for RGE effects. Specifically, we have placed meaningful constraints on 55 dim-7 Wilson coefficients, compared to only 10 from a simple tree-level analysis. Certain operators exhibit much stricter constraints when RGE effects are included, especially for the operators that mix with neutrino mass operators. We provide a complete code documentation for D7RGESolver, along with examples of its usage and interfacing with external automated codes for calculating $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay. The D7RGESolver code is available at: \href{https://github.com/ZhaoXiang210/D7RGESolver}{Github: D7RGESolver}</description>

      <title>Using neutron stars to probe dark matter charged under a $L_\mu-L_\tau$ symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06506</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06506v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinetic heating of old cold neutron stars, via the scattering of dark matter with matter in the star, provides a promising way to probe the nature of dark matter interactions. We consider a dark matter candidate that is a Standard Model singlet Dirac fermion, charged under a $U(1)_{L_\mu-L_\tau}$ symmetry. Such dark matter interacts with quarks and electrons only via loop-induced couplings, and hence is weakly constrained by direct-detection experiments and cosmic-microwave background observations. However, tree-level interactions with muons enable the dark matter to interact efficiently with the relativistic muon component of a neutron star, heating the star substantially. Using a fully relativistic approach for dark matter capture in the star, we show that observations of old cold neutron stars can probe a substantial, yet unexplored, region of parameter space for dark matter masses in the range 100 MeV - 100 GeV.</description>

      <title>Implementing Errors on Errors: Bayesian vs Frequentist</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06521v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When combining apparently inconsistent experimental results, one often implements errors on errors. The Particle Data Group's phenomenological prescription offers a practical solution but lacks a firm theoretical foundation. To address this, D'Agostini and Cowan have proposed Bayesian and frequentist approaches, respectively, both introducing gamma-distributed auxiliary variables to model uncertainty in quoted errors. In this Letter, we show that these two formulations admit a parameter-by-parameter correspondence, and are structurally equivalent. This identification clarifies how Bayesian prior choices can be interpreted in terms of frequentist sampling assumptions, providing a unified probabilistic framework for modeling uncertainty in quoted variances.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Uncertainty Principle. New Bounds and Trends</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle is one of the fundamental pillars of quantum mechanics and quantum field theory. It is normally introduced by postulating the commutation relations $[\hat{x}^i, \hat{p}^j] = i\hbar \delta^{ij}$. However, as suggested by some quantum gravity models and string theory, this basic principle no longer holds true in the presence of a minimal length, possible the Plank length, and modifications of the commutation have been proposed i.e., of the form $[\hat{x}^\mu, \hat{p}^\nu ] = -i\hbar(1 + \beta_0 \, \hat{p}^2/\Lambda^2 )\eta^{\mu\nu}$(plus possible additional terms). In this work we will consider the previous modified uncertainty principle in terms of an effective field theory, comment upon some theoretical subtleties that are often overlooked in the literature, and constrain, for the first time, the $\Lambda$ scale with the Compton high-energy experimental data. Our findings suggest that high-energy experiments are potentially sensitive to these corrections and could serve as an effective framework for probing possible violations of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle</description>

      <title>Six-dimensional light-front Wigner distributions of the proton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06615</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06615v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate six-dimensional quark Wigner distributions of the proton in a light-front quark spectator-diquark model. Benefiting from the light-front boost-invariant longitudinal variable $\tilde{z}$, these light-front Wigner distributions provide complete information of parton distribution in the phase space and the correlation with spins. At the leading twist, one can define 16 independent distribution functions in according to different combinations of quark and proton polarizations. Numerical results of all these Wigner distributions are presented, unraveling rich structures of the proton, which may potentially provide new observables to be explored at future experiments.</description>

      <title>Approximate Minimal SU(5), Several Fundamental Scales, Fluctuating Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06716v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Having shortly reviewed our idea of the grand unified SU(5) being only exact in a classical limit, in a truly existing lattice, an ontological lattice, we go over to putting a series of different physical energy scales such the approximate unification scale for the SU(5)(without any SUSY), the Planck scale, and e.g. the scale of see-saw neutrino masses into a certain plot showing the energy scales on a straight line. This straight line of this plot supposed to result from such an ontological lattice, that fluctuates in link size a and lattice density in a very strong way according to a log normal distribution. The point is that different energy scales result from the link size of the lattice to different powers, like the averages a to the n th , where the power n depends on the type of scale considered. Since the n th root of the average of the n th power of the link size in the fluctuating lattice is very strongly dependent on the power n, because of very huge fluctuations, the different types of physical energy scales can get very different. With a Galton i.e. log normal distribution of the link size the various energy scales have their logarithms fall into a nice straight line versus the power of the link size, on which they depend. Our model gives a surprisingly good number for the small deviations of the experimental electron-and muon-anomalous magnetic moment from the pure Standard Model value.</description>

      <title>Flavor-Dependent Dynamical Spin-Orbit Coupling in Light-Front Holographic QCD: A New Approach to Baryon Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a novel extension of Light-Front Holographic Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) to study the effects of spin-orbit coupling on the baryon spectrum by introducing a flavor-dependent dynamical spin-orbit potential. This potential, modulated by the holographic coordinate and quark flavor, accounts for the mass hierarchy of quarks and the nonperturbative dynamics of confinement. By incorporating an exponentially decaying coupling that varies with the confinement scale, we capture the interplay between short-distance and long-distance spin-orbit interactions, particularly for heavy-light baryons. An optional coupling to holographic glueball fields further enriches the model, introducing nonperturbative QCD effects. The resulting modified light-front wave equation predicts flavor-dependent mass splittings and Regge trajectories, offering improved descriptions of both light and heavy baryon spectra. We discuss the implementation, parameter fitting, and testable predictions for experimental validation, particularly for heavy baryons observed at LHCb and Belle II. This approach bridges light and heavy quark dynamics, advancing the holographic modeling of baryon spectroscopy.</description>

      <title>Pseudoscalar Meson Parton Distributions within Gauge Invariant Nonlocal Chiral Quark Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06726v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the gluon distributions for the kaon and pion, as well as the improvement of the valence-quark distributions, in the framework of the gauge-invariant nonlocal chiral quark model (NL$\chi$QM), where the momentum dependence is taken into account. We then compute the gluon distributions for the kaon and pion that are dynamically generated from the splitting functions in the DGLAP QCD evolution. In a comparison with the recent lattice QCD and JAM global analysis results, it is found that the results for the pion gluon distributions at $Q =$ 2 GeV, which is set based on the lattice QCD, have a good agreement with the recent lattice QCD data, which is followed by the up valence-quark distribution of the pion results at $Q =$ 5.2 GeV in comparison with the reanalysis experimental data. Our prediction on the kaon gluon distributions at $Q =$ 2 GeV is consistent with the recent lattice QCD calculation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06734v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The IceCube Upgrade will provide unprecedented sensitivity to dark matter particles annihilating in the core of the Sun. For dark matter candidates with spin-dependent couplings to nuclei and that annihilate significantly to tau leptons or neutrinos, we find that the IceCube Upgrade will be capable of testing parameter space that is beyond the reach of existing direct detection experiments. After calculating the sensitivity of the IceCube Upgrade to dark matter annihilation in the Sun, we explore dark matter models that could be tested by this experiment, identifying two classes of scenarios as promising targets for such searches.</description>

      <title>Hadroproduction Data Support Tetraquark Hypothesis for $\chi_{c1} (3872)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06910v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the recently proposed tetraquark hypothesis for the nature of the $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ results in a formalism for inclusive production rates that has no unknown parameters. We employ this formalism to compute hadroproduction rates of $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ at the Large Hadron Collider, which agree with measured prompt and nonprompt cross sections. Thus we find that the tetraquark hypothesis for $\chi_{c1}(3872)$ is well supported by hadroproduction data.</description>

      <title>One-loop corrections to the neutrino in the N-B-LSSM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06970v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study one-loop corrections to the neutrino mass matrix in the N-B-LSSM. We obtain the N-B-LSSM from the $U(1)$ extension of the minimal supersymmetric standard model(MSSM). By adding three generation right-handed neutrino superfields and three Higgs singlets, the model generates tiny neutrino masses at the tree level through the first type seesaw mechanism. However, one-loop corrections are essential for understanding neutrino masses and mixing angles. We calculate the neutrino mass variance and mixing angle from both normal order neutrino mass spectrum and inverse order neutrino mass spectrum. This study provides new theoretical support for exploring the mechanism of neutrino mass generation in the supersymmetric model and provides clues for exploring new physics beyond the Standard Model (SM).</description>

      <title>A $p_T$-ratio observable for studies of intrinsic transverse momentum of partons from Drell-Yan $p_T$ spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06973v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The determination of the intrinsic transverse momentum distribution of partons is central both for applications of parton shower Monte Carlo generators and for QCD studies of transverse momentum dependent (TMD) parton densities. Valuable information on this distribution is provided by experimental measurements of Drell-Yan transverse momentum $p_T$, in the region of low transverse momenta, with fine binning in $p_T$. However, such fine-binning measurements are challenging, as they require an extremely delicate control of systematic uncertainties. We suggest a $p_T$ observable based on measuring ratios between cross sections of suitably defined low-$p_T$ and high-$p_T$ regions. This observable does not rely on any dedicated partition of bins and has lower systematic uncertainties, and is shown to provide a good sensitivity to the intrinsic transverse momentum.</description>

      <title>Instability of quantum fluctuation around classical nonlinear massive wave solution in Higgs potential and particle creations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the dynamics of the quantum fluctuation around the nonlinear massive wave solution in the Higgs potential. In particular, we analyze the stability and instability of the mode function. Using the stability condition for Hill's equation, we obtain the instability region of the mode function in the quantum fluctuation as the function of the parameters in the mode equation. We show that the two types of the instabilities of the system in the particle number can be understood by the Floquet's exponents in the instability parameter region. The analysis will be useful to understand the dynamics of the quantum field theory around the nonlinear massive wave solution when the classical background slightly deviates from the constant background during the middle stage of the phase transition.</description>

      <title>$\phi$ meson properties in dense resonance matter at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The effective mass and decay width of the $\phi$ meson in the isospin asymmetric hot and dense resonance matter are studied using the effective Lagrangian framework considering the $\phi K \bar K $ interactions at one-loop level. In addition to spin$-1/2$ octet baryons, we consider the effect of resonances $\Delta^{++,+,0,-}, \Sigma^{*\pm,0},\Xi^{*0,-}, \Omega^{-}$, on the properties of $\phi$ meson. The in-medium effects on the $\phi$ meson properties are simulated through the effective masses of kaons and antikaons computed using the chiral SU(3) hadronic mean field model in the presence of resonance baryons. The loop integral appearing in the computation of $\phi$ meson self energies is regularized using the dipole form factor with a cutoff parameter. The presence of resonance baryons within the medium at finite temperature is observed to significantly modify the effective mass and decay width of $\phi$ mesons. Examining the $\phi$ meson masses and decay width within a dense medium is anticipated to be essential for understanding experimental results from heavy-ion collision experiments.</description>

Abstract: In this contribution, I'll discuss two classes of effects--additional sources of CP violation and PQ breaking--that offer a slightly different take on axion physics. Both are tied to the idea that the axion solution to the strong CP problem might not be exact, hence the title ``Imperfect Axions''.</description>

      <title>CP Violation in Hadronic Weak Decays of Charmed Baryons in the Topological Diagrammatic Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07150v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: CP violation in the charmed baryon sector is generally expected to be very small, of order $10^{-4}$ or even smaller. Nevertheless, large long-distance penguin topologies can be induced through final-state rescattering. At the hadron level, they are manifested as the triangle and bubble diagrams. However, these diagrams consist of not only the penguin but also other tree topologies. Therefore, we focus on the flavor structure of the these diagrams and project out their contributions to penguin and tree topologies. The analysis is performed within the framework of the topological diagram approach and the irreducible SU(3) approach in which the SU(3) flavor symmetry of QCD is realized to describe the nonleptonic decays of charmed baryons. CP violation at the per mille level is found in the following decay modes: $\Lambda_c^+ \to p \pi^0,~\Lambda_c^+ \to p \eta', ~\Xi_c^0 \to \Sigma^0\eta$ and $\Xi_c^+ \to \Sigma^+ \eta$. CP asymmetries in the last three modes receive sizable contributions from the SU(3)-flavor-singlet hairpin diagram.</description>

      <title>Enhancement of photon emission rate near QCD critical point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute photon emission rate enhancement near the QCD critical point using an effective theory of dynamic critical phenomena and derive a universal photon spectrum. The emission rate scales similarly to conductivity, increasing with the correlation length ($\xi$), diverging at the critical point. The spectrum exhibits $\omega dN_{\gamma}/d^3k \propto \omega^{-1/2}$ in the scaling regime, with the transition occurring at a frequency comparable to shear damping rate $\omega \sim \gamma_{\eta}/\xi^2$, reflecting the nonequilibrium properties of the near-critical liquid.</description>

Abstract: We study the lepton mass textures, which are derived by $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauging of $\mathbb{Z}_M$ symmetries. We can obtain various textures for the Yukawa couplings in the charged lepton sector, but the patterns of neutrino mass matrices are limited. All the obtained textures can not be realized by group-theoretical symmetries, and certain textures can lead to realistic results.</description>

      <title>Dark photon in parity-violating electron scatterings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07279v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We proposed that parity-violating electron scattering (PVES) offers a powerful tool to probe the hypothetical dark photon. We calculated the dark photon contributions to PVES asymmetries in both elastic and deep-inelastic scattering (DIS). These contributions are characterised by the corrections to the standard model couplings $C_{1q}, \, C_{2q}$, and $C_{3q}$. At low scales, the corrections to $C_{1q}$ and $C_{3q}$ could be as large as $5\%$ were a dark photon to exist. In DIS at very high $Q^2$, of relevance to HERA or the EIC, the dark photon could induce substantial corrections to $C_{2q}$, suggesting as large as $10\%$ uncertainties in the extraction of valence parton distribution functions. We also extracted the favoured regions of the dark photon parameter space by fitting the parity violation data and the CDF $W$ boson mass, which prefer a heavy dark photon with mass above the $Z$-boson mass.</description>

      <title>Lepton Number Violation Higgs Decay at Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the scalar singlet extension of type-I seesaw, where a scalar singlet $S$ and heavy neutral lepton $N$ are further introduced. The Majorana mass term of heavy neutral lepton is generated through the Yukawa interaction with the scalar singlet, which then induces the lepton number violation decays of SM Higgs $h$ and heavy Higgs $H$ via mixing of scalars. As a pathway to probe the origin of heavy neutral lepton mass, we investigate the lepton number violation Higgs decay signature at the TeV-scale muon collider. The dominant production channel of Higgs bosons at the TeV-scale muon collider is via vector boson fusion. So we perform a detailed analysis of the signal process $\mu^+\mu^-\to \nu_\mu \bar{\nu}_\mu h/H \to \nu_\mu \bar{\nu}_\mu NN $ followed by $ N \to \mu^\pm jj$, where the two jets from $W$ boson decay are treated as one fat-jet $J$. With an integrated luminosity of $1(10)~\text{ab}^{-1}$, the 3 (10) TeV muon collider could discover the lepton number violation SM Higgs decay $h\to \mu^\pm\mu^\pm JJ$ signature for the Higgs mixing parameter $\sin\alpha&gt;0.05(0.009)$. Meanwhile, a large parameter space can be detected by the lepton number violation heavy Higgs decay $H\to \mu^\pm\mu^\pm JJ$ signature for $m_H\lesssim1 (3)$ TeV and $\sin\alpha\gtrsim0.03(0.005)$ at the 3 (10) TeV muon collider. Therefore, the lepton number violation SM and heavy Higgs decay signatures are both promising at the TeV scale muon collider.</description>

      <title>Parton helicities at arbitrary x and Q2 in double-logarithmic approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Description of spin-dependent hadronic processes at high energies in terms of parton helicities is a both effective and technically convenient means. In the present paper, we obtain explicit expressions for the parton helicities when either Collinear or KT forms of QCD Factorization are used. Starting our studies with calculation of the helicities in the double-logarithmic approximation (DLA) in the region of small x and large Q2, we generalize the results in order to obtain formulae valid at arbitrary x and Q2. We argue against using Collinear Factorization, when the parton orbital angular momenta are accounted for, and prove that KT-Factorization should be used instead. We also consider in detail the small-x asymptotics of the parton helicities, compare them with the DGLAP-asymptotics and prove a property of the asymptot1ics often used in the literature though without a proof. Namely, the asymptotics of all parton helicities and the asymptotics of the spin structure function g1 are the same despite the parent formulae for these objects are quite different.</description>

      <title>Investigating sub-MeV dark matter annihilation to neutrinos using direct detection experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Dark matter (DM) could self-annihilate into neutrinos in dense regions of the Universe. We consider the resulting flux of neutrinos from the Milky Way DM halo and derive exclusion limits on the annihilation cross-section using XENONnT electron recoil data. Assuming a $J$-factor independent of the annihilation cross-section, we find leading limits for DM masses below $\mathcal{O}$(MeV). Self-annihilating DM affects the DM halo via dissolution, introducing a cross-section dependency on the halo profile and thus the $J$-factor. We discuss such a situation in more detail, finding that the signal rate is below the experimental sensitivity of XENONnT, leaving the annihilation cross-section unconstrained.</description>

      <title>Predictions for Identified Hadron ($\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$ and $p(\overline{p})$) Production and Collective Dynamics in Oxygen-Oxygen Collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$= 7 TeV with EPOS4, AMPT-SM, and Angantyr in Pythia 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of identified hadrons ($\pi^\pm$, $K^\pm$ and $p(\overline{p})$) production in $O+O$ collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\mathrm{NN}}} = 7$TeV using recently updated version of EPOS4, string melting version of A Multi-Phase Transport Model (AMPT-SM) and Angantyr model, incorporated within Pythia 8. We examine the interplay between different mechanisms implemented in these models. Predictions for charged particle multiplicity ($dN_{ch}/d\eta$), transverse momentum ($p_T$) spectra of identified hadrons, particle yield ($dN/dy$) and mean transverse mass ($\langle m_T \rangle$) are presented. To probe the collective behavior of the produced particles, the $p_T$-differential kaons-to-pion and proton-to-pion ratios are studied. While AMPT incorporates some flow effects, EPOS4's implementation of full hydrodynamic flow proves significantly more effective. In contrast, the flow effects in Pythia 8 are substantially weaker compared to the other models. The upcoming $O+O$ data from the LHC will help constrain the parameters of these models.</description>

      <title>Higgs Inflation with Vector-Like Quark Stabilisation and the ACT spectral index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07488v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration has reported a scalar spectral index $n_s~=~0.9743~\pm~0.0034$. This is substantially larger than the classical prediction of Higgs Inflation, $n_s \approx 0.965$, which is 2.74$\sigma$ below the ACT mean value. We show that when an otherwise metastable Standard Model Higgs Inflation potential is stabilised by the addition of vector-like quark pairs and the potential is renormalised in the Jordan frame, the value of $n_s$ is generally larger than 0.965 and can explain the ACT observation. As an example, assuming the 2022 PDG direct measurement central value for the t quark mass, $m_{t} = 172.69$ GeV, and central values for the SM inputs to the renormalisation group equations, we obtain $n_s = 0.9792 - 0.9844$ for the case of three isosinglet vector-like B quarks with mass $m_{Q}$ in the range 1-3 TeV, with the lowest value of the $n_s$ range being 1.44$\sigma$ above the ACT mean value. The model predicts primordial gravitational wave with tensor-to-scalar ratio $r = 7.87 \times 10^{-3} - 1.21 \times 10^{-2}$ for $m_{Q} =$ 1-3 TeV, which will be easily observable in forthcoming CMB experiments. Observation of vector-like quarks of mass close to 1 TeV mass combined with a large tensor-to-scalar ratio $r \sim 0.1$ would support the model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mass estimates of active and sterile (right-handed) neutrinos are considered at the phenomenological level using the seesaw mechanism. It is assumed that the neutrino mass values depend on three characteristic scales, and the sum of the active neutrino mass values is limited from above by 0.06 eV. The neutrino mass values are estimated, as well as the observable neutrino mass values, namely, the average mass m_C of active neutrinos and the kinematic neutrino mass m_{\beta} of beta-decay.</description>

      <title>Towards a test of the Born rule in high-energy collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider how the Born rule, a fundamental principle of quantum mechanics, could be tested for particles created on the shortest timescales ($\sim10^{-25}\,\mathrm{s}$) currently accessible at high-energy colliders. We focus on targeted tests of the Born rule for spin or polarisation probabilities, which offer a particularly clean experimental signal, and which can be described by a simple hidden-variables model of two-state systems proposed by Bell. These probabilities test a remarkable feature of the quantum formalism, whereby expectation values for incompatible experiments are linearly related. Born-rule violations can be parameterised by nonlinear expectation values for quantum measurements of spin or polarisation, along with anomalies in ensemble averages, which are to be constrained by experiment. Notable experiments considered here include the recent detection of single photons from top-quark decay, and the indirect measurement of tau-lepton polarisation. Repurposing these experiments as tests of the Born rule, however, presents several challenges, which are discussed in this paper.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07586v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of a Standard Model extension incorporating an inert scalar doublet and a gauged $U(1)_{B-L}$ symmetry. Our analysis reveals regions of the parameter space that support strong first-order phase transitions, including cases featuring two successive transitions. Each transition can generate a stochastic gravitational wave background within the sensitivity reach of upcoming experiments. Remarkably, the high-scale transition may also produce primordial black holes with appreciable abundance.</description>

      <title>A Likelihood Ratio Framework for Highly Motivated Subdominant Signals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In particle physics and cosmology, distinguishing subtle new physics signals from established backgrounds is always a fundamental challenge for individual phenomenologists. This paper presents a simple and robust statistical framework to evaluate the compatibility of highly motivated (HM) theoretical models with the residual of the experimental results, focusing on scenarios where data appears consistent with background predictions. We develop a likelihood ratio test procedure that compares null and alternative hypotheses, emphasizing cases where new physics introduces small deviations from the background. We demonstrate the approach through two concrete examples, a localized excess and a modulation over an oscillatory background. We derive explicit conditions under which the effect of the background on the residual of the data must be accounted for.

      <title>Dark Matter in Multi-Singlet Extensions of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the simplest extensions of the Standard Model (SM) that originate Dark Matter (DM) candidates, built with the addition of real singlets and new ${Z}_2$ symmetries under which the models are invariant. In this type of models the interactions between SM particles are not altered except for the new interactions stemming from the portal couplings that link the SM Higgs with the DM candidates. In the extension with just one singlet, DM masses below about 4 TeV are already excluded by the combination of relic density and direct detection (DD) constraints, except for the resonant case of half the Higgs mass, making them undetectable at the LHC. Adding more real singlets with independent ${Z}_2$ symmetries opens up a new mass window for one of the DM candidates and decreases the lower bound on the other. Adding more singlets with independent ${Z}_2$ symmetries will not change this picture dramatically. If instead we add new singlets all odd under the same ${Z}_2$ symmetry, the allowed mass region for the DM candidate (i.e., the lighter dark sector scalar) will span the entire mass range from half the Higgs mass to the TeV scale. In principle, such light particles could be probed at the LHC in mono-$X$ searches. Although they are still out of reach with the current LHC DM searches, there are good chances to probe the models in some final states at the High-Luminosity (HL-LHC) stage of the LHC.</description>

      <title>Tagging fully hadronic exotic decays of the vectorlike $\mathbf{B}$ quark using a graph neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07769v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following up on our earlier study in [J. Bardhan et al., Machine learning-enhanced search for a vectorlike singlet B quark decaying to a singlet scalar or pseudoscalar, Phys. Rev. D 107 (2023) 115001; arXiv:2212.02442], we investigate the LHC prospects of pair-produced vectorlike $B$ quarks decaying exotically to a new gauge-singlet (pseudo)scalar field $\Phi$ and a $b$ quark. After the electroweak symmetry breaking, the $\Phi$ decays predominantly to $gg/bb$ final states, leading to a fully hadronic $2b+4j$ or $6b$ signature. Because of the large Standard Model background and the lack of leptonic handles, it is a difficult channel to probe. To overcome the challenge, we employ a hybrid deep learning model containing a graph neural network followed by a deep neural network. We estimate that such a state-of-the-art deep learning analysis pipeline can lead to a performance comparable to that in the semi-leptonic mode, taking the discovery (exclusion) reach up to about $M_B=1.8\:(2.4)$~TeV at HL-LHC when $B$ decays fully exotically, i.e., BR$(B \to b\Phi) = 100\%$.</description>

      <title>Exploring Potential Higgs Resonances at 650 GeV and 95 GeV in the 2HDM Type III</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent searches by the CMS collaboration at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) in the `diphoton plus $b\bar{b}$ final state' have revealed an excess near 650 GeV, which might indicate the presence of a (broad) heavy resonance decaying into a Standard Model (SM) Higgs boson and an additional particle. At the same time, both ATLAS and CMS as well as all experiments at the Large Electron-Position (LEP) collider have reported excesses consistent with a light Higgs boson channel around 95 GeV, suggesting a potential connection between these two signals. In this study, we investigate these anomalies within the context of the CP-conserving 2-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM) Type~III. In our proposed scenario, a heavy CP-odd Higgs boson $A$ with a mass near 650 GeV decays into a SM-like Higgs boson $H$ and a $Z$ boson, with the $H$ boson subsequently decaying into diphotons and the $Z$ boson decaying into $b\bar{b}$ pairs. To explain the excess around 95 GeV, we independently select the mass of the light CP-even Higgs boson of the model $h$ to be around this value. This configuration allows for a consistent explanation of both the high- and low-mass excesses observed in the experiments. Through a detailed analysis, we demonstrate that these two signals can be fitted simultaneously at the 2.5$\sigma$ significance level, offering a promising solution to the observed anomalies and potentially hinting at new physics Beyond the Standard Model (BSM).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21395v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a geometric formulation of effective field theories via nonlinear supersymmetry. Non-supersymmetric particles are embedded in constrained superfields governed by a nonlinear sigma model, and operators are collected into potentials on the target space. The use of chiral superfields standardizes the treatment of flavor across scalars and fermions, and the minimal jet bundle extension makes invariance under derivative field redefinitions manifest.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Strings-induced CMB anisotropies in light of Weighted Morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00758v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the morphological measures in assessing the geometrical and topological properties of a generic cosmological stochastic field, we propose an extension of the weighted morphological measures, specifically the $n$th conditional moments of derivative (cmd-$n$). This criterion assigns a distinct weight to each excursion set point based on the associated field. We apply the cmd-$n$ on the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) to identify the cosmic string networks (CSs) through their unique Gott-Kaiser-Stebbins effect on the temperature anisotropies. We also formulate the perturbative expansion of cmd-$n$ for the weak non-Gaussian regime up to $\mathcal{O}(\sigma_0^3)$. We propose a comprehensive pipeline designed to analyze the morphological properties of string-induced CMB maps within the flat sky approximation. To evaluate the robustness of our proposed criteria, we employ string-induced high-resolution flat-sky CMB simulated patches of $7.2$ deg$^2$ size with a resolution of $0.42$ arc-minutes. Our results demonstrate that the minimum detectable value of cosmic string tension is $G\mu\gtrsim 1.9\times 10^{-7}$ when a noise-free map is analyzed with normalized cmd-$n$. Whereas for the ACT, CMB-S4, and Planck-like experiments at 95.45\% confidence level, the normalized cmd-$n$ can distinguish the CSs network for $G\mu\gtrsim2.9 \times 10^{-7}$, $G\mu\gtrsim 2.4\times 10^{-7}$ and $G\mu\gtrsim 5.8\times 10^{-7}$, respectively. The normalized cmd-$n$ exhibits a significantly enhanced capability in detecting CSs relative to the Minkowski Functionals.</description>

      <title>Study of the Quartic Anharmonic Oscillator Using the System's Wave Function Expansion in the Oscillator Basis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum quartic anharmonic oscillator with the Hamiltonian $H=\frac{1}{2}\left( p^{2}+x^{2}\right) +\lambda x^{4}$ is a classical and fundamental model that plays a key role in various branches of physics, including quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, high-energy particle physics, and other areas. To study this model, we apply a method based on a convergent expansion of the system's wave function in a complete set of harmonic oscillator eigenfunctions -- namely, the basis of eigenfunctions $\varphi^{(0)}_n$ of the unperturbed Hamiltonian $H^{(0)}=\frac{1}{2}\left(p^{2}+x^{2}\right)$. This approach enables a thorough analysis and calculation of the oscillator's physical characteristics. We demonstrate very good convergence of all calculated quantities with respect to the number of basis functions included in the expansion, over a wide range of $\lambda$ values. We have computed the energies of the ground and the first six excited states for a broad range of the coupling constant $\lambda$, and also calculated and constructed the corresponding wave functions. Additionally, we propose and detail an improved version of the expansion method using a modified optimized oscillator basis with variable frequency. This modification significantly accelerates the convergence of expansions across the entire range of $\lambda$, thereby greatly enhancing the efficiency of the method and allowing accurate calculations with a very small number of expansion functions $N\lesssim 10$. As a result, this modified approach provides an essentially complete, simple, and efficient solution to the problem of the anharmonic oscillator, enabling straightforward computation of all its physical properties -- including the energies and wave functions of both ground and excited states -- for arbitrary values of $\lambda$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06338v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We extend the holographic V-QCD model by introducing a charged scalar field sector to represent the condensation of paired quark matter in the deconfined phase. By incorporating this new sector into the previously established framework for nuclear and quark matter, we obtain a phase diagram that, in addition to the first-order deconfinement transition and its critical end-point, also features a second-order transition between paired and unpaired quark matter. The critical temperature for quark pairing exhibits only a mild dependence on the chemical potential and can reach values as high as $T_\mathrm{crit} \approx 30~\rm MeV$. Comparison of the growth rate for the formation of homogeneous paired phases to the growth rate of previously discovered modulated phases suggests that the former is subdominant to the latter.</description>

      <title>Quantum State Preparation via Large-Language-Model-Driven Evolution</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06347v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an automated framework for quantum circuit design by integrating large-language models (LLMs) with evolutionary optimization to overcome the rigidity, scalability limitations, and expert dependence of traditional ones in variational quantum algorithms. Our approach (FunSearch) autonomously discovers hardware-efficient ans\"atze with new features of scalability and system-size-independent number of variational parameters entirely from scratch. Demonstrations on the Ising and XY spin chains with n = 9 qubits yield circuits containing 4 parameters, achieving near-exact energy extrapolation across system sizes. Implementations on quantum hardware (Zuchongzhi chip) validate practicality, where two-qubit quantum gate noises can be effectively mitigated via zero-noise extrapolations for a spin chain system as large as 20 sites. This framework bridges algorithmic design and experimental constraints, complementing contemporary quantum architecture search frameworks to advance scalable quantum simulations.</description>

      <title>Analysis of Two Models for the Angular Structure of the Outflows Producing the Swift/XRT "Larger-Angle Emission" of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06401</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06401v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The instantaneous emission from a relativistic surface endowed with a Lorentz factor $\Gamma$ that decreases away from the outflow symmetry axis can naturally explain the three phases observed by Swift/XRT in GRBs and their afterglows (GRB tail, afterglow plateau and post-plateau).
  We expand the analytical formalism of the "Larger-Angle Emission" model previously developed for "Power-Law" outflows to "n-Exponential" outflows (e.g. exponential with $n=1$ and Gaussian with $n=2$) and compare their abilities to account for the X-ray emission of XRT afterglows.
  We assume power-law $\Gamma$-dependences of two spectral characteristics (peak-energy and peak intensity) and find that, unlike Power-Law outflows, n-Exponential outflows cannot account for plateaus with a temporal dynamical range larger than 100.
  To include all information existing in the Swift/XRT measurements of X-ray aferglows (0.3-10 keV unabsorbed flux and effective spectral slope), we calculate 0.3 keV and 10 keV light-curves using a broken power-law emission spectrum of peak-energy and low-and high-energy slopes that are derived from the effective slope measured by XRT. This economical peak-energy determination is found to be consistent with more expensive spectral fits.
  The angular distributions of the Lorentz factor, comoving frame peak-energy, and peak-intensity ($\Gamma (\theta), E'_p (\theta), i'_p(\theta)$) constrain the (yet-to-be determined) convolution of various features of the production of relativistic jets by solar-mass black-holes and of their propagation through the progenitor/circumburst medium, while the $E'_p (\Gamma)$ and $i'_p (\Gamma)$ dependences may constrain the GRB dissipation mechanism and the GRB emission process.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of baryon dynamics with directed flow in relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This thesis aims to elucidate the role of initial baryon stopping and its diffusion in heavy-ion collisions (HIC) using hydrodynamic model. In this regard, we have studied the observable-directed flow ($v_1$) of identified hadrons, particularly the $v_1$ of baryons and antibaryons, as well as the splitting observed between them in detail. We propose a new ansatz for the initial baryon distribution. By employing this initial baryon deposition model alongside a tilted energy distribution as inputs to a hybrid framework, we successfully describe the rapidity-odd $v_1$ of identified hadrons, including the elusive baryon-antibaryon splitting of $v_1$ across a wide range of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$. Our model, incorporating baryon stopping and it's subsequent diffusion within a relativistic hydrodynamic framework and employing a crossover equation of state derived from lattice QCD calculations, establishes a non-critical baryonic baseline. Moreover, we demonstrate that recent STAR measurements of the centrality and system-size dependence of $v_1$ splitting between oppositely charged hadrons-attributed to electromagnetic field effects-are significantly influenced by background contributions from baryon stopping and its diffusion. Furthermore, we show that the rapidity dependence of the splitting of the rapidity-even component of $v_1$ between $p$ and $\bar{p}$ is highly sensitive to the initial baryon deposition scheme. If measured experimentally, this could constraint the rapidity dependence of the initial baryon deposition profile. Moreover, it could offer valuable phenomenological insights into the baryon junction picture and help refine constraints on the baryon diffusion coefficient of the medium. Notably, utilizing this phenomenologically successful baryon deposition model, we present the first estimation of the baryon diffusion coefficient for the strongly interacting QCD matter created in HIC.</description>

      <title>Method for high-precision determination of the nucleon axial structure using lattice QCD: Removing $\pi N$-state contamination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed a precise calculation of physical quantities related to the axial structure of the nucleon using 2+1 flavor lattice QCD gauge configuration (PACS10 configuration) generated at the physical point with lattice volume larger than $(10\;{\mathrm{fm}})^4$ by the PACS Collaboration. The nucleon matrix element of the axial-vector current has two types of the nucleon form factors, the axial-vector ($F_A$) form factor and the induced pseudoscalar ($F_P$) form factor. Recently lattice QCD simulations have succeeded in reproducing the experimental value of the axial-vector coupling, $g_A$, determined from $F_A(q^2)$ at zero momentum transfer $q^2=0$, at a percent level of statistical accuracy. However, the $F_P$ form factor so far has not reproduced the experimental values well due to strong $\pi N$ excited-state contamination. Therefore, we proposed a simple subtraction method for removing the so-called leading $\pi N$-state contribution, and succeeded in reproducing the values obtained by two experiments of muon capture on the proton and pion electro-production for $F_P(q^2)$. The novel approach can also be applied to the nucleon pseudoscalar matrix element to determine the pseudoscalar ($G_P$) form factor with the help of the axial Wald-Takahashi identity. The resulting form factors, $F_P(q^2)$ and $G_P(q^2)$, are in good agreement with the prediction of the pion-pole dominance model. In the new analysis, the induced pseudoscalar coupling $g_P^\ast$ and the pion-nucleon coupling $g_{\pi NN}$ can be evaluated with a few percent accuracy including systematic uncertainties using existing data calculated at two lattice spacings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.06878v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the properties of quantum electrodynamics (QED) two-particle scattering processes when an arbitrarily sharp filtering of the outgoing particles in momentum space is performed. We find that these processes are described by dynamical quantum maps, whose structure is such that any initial state is transformed into a maximally entangled state, after an infinite number of iterations of the map. This structural property is exactly realized if all the colliding particles are massive fermions while, when photons are involved, it is verified in a partial way, depending on the process under consideration.</description>

      <title>Traversable wormhole sourced by a generalized string fluid in the 4D Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate traversable wormhole solutions in four-dimensional Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet (EGB) gravity coupled with a generalized string fluid background. Our analysis reveals that zero-tidal solutions meet all geometric criteria for traversability while avoiding singularities, with the Gauss-Bonnet coupling $\alpha$ modulating the throat geometry and asymptotic behavior. Varying the parameters $\alpha$ and $\varepsilon$ significantly affects curvature both near the throat and at large distances, maintaining finite values throughout spacetime. We demonstrate that the null energy condition (NEQ) can be satisfied for high values of $\alpha$ ($\gtrsim 1$) and low string fluid density $\varepsilon$ ($\lesssim 0.1$), greatly reducing the exotic matter requirement compared to general relativistic wormholes. The string fluid's behavior approaches that of a cloud of strings for large $\alpha$ or $\varepsilon$. Additionally, the volume integral quantifier and complexity factor analyses show that increasing $\alpha$ reduces gravitational complexity and exotic matter content near the throat, aligning with NEQ preservation. Our results establish that the combined influence of Gauss-Bonnet gravity and string-like matter can support traversable wormholes while minimizing unphysical energy conditions, offering new insights for constructing viable wormhole geometries in modified gravity.</description>

      <title>Quarkyonic picture of isospin QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07076v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We suggest a new look onto the thermodynamics of cold isospin QCD matter described within the quarkyonic framework, when confining forces are essential only for the momentum states close to the Fermi sphere and lead to formation of the quark-antiquark correlations with quantum numbers of pions. Within this picture cold isospin QCD matter is constituted by the Bose-Einstein condensate of pions and free (anti)quarks. We develop a simple confining model of pions existing as the lowest energy $P$-state of in-medium three-dimensional harmonic oscillator and use it to show that under the conditions of isospin QCD quarkyonic matter can onset at densities significantly smaller than the overlap density of pions. Using the experimentally established pion charge radius we demonstrate that the onset density can be even lower than two nuclear saturation densities. To analyze the lattice QCD data we develop a field-theory inspired model of quark-antiquark-pion matter with vector-isovector repulsion among pions and (anti)quarks. The quark substructure of pions, which is one of the key elements of the model, is accounted for within the one-loop no-sea approximation and leads to an effective medium dependence of the pion mass. The latter is shown to be crucial for providing asymptotic vanishing of the pion density and pion condensate, which reflects pion dissociation due to asymptotic freedom of QCD. The proposed quarkyonic picture of isospin QCD agrees with the results of perturbative calculations on reaching the conformal limit of QCD and with the data of lattice simulations, which supports its viability and physical relevance.</description>

      <title>Estimating the Lensing Probability for Binary Black Hole Mergers in AGN disk by Using Mismatch Threshold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07114v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stellar-mass binary black holes (BBH) may form, evolve, and merge within the dense environments of active galactic nuclei (AGN) disks, thereby contributing to the BBH population detected by gravitational wave (GW) observatories. Mergers occurring in AGN disks may be gravitationally lensed by the supermassive black hole at the AGN centre. The probability of such lensing events has been approximately estimated by using the Einstein criterion in previous work. However, a more reasonable approach to calculating the lensing probability should be based on whether the detector can distinguish the lensed GW waveform from the unlensed one. In this work, we calculate the lensing probability of LIGO sources embedded in AGN disk by relating threshold mismatch to the signal-to-noise ratio of the observed events. For the sensitivity of LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA O3 observation runs, our results indicate that the lensing probability is several times higher than previous estimates. If AGNs are indeed the primary formation channel for BBHs, we could quantify the probability of detecting the lensed GW events in such a scenario. The non-detections, on the other hand, will place stricter constraints on the fraction of AGN disk BBHs and even the birthplaces of BBH mergers.</description>

      <title>Violation of NCQ scaling in hadron elliptic flow in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}}=3.0-7.7 \,\mathrm{GeV}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07187v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the number-of-constituent-quark (NCQ) scaling of elliptic flow for various hadrons in non-central Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 3.0\text{--}7.7\,\mathrm{GeV}$ using the AMPT model with string melting (SM) and pure hadron cascade (HC) modes. For the SM case, NCQ scaling is absent at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3.0\,\mathrm{GeV}$ but is largely restored by $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3.9\,\mathrm{GeV}$. Although quark coalescence occurs at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =3.0\,\mathrm{GeV}$, the lack of NCQ scaling is attributed to the insufficient development of quark elliptic flow and the limited production of strange quarks and antiquarks. This finding suggests that NCQ scaling could not be considered a definitive signature of quark-gluon plasma (QGP) formation in the RHIC fixed-target energy region. For the HC case, as expected, no NCQ scaling is observed. However, a mass ordering in the elliptic flow emerges at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =4.5\,\mathrm{GeV}$, indicating that full thermalization may not be a prerequisite for mass ordering.</description>

      <title>Isotropy Test with Quasars Using Method of Smoothed Residuals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07439v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To assess the significance and scale dependence of anomalous large scale modes in the CatWISE quasar data, we generate smoothed number density fields on the sphere and study their extreme values -- maximum, minimum, maximum antipodal difference. By comparing these summary statistics to those obtained from random isotropic realisations of the data, we determine the statistical significance of large scale modes as a function of smoothing scale. We perform our analysis using five different versions of the data -- the original quasar map, the maps after separately subtracting the ecliptic bias and the CMB dipole, the map obtained after subtracting both, and the map after subtracting the ecliptic bias and anomalous dipole inferred in \cite{Secrest2021}. We find that the ecliptic-corrected, CMB dipole-removed map exhibits large scale modes that are in tension with random realisations of the data (p-values $p \sim 10^{-4}$), over a wide range of smoothing scales $\pi/8 \leq \delta \leq \pi/2$. The most prominent feature in the data is an underdensity in the southern galactic plane at $(b,\ell) = (-31^\circ,78^\circ)$, which reaches its highest statistical significance when smoothed on scales $\delta = \pi/6$ ($p \ll 10^{-5}$). Notably, the minima statistics align with the maximum antipodal difference statistics, whereas the maxima do not. This suggests that the observed dipole-like behavior in the data is primarily driven by the underdensity in the southern sky. The ecliptic corrected, anomalous dipole subtracted map reduces the significance of any residual anisotropic features, but an underdensity in the south sky persists with p-value $p =0.0018$.</description>

      <title>Effective Quantum Gravitational Collapse in Metric Variables: The $\bar{\mu}$ Scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07517v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study, using the metric variables, how an effective theory for the Oppenheimer-Snyder gravitational collapse can be built with the $\bar{\mu}$ scheme from Loop Quantum Gravity (LQG). The collapse is analyzed for both the flat and spherical models. In both scenarios the effective theory make possible to avoid the formation of the singularity. The source of this is found in the presence of a negative pressure term inside the stress-energy tensor of the gravitational field. This pressure is analyzed and is concluded that the effective polymer model is the reason why the negative pressure appears. A characterization of the solutions for both models is also carried out, showing that the collapse is altered and avoided in favor of a transition from a black hole state to a white hole one, transition that occurs when the collapse has reached a Planckian regime.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal flow decorrelation in heavy-ion collision at RHIC energies using a multi-phase transport model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.08406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a study on the longitudinal flow decorrelation in heavy-ion collisions at the RHIC Beam Energy Scan (BES) energies ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$ = 11.5 to 200 GeV in Au+Au collisions) using the AMPT model. We measure the second and third order factorization ratios ($r_{2}$ and $r_{3}$) across BES energies, finding $r_{2}$ weakly dependent on collision energy while $r_{3}$ shows a more prominent collision energy dependent. The effect of parton-parton scattering cross section on $r_{2}$ and $r_{3}$ is studied which suggests that longitudinal decorrelation could be a potential observable to constrain transport properties of the medium. We also analyze the contributions of flow-plane and flow magnitude decorrelation, with flow-plane decorrelation being dominant. we measure a recently proposed observable, the four particle cumulant ($T_{2}$), which remains resilient to non-flow effects and exhibits sensitivity to different decorrelation patterns. Through the measurement of $T_{2}$, we consistently observe a hint of S-shaped or torqued decorrelation across all energy ranges in peripheral collisions (40-80\%). But in central and mid-central collisions, presence of any specific pattern of decorrelation is missing in AMPT model.</description>

      <title>Leading two-loop corrections to the Higgs di-photon decay in the Inert Doublet Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.14976v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leading two-loop contributions to the di-photon decay of the Higgs boson are evaluated for the first time in the Inert Doublet Model (IDM). We employ for this calculation the Higgs low-energy theorem, meaning that we obtain corrections to the Higgs decay process by taking Higgs-field derivatives of the leading two-loop contributions to the photon self-energy. Specifically, we have included corrections involving inert BSM Higgs bosons and gauge bosons, as well as external-leg contributions involving inert scalars, gauge bosons and fermions. Our calculation has been performed with a full on-shell renormalization, and in the gauge-less limit. Moreover, we performed two independent calculations, using the background-field method and the pinch technique, in order to apply the Higgs low-energy theorem consistently, and found full agreement between the two calculations. We investigate our results numerically in two scenarios of the IDM: one with a light dark matter (DM) candidate (Higgs resonance scenario), and another with all additional scalars heavy (heavy Higgs scenario). In both cases, we find that the inclusion of two-loop corrections qualitatively modifies the behavior of the decay width, compared with the one-loop ($i.e.$ leading) order, and that they increase the deviation from the Standard Model. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the inclusion of the newly-computed two-loop corrections is essential to reliably interpret the observation or non-observation of a deviation in the Higgs di-photon decay width at current and future colliders.</description>

Abstract: Sub-GeV neutrinos produced in a stellar core may emerge from main sequence stars, white dwarfs and brown dwarfs producing possible observable signals of dark matter capture. A distribution of these stars near the Milky Way galactic center will produce a neutrino flux that can be probed at Earth based neutrino observatories like Super-Kamiokande and Hyper-Kamiokande. We demonstrate that this can provide a handle to probe dark matter masses in the $200\,$MeV\,$-$\,$2\,$GeV mass scales that compares favourably with present day direct detection bounds.</description>

      <title>Particle production in HRG with thermodynamically consistent EoS and partially deformable hadrons</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.11752v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the present work, we analyze several strange as well as non-strange relative hadronic yields obtained in the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions (URHIC) experiments over a wide range of center-of-mass collision energy ($\sqrt{s_{NN}}$). We invoke the formation of a hot and dense hadronic resonance gas (HRG) in the final stage following the URHIC. We use an earlier proposed thermodynamically consistent approach for obtaining the equation of state (EoS) of a HRG. It takes into account an important aspect of the hadronic interaction, viz., the hadronic hard-core repulsion, by assigning hard-core volumes to the hadrons, leading to an excluded volume (EV) type effect. We have invoked the bag model approach to assign hard-core volumes to baryons (antibaryons) while treating mesons to be point particles. We employ ansatz to obtain the dependence of the temperature (\textit{T}) and baryon chemical potential (BCP) of HRG system on the center-of-mass energy in URHIC. We also find strong evidence of a double freeze-out scenario, corresponding to baryons (antibaryons) and mesons, respectively. Strangeness (anti-strangeness) imbalance factor is also seen to play an important role in explaining the ratio of strange hadrons to the non-strange ones. The HRG model can explain the experimental data on various relative hadronic multiplicities quite satisfactorily over a wide range of $\sqrt{s_{NN}}$, ranging from the lowest RHIC energies to the highest LHC energies using one set of model parameters by obtaining the best theoretical fits to the experimental data using the minimum $\chi^{2}$/dof method.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the dynamics of scalar particle production, focusing on the presence of multiple fields and couplings in the medium. The interplay of various fields and couplings can influence the production rate, potentially overshadowing the effect of electrons alone. The plasma mixing, which induces the resonance and screening of scalar processes, is shown to be modified by the in-medium effects depending on the type of processes and field contents. Incorporating these in-medium effects into the analysis of stellar cooling via scalar emission allows for the emergence of various features of multi-field effects given in several types of scalar models.</description>

      <title>Revealing the Origin of Neutrino Masses through Displaced Shower Searches in the CMS Muon System</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the potential to probe the origin of neutrino masses, by searching for long-lived right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) $N$ in the $B-L$ model and in the RHN-extended Standard Model (SM) Effective Field Theory (EFT). Despite the small active-sterile mixing $|V_{\ell N}|^2$, RHNs are produced abundantly via SM and exotic Higgs production, as long as the Higgs mixing or EFT operator coefficient is sufficiently large. We reinterpret a search for displaced showers in the CMS muon system and we find that it is sensitive to parameter space at and below the seesaw floor, $|V_{\ell N}|^2 \approx 10^{-12}$ ($\ell = e$, $\tau$) for $m_N \approx 40$ GeV. With existing data constraining such well-motivated scenarios of neutrino mass generation, we determine the projected sensitivity at the HL-LHC, motivating dedicated searches for long-lived RHNs with decay lengths $\approx 10$ m.</description>

Abstract: Reconstructing the internal three-dimensional quark and gluon structures of hadrons through generalized parton distributions (GPDs) from hard exclusive scattering processes is one of the most challenging tasks in nuclear and particle physics. In this paper, we introduce a new optimized reference frame that, for the first time, enables a unified view of all the reactions sensitive to GPDs and facilitates the interpretation of a variety of phase-space patterns that were previously hardly accessible and interpretable. Similarly to how the heliocentric description advanced our understanding of the solar system and gravitation, our new frame centers around a quasireal state, allows for a consistent separation of physical scales, and reveals a novel quantum interference mechanism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.15218v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore constraints on the parameter space of the alternative left-right model originating from the leptonic sector. Our analyses focuses on both lepton-flavour-conserving observables, particularly the anomalous magnetic moment of the muon, and lepton-flavour-violating processes like $\mu \to e \gamma $ decay and $\mu-e$ conversions in nuclei. While contributions to the anomalous magnetic moment fall below the measured values at 2$\sigma$, current and future experimental sensitivities to flavour-violating branching rations of the Standard Model leptons are expected to impose lower bounds on the mass of the peculiar $SU(2)_R$ gauge boson of the model. This provides complementary constraints relative to existing limits, which are indirect and derived from collider bounds on the mass of the associated neutral gauge boson $Z^\prime$.</description>

Abstract: We summarise the physics of first-order phase transitions in the early universe, and the possible ways in which they might come about. We then focus on gravitational waves, emphasising general qualitative features of stochastic backgrounds produced by early universe phase transitions and the cosmology of their present-day appearance. Finally, we conclude by discussing some of the ways in which a stochastic background might be detected.</description>

      <title>Study of large extra dimension and neutrino decay at P2SO experiment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09628v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we explore two intriguing new physics scenarios: the theory of Large Extra Dimensions (LED) and the theory of neutrino decay. We analyze the impact of LED on neutrino oscillations in the contexts of Protvino to Super-ORCA (P2SO), DUNE, and T2HK, with a particular emphasis on P2SO. In contrast, the effects of neutrino decay are examined exclusively in the context of P2SO. For the LED scenario, we find that combining data from P2SO, DUNE, and T2HK can yield tighter constraints than current bounds, but only if all oscillation parameters are measured with high precision. In the case of neutrino decay, P2SO can achieve slightly better bounds compared to ESSnuSB and MOMENT, although its bounds remain weaker than those provided by DUNE and T2HK. Regarding sensitivities to unresolved oscillation parameters, the existence of LED has a minimal impact on the determination of CP violation, mass ordering and octant. However, neutrino decay can significantly influence the sensitivities related to CP violation and octant in a non-trivial manner.</description>

      <title>Probing the Inert Doublet Model via Vector-Boson Fusion at a Muon Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13729</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we explore the discovery potential of the Inert Doublet Model (IDM) via the vector boson fusion (VBF) channel at a muon collider with centre-of-mass energy of 10 TeV. The Inert Doublet Model is a two-Higgs-doublet model variant with an unbroken discrete $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry, featuring new stable scalar particles that can serve as dark matter candidates. Current dark matter data constrain the phenomenologically viable parameter space of the IDM and render certain collider signatures elusive due to tiny couplings. However, VBF-type processes can still exhibit significant enhancements compared to the Standard Model, presenting a promising avenue to probe the IDM at a high-energy muon collider. We consider as our specific target process $\mu^+\mu^-\to \nu_\mu\bar{\nu}_\mu AA\to \nu_\mu\bar{\nu}_\mu jj \ell\ell HH$, where $H$ and $A$ are the lightest and second-lightest new scalars and $\ell$ can be electrons or muons. We perform both cut-based and machine-learning improved sensitivity analyses for such a signal, finding a population of promising benchmark scenarios. We additionally investigate the impact of the collider energy by comparing sensitivities to the target process at 3 TeV and 10 TeV. Our results provide a clear motivation for a muon collider design capable of reaching a 10 TeV centre-of-mass energy. We furthermore discuss constraints stemming from new-physics corrections to the Higgs to di-photon decay rate as well as the trilinear Higgs coupling in detail, using state-of-the-art higher-order calculations.</description>

      <title>Next-to-leading order evolution of structure functions without PDFs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate and numerically solve the Dokshitzer-Gribov-Lipatov-Altarelli-Parisi~(DGLAP) evolution equations at next-to-leading order in perturbation theory directly for a basis of 6 physical, observable structure functions in deeply inelastic scattering. By expressing the evolution in the physical basis one evades the factorization scale and scheme dependence. Working in terms of observable quantities, rather than parametrizing and fitting unobservable parton distribution functions (PDFs), provides an unambiguous way to confront predictions of perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics with experimental measurements. We compare numerical results for the DGLAP evolution for structure functions in the physical basis to the conventional evolution with PDFs.</description>

      <title>Charmful two-body $\Omega_b$ decays in the light-front quark model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11584</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.11584v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the singly and doubly charmful two-body $\Omega_b^-$ decays using the light-front quark model. Our findings reveal that most branching fractions calculated in this study, such as ${\cal B}(\Omega_b^-\to\Xi^- D^0,\Xi^{-}D^{*0})$, can be ten to one hundred times larger than those reported in previous calculations. Additionally, we interpret the ratio ${\cal B}(\Omega_b^-\to\Omega^- J/\psi)/{\cal B}(\Omega_b^-\to\Omega^- \eta_c)\simeq 3.4$ within the helicity framework. While the decay involving external $W$-boson emission appears to be suppressed by the $b\to u \bar c s$ weak transition, it still yields a significant branching fraction. For instance, ${\cal B}(\Omega_b^-\to\Xi^0 D_s^{*-})=(5.9-14.2)\times 10^{-5}$, ${\cal B}(\Omega_b^-\to\Xi^{*0}D_s^{-})=(6.7-12.1)\times10^{-5}$, and ${\cal B}(\Omega_b^-\to\Xi^{*0}D_s^{*-})=(12.8-26.7)\times10^{-5}$, with values reaching as large as $10^{-4}$. These predictions are well within the experimental reach of LHCb.</description>

      <title>Neutrino Oscillations in the Three Flavor Paradigm</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.08374v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The three-flavor neutrino oscillation model describes the well-studied phenomenon of neutrinos produced in association with one charged lepton: electron, muon, or tau, and then later detected in association with a possibly different charged lepton. While somewhat surprising, the firm experimental discovery of the phenomenon in the late 1990s and early 2000s has lead to a revolution in particle physics as the nature of neutrinos has been explored with heightened vigor ever since. At the core of the phenomenon are the six neutrino oscillation parameters. These parameters are fundamental and not predicted from anything else in our model of particle physics. At the time of writing this chapter, many of them have been measured, but several key questions remain that are to be answered by neutrino oscillations themselves. These questions have motivated some of the largest and most involved particle physics experiments built to date. This chapter will develop the basics of neutrino oscillation theory and build intuition for the role of the oscillation parameters and how they are measured, as well as the important role of the matter effect in neutrino oscillations.</description>

      <title>Experimental signatures of Kalb-Ramond-like particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09836v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyse phenomenological signatures of Kalb-Ramond-like particles, described by an antisymmetric rank-2 tensor, when coupled to fermionic matter. The latter is modelled by a tensor current coupled directly to the Kalb-Ramond field or by a pseudovector current coupled to the rank-1 dual of the field-strength tensor. We obtain limits on the coupling constants to fermions and mass of the Kalb-Ramond-like particles by investigating their impact on the hyperfine splittings of hydrogen, the tree-level unitarity of the $S$ matrix for $e^- + e^+ \rightarrow \ell^- + \ell^+$ scattering with $\ell \neq e$ and the differential cross section for Bhabha scattering. Assuming that the couplings to fermions are independent of the fermion species, the strongest 95\%-CL bounds we find are from LEP data at $\sqrt{s} = 136.23$~GeV, namely $g_{\rm PV}/\Lambda \lesssim 6.3 \times 10^{-13} \, {\rm eV}^{-1}$ and $g_{\rm T} \lesssim 1.3 \times 10^{-12} \left( m/{\rm eV} \right)$, both for $m \ll \sqrt{s}$ (here $\Lambda$ is a characteristic energy scale). These limits can be improved in upcoming lepton colliders due to enhanced precision, as well as higher energies.</description>

      <title>Probing conventional and new physics at the ESS with coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential of the European Spallation Source (ESS) in probing physics within and beyond the Standard Model (SM), based on future measurements of coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering (CE$\nu$NS). We consider two SM physics cases, namely the weak mixing angle and the nuclear radius. Regarding physics beyond the SM, we focus on neutrino generalized interactions (NGIs) and on various aspects of sterile neutrino and sterile neutral lepton phenomenology. For this, we explore the violation of lepton unitarity, active-sterile oscillations as well as interesting upscattering channels such as the sterile dipole portal and the production of sterile neutral leptons via NGIs. The projected ESS sensitivities are estimated by performing a statistical analysis considering the various CE$\nu$NS detectors and expected backgrounds. We find that the enhanced statistics achievable in view of the highly intense ESS neutrino beam, will offer a drastic improvement in the current constraints obtained from existing CE$\nu$NS measurements. Finally, we discuss how the ESS has the potential to provide the leading CE$\nu$NS-based constraints, complementing also further experimental probes and astrophysical observations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16588v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a recent work [Phys. Rev. D 110, 023520 (2024)], a baryogenesis scenario was proposed in which our visible Universe is a 3-brane coevolving with a hidden 3-brane in a multidimensional bulk, giving rise to a new pseudo-scalar boson. In the present paper, one shows that this boson may survive as a relic from the early Universe, forming a minor component of dark matter. Remarkably, a one-loop process enables an ultra-weak yet non-zero coupling to photons, leading to a distinctive scattering signature. One explores this effect and argues that subtle light scattering around blue giant stars could provide observational constraints on the boson's properties, thereby testing the underlying baryogenesis scenario with current and future observation instruments.</description>

      <title>Misconceptions in Neutrino Oscillations in presence of a non-Unitary Mixing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Deviations from unitarity of the CKM matrix in the quark sector are considered excellent windows to probe physics beyond the Standard Model. In its leptonic counterpart, the PMNS matrix, these searches are particularly motivated, as the new physics needed to generate neutrino masses often leads to non-unitary mixing among the standard neutrinos. It is then interesting to consider how neutrino oscillations are affected in such scenario. This simple question is, however, subject to several subtleties: What is the correct way to define oscillation probabilities for a non-unitary mixing matrix? Do these probabilities add up to one? Does a non-unitary mixing matrix lead to observable flavor transitions at zero distance? What is the interplay between unitarity constraints obtained from neutrino oscillations and from electroweak precision data? This work aims to shed light on these issues and to clarify the corresponding misconceptions commonly found in the literature. We also compile updated bounds from neutrino oscillation searches to compare with those from flavour and electroweak precision observables.</description>

      <title>Investigation of box diagrams for the peak of $Z_{cs}(3985)$ in $e^+e^- \to D^-_s D^{*0} K^+$ and $ D^{*-}_s D^0 K^+$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The BESIII collaboration recently observed a charged hidden-charm structure with strangeness in the recoil mass spectrum of $K^+$ in the processes $e^+e^- \to D^-_s D^{*0} K^+$ or $D^{*-}_s D^0 K^+$, named as $Z_{cs}(3985)^-$. Within the energy region around the peak of $Z_{cs}(3985)$, various box diagrams are present. A systematic study of these box diagrams reveals the existence of a box singularity. Dalitz plots and invariant mass distributions of two charmed mesons from the box diagram for the processes $e^+e^- \to D^-_s D^{*0} K^+$ and $D^{*-}_s D^0 K^+$ are presented at five energy points $\sqrt s = 4.628,\,4.641,\,4.661,\,4.681$, and $4.698$ GeV. It is found that these box diagrams can generate peaks similar to those observed in experiments, suggesting that the peak of $Z_{cs}(3985)$ may be attributed to the box singularity contribution. Additionally, slight differences in the invariant mass spectra of $D^-_s D^{*0}$ and $D^{*-}_s D^0 K^+$ are identified based on the box diagrams, needing further experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Thermal Fermion Propagators and Flavor-Changing via Loop Corrections in the Early Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.01150v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the Minimally Extended Standard Model in the mass basis in the symmetric phase of the early Universe, demonstrating that the CP-violating CKM and PMNS matrices emerge not only in the weak interactions but also in the Yukawa interactions. This is due to the presence of all four components of the Higgs field. Specifically, left-handed fermions acquire additional thermal mass contributions involving the CKM and PMNS matrix elements. Most notably, the structure of Yukawa interactions enables flavor-changing and CP-violating conversions among left-handed fermions, such as $u_L\leftrightarrow c_L$, which do not occur in the broken phase.
  In contrast, the right-handed fermions retain their mass eigenstates, leading to distinct thermal masses. Additionally, we identify novel CP-violating scattering processes, such as $u_L\bar{c}_L\rightarrow 2A_3$, which are exclusive to the symmetric phase.</description>

Abstract: Searches for neutrino isocurvature usually constrain a specific linear combination of isocurvature perturbations. In this work, we discuss realistic cosmological scenarios giving rise to neutrino isocurvature. We show that in general both, neutrino and matter isocurvature perturbations are generated, whose ratio we parameterize by a newly introduced mixing angle. We obtain the first limits on this new mixing angle from PLANCK data, and discuss novel insights into the early Universe that could be provided by future measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.20045v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dark Matter (DM) is a known unknown. Apart, current experimental constraints on flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) processes involving up-type quarks also provide scope to explore physics beyond the Standard Model (SM). In this article, we establish a connection between the flavor sector and the DM sector with minimal extension of the SM. Here a singlet complex scalar field, stable under $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry, acts as DM and couples to SM up-type quarks through a heavy Dirac vector-like quark (VLQ), which shares the same $\mathbb{Z}_3$ charge as of the DM. The model thus addresses the observed $D^0-\bar{D^0}$ mixing, top-FCNC interactions, and $D^0$ meson decays, together with DM relic density, while evading the direct and indirect DM search bounds. The model can be probed at the future high-energy muon collider, through distinctive signatures of VLQ production, where the VLQ decays into DM and SM particles, abiding by the existing bounds.</description>

      <title>Role of the short-range dynamics in simultaneous interpretation of $P_{cs}$ pentaqurks via $\Xi_c^{(\prime,*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.02601v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate hidden-charm molecular states in $\Xi_c^{(\prime,*)}\bar{D}^{(*)}$ systems using the one-boson exchange model. By regulating the short-range interactions with parameter $a$ and cutoff $\Lambda$, we found ten bound states in isoscalar systems. Our analysis reveals that if the LHCb's $P_{cs}(4459)$ and Belle's $P_{cs}(4472)$ pentaqurks are indeed distinct states, their mass splitting can be resolved through $\Xi_c^{\prime}\bar{D}$-$\Xi_c\bar{D}^*$ coupled-channel dynamics using consistent model parameters. This framework assigns $3/2^-$ and $1/2^-$ spin-parity quantum numbers to $P_{cs}(4459)$ and $P_{cs}(4472)$, respectively. With this consistent model parameter, we predict several new molecular candidates in the 4.3-4.7 GeV mass region, demonstrating the crucial interplay between coupled-channel effects and short-range dynamics in understanding hidden-charm pentaquarks as hadronic molecules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine toponium formation effects in top-antitop pair production at the LHC, focusing on the near-threshold region where non-relativistic corrections are relevant. We discuss their modelling using non-relativistic QCD Green's functions, and show that predictions reproduce features expected from bound-state dynamics, in contrast to pseudo-scalar toy models.</description>

      <title>Collisional and radiative energy loss in small systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14426v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an energy loss model which includes small system size corrections to both the radiative and elastic energy loss. Our model is used to compute the nuclear modification factor $R_{AB}$ of light and heavy flavor hadrons, averaged over realistic collision geometries for central and peripheral $A+A$ and central $p / d / {}^3\text{He} + A$ collisions at LHC and RHIC. We find that the predicted suppression in small systems is almost entirely due to elastic energy loss. Our results are keenly sensitive to the crossover between elastic energy loss calculated with hard thermal loop propagators and vacuum propagators, respectively, which leads to a large theoretical uncertainty. We find that the $R_{AB}$ is largely insensitive to the form of the elastic energy loss distribution - Gaussian or Poisson - surprisingly so in small systems where the central limit theorem is inapplicable. We present an expansion of the $R_{AB}$ in terms of the moments of the energy loss probability distribution, which allows for a rigorous understanding of the dependence of the $R_{AB}$ on the underlying energy loss distribution.</description>

      <title>Light Nuclei Femtoscopy and Baryon Interactions in 3 GeV Au+Au Collisions at RHIC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the measurements of proton-deuteron ($p$-$d$) and deuteron-deuteron ($d$-$d$) correlation functions in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_\mathrm{NN}}$ = 3 GeV using fixed-target mode with the STAR experiment at the Relativistic Heavy-Ion Collider (RHIC). For the first time, the source size ($R_{G}$), scattering length ($f_{0}$), and effective range ($d_{0}$) are extracted from the measured correlation functions with a simultaneous fit. The spin-averaged $f_0$ for $p$-$d$ and $d$-$d$ interactions are determined to be -5.28 $\pm$ 0.11(stat.) $\pm$ 0.82(syst.) fm and -2.62 $\pm$ 0.02(stat.) $\pm$ 0.24(syst.) fm, respectively. The measured $p$-$d$ interaction is consistent with theoretical calculations and low-energy scattering experiment results, demonstrating the feasibility of extracting interaction parameters using the femtoscopy technique. The reasonable agreement between the experimental data and the calculations from the transport model indicates that deuteron production in these collisions is primarily governed by nucleon coalescence.</description>

      <title>Attosecond physics hidden in Cherenkov radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00212v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cherenkov radiation of charged particles moving with superluminal velocities in transparent media is a well-studied phenomenon with a plethora of applications. Its microscopic origins can be traced to the polarization of atomic shells, characterized by time scales in the subfemtosecond range - dynamics that eludes conventional macroscopic treatment. Here we present a theoretical framework for probing the intrinsic dynamics of Cherenkov radiation, unveiling quantum features absent in classical realm and even in a fully quantum theory in momentum space. These features include a finite formation length and spreading time of the photon, the latter becoming negative nearby the Cherenkov angle, a finite flash duration tied to the size of the electron packet, along with a shift in the photon arrival time that can be either positive or negative and necessitates going beyond the far-field approximation. The calculated time scales lie in the attosecond range for the relevant parameters, thus linking this macroscopic phenomenon back to its atomic origins. Finally, we propose that by measuring the duration of the Cherenkov flash one can in principle retrieve the length of the emitting packet, deepening our understanding of quantum coherence effects in photon emission.</description>

      <title>Non-local effective field theory in general relativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11990v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by known facts about effective field theory and non-Abelian gauge theory, we argue that the post-Newtonian approximation might fail even in the limit of weak fields and small velocities under certain conditions. Namely, the post-Newtonian approximation might break down for wide extended bodies with angular momentum, where angular momentum spans significant spacetime curvature. We construct a novel dimensionless quantity that samples this breakdown, and we evaluate it by means of existing analytical solutions of rotating extended bodies and observational data. We give estimates for galaxies and binary systems, as well as our home in the Cosmos, Laniakea. We thus propose that a novel effective field theory of general relativity is needed to account for the onset of nonlocal angular momentum effetcs, with significant consequences for gravitational physics and cosmology at large.</description>

      <title>False vacuum decay beyond the quadratic approximation: summation of non-local self-energies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18421v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using the 2PI effective action formalism, we study false vacuum decay beyond the quadratic approximation of the path integral. We derive a coupled system of equations for the bounce and the propagator, and we compute a semi-analytic expression for the self-energy of a real scalar field with cubic and quartic interactions from the 2PI effective action truncated at two loops and without further approximations. Deriving numerical results, we can show that the Hartree approximation, where non-local contributions to the self-energy are neglected, is generally not justified. The procedure we develop is a key step towards the explicit computation of the quantum corrected bounce, the determinant of fluctuations about it and the decay rate in the presence of classical zero-modes that are lifted by quantum effects, e.g. classically scale-invariant models relevant for assessing the Higgs stability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The path optimization method with machine learning is applied to the one-dimensional massive lattice Thirring model, which has the sign problem caused by the fermion determinant. This study aims to investigate how the path optimization method works for the sign problem. We show that the path optimization method successfully reduces statistical errors and reproduces the analytic results. We also examine an approximation of the Jacobian calculation in the learning process and show that it gives consistent results with those without an approximation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08707v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that the superhorizon-limit curvature perturbations are conserved at one-loop level in single-field inflation models with a transient non-slow-roll period. We take the spatially-flat gauge, where the backreaction plays a crucial role for the conservation of superhorizon curvature perturbations unless the counter terms are tuned. We calculate the backreaction with the in-in formalism. In addition, we explicitly show the renormalization of the UV divergences with the counter terms.</description>

      <title>A Model of Realistic Flavour Symmetry: Origin of Fermion Mass, Flavour Mixing and Leptogenesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I proposed a unified model of particle physic and cosmology in \cite {1}, which can successfully account for many things of the inflation, dark energy, dark matter, neutrino mass and baryogenesis. Based on the model, I here focus on the fermion flavour issues, I introduce a realistic flavour symmetry to address the fermion mass and mixing, establish the relationship of the quark mixing and lepton mixing, and clarify the source of the difference between them. From the model Lagrangian I derive a neutrino mass matrix with a special structure form and fewer parameters, its numerical solutions are precisely fitting to all the data of the neutrino mass spectrum and lepton mixing, and clearly show a stable predicting power. In addition, I suggest a new scenario of the leptogenesis, which arises from two CP-asymmetric decays of a superheavy neutral Dirac fermion. This mechanism is closely related to the neutrino flavour violation, I derive its relationship with the neutrino mass and mixing. In short, the model can simply and elegantly address the fermion flavour issues and account for the matter-antimatter asymmetry, therefore it is very realistic and believable, we expect the ongoing and future experiments to test the model.</description>

      <title>Reheating ACTs on Starobinsky and Higgs inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01129v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the recent sixth data release (DR6) of the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) collaboration, the value of $n_{\rm s}=0.9743 \pm 0.0034$ for the scalar spectral index is reported, which excludes the Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models at $2\sigma$ level. In this paper, we perform a Bayesian inference of the parameters of the Starobinsky or Higgs inflationary model with non-instantaneous reheating using the Markov chain Monte Carlo method. For the analysis, we use observational data on the cosmic microwave background collected by the Planck and ACT collaborations and on baryonic acoustic oscillations from the DESI collaboration. The reheating stage is modelled by a single parameter $R_{\rm reh}$. Using the modified Boltzmann code CLASS and the cobaya software with the GetDist package, we perform a direct inference of the model parameter space and obtain their posterior distributions. Using the Kullback--Leibler divergence, we estimate the information gain from the data, yielding $2.52$ bits for the reheating parameter. Inclusion of the ACT DR6 data provides $75\%$ more information about the reheating stage compared to analysis without ACT data. We draw constraints on the reheating temperature and the average equation of state. While the former can vary within $10$ orders of magnitude, values in the $95\%$ credible interval indicate a sufficiently low reheating temperature; for the latter there is a clear preference for values greater than $0.5$, which means that the conventional equations of state for dust $\omega=0$ and relativistic matter $\omega=1/3$ are excluded with more than $2\sigma$ level of significance. However, there still is a big part of parameter space where Starobinsky and Higgs inflationary models exhibit a high degree of consistency with the latest observational data, particularly from ACT DR6. Therefore, it is premature to reject these models.</description>

      <title>Manifest Gauge Invariance for Structure Dependent Radiative Corrections to Processes Involving Atoms and Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Radiative corrections to reactions involving atoms or nuclei can become sensitive to the structure of the bound state. Generically, one encounters correlation functions of multiple currents which must satisfy Ward identities. At intermediate steps, however the Ward identities are obscured, and often violated by physically motivated approximation schemes. In this paper we outline a method to construct a representation of the aforementioned correlators that manifests gauge invariance in the limit of a heavy target (i.e., when recoil energy can be neglected). This representation then enables manifestly gauge invariant approximation schemes. Furthermore, the proposed representation naturally separates the largest contributions that dominate scattering amplitudes in the limit of a heavy constituent (e.g., proton) mass. We analyze elastic electron scattering from nuclei in detail, and also discuss radiative corrections to processes mediated by the weak interaction.</description>
