      <title>Theoretical study of the $\Sigma N$ cusp in the $K^-d\rightarrow\pi\Lambda N$ reaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14227v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $K^-d\rightarrow\pi\Lambda N$ reaction is useful for exploring the hyperon-nucleon interaction through final state interactions. In particular, the cusp structure of the $\Lambda N$ invariant mass spectrum at the $\Sigma N$ threshold contains information about the s-wave interaction of 1/2-isospin hyperon-nucleon systems. The calculation of the spectrum is performed with the aim of extracting the scattering length of the $\Sigma N(I=1/2)$ channel that couples to the $\Lambda N$ channel from this reaction, and the results are discussed in comparison with experimental data to highlight the factors that should be considered.</description>

      <title>Longitudinal flow decorrelations in small collision systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study presents a detailed analysis of longitudinal flow decorrelations in light ion collisions at both Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider(LHC) energies, focusing on various \textit{ab-initio} models of oxygen structure. We identify that the correlator $V_{2\Delta}$ effectively differentiates between the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) structure and other models, such as Nuclear Lattice Effective Field Theory (NLEFT) and the Projected Generator Coordinate Method (PGCM), revealing similar behaviors between the latter two. By utilizing the isolated non-spherical components, we highlight significant negative contributions in the structure generated by VMC compared to the other configurations. Additionally, we show that employing decorrelation $r_2$ to mitigate non-flow effects proves beneficial in identifying various modeled structures. We further examine flow decorrelations across different systems, including d+Au and O+O collisions at 200 GeV, as well as Ne+Ne and O+O collisions at 6.37 TeV, indicating a hierarchy in decorrelations that underscores the complexity of these interactions. Our findings emphasize that the role of asymmetry in d+Au collisions and its impact on flow correlations is mitigated by the correlator $V_{2\Delta} (\eta, \eta_{\text{ref}} )$. Additionally, our analysis of flow angle decorrelations shows diverse distributions of $\cos(2\Delta\psi_2)$ vs. overall flow magnitude in d+Au collisions compared to those in other collision systems, as indicated by the mean value of $\cos(2\Delta\psi_2)$.</description>

      <title>QED corrections to the parity-violating asymmetry in high-energy electron-nucleus collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The parity-violating asymmetry, including leading-order QED corrections to the Coulomb potential, is calculated non-perturbatively by solving the Dirac equation. At GeV collision energies and forward scattering angles, QED effects enhance the asymmetry by approximately 5% for the recently measured nuclei 27Al, 48Ca, and 208Pb. The corrections result in a shift of the estimated neutron radius, leading to an increase in the inferred neutron skin thicknesses of these nuclei and, thus, to the pressure neutrons feel around nuclear saturation density.</description>

      <title>Level shifts of exotic deuterium atoms from effective range parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14407v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss various methods for determining the level shifts induced by short-range interactions in exotic atoms which are formed by a hadron and a nucleus of opposite charge. The energy shifts can be related to the effective range parameters through Deser or Trueman formulas. In order to assess the accuracy and the reliability of this indirect approach, its predictions are compared with direct bound-state calculations. Notably, the importance of including the Coulomb potential in scattering calculations is highlighted. Finally, the impact of multipole terms in the asymptotic electromagnetic interaction is examined. It is demonstrated that an indirect approach remains relevant by accounting for these effects perturbatively.</description>

      <title>Study on axial fields in the dynamically assisted Schwinger effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14283v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dynamically assisted Schwinger effect, the generation of fermion-antifermion pairs in vacuum under a strong, slow-varying field and a weak, high-frequency field, has become a promising avenue to probe the vacuum structure and the nonlinear dynamics of QED. However, the role of axial fields in this phenomenon has remained underexplored. This study aims at analyzing how spatial axial fields influence particle production in the dynamically assisted Schwinger effect. Employing the high-frequency effective theory based on the Floquet-Magnus expansion, we demonstrate that a spatial axial field can occur as the effective field of a circular polarized high-frequency plane wave and significantly increase the number of fermions produced across different timescales. This enhancement offers both theoretical insights and useful tools for the experimental implementation of the Schwinger effect.</description>

      <title>Can one-loop corrections to the one-gluon exchange potential adequately describe the charmed meson spectrum?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14386v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the charmed meson spectrum using a constituent quark model (CQM) with one-loop corrections applied to the one-gluon exchange (OGE) potential. The study aims to understand if these one-loop corrections sufficiently account for the charmed meson spectrum observed experimentally, without invoking exotic configurations like tetraquarks. Within this model, charmed mesons' masses are computed, comparing theoretical predictions to experimental data. The results suggest that the model, with one-loop OGE corrections, generally reproduces mass splittings and level ordering observed for charmed mesons. Discrepancies, particularly in P-wave states, are addressed by incorporating higher-order interaction terms. The findings emphasize that while the traditional quark model is limited in fully describing charmed mesons, enhanced potential terms may bridge the gap with experimental observations. The study contributes a framework for predicting excited charmed meson states for future experimental validation.</description>

      <title>Automated NLO calculations for asymmetric hadron-hadron collisions in MadGraph5_aMC@NLO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14487v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have extended {\tt MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO} capabilities by implementing computations for asymmetric hadron-hadron collisions, including proton-nucleus, pion-hadron or nucleus-nucleus collisions in order to obtain a tool for automated perturbative computations of cross sections (or ratios of cross sections) in asymmetric reactions at next-to-leading (NLO) order in $\alpha_S$ in collinear factorisation. This tool, like the original symmetric version of \texttt{MadGraph5\_aMC@NLO}, automatically computes cross sections for different factorisation and renormalisation scales and PDFs provided by the {\tt LHAPDF} library, thereby allowing for an easy assessment of the associated theoretical uncertainties. In this paper, we present the validation of our code using $W$ and $Z$ boson production in $p$Pb collisions and Drell-Yan-pair production in $\pi W$ collisions. We also illustrate the capabilities of the framework by providing cross section and nuclear modification factors with their uncertainties for the production of $W$ and $Z$ bosons, charm and bottom quarks as well as associated production of $b\bar b+H^0$ in $p$Pb collisions at the LHC.</description>

      <title>Radiative corrections to the spin asymmetry in elastic polarized electron-nucleus collisions at high energy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modifying the numerical codes, dispersion corrections to the beam-normal spin asymmetry which arise from low-lying transient nuclear excitations up to 30 MeV, are estimated for collision energies between 50 MeV and 1 GeV. A nonperturbative calculation of vacuum polarization and the vertex plus self-energy correction, using optimized potentials, indicates that for small scattering angles both these quantum electrodynamical (QED) effects on the spin asymmetry decrease with energy above 200 MeV and can be neglected at high energies. Examples are given for the 12C and 208Pb nuclei. The available measurements of the spin asymmetry at collision energies beyond 500 MeV cannot be explained by the present theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.01836v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish robust relations between Transverse Momentum Dependent distributions (TMDs) and collinear distributions. We define weighted integrals of TMDs that we call Transverse Momentum Moments (TMMs) and prove that TMMs are equal to collinear distributions evaluated in some minimal subtraction scheme. The conversion to the modified minimal subtraction ($\bar{MS}$) scheme, can be done by a calculable factor, which we derive up to three loops for some cases. We discuss in detail the zeroth, the first, and the second TMMs and provide phenomenological results for them based on the current extractions of TMDs. The results of this paper open new avenues for theoretical and phenomenological investigation of the three-dimensional and collinear hadron structures.</description>

      <title>Strongly vs. weakly coupled in-medium showers: energy stopping in large-$N_f$ QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19008v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inside a medium, showers originating from a very high-energy particle may develop via medium-induced splitting processes such as hard bremsstrahlung or pair production. During shower development, two consecutive splittings sometimes overlap quantum mechanically, so that they cannot be treated independently. Some of these effects can be absorbed into an effective value of a medium parameter known as $\hat q$. Previous calculations (with certain simplifying assumptions) have found that, after adjusting the value of $\hat q$, the leftover effect of overlapping splittings is quite small for purely gluonic large-$N_c$ showers but is very much larger for large-$N_f$ QED showers, at comparable values of $N\alpha$. Those works did not quite make for apples-to-apples comparisons: the gluon shower work investigated energy deposition from a gluon-initiated shower, whereas the QED work investigated charge-deposition from an electron-initiated shower. As a first step to tighten up the comparison, this paper investigates energy deposition in the QED case. Along the way, we develop a framework that should be useful in the future to explore whether the very small effect of overlapping splitting in purely gluonic showers is an artifact of having ignored quarks.</description>

      <title>Detailed nuclear structure calculations for coherent elastic neutrino-nucleus scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20060</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.20060v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Any discovery of `new physics' in the neutrino sector first requires a precise prediction of the expected Standard Model cross section. Currently, Coherent Elastic neutrino-Nucleus Scattering (CEvNS) experiments are statistics limited. However, as new and future experiments scale up, it will be necessary to improve the theoretical predictions. Here we review the calculation of the CEvNS cross section in a consistent theory of hadronic currents and compute the relevant nuclear form factors using the nuclear shell model. The uncertainty on the form factors is explored by repeating the calculation for various shell model interactions and with Skyme-Hartree-Fock evaluations of the Weak-charge radii. We then refine the Standard Model predictions for the recent experimental results of the COHERENT experiment. We find that our cross sections are in good agreement with previous predictions, but with significantly smaller uncertainties - by up to a factor of 10. Near-future CEvNS experiments will meaningfully benefit from improved predictions through an increased sensitivity to new-physics signals.</description>

      <title>QCD constraints on isospin-dense matter and the nuclear equation of state</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.09273v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of dense hadronic matter is a central goal in nuclear physics as it governs the nature and dynamics of astrophysical objects such as supernovae and neutron stars. Because of the non-perturbative nature of quantum chromodynamics (QCD), little is known rigorously about hadronic matter in these extreme conditions. Here, lattice QCD calculations are used to compute thermodynamic quantities and the equation of state of QCD over a wide range of isospin chemical potentials with controlled systematic uncertainties. Agreement is seen with chiral perturbation theory when the chemical potential is small. Comparison to perturbative QCD at large chemical potential allows for an estimate of the gap in the superconducting phase, and this quantity is seen to agree with perturbative determinations. Since the partition function for an isospin chemical potential, $\mu_I$, bounds the partition function for a baryon chemical potential $\mu_B=3\mu_I/2$, these calculations also provide rigorous non-perturbative QCD bounds on the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state over a wide range of baryon densities for the first time.</description>

Here, by investigating the same problem for QCD with *quarks* in the large-$N_f$ limit of many quark flavors, we make a first study of whether the small effect in purely gluonic showers (i) was merely an accident or (ii) is more broadly characteristic of such overlap effects in QCD. We also offer a qualitative explanation for the large size of the effect in QED vs. QCD.</description>
