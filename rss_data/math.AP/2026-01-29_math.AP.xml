      <title>The Verigin problem with phase transition as a Wasserstein flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the modeling of a compressible two-phase flow in a porous medium. The governing free boundary problem is known as the Verigin problem with phase transition. We introduce a novel variational framework to construct weak solutions. Our approach reveals the gradient-flow structure of the system by adopting a minimizing movement scheme using the Wasserstein distance. We prove the convergence of the scheme, obtaining ``relaxed" distributional solutions in the limit that satisfy an optimal energy-dissipation rate. Under the additional assumptions that $d \geq 3$ and that the discrete mass densities are uniformly Muckenhoupt weights, we show that the limit is the characteristic function of a set of finite perimeter in the region where there is no vacuum.</description>

      <title>Positive normalized solutions to a singular elliptic equation with a $L^2$-supercritical nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the existence of positive normalized solutions to the singular elliptic equation \[ -\Delta u + \lambda u = u^{-r} + u^{p-1} \quad \text{in } \Omega, \] with the Dirichlet boundary condition $u=0$ on $\partial\Omega$ and the normalization constraint $\int_\Omega u^2\,dx = \rho$. Here $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\ge3$) is a smooth bounded domain, $0&lt;r&lt;1$, $2+\frac{4}{N}&lt;p&lt;2^*$, where $2^*$ is the critical Sobolev exponent, and $\lambda\in\mathbb{R}$ is a Lagrange multiplier. We obtain that for sufficiently small $\rho&gt;0$, the problem admits a positive solution $(\lambda,u)\in\mathbb{R}\times H_0^1(\Omega)$. The proof is based on a variational approach using a regularized functional and a careful analysis of the limiting process.</description>

      <title>Mode-Wise Spectral Criteria for Coupled Mass Transport in Hybrid PDE--ODE Tumor Microenvironments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study coupled mass transport in a tumor--microenvironment setting with two motile densities $(S,R)$ and non-motile state switching $(P,A)$. The populations diffuse and undergo chemotactic drift; $(P,A)$ follow pointwise ODE switching. A decoupled inhibitory field $D$ satisfies a damped Neumann heat equation, giving maximum-principle bounds and exponential decay. Together with the pointwise invariant $P+A$, these identities yield global existence, positivity, and long-time reduction to limiting $(S,R)$ kinetics with a unique globally attracting coexistence state. Neumann eigenmode reduction gives closed dispersion relations. The base $(S,R)$ reaction--diffusion block remains stable for all nonconstant modes for any $d_S,d_R&gt;0$, excluding classical Turing destabilization. Chemotaxis is posed via a diffusive cue $c$, since $\nabla A$ is undefined for non-diffusive $A$. In one-way damped coupling, the linearized mode matrix is block triangular and leaves the $(S,R)$ spectrum unchanged. Two-way coupling adds a feedback rank-one mobility correction, induces effective cross-diffusion, and admits mode growth. We give explicit trace/determinant criteria for unstable Laplacian modes and the resulting instability thresholds.</description>

      <title>The scattering map for the Schrodinger operator on curved spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20225v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $P$ be a Schr\"odinger operator $D_t+\Delta_g$ with metric and potential perturbation that are compactly supported in spacetime $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$.
  Here $D_t = -i \partial_t$ and $\Delta_g$ is the positive Laplacian.
  We consider the scattering map $S$ defined previously by the first author with Gell-Redman and Gomes arXiv:2201.03140, which relates the asymptotic data, as $t \to \pm \infty$, of global solutions $u$ to $Pu = 0$. We show that $S$ is a `1-cusp' Fourier integral operator, where `1-cusp' refers to a pseudodifferential calculus introduced by Vasy and Zachos arXiv:2204.11706 in the completely different setting of inverse problems on asymptotically conic manifolds. Our viewpoint is that 1-cusp geometry is the natural setting for studying the asymptotic data of solutions to Schr\"odinger's equation.</description>

      <title>On the Damped Euler--Monge--Amp\`ere equations with Radial Symmetry: Critical Thresholds and Large-Time Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20266</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20266v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the global well-posedness and large-time dynamics of the pressureless Euler--Monge--Amp\`ere (EMA) system with velocity damping in multidimensions, subject to radially symmetric initial data. We first establish the phenomenon of critical thresholds, where subcritical initial data maintain global regularity, and supercritical initial data lead to finite time singularity formation. We provide two methods for constructing these thresholds: a refined spectral dynamics approach based on \cite{liu2002spectral} and a comparison principle based on Lyapunov functions introduced in \cite{bhatnagar2020critical2}.
  A key finding of this work is that the inclusion of linear damping effectively removes the initial density lower bound previously required in the undamped case \cite{tadmor2022critical} in certain regimes, allowing for global regularity even in the presence of vacuum or arbitrarily low density. Furthermore, for subcritical initial data, we prove an exponential decay rate to the equilibrium state. Our results unify and extend existing theories for 1D Euler--Poisson system and undamped multidimensional EMA system with radial symmetry.</description>

      <title>Norm inflation for quadratic derivative fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Cauchy problem for quadratic derivative fractional nonlinear Schr\"odinger equations on $\mathbb{R}$ or $\mathbb{T}$. We determine the sharp exponents of the fractional derivatives for which the Cauchy problem is well-posed in the Sobolev space. Thanks to the global well-posedness result established by Nakanishi and Wang (2025), we can expand the solution as a sum of iterated terms. By deriving estimates for each iterated term, we establish norm inflation with infinite loss of regularity, which in particular implies ill-posedness.</description>

      <title>On a two-season faecal-oral model with impulsive intervention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rainfall is associated with the outbreak of certain waterborne faecal-oral diseases, driving the implementation of various human interventions for their control and prevention. Taking into account human intervention and temporal variation in rainfall, this paper develops a two-season switching faecal-oral model with impulsive intervention and free boundaries. In this model, the infection fronts are represented by fixed boundaries during the dry season and by moving boundaries during the wet season, with impulsive intervention occurring at the end of each wet season. The simultaneous introduction of impulsive intervention and seasonal switching creates new difficulties for mathematical analysis. We overcome these challenges through novel analytical techniques, resulting in a spreading-vanishing dichotomy and a sharp criteria governing this dichotomy. Finally, numerical simulations are presented to validate the theoretical results and to visually illustrate the influence of seasonal switching and impulsive intervention. Our results mathematically explain that two factors, the duration of the dry season and the intensity of impulsive intervention are both positively correlated with effective disease control.</description>

      <title>On Eigenvalues of Logarithmic Potential Operator in the Hyperbolic Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20431v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded open set in the Poincar\'e hyperbolic disk, $\mathbb{D}$. In this article, we consider the hyperbolic logarithmic potential operator $\mathcal{L}_h : L^2(\Omega) \to L^2(\Omega)$, defined by \begin{equation*}
  \mathcal{L}_h u(z)=\frac{1}{2}\int_\Omega \log\frac{1}{[z,w]}\,u(w)\, {\,\rm d}(w), \end{equation*} and the associated eigenvalue problem on $\Omega$ \begin{equation}
  \mathcal{L}_h u=\tau u. \end{equation} We first extend the notion of polarization with respect to hyperplanes in the Poincar\'e disk and prove the associated properties. Then we establish a reverse Faber-Krahn inequality for the largest eigenvalue, $\tau_{h}$ of $\mathcal{L}_h$, under polarization. Further, we provide a representation formula for the eigenfunctions of $\mathcal{L}_h$. In addition, we show that the operator $\mathcal{L}_h$ is a positive operator on $L^2(\Omega)$.</description>

      <title>Fast reaction limits and convergence rate for nonlinear bulk-surface reaction-diffusion systems modeling reversible chemical reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20453v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The fast reaction limit for a nonlinear bulk-surface reaction-diffusion system is investigated. The system model describes a reversible reaction with arbitrary stoichiometric coefficients, where one chemical is present in a bounded vessel $\Omega$ and the other chemical lies only on the boundary $\partial\Omega$ where the reaction takes place. In the limit as the reaction rate constant tends to infinity, we prove that the solution converges strongly to that of a heat equation with nonlinear dynamical boundary condition. This is obtained by showing a-priori estimates of solutions which are uniform in the reaction rate constants. In order to overcome the difficulty caused by the bulk-surface coupling, we consider the limit in suitable product spaces where the Aubin-Lions lemma is applicable. Moreover, in the case of equal stoichiometric coefficients, we obtain the convergence rate of the fast reaction limit by exploiting suitable estimates of the limiting system.</description>

      <title>Existence and selection of solutions in the energy-variational framework with applications in fluid dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20455</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20455v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We provide a novel existence result for energy-variational solutions to a general class of evolutionary partial differential equations. Compared to previous works on this solution concept, the generalization is mainly twofold: a relaxation of the assumptions on the regularity weight and the admissibility of energies with merely linear growth. We apply the abstract theory to the Euler--Korteweg system and to the equation for binormal curvature flow, which serve as examples that require the first and second generalization, respectively. Moreover, we discuss criteria that are suitable for the selection of particular energy-variational solutions in the possibly multi-valued solution set.</description>

      <title>Regularity of Lipschitz free boundaries for weak solutions of Alt-Caffarelli type problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the Serrin problem, we study weak solutions of the generalised Alt-Caffarelli problem $-\Delta u = f$ in $\Omega$, $u = 0$ on $\partial\Omega$, $\partial_\nu u = Q$ on $\partial\Omega$. Our main result establishes that if $\Omega$ is Lipschitz, then it is actually $C^{\infty}$ (provided that $f$ and $Q$ are smooth). This was known before only for viscosity solutions. As a corollary, we obtain an alternative solution of Serrin's problem in the case of Lipschitz domains. We also discuss the characterisation of the regularity of Lipschitz domains in terms of their Poisson kernel.</description>

      <title>Normalized Solutions for a Weighted Laplacian Problem with the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg Critical Exponent</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article establishes the existence and multiplicity of normalized solutions to the weighted nonlinear Schr\"odinger-type equation governed by the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg operator, $$ -\text{div}(|x|^{-2a}\nabla u)=\lambda \frac{u}{|x|^{2a}}+\beta\frac{|u|^{q-2}u}{|x|^{bq}} +\frac{|u|^{2^{\sharp}-2}u}{|x|^{b{2^{\sharp}}}}\quad \text{in}~\mathbb{R}^N,$$ $$\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}\frac{|u|^2}{|x|^{2a}}dx=\rho^2,$$ where $\lambda\in \mathbb{R}$, $\beta,~\rho&gt;0$, $0&lt; a&lt;\frac{N-2}{2}$, $a&lt;b&lt;a+1$, $2^{\sharp}:=\frac{2N}{N-2(1+a-b)}$ and $2&lt;q&lt;{2^{\sharp}}$.
  Through constrained variational techniques, refined estimates on the best constants in the Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg inequalities, and a bespoke concentration-compactness lemma, the study secures mass-subcritical ground states alongside multiple constrained critical points, together with high-energy ground state solutions in the mass-critical and supercritical regimes -- notwithstanding the noncompactness arising from the critical Caffarelli-Kohn-Nirenberg nonlinearity over the unbounded domain.</description>

      <title>Refined Strichartz estimates and their orthornomal counterparts for Schr\"odinger equations on torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the paper is twofold. We establish refined Strichartz estimates for the Schr\"odinger equation on tori within the framework of partial regularity. As a result, we reveal that the solution of the free Schr\"odinger equation has better regularity in mixed Lebesgue spaces. This complements the well-established theory over the past few decades, where initial data comes from the Sobolev space with respect to all spatial variables. As an application, we obtain local well-posedness for non-gauge-invariant nonlinearities with partially regular initial data. On the other hand, we extend refined Strichartz estimates for infinite systems of orthonormal functions, which generalizes the classical orthonormal Strichartz estimates on the torus by Nakamura [41] . As an application, we establish well-posedness for the Hartree equation for infinitely many fermions in some Schatten spaces. In the process, we develop several harmonic analysis tools for mixed Lebesgue spaces, e.g. Fourier multiplier transference principle, vector-valued Bernstein inequality, and vector-valued Littlewood--Paley theory for densities of operators, which may be of independent interest and complement the results of [45,55].</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the $\Gamma$-convergence of Ambrosio-Tortorelli type-functionals for circle valued functions, in the case of volume terms with linear growth. We show the emergence of a non-local $\Gamma$-limit, which is due to the topological structure of the target space, and discuss compactness of minimal liftings. Our results extend the analysis of a previous work on the quadratic case.</description>

Abstract: We consider on an arbitrary Riemannian manifold $M$ the \textit{Leibenson equation} $\partial _{t}u=\Delta _{p}u^{q}$, that is also known as a \textit{doubly nonlinear evolution equation}. We prove that if $p&gt;1, q&gt;0$ and $pq\geq 1$ then the Cauchy-problem \begin{equation*} \left\{\begin{array}{ll}\partial _{t}u=\Delta _{p}u^{q} &amp;\text{in}~M\times (0, \infty), \\u(x, 0)=u_{0}(x)&amp; \text{in}~M,
  \end{array}%
  \right. \end{equation*} has a weak solution for any $u_{0}\in L^{1}(M)\cap L^{\infty}(M)$.</description>

      <title>Large positive solutions for a class of 1-D diffusive logistic problems with general boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The first goal of this paper is to establish the existence of a positive solution for the singular boundary value problem (1.1), where $\mathcal{B}$ is a general boundary operator of Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin type, either classical or non-classical; in the sense that, as soon as $\mathcal{B}u(0)=-u'(0)+\beta u(0)$, the coefficient $\beta$ can take any real value, not necessarily $\beta\geq 0$ as in the classical Sturm--Liouville theory. Since the function $f(u):=au^p -\lambda u$, $u\geq 0$, is not increasing if $\lambda&gt;0$, the uniqueness of the positive solution of (1.1) is far from obvious, in general, even for the simplest case when $a(x)$ is a positive constant. The second goal of this paper is to establish the uniqueness of the positive solution of (1.1) in that case. At a later stage, denoting by $L_\lambda$ the unique positive solution of (1.1) when $a(x)$ is a positive constant, we will characterize the point-wise behavior of $L_\lambda$ as $\lambda\to \pm \infty$. It turns out that any positive solution of (1.1) mimics the behavior of $L_\lambda$ as $\lambda \to \pm\infty$. Finally, we will establish the uniqueness of the positive solution of (1.1) when $a(x)$ is non-increasing in $[0,R]$, $\lambda\geq 0$, and $\beta&lt;0$ if $-u'(0)+\beta u(0)=0$.</description>

      <title>Spectral stability of shock profiles for the Navier-Stokes-Poisson system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the spectral stability of small-amplitude shock profiles for the one-dimensional isothermal Navier-Stokes-Poisson system, which describes ion dynamics in a collision-dominated plasma. Specifically, we establish (i) bounds on the essential spectrum, (ii) bounds on the point spectrum, and (iii) simplicity of the zero eigenvalue for the linearized operator about the profile in $L^2$. The result in (i) shows that the zero eigenvalue arising from translation invariance is embedded in the essential spectrum. Consequently, the standard Evans function approach cannot be applied directly to prove (iii). To resolve this, we employ an Evans-function framework that extends into regions of the essential spectrum, thereby enabling us to compute the derivative of the Evans function at the origin. Our result establishes that this derivative admits a factorization into two factors: one associated with transversality of the connecting profile and the other with hyperbolic stability of the corresponding shock of the quasi-neutral Euler system. We further show that both factors are nonzero, which implies simplicity of the zero eigenvalue.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This manuscript investigates the existence and spectral stability of multiple periodic standing wave solutions for a nonlinear Schr\"odinger system. By considering both cnoidal and snoidal profiles, we provide a comprehensive spectral analysis of the associated linearized operators, employing the Floquet theory and comparison theorems. Stability results are derived under periodic perturbations with the same period as the underlying standing waves. Furthermore, we apply the spectral stability theory via Krein signature to determine the spectral stability and instability results.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we generalize the famous result of [FKS] to the double phase model. In particular, we work with minimal assumptions on the modulating coefficient by introducing a Muckenhoupt-type condition on generalized Orlicz spaces. We develop a complete theory equivalent to that of classical Muckenhoupt weights, including the boundedness of the maximal operator and Sobolev-Poincare estimates. We combine this with the De~Giorgi technique to show H\"older continuity of the solutions.</description>

      <title>Continuum of finite point blowup rates for the critical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20801</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20801v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For any $\nu\in(\frac 37,\frac12)$, we prove the existence of an $H^1$ solution $u$ of the mass critical generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation on the time interval $(0,T_0]$, for some $T_0&gt;0$, which blows up at the time $t=0$ and at the point $x=0$ with the rate $\|\partial_x u (t,x)\|_{L^2} \approx t^{-\nu}$. Such a blowup rate is associated to a blowup residue of the form $r_\alpha(x)= x^{\alpha -\frac 12}$ for $x&gt;0$ close to the blowup point, where $\alpha=\frac{3\nu-1}{2-4\nu}$. The condition $\nu\in(\frac37,\frac12)$ is equivalent to $\alpha&gt;1$, which corresponds to the full range for which the residue $r_\alpha$ belongs to $H^1$.
  Such blowup at a finite point is in contrast with all the blowup solutions constructed for this equation, except the one constructed previously by the authors corresponding to the special value $\nu=\frac 25$.
  Finally, we present some open problems regarding the blowup phenomenon for the mass critical gKdV equation.</description>

      <title>Lipschitz regularity of harmonic map heat flows into $CAT(0)$ spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20579</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20579v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 1964, Eells and Sampson proved the famous long-time existence and convergence for the harmonic map heat flow into non-positively curved Riemannian manifolds. Subsequently, Hamilton investigated the corresponding initial-boundary problem. In 1992, Gromov and Schoen developed a variational theory of harmonic maps into $CAT(0)$ metric spaces. This progress naturally motivated the study of the harmonic map heat flow into singular metric spaces.
  In the 1990s, Mayer and Jost independently studied convex functionals on $CAT(0)$ spaces and extended Crandall-Liggett's theory of gradient flows from Banach spaces to $CAT(0)$ spaces to obtain the weak solutions, called semi-group weak solutions, for the harmonic map heat flow into $CAT(0)$ spaces. Very recently, Lin, Segatti, Sire, and Wang used an elliptic approximation method to obtain another class of weak solutions, called suitable weak solutions in the sense of the Evolution Variational Inequality (EVI), to the harmonic map heat flow into $CAT(0)$ spaces. They proved that these solutions are Lipschitz in space and $\frac{1}{2}$-H\"older continuous in time.
  Since the semi-group weak solutions of the harmonic map heat flow enjoy the favorable long-time existence, uniqueness and well established long-time behaviors, it is natural to ask if the semi-group solutions possess the Lipschitz regularity. In the present paper, we answer this question. We show that the semi-group weak solutions of the harmonic map heat flow into CAT(0) spaces are Lipschitz continuous in both space and time. We also establish an Eells-Sampson-type Bochner inequality.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of invariant measures for stochastic damped anisotropic Navier--Stokes equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.20616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional Navier--Stokes system with anisotropic viscosity, linear damping term, and an additive noise on the whole space $\mathbb{R}^2$. For this model we prove uniqueness of invariant measures when the damping coefficient is sufficiently large compared to the noise intensity. The argument is based on an asymptotic coupling method and relies on anisotropic energy estimates together with exponential-type estimates for the $H^1$-energy. Since no Poincar\'e inequality is available on $\mathbb{R}^2$, the damping term is essential even for the existence of invariant measures. Our result applies to general additive noise without any non-degeneracy condition and remains valid even in the deterministic case $\sigma\equiv0$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.20859v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Berger and Coburn proposed an endpoint boundedness criterion for Toeplitz operators on the Bargmann--Fock space in which the decisive quantity is the heat transform of the symbol at the borderline time $t=\tfrac14$, the time naturally singled out by the Weyl calculus under the Bargmann transform. We show that this criterion fails for general measurable symbols in every complex dimension $n\ge 1$. Concretely, we construct a measurable symbol $g\in L^2(\mathbb C^n,d\mu)$ such that $gk_a\in L^2(d\mu)$ for every normalized reproducing kernel $k_a$, and the associated Toeplitz form extends to a bounded operator on $H^2(\mathbb C^n,d\mu)$, but the heat transform $g^{(1/4)}$ is unbounded on $\mathbb C^n$. The example is obtained by summing translated bounded "blocks" whose Toeplitz norms are summable while their $t=\tfrac14$ heat profiles have fixed size. The blocks are produced by combining a Hilbert--Schmidt estimate for Weyl quantization with the Bargmann correspondence between Weyl and Toeplitz operators.</description>

      <title>Existence Results for the Time-incremental Elastic Contact Problem with Coulomb Friction in 2D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.16298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.16298v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, the structure of the incremental quasistatic contact problem with Coulomb friction in linear elasticity (Signorini-Coulomb problem) is unraveled and sharp existence results are proved for the most general two-dimensional problem with arbitrary geometry and elasticity modulus tensor. The problem is reduced to a variational inequality involving a nonlinear operator which handles both elasticity and friction. This operator is proved to fall into the class of the so-called Leray-Lions operators, so that a result of Br\'ezis can be invoked to solve the variational inequality. It turns out that one property in the definition of Leray-Lions operators is difficult to check and requires proving a new fine property of the linear elastic Neumann-to-Dirichlet operator. This fine property is only established in the case of the two-dimensional problem, limiting currently our existence result to that case. In the case of isotropic elasticity, either homogeneous or heterogeneous, the existence of solutions to the Signorini-Coulomb problem is proved for arbitrarily large friction coefficient. In the case of anisotropic elasticity, an example of nonexistence of a solution for large friction coefficient is exhibited and the existence of solutions is proved under an optimal condition for the friction coefficient.</description>

Abstract: We focus on open questions regarding the uniqueness of distributional solutions of the fast diffusion equation (FDE) with a given source term. When the source is sufficiently smooth, the uniqueness follows from standard results. Assuming that the source term is a measure, the existence of different classes of solutions is known, but in many cases, their uniqueness is an open problem. In our work, we focus on the supercritical FDE and prove the uniqueness of distributional solutions with a Dirac source term that moves along a prescribed curve.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.10304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.10304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence and the regularity results obtained in [37] for the variational model introduced in [36] to study the optimal shape of crystalline materials in the setting of stress-driven rearrangement instabilities (SDRI) are extended from two dimensions to any dimensions $n\geq2$. The energy is the sum of the elastic and the surface energy contributions, which cannot be decoupled, and depend on configurational pairs consisting of a set and a function that model the region occupied by the crystal and the bulk displacement field, respectively. By following the physical literature, the ``driving stress'' due to the mismatch between the ideal free-standing equilibrium lattice of the crystal with respect to adjacent materials is included in the model by considering a discontinuous mismatch strain in the elastic energy. Since two-dimensional methods and the methods used in the previous literature where Dirichlet boundary conditions instead of the mismatch strain and only the wetting regime were considered, cannot be employed in this setting, we proceed differently, by including in the analysis the dewetting regime and carefully analyzing the fine properties of energy-equibounded sequences. This analysis allows to establish both a compactness property in the family of admissible configurations and the lower-semicontinuity of the energy with respect to the topology induced by the $L^1$-convergence of sets and a.e.\ convergence of displacement fields, so that the direct method can be applied. We also prove that our arguments work as well in the setting with Dirichlet boundary conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15149v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the elliptic equation $-\text{div} (A_\varepsilon \nabla u_\varepsilon) = \text{div} f$ in a bounded $C^1$ domain, where $A_\varepsilon$ takes a form of $A_\varepsilon(x) = A(x/\varepsilon_1, x/\varepsilon_2,\cdots, x/\varepsilon_n)$, with $A(y_1,y_2,\cdots,y_n)$ being 1-periodic in each $y_i$. We prove the uniform Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund estimate, namely, the uniform $L^p$ boundedness of the linear map $f\mapsto \nabla u_\varepsilon$ for any $p\in (1,\infty)$ with a constant independent of small parameters $(\varepsilon_1,\varepsilon_2,\cdots, \varepsilon_n) \in (0,1]^n$. Our result includes the uniform Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund estimate in quasiperiodic elliptic homogenization (even without the Diophantine condition), which was previously unknown. The proof novelly combines the Dirichlet's theorem on the simultaneous Diophantine approximation from number theory, a technique of reperiodization, reiterated periodic homogenization and a large-scale real-variable argument. Using the idea of reperiodization, we also obtain some large-scale or mesoscopic-scale Lipschitz estimates.</description>

Abstract: We prove local-in-time a-priori estimates in $H^{-1}(\mathbb{R})$ for a family of generalized Korteweg--de Vries equations. This is the first estimate for any non-integrable perturbation of the KdV equation that matches the regularity of the sharp well-posedness theory for KdV. In particular, we show that our analysis applies to models for long waves in a shallow channel of water with an uneven bottom.
  The proof of our main result is based upon a bootstrap argument for the renormalized perturbation determinant coupled with a local smoothing norm.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14749v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a rigorous analysis of a multi-soliton solution of the focusing nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equation as the number, $N$, of solitons grows to infinity. We discover configurations of $N$-soliton solutions which exhibit the formation (as $N \to \infty$) of a soliton gas condensate. Specifically, we show that when the eigenvalues of the Zakharov - Shabat operator for the NLS equation accumulate on two bounded horizontal segments in the complex plane with norming constants bounded away from $0$, then, asymptotically, the solution is described by a rapidly oscillatory elliptic-wave with constant velocity, on compact subsets of $(x,t)$. We then consider more complex solutions with an extra soliton component, and provide rigorous justification of the predictions of the kinetic theory of solitons in this deterministic setting. This is to be distinguished from previous analyses of soliton gasses where the norming constants were tending to zero with $N$, and the asymptotic description only included elliptic waves in the long-time asymptotics.</description>

      <title>On a class of nonlinear BGK-type kinetic equations with density dependent collision rates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.14225v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a class of nonlinear, spatially inhomogeneous kinetic equations of BGK-type with density dependent collision rates. These equations share the same superlinearity as the Boltzmann equation, and fall into the class of run and tumble equations appearing in mathematical biology. We prove that the Cauchy problem is well-posed, and the solutions propagate Maxwellian bounds over time. Moreover, we show that the solutions approach to equilibrium with an exponential rate, known as a hypocoercivity result. Lastly, we derive a class of nonlinear diffusion equations as the hydrodynamic limit of the kinetic equations in the diffusive scaling, employing both hypocoercivity and relative entropy methods. The limit equations cover a wide range of nonlinear diffusion equations including both the porous medium and the fast diffusion equations.</description>

      <title>Telegrapher's Generative Model via Kac Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20641</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20641v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We break the mold in flow-based generative modeling by proposing a new model based on the damped wave equation, also known as telegrapher's equation. Similar to the diffusion equation and Brownian motion, there is a Feynman-Kac type relation between the telegrapher's equation and the stochastic Kac process in 1D. The Kac flow evolves stepwise linearly in time, so that the probability flow is Lipschitz continuous in the Wasserstein distance and, in contrast to diffusion flows, the norm of the velocity is globally bounded. Furthermore, the Kac model has the diffusion model as its asymptotic limit. We extend these considerations to a multi-dimensional stochastic process which consists of independent 1D Kac processes in each spatial component. We show that this process gives rise to an absolutely continuous curve in the Wasserstein space and compute the conditional velocity field starting in a Dirac point analytically. Using the framework of flow matching, we train a neural network that approximates the velocity field and use it for sample generation. Our numerical experiments demonstrate the scalability of our approach, and show its advantages over diffusion models.</description>

      <title>Quadratic flatness and Regularity for Codimension-One Varifolds with Bounded Anisotropic Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18357v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove that if $ V $ is a $ n $-dimensional varifold in an open subset of $ \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $ with
  bounded anisotropic mean curvature such that $ {\rm spt} \| V \| $ has locally finite
  $ \mathscr{H}^n $-measure, then $ {\rm spt} \| V \| $ can be touched by two mutually tangent balls at
  $ \mathscr{H}^n $ almost all points. In particular, this result implies that $ \mathscr{H}^n $ almost all of
  $ {\rm spt} \| V \| $ can be covered by the union of countably many $ C^2 $-regular
  $ n $-dimensional submanifolds of $ \mathbf{R}^{n+1} $. Moreover, combined with Allard's local
  anisotropic regularity theorem, it implies that if $ V $ is an integral varifold with
  bounded anisotropic mean curvature and if $ \mathscr{H}^n \llcorner {\rm spt} \| V \| $ is absolutely
  continuous with respect to $ \| V \| $, then $ {\rm spt} \| V \| $ is $ C^{1, \alpha} $-regular
  around $ \mathscr{H}^n $ almost every point of density $ 1 $.</description>

      <title>Sharp remainder terms and stability of weighted Hardy-Poincar\'e and Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl inequalities related to the Baouendi-Grushin operator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.16380v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we obtain sharp remainder terms for the Hardy-Poincar\'e inequalities with general non-radial weights in the setting of Baouendi-Grushin vector fields (see Theorem 2.5). It is worth emphasizing that all of our results are new both in the Baouendi-Grushin and standard Euclidean settings. The method employed allows us to not only unify, but also improve the results of Kombe and Yener [KY18] for any $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ while holding true for complex-valued functions and providing explicit constants (Corollary 2.7). As a result, we are able to obtain sharp remainder terms to many known weighted Hardy-type inequalities (see Section 3.1). Aside from weighted Hardy-type inequalities, we also recover a sharp remainder formula for the $L^{p}$-Poincar\'e inequality (Corollary 3.5). In the special case of radial weights, we are naturally able to introduce the notion of Baouendi-Grushin $p$-Bessel pairs (see Definition 2.9). Furthermore, we apply the technique to establish the sharp remainder term of the Heisenberg-Pauli-Weyl inequality in $L^{p}$ for $1&lt;p&lt;\infty$ (Corollary 3.13), which includes the sharp constant. This makes it possible to obtain the $L^{p}$-analogue for $2\leq p &lt; n$ (Theorem 3.17) of a stability result by Cazacu, Flynn, Lam and Lu [CFLL24]. Lastly, as another application, the non-existence of positive solutions to nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations is investigated (Theorem 3.22).</description>

      <title>Large-time Behavior for a Cutoff Level-Set Mean Curvature G-equation with Source term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a cutoff level-set mean curvature G-equation with a non-negative source term. In particular, we study the large-time behavior of this fully nonlinear degenerate parabolic partial differential equation in two settings: periodic and radially symmetric. Due to the non-coercivity and non-convexity of the Hamiltonian, we are not able to use the standard Hamilton-Jacobi theory and instead rely on the inherent structure to find a monotonicity property and corresponding uniqueness set. Lastly, we discuss the local regularity of the solutions, as well as a representation formula in the radial symmetric setting.</description>

      <title>Uniqueness of radial solutions for $m$-Laplacian equations in low dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.16129v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper extends the uniqueness results of Serrin and Tang [\textit{Indiana Univ. Math. J.}, 49 (2000), pp. 897--923] to the low-dimensional case $1\leq N\leq m$ with $m&gt;1$. We consider radial solutions of the overdetermined problem
  \[
  \begin{cases}
  -\Delta_m u = f(u), \quad u&gt;0 &amp; \text{in } B_R,\\[4pt]
  u = \partial_\nu u = 0 &amp; \text{on } \partial B_R, \text{ if } R&lt;\infty,\\[4pt]
  \displaystyle\lim_{|x|\to\infty} u(x)=0, &amp; \text{if } R=\infty,
  \end{cases}
  \]
  where $B_R$ is the open ball in $\mathbb{R}^N$ centered at the origin with radius $R&gt;0$ (the case $R=\infty$ corresponds to the whole space, for studying positive ground states). Under suitable assumptions on the nonlinearity $f$, we establish the uniqueness of such solutions, whenever they exist.
  Our analysis is motivated by connections to sharp forms of the Gagliardo--Nirenberg and Nash inequalities. Although the overall framework follows that of Serrin and Tang, the details of our proofs differ substantially in the low-dimensional setting. In particular, Serrin and Tang explicitly noted that their techniques rely heavily on the condition $N&gt;m$ and do not readily extend to $N\leq m$ (see Subsection~6.2 of their work). The present paper closes this gap, thereby providing a complete uniqueness theory for all dimensions.
  As a concrete example, for the canonical nonlinearity $f(u) = -u^p + u^q$ with $p&lt;q$, our result covers the full range $-1 &lt; p &lt; q &lt; m^*-1$, where $m^*:=\frac{Nm}{N-m}$ for $N&gt;m$ and $m^* = \infty$ for $N\leq m$. Consequently, our work also completely resolves an open problem posed by Pucci and Serrin [\textit{Indiana Univ. Math. J.}, 47 (1998), pp. 501--528], which had been settled for $N&gt;m$ in the earlier work of Serrin and Tang.</description>

Abstract: In Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, the minimization problem of a nonlocal isoperimetric functional with a competition between perimeter and a nonlocal term derived from the negative power of the distance function, has been extensively studied. In this paper, we investigate this nonlocal isoperimetric problem in hyperbolic space $\mathbb{H}^n$, we prove that the geodesic balls are unique minimizers (up to hyperbolic isometries) for small volumes $m$ and obtain nonexistence results for large volumes $m$ under certain ranges of the exponent in the nonlocal term.</description>

      <title>Critical blow-up curve in a two-species chemotaxis system with two chemicals involving flux-limitation</title>

Abstract: We investigate the following two-species chemotaxis system with two chemicals involving flux-limitation \begin{align}\tag{$\star$} \begin{cases} u_t = \Delta u - \nabla \cdot \left(u(1+|\nabla v|^2)^{-\frac{p}{2}}\nabla v\right), &amp; x \in \Omega, \ t &gt; 0, \\ 0 = \Delta v - \mu_w + w, \quad \mu_{w}=f_{\Omega} w, &amp; x \in \Omega, \ t &gt; 0, \\ w_t = \Delta w - \nabla \cdot \left(w (1+|\nabla z|^2)^{-\frac{q}{2}} \nabla z\right), &amp; x \in \Omega, \ t &gt; 0, \\ 0 = \Delta z - \mu_u + u, \quad \mu_{u}=f_{\Omega} u, &amp; x \in \Omega, \ t &gt; 0, \\ \frac{\partial u}{\partial \nu} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial \nu} = \frac{\partial w}{\partial \nu} = \frac{\partial z}{\partial \nu} = 0, &amp; x \in \partial \Omega, \ t &gt; 0, \\ u(x, 0) = u_0(x), \quad w(x, 0) = w_0(x), &amp; x \in \Omega, \end{cases} \end{align} where $p,q \in \mathbb{R}$ and $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ is a smooth bounded domain. In this paper, we identify a critical blow-up curve for system ($\star$) with $n\geq 3$. If $p&lt;\frac{n-2}{n-1}$ and $q&lt;\frac{n-2}{n-1}$, and $\Omega=B_R(0) \subset \mathbb{R}^n$ with $n\geq 3$, there exist radially symmetric initial data such that the corresponding solution blows up in finite time; if either $p&gt;\frac{n-2}{n-1}$ or $q&gt;\frac{n-2}{n-1}$ with $n\geq 2$, then solutions exist globally and remain bounded.</description>

The solution describes a stratified water column with three constant-density regions: a motionless bottom layer, a middle layer - the halocline - described by nonhydrostatic, near-inertial Pollard waves, and an upper layer presenting a mean current and a wave motion associated with the one in the halocline layer.</description>

Abstract: In this note, we investigate the existence of smooth complete hypersurfaces in hyperbolic space with constant $(n-2)$-curvature and a prescribed asymptotic boundary at infinity. Previously, the existence was known only for a restricted range of curvature values, while in here, by deriving curvature estimates, we are able to deduce the existence for all possible curvature values.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.09800v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mixed Christoffel problem asks for necessary and sufficient conditions for a Borel measure on the Euclidean unit sphere to be the mixed area measure of some convex bodies, all but one of them are fixed. We consider the case in which the reference bodies are $(n-1)$-dimensional disks lying in a fixed hyperplane. We obtain an integral representation that reconstructs the support function of a convex body from its disk area measure, without any regularity assumptions. In the smooth setting, we reformulate the problem as a linear differential equation on the sphere, and derive a necessary and sufficient condition on the density of the disk area measure guaranteeing both convexity and regularity of the solution.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we employ the ABP method developed by Brendle to establish the optimal $L^p$ logarithmic Sobolev inequality on manifolds with nonnegative Ricci curvature, as well as a sharp $L^2$ logarithmic Sobolev inequality for submanifolds in manifolds with nonnegative sectional curvature. The sharp constants in both inequalities depend on the asymptotic volume ratio of the ambient manifold.</description>
