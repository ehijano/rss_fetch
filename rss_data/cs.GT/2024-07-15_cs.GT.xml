      <title>Basic Strategy for some Simplified Blackjack Variants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate a basic strategy for several variations of a simplified version of Blackjack. In short, for these variants the player has only the two options of hit or stand, and they may only make either decision once. Other minor variations including rule modifications, changes in number of decks, alternate payout structures, and different given information about dealer's hand are also considered. An interesting theoretical result regarding the asymptotic behavior of the basic strategy and overall expectation as the number of decks increase is also proved.</description>

      <title>Examples and Counterexamples of Cost-efficiency in Incomplete Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a number of examples and counterexamples to illustrate the results on cost-efficiency in an incomplete market obtained in [BS24]. These examples and counterexamples do not only illustrate the results obtained in [BS24], but show the limitations of the results and the sharpness of the key assumptions. In particular, we make use of a simple 3-state model in which we are able to recover and illustrate all key results of the paper. This example also shows how our characterization of perfectly cost-efficient claims allows to solve an expected utility maximization problem in a simple incomplete market (trinomial model) and recover results from [DS06, Chapter 3], there obtained using duality.</description>

      <title>Portfolio-Based Incentive Mechanism Design for Cross-Device Federated Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04081</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a significant increase in attention towards designing incentive mechanisms for federated learning (FL). Tremendous existing studies attempt to design the solutions using various approaches (e.g., game theory, reinforcement learning) under different settings. Yet the design of incentive mechanism could be significantly biased in that clients' performance in many applications is stochastic and hard to estimate. Properly handling this stochasticity motivates this research, as it is not well addressed in pioneering literature. In this paper, we focus on cross-device FL and propose a multi-level FL architecture under the real scenarios. Considering the two properties of clients' situations: uncertainty, correlation, we propose FL Incentive Mechanism based on Portfolio theory (FL-IMP). As far as we are aware, this is the pioneering application of portfolio theory to incentive mechanism design aimed at resolving FL resource allocation problem. In order to more accurately reflect practical FL scenarios, we introduce the Federated Learning Agent-Based Model (FL-ABM) as a means of simulating autonomous clients. FL-ABM enables us to gain a deeper understanding of the factors that influence the system's outcomes. Experimental evaluations of our approach have extensively validated its effectiveness and superior performance in comparison to the benchmark methods.</description>

      <title>Condorcet Markets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.05028v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The paper studies information markets concerning single events from an epistemic social choice perspective. Within the classical Condorcet error model for collective binary decisions, we establish equivalence results between elections and markets, showing that the alternative that would be selected by weighted majority voting (under specific weighting schemes) corresponds to the alternative with highest price in the equilibrium of the market (under specific assumptions on the market type). This makes it possible in principle to implement specific weighted majority elections, which are known to have superior truth-tracking performance, by means of information markets without needing to elicit voters' competences.</description>

      <title>On the Effect of Bounded Rationality in Electricity Markets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.19236v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nash equilibrium is a common solution concept that captures strategic interaction in electricity market analysis. However, it requires a fundamental but impractical assumption that all market participants are fully rational, implying unlimited computational resources and cognitive abilities. To tackle the limitation, level-k reasoning is proposed and studied to model the bounded rational behaviors. In this paper, we consider a Cournot competition in electricity markets with two suppliers, both following level-k reasoning. One is a self-interested firm and the other serves as a benevolent social planner. First, we observe that the optimal strategy of the social planner corresponds to a particular rationality level, where being either less or more rational may both result in reduced social welfare. We then investigate the effect of bounded rationality on social welfare performance and find that it can largely deviate from that at the Nash equilibrium point. From the perspective of the social planner, we characterize optimal, expectation maximizing and robust maximin strategies, when having access to different information. Finally, by designing its utility function, we find that social welfare is better off if the social planner cooperates with or fights the self-interested firm. Numerical experiments further demonstrate and validate our findings.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic Verification in Mechanism Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.05556</link>
      <description>arXiv:1908.05556v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a model of probabilistic verification in mechanism design. The principal elicits a message from the agent and then selects a test to give the agent. The agent's true type determines the probability with which he can pass each test. We characterize whether each type has an associated test that best screens out all other types. If this condition holds, then the testing technology can be represented in a tractable reduced form. We use this reduced form to solve for profit-maximizing mechanisms with verification. As the verification technology varies, the solution continuously interpolates between the no-verification solution and full surplus extraction.</description>

      <title>Calibrated Recommendations for Users with Decaying Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.03239v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recommendation systems capable of providing diverse sets of results are a focus of increasing importance, with motivations ranging from fairness to novelty and other aspects of optimizing user experience. One form of diversity of recent interest is calibration, the notion that personalized recommendations should reflect the full distribution of a user's interests, rather than a single predominant category -- for instance, a user who mainly reads entertainment news but also wants to keep up with news on the environment and the economy would prefer to see a mixture of these genres, not solely entertainment news. Existing work has formulated calibration as a subset selection problem; this line of work observes that the formulation requires the unrealistic assumption that all recommended items receive equal consideration from the user, but leaves as an open question the more realistic setting in which user attention decays as they move down the list of results.
  In this paper, we consider calibration with decaying user attention under two different models. In both models, there is a set of underlying genres that items can belong to. In the first setting, where items are represented by fine-grained mixtures of genre percentages, we provide a $(1-1/e)$-approximation algorithm by extending techniques for constrained submodular optimization. In the second setting, where items are coarsely binned into a single genre each, we surpass the $(1-1/e)$ barrier imposed by submodular maximization and give a $2/3$-approximate greedy algorithm. Our work thus addresses the problem of capturing ordering effects due to decaying attention, allowing for the extension of near-optimal calibration from recommendation sets to recommendation lists.</description>

      <title>It Takes Two: A Peer-Prediction Solution for Blockchain Verifier's Dilemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.01794v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The security of blockchain systems is fundamentally based on the decentralized consensus in which the majority of parties behave honestly, and the process of content verification is essential to keep the robustness of blockchain systems. However, the phenomenon that a secure blockchain system with few or no cheaters could not provide sufficient incentive for verifiers to honestly perform the costly verification, referred to as the Verifier's Dilemma, could severely undermine the fundamental security of blockchain systems. While existing works have attempted to insert deliberate errors to disincentivize lazy verification, the decentralized environment makes it impossible to judge the correctness of verification or detect malicious verifiers directly.
  In this paper, we initiate the research that leverages the peer prediction approach towards the design of Bayesian truthful mechanisms for the decentralized verification game among multiple verifiers, incentivizing all verifiers to perform honest verification without access to the ground truth even in the presence of noisy observations in the verification process. With theoretically guaranteed truthfulness of our mechanism for the verification game, our work provides a framework of verification mechanisms that enhances the security and robustness of the blockchain and potentially other decentralized systems.</description>
