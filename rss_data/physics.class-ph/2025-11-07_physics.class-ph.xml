      <title>Coherent control of magnon-polaritons using an exceptional point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03899v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The amplitude of resonant oscillations in a non-Hermitian environment can either decay or grow in time, corresponding to a mode with either loss or gain. When two coupled modes have a specific difference between their loss or gain, a feature termed an exceptional point emerges in the excitations' energy manifold, at which both the eigenfrequencies and eigenmodes of the system coalesce. Exceptional points have intriguing effects on the dynamics of systems due to their topological properties. They have been explored in contexts including optical, microwave, optomechanical, electronic and magnonic systems, and have been used to control systems including optical microcavities, the lasing modes of a PT-symmetric waveguide, and terahertz pulse generation. A challenging problem that remains open in all of these scenarios is the fully deterministic and direct manipulation of the systems' loss and gain on timescales relevant to coherent control of excitations. Here we demonstrate the rapid manipulation of the gain and loss balance of excitations of a magnonic hybrid system on durations much shorter than their decay rate, allowing us to exploit non-Hermitian physics for coherent control. By encircling an exceptional point, we demonstrate population transfer between coupled magnon-polariton modes, and confirm the distinctive chiral nature of exceptional point encircling. We then study the effect of driving the system directly through an exceptional point, and demonstrate that this allows the coupled system to be prepared in an equal superposition of eigenmodes. We also show that the dynamics of the system at the exceptional point are dependent on its generalised eigenvectors. These results extend the established toolbox of adiabatic transfer techniques with a new approach for coherent state preparation, and provide a new avenue for exploring the dynamical properties of non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Interstitial dual-mode ultrasound with a 3-mm MR-compatible catheter for image-guided HIFU and directional in-vitro tissue ablations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.04207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current interstitial techniques of tumor ablation face challenges that ultrasound technologies could meet.
The ablation radius and directionality of the ultrasound beam could improve the efficiency and precision. Here, a 9gauge MR-compatible dual-mode ultrasound catheter prototype was experimentally evaluated for Ultrasound Imageguided High Intensity Focused Ultrasound (USgHIFU) conformal ablations. The prototype consisted of 64 piezocomposite linear array elements and was driven by an open research programmable dual-mode ultrasound platform. After verifying the US-image guidance capabilities of the prototype, the HIFU output performances (dynamic focusing and HIFU intensities) were quantitatively characterized, together with the associated 3D HIFU-induced thermal heating in tissue phantoms (using MR thermometry). Finally, the ability to produce robustly HIFU-induced thermal ablations in in-vitro liver was studied experimentally and compared to numerical modeling. Investigations of several HIFU dynamic focusing allowed overcoming the challenges of miniaturizing the device: mono-focal focusing maximized deep energy deposition, while multi-focal strategies eliminated grating lobes. The linear-array design of the prototype made it possible to produce interstitial ultrasound images of tissue and tumor mimics in situ. Multi-focal pressure fields were generated without grating lobes and transducer surface intensities reached up to Isapa =14 W$\bullet$cm -2 . Seventeen elementary thermal ablations were performed in vitro. Rotation of the catheter proved the directionality of ablation, sparing non-targeted tissue. This experimental proof of concept demonstrates the feasibility of treating volumes comparable to those of primary solid tumors with a miniaturized USgHIFU catheter whose dimensions are close to those of tools traditionally used in interventional radiology, while offering new functionalities.</description>

      <title>Variational Projection of Navier-Stokes: Fluid Mechanics as a Quadratic Programming Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.03896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gauss's principle of least constraint transforms a dynamics problem into a pure minimization problem, where the total magnitude of the constraint force is the cost function, minimized at each instant. Newton's equation is the first-order necessary condition for minimizing the Gaussian cost, subject to the given kinematic constraints. The principle of minimum pressure gradient (PMPG) is to incompressible fluid mechanics what Gauss's principle is to particle mechanics. The PMPG asserts that an incompressible flow evolves from one instant to another by minimizing the L2-norm of the pressure gradient force. A candidate flow field whose evolution minimizes the pressure gradient cost at each instant is guaranteed to satisfy the Navier-Stokes equation. Consequently, the PMPG transforms the incompressible fluid mechanics problem into a pure minimization framework, allowing one to determine the evolution of the flow field by solely focusing on minimizing the cost. In this paper, we show that the resulting minimization problem is a convex Quadratic Programming (QP) problem-one of the most computationally tractable classes in nonlinear optimization. Moreover, leveraging tools from analytical mechanics and the Moore-Penrose theory of generalized inverses, we derive an analytical solution for this QP problem. As a result, we present an explicit formula for the projected dynamics of the spatially discretized Navier-Stokes equation on the space of divergence-free fields. The resulting ODE is ready for direct time integration, eliminating the need for solving the Poisson equation in pressure at each time step. It is typically an explicit nonlinear ODE with constant coefficients. This compact form is expected to be highly valuable for both simulation and theoretical studies, including stability analysis and flow control design. We demonstrate the framework on the lid-driven cavity problem.</description>
