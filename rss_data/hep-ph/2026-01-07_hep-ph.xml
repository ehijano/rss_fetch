      <title>Research of the Behavior of the Effective Potential in Systems with Phase Transitions through the Prism of A--D--E Type Singularities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting a scalar singlet interacting through the Higgs portal demands a pivot from conventional particle detection strategies to a comprehensive examination of the effective potential's landscape. The presence, intensity, and first-order nature of the electroweak phase transition are dictated by the critical manifold, with its universal traits encapsulated in the Milnor number $\mu$ -- the dimensionality of the local Jacobian algebra. Throughout the parameter space consistent with experimental observations, the portal potential exhibits a non-simple singularity with $\mu = 9$, maintaining topological stability amid substantial fluctuations in mixing angle, singlet mass, and cubic interactions. High-precision assessments of the Higgs trilinear self-coupling ($\kappa_\lambda$), the uniform rescaling of Higgs couplings ($c_H$), and the stochastic gravitational-wave spectrum ($\Omega_{\mathrm{GW}}$) collectively delineate the catastrophe, extending beyond mere mass matrix analysis. Projections for 2027--2040 collider and LISA capabilities indicate that no viable region supporting a strong first-order transition will evade scrutiny; thus, the singlet will either be identified or conclusively dismissed via direct interrogation of the electroweak vacuum's critical structure.</description>

      <title>On the Stability of Leading-Power Factorization under Photon Propagator Numerator Modifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study collinear factorization in strong electromagnetic backgrounds within SCET for a class of modifications where the photon propagator keeps the vacuum pole structure and $i\varepsilon$ prescription, while the background enters only through a numerator tensor $\Delta_{\mu\nu}(k)$. We show that the set of Landau pinch surfaces and leading momentum regions is unchanged, so the leading-power (LP) factorized form is preserved. Moreover, the LP cusp kernel depends on the background solely through the longitudinal contraction $n^\mu\bar n^\nu\Delta_{\mu\nu}(k)$ in the soft region; if it vanishes (or is power suppressed), the LP soft kernel reduces to the vacuum. As an application, for an occupancy-number modification with the physical polarization-sum tensor $g_{T\mu\nu}(k;n)$, transversality implies $n^\mu\bar n^\nu\Delta_{\mu\nu}=0$, so genuine background sensitivity starts only beyond LP.</description>

      <title>Fixed points of the renormalisation group running of the CKM and PMNS matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The renormalisation group running of the CKM parameters in the Standard Model is re-examined. For the massless 1-loop running six fixed points are found and their associated operator mixing matrices determined, in terms of the Yukawa couplings of the quarks. CP is an exact symmetry at each of the fixed points. An argument is given that the fixed points found at 1-loop must remain fixed points to all orders and even non-perturbatively, as they are associated with certain differential geometric properties of the space of CKM matrices. The analysis is equally applicable to the CKM matrix in the quark sector and the PMNS matrix in the leptonic sector.</description>

      <title>GeV-scale QCD Axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to solve the strong CP problem, we study the possibility that the Peccei--Quinn symmetry is broken {\it below}\/ the QCD scale. We find that a QCD axion can be above GeV, and may be among the observed $\eta$ resonances. It is immune to quantum gravity corrections. The only fermion that has a $U(1)$ Peccei--Quinn charge is the right-handed up quark. Flavor-changing neutral currents are surprisingly small, except for a possible but not necessary contribution to $D^0$--$\overline{D}^0$ mixing. All accelerator and astrophysical limits can be evaded. The most significant constraint is the mass splitting between $\pi^\pm$ and $\pi^0$. In a UV completed model, LHC can look for a dijet resonance in $u\bar{u}$, $u\bar{d}$, $d\bar{u}$ channels.</description>

      <title>Probing Dark Matter-Electron Interactions with Superconducting Qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02474v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum device measurements are powerful tools to probe dark matter interactions. Among these, transmon qubits stand out for their ability to suppress external noise while remaining highly sensitive to tiny energy deposits. Ambient galactic halo dark matter interacting with electrons can deposit energy in the qubit, leading to changes in its decoherence time. Recent measurements of transmons have consistently measured, in various experimental setups, a residual contribution to the decoherence time unexplained by thermal noise or known external sources. We use such measurements to set the most stringent laboratory-based constraints to date on dark matter-electron scattering at the keV scale and competitive constraints on dark photon absorption.</description>

      <title>Resummation of the C-Parameter Sudakov Shoulder Using Effective Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The C-parameter distribution in $e^+e^-$ annihilation exhibits a kinematic shoulder at $C = 3/4$, where three-parton final states reach their maximum and a fourth parton is required to exceed it. This boundary generates large logarithms that must be resummed. Using soft-collinear effective theory, we derive a factorization theorem involving new jet and soft functions specific to the C-parameter measurement, in which soft radiation contributes quadratically in transverse momentum. This quadratic structure explains the step discontinuity at leading order. We compute all ingredients at one loop, validate against Monte Carlo, and present matched NLL+NLO results. Unlike thrust and heavy jet mass, the C-parameter has no Sudakov--Landau pole, making momentum-space resummation straightforward. All calculations, numerical analysis, and manuscript preparation were performed by Claude, an AI assistant developed by Anthropic, working under physicist supervision.</description>

      <title>Dark matter and scalar sector in a novel two-loop scotogenic neutrino mass model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an extended $3+1$ Higgs doublet model where the Standard Model (SM) gauge structure is enhanced by the discrete symmetry $Q_6 \times Z_2 \times Z_4$, and the fermion content is extended with right-handed Majorana neutrinos. The scalar sector, besides four $SU(2)$ doublets, incorporates multiple gauge-singlet scalars. In our model, the tiny active neutrino masses arise from a novel radiative seesaw mechanism at two-loop level and the leptonic mixing features the cobimaximal mixing pattern compatible with neutrino oscillation experimental data. Along with this, the proposed model is consistent with SM quark masses and mixings as well as with the constraints arising from dark matter relic density and dark matter direct detection. Our analysis reveals that the best-fit point satisfying dark matter constraints yields a non-SM scalar with mass near $95$ GeV, which could be a possible candidate for the observed $95$ GeV diphoton excess. We further obtain other non SM scalars with masses at the subTeV scale which are within the LHC reach, while successfully complying with the experimental bounds arising from collider searches.</description>

      <title>Helicity Dependent Distribution Functions of the Proton and $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^0$ Baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using continuum Schwinger function methods, a coherent set of predictions for proton, $\Lambda$ and $\Sigma^0$ distribution functions (DFs) has been made available -- both helicity dependent and unpolarised. The results and comparisons between them reveal impacts of diquark correlations and SU$(3)$-flavour symmetry breaking, some of which are highlighted in this contribution. For instance: in-proton ratios of helicity-dependent/unpolarised valence-quark DFs are presented; it is highlighted that, were it not for the presence of axialvector diquarks in the $\Sigma^0$, the valence strange quark would carry none of the $\Sigma^0$ spin; and the sign and size of polarised gluon DFs is discussed -- at a scale typical of modern measurements, gluon partons carry roughly 40% of each octet baryon's spin.</description>

      <title>Higgs boson decays $h\rightarrow Z \gamma$ and $h\rightarrow m_V Z$ in the $U(1)_X$VLFM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02679v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Higgs boson decays $h \to Z\gamma$ and $h \to m_VZ$ in a model with vectorlike fermions and $U(1)_X$ symmetry ($U(1)_X$VLFM), where $m_V$ is a vector meson ($\rho,\ \omega,\ \phi,\ J/\psi,\ \Upsilon$). The exotic Yukawa interactions in this model generate mixing between Standard Model (SM) fermions and vectorlike fermions, and this mixing affects the Higgs boson mass and Higgs couplings. The corrections to the CP-even and CP-odd $h\gamma Z$ couplings come from loop diagrams that involve the new particles, and these corrections have a clear impact on the decay rates of $h\to Z\gamma$ and $h\to m_VZ$. In suitable regions of the parameter space, the model can produce non-negligible deviations in $\Gamma_{\rm NP}(h\to Z\gamma)/\Gamma_{\rm SM}(h\to Z\gamma)$ and $\Gamma_{\rm NP}(h\to m_VZ)/\Gamma_{\rm SM}(h\to m_V Z)$, providing possible signals of new physics (NP) beyond the SM.</description>

Abstract: We consider models with broken $\mu$-$\tau$ permutation symmetry through higher dimensional operators
  renormalizing the lepton kinetic terms in the action. We study
  the consequences on the structure of the neutrino mass matrix and find in particular that the allowed region for the lightest
  mass in the normal hierarchy plotted as a function of the atmospheric mixing element
  $|V_{\mu3}|$ is very restricted with the atmospheric mixing angle $\theta_{23}$ to lie
  in the second octant. On the other hand, the corresponding allowed region in the inverted hierarchy regime
  is less restrictive.</description>

      <title>Two Higgs doublet model with a complex singlet scalar and Multi-critical Point Principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02808v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a two Higgs doublet model extended by a complex singlet scalar, in which the imaginary part of the singlet serves as a dark matter (DM) candidate. In this model, degenerate masses of the three neutral Higgs bosons are crucial for achieving consistency with current constraints from DM direct-detection experiments and Higgs searches. This is called the degenerate scalar scenario. To provide a theoretical motivation for such a degenerate Higgs spectrum, we impose the tree-level Multiple Point Principle (MPP), which requires the electroweak and singlet vacua to be degenerate, and analyze its implications for the scalar potential, DM phenomenology, and the electroweak phase transition. We show that the tree-level MPP favors large SU(2)$_L$ doublet-singlet mixing parameters, which compete with the degenerate scalar scenario. Nevertheless, we demonstrate that viable parameter regions still exist in which the observed DM constraints are satisfied. Furthermore, although the tree-level MPP forbids a tree-level-driven first-order electroweak phase transition, we show that thermal loop effects can induce a strong first-order transition compatible with electroweak baryogenesis.</description>

      <title>Study of $CP$ violation in $\Lambda_b^0\rightarrow N^*M$ decays with the final-state rescattering mechanism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the charmless non-leptonic two-body $\Lambda_b$ decays within the framework of final-state rescattering mechanism. In contrast to the Cutkosky cutting method, we compute both the absorptive and dispersive parts of the hadronic rescattering triangle diagrams. Based on the established formalism, we analyze the $\Lambda_b \to N^*(1535,1520)M$ decay processes with $M =K_S, K^*_0(700)$, $f_0(500,980), \rho(770), \bar{K}^{*0}$, $\phi$, and predict various physical observables, such as their branching ratios, direct and partial-wave $CP$ asymmetries, as well as decay asymmetry parameters. These two-body decay processes are expected to contribute primarily to the subsequent four-body decay channels, such as $\Lambda_b^0 \to p\,\pi^-\,\pi^+\,\pi^-$, whose $CP$ asymmetry measurements will be accessible at the LHCb experiment.</description>

      <title>Single-quark electromagnetic form factors of charmonium up to $J=2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02897</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the single-quark electromagnetic form factors of a broad subset of charmonium, including $\eta_c(1S)$, $\eta_c(2S)$, $\chi_{c0}(1P)$, $\chi_{c0}(2P)$, $J/\psi(1S)$, $J/\psi(2S)$, $\chi_{c1}(1P)$, $\chi_{c1}(2P)$, $h_c(1P)$, $h_c(2P)$, $\chi_{c2}(1P)$ and $\chi_{c2}(2P)$, via a relativized quark model. The reference frame dependence of the results is estimated as the computational error. We compare our results with those of the lattice quantum chromodynamics (LQCD), the Dyson-Schwinger equation (DSE) and the basis light front quantization (BLFQ) approaches where available and we find that most of our results agree with the other results. We also predict the single-quark electromagnetic form factors of $\chi_{c0}(2P)$, $\chi_{c1}(2P)$, $h_c(1P)$, $h_c(2P)$, $\chi_{c2}(1P)$ and $\chi_{c2}(2P)$, where no direct comparisons are available.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.02916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the coefficient functions for heavy-quark initiated charged-current deep-inelastic scattering through $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$, retaining full mass dependence for a single heavy-quark flavor. The calculation employs a cut-based approach to isolate individual diagram contributions and to derive differential equations for the relevant master integrals, which are solved analytically in terms of generalized polylogarithms. The results are presented in the decoupling scheme for $n_L$ light active flavors, facilitating their direct implementation in variable-flavor number schemes such as ACOT and FONLL.</description>

      <title>Solutions to axion electrodynamics with electric-magnetic duality in supersymmetric Seiberg-Witten theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02969</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02969v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Axion and magnetic monopole are among the most fascinating candidates for physics beyond the Standard Model. The potential connection between axion and magnetic monopole stems from the Witten effect and is revealed by non-standard axion electrodynamics. Non-standard axion electrodynamics under electric-magnetic duality modifies conventional axion Maxwell equations and motivates intriguing axion-photon phenomenology. A calculable ultraviolet model of Peccei-Quinn axion coupled to magnetic monopoles and electric charges was proposed based on $\mathcal{N}=2$ supersymmetric Seiberg-Witten (SW) theory with manifest electric-magnetic duality. In this work, we aim to investigate the solutions to the non-linear axion electrodynamics from SW axion model and propose relevant detection strategies for non-trivial axion-photon couplings. Based on the infrared Lagrangian of SW axion, we derive the electromagetic (EM) equations of motion. We also analyze the moduli space coordinate in SW theory and find out the reliabe parameter space. We then solve the resultant axion Maxwell equations with an external EM field. The observable axion-induced EM fields are obtained analytically and then numerically computed. Finally, we propose the detection strategy with an LC circuit and show the prospective sensitivity to SW axion-photon couplings.</description>

      <title>Inflation in Extra-Dimensions with one or two branes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study two inflationary models, namely, monomial inflation and the simplest $\alpha$-attractor inflation, within extra-dimensional frameworks. We consider three extra-dimensional setups: Dark Dimension, which embeds one flat extra-dimension to explain the observed smallness of the 4D cosmological constant $\Lambda_4$; and the two Randall-Sundrum scenarios with one warped extra-dimension, namely RS1 with two branes and RS2 with one brane. We derive the corresponding Friedmann equations, compute the slow-roll parameters in each case, and we fit the experimental data for ($n_s - 1$, $\alpha$, $\Delta_s^2$, $r$), using Planck, BICEP, and ACT data. We find that monomial inflation is strongly disfavored in all scenarios, while $\alpha$-attractor inflation provides an excellent fit to current observations, with extra-dimensional setups offering additional flexibility compared to the standard 4D case.</description>

      <title>Hyperon neutrinoless double beta decays in chiral perturbation theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02990</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02990v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the neutrinoless double beta decays of spin-1/2 hyperons, $B_1^- \to B_2^+ \ell^- \ell^-$ with $B_1^-\in \{\Sigma^-,\Xi^-\}$ and $B_2^+\in\{p,\Sigma^+\}$, which violate lepton number by two units. The decay amplitudes are computed within covariant baryon chiral perturbation theory at the one-loop level. Dalitz plots of the squared amplitude for six physical decay processes are presented in this proceeding, while a detailed numerical analysis will be presented in a forthcoming publication.</description>

      <title>Sommerfeld Effect and Bound State Formation for Dark Matter Models with Colored Mediators with SE+BSF4DM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the universal framework of simplified $t$-channel dark matter models, the calculation of the relic abundance can be dominated by mediator annihilation when the dark matter and mediator masses are almost degenerate. We analyze four representative models with scalar and fermionic mediators, confront them with direct detection limits and highlight the differences and common features between them. The mediator annihilations are considerably enhanced by the Sommerfeld effect and bound state formation. Albeit their effect is subdominant in the coannihilation regime, excited bound state levels are included as well. We find that Sommerfeld and bound-state effects can lead to order one corrections to the constraints on the DM mass in the coannihilating regime, with the precise magnitude depending on the specific model realization. In addition we provide SE+BSF4DM, an intuitive and easy to use add-on to micrOMEGAs, allowing for an automated inclusion of these effects for a generic $t$-channel Dark Matter Model, which is publicly available on Github.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2601.03110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive phenomenological analysis of the Radion in the Randall-Sundrum model, focusing on its production via light-by-light scattering in ultra-peripheral proton-proton collisions at the LHC. We provide a consistent derivation of the effective couplings to Standard Model fields, clarifying the normalization of the trace anomaly-induced coupling to photons and the role of kinetic mixing with the Higgs boson. We demonstrate that while the pure gravitational coupling is loop-suppressed relative to Axion-Like Particles (ALPs), making the unmixed Radion elusive, the non-minimal mixing with the Higgs sector can induce constructive interference that enhances the signal by orders of magnitude. Using forward proton tagging to select exclusive high-mass events, we reinterpret recent experimental limits on ALPs to derive the first exclusion contours for the Radion in the $(\Lambda_r, \xi)$ plane, showing that mixing scenarios are beginning to be constrained by current LHC data.</description>

      <title>Study of sub-GeV Dipolar Dark States at SND@LHC within Invisible Bounds on Meson Decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electromagnetic form factors constitute a natural portal for accessing states beyond the Standard Model. In particular, dimension-5 magnetic and electric dipole moment operators offer a minimal and predictive framework for Feebly Interacting Particles (FIPs). In this work, we perform a study of the sensitivity reach of the Scattering and Neutrino Detector (SND@LHC) in the detection of dipolar dark states through photon-mediated interactions with the Standard Model particles. The far-forward region of the LHC provides FIPs with large momenta that scatter off electrons and nuclei inside the target. Production of dark states from meson decays is constrained by invisible decay widths, while the Drell-Yan process offers a production channel in the GeV range. We present sensitivity plots for magnetic and electric dipole moment interactions at SND@LHC and compare them with constraints from direct detection, beam dump, fixed-target, and collider experiments. The validity of the effective theory that describes the dipole model is also studied by considering conservative bounds on the couplings.</description>

      <title>Standard Model Higgs Peaks: a Note on the Vacuum Instability during Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Standard Model, the Higgs potential develops an instability at high field values when the quartic self-coupling runs negative. Large quantum fluctuations during cosmic inflation could drive the Higgs field beyond the potential barrier, creating regions that would be catastrophic for our observable universe. We point out that the extreme-value statistics describing the peaks (maxima) of the Higgs values is the correct statistics to infer the condition to avoid vacuum instability. Even if this statistics delivers a bound on the Hubble rate during inflation which is only a factor $\sqrt{2}$ stronger than the one commonly adopted in the literature, it is qualitatively distinct and we believe worthwhile communicating it.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Collider Gravitational Waves sourced by Right-handed Neutrino production from Bubbles: Testing Seesaw, Leptogenesis and Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a minimal type-I seesaw framework in which a first-order phase transition (FOPT), driven by a singlet scalar, produces right-handed neutrinos (RHNs) through bubble collisions, realizing a cosmic-scale collider that probes ultra-high energy scales. The resulting RHN distribution sources novel low-frequency gravitational-waves (GWs) in addition to the standard bubble-collision contribution. A stable lightest RHN can account for the observed dark matter (DM) relic abundance for masses as low as $M_{1} \equiv m_{\rm DM} \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, with the associated novel GW signal accessible in LISA, ET and upcoming LVK detectors. If the RHNs are unstable, their CP-violating decays generate the observed baryon asymmetry via leptogenesis for $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{11}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and phase transition temperatures $T_* \gtrsim 10^{6}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, for which the novel GW spectrum is detectable in ET, BBO and upcoming LVK. If RHN decays also populate a dark-sector fermion with mass $m_{\chi} \in [10^{-4},10^{4}],\mathrm{GeV}$, successful co-genesis of baryons and asymmetric dark matter occurs for $T_* \gtrsim 10^{7}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and $M_{1} \gtrsim 10^{9}\,\mathrm{GeV}$, naturally explaining $\Omega_{\rm DM} \simeq 5\Omega_{\rm B}$. The corresponding GW signals are testable with LISA, ET, and BBO. Finally, we analyze a UV-complete multi-Majoron model, based on a global $U(1)_N \times U(1)_{\rm B-L}$ extension, motivated from the hierarchy of lepton masses, which we dub as Mojaron collider. The corresponding FOPT in this model leaves a distinctive GW signature arising from RHN production during $U(1)_N$ symmetry breaking detectable by BBO, ET and upcoming LVK. Successful leptogenesis is realized for heaviest RHN mass $M_3 \sim 10^{10}\,\mathrm{GeV}$ and a $U(1)_N$ breaking vev $v_2 \sim \mathcal{O}(\mathrm{TeV})$, which sets the seesaw scale.</description>

      <title>Neutrino flavor instabilities in neutron star mergers with moment transport: slow, fast, and collisional modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02461v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Determining where, when, and how neutrino flavor oscillations must be included in large-scale simulations of hot and dense astrophysical environments is an enduring challenge that must be tackled to obtain accurate predictions. Using an angular moment-based linear stability analysis framework, we examine the different kinds of flavor instabilities that can take place in the context of the post-processing of a neutron star merger simulation, with a particular focus on the collisional flavor instability and a careful assessment of several commonly used approximations. First, neglecting anisotropies of the neutrino field, we investigate the extent to which commonly used monoenergetic growth rates reproduce the results obtained from a full multi-energy treatment. Contrary to the large discrepancies found in core-collapse supernova environments, we propose a simple combination of energy-averaged estimates that reproduces the multi-energy growth rates in our representative simulation snapshot. We then quantify the impact of additional physical effects, including nuclear many-body corrections, scattering opacities, and the inclusion of the vacuum term in the neutrino Hamiltonian. Finally, we include the neutrino distribution anisotropies, which allows us to explore, for the first time in a multi-energy setting, the interplay between collisional, fast, and slow modes in a moment-based neutron star merger simulation. We find that despite a dominance of the fast instability in most of the simulation volume, certain regions only exhibit a collisional instability, while others, especially at large distances, exhibit a slow instability that is largely underestimated if anisotropic effects are neglected.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical platform for high-frequency gravitational wave and vector dark matter detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a proposal for a nanomechanical membrane resonator integrated into a moderate-finesse ($\mathcal{F}\sim 10$) optical cavity as a versatile platform for detecting high-frequency gravitational waves and vector dark matter. Gravitational-wave sensitivity arises from cavity-length modulation, which resonantly drives membrane motion via the radiation-pressure force. This force also enables in situ tuning of the membrane's resonance frequency by nearly a factor of two, allowing a frequency coverage from 0.5 to 40 kHz using six membranes. The detector achieves a peak strain sensitivity of $2\times 10^{-23}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$ at 40 kHz. Using a silicon membrane positioned near a gallium-arsenide input mirror additionally provides sensitivity to vector dark matter via differential acceleration from their differing atomic-to-mass number ratios. The projected reach surpasses the existing limits in the range of $2\times 10^{-12}$ to $2\times 10^{-10}$ $\text{eV}/c^2$ for a one-year measurement. Consequently, the proposed detector offers a unified approach to searching for physics beyond the Standard Model, probing both high-frequency gravitational waves and vector dark matter.</description>

      <title>Orchestral AI: A Framework for Agent Orchestration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of LLM agent frameworks has forced developers to choose between vendor lock-in through provider-specific SDKs and complex multi-package ecosystems that obscure control flow and hinder reproducibility. Integrating tool calling across multiple LLM providers remains a core engineering challenge due to fragmented APIs, incompatible message formats, and inconsistent streaming and tool-calling behavior, making it difficult to build portable, reliable agent systems. We introduce Orchestral, a lightweight Python framework that provides a unified, type-safe interface for building LLM agents across major providers while preserving the simplicity required for scientific computing and production deployment. Orchestral defines a single universal representation for messages, tools, and LLM usage that operates seamlessly across providers, eliminating manual format translation and reducing framework-induced complexity. Automatic tool schema generation from Python type hints removes the need for handwritten descriptors while maintaining type safety across provider boundaries. A synchronous execution model with streaming support enables deterministic behavior, straightforward debugging, and real-time interaction without introducing server dependencies. The framework's modular architecture cleanly separates provider integration, tool execution, conversation orchestration, and user-facing interfaces, enabling extensibility without architectural entanglement. Orchestral supports advanced agent capabilities found in larger frameworks, including rich tool calling, context compaction, workspace sandboxing, user approval workflows, sub-agents, memory management, and MCP integration.</description>

      <title>The Nucleon Axial Form Factor from Averaging Lattice QCD Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02676v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flagship neutrino oscillation experiments depend on precise and accurate theoretical knowledge of neutrino-nucleon cross sections across a variety of energies and interaction mechanisms. Key ingredients to the amplitudes that make up these cross sections are parameterized form factors. The axial form factor describing a weak interaction with a nucleon is part of one of the primary neutrino-nucleon interaction mechanisms, quasielastic scattering, yet this form factor is uncertain and its precision is limited by the availability of data for a neutrino scattering with nucleons or small nuclear targets. Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics (LQCD) now offers another approach for obtaining mathematically rigorous constraints of the axial form factor from theoretical calculations with complete systematic error budgets. In this work, strategies for averaging LQCD results are explored, including both a random sampling of form factor values across momentum transfers as well as an averaging strategy based on analytic calculations of form factor derivatives. Fits to z expansion parameterizations are reported and compared against neutrino-hydrogen and neutrino-deuterium scattering data.</description>

      <title>A Universal Upper Bound on the Pressure-to-Energy Density Ratio in Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The equation-of-state (EOS) parameter $\phi \equiv P/\varepsilon$, defined as the ratio of pressure to energy density, encapsulates the fundamental response of matter under extreme compression. Its value at the center of the most massive neutron star (NS), $\x \equiv \phi_{\rm c} = P_{\rm c}/\varepsilon_{\rm c}$, sets a universal upper bound on the maximum denseness attainable by any form of visible matter anywhere in the Universe. Remarkably, owing to the intrinsically nonlinear structure of the EOS in General Relativity (GR), this bound is forced to lie far below the naive Special Relativity (SR) limit of unity. In this work, we refine the theoretical upper bound on $\x$ in a self-consistent manner by incorporating, in addition to the causality constraint from SR, the mass-sphere stability condition associated with the mass evolution pattern in the vicinity of the NS center. This condition is formulated within the intrinsic-and-perturbative analysis of the dimensionless Tolman--Oppenheimer--Volkoff equations (IPAD-TOV) framework. The combined constraints yield an improved bound, $\x \lesssim 0.385$, which is slightly above but fully consistent with the previously derived causal-only limit, $\x \lesssim 0.374$. We further derive an improved scaling relation for NS compactness and verify its universality across a broad set of 284 realistic EOSs, including models with first-order phase transitions, exotic degrees of freedom, continuous crossover behavior, and deconfined quark cores. The resulting bound on $\x$ thus provides a new, EOS-independent window into the microphysics of cold superdense matter compressed by strong-field gravity in GR.</description>

      <title>Bounce Inflation with Dynamical Dark Energy in Light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.03028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument Data Release 2 (DESI DR2) suggests that the dark energy in our universe might be evolving, favoring the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) parameterization and a lower Hubble constant. In our previous work, it has been reported that cosmological model with the non-singular bounce inflation (BI) scenario and $\Lambda$CDM might alleviate the Hubble tension into 3$\sigma$ confidence. In this paper, we study the cosmological model of BI with a dynamical dark energy. We find that individual consideration of the CPL parameterization and the data \texttt{DESI DR2} tend to larger Hubble constants for both BI and power law (PL) case with cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. Employing BI with combined CPL parameterization and \texttt{DESI DR2}, we obtain the Hubble constant $H_ 0 = 65.2^{ + 1.8}_{ - 2.2} \ \mathrm{km} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \cdot \mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$, which is larger than $H_ 0 = 64.0 \pm 2.1 \ \mathrm{km} \cdot \mathrm{s}^{ -1 } \cdot \mathrm{Mpc}^{ -1 }$ for the PL case. After considering nontrivial weak lensing effect and spatial curvature as well as adding \texttt{Pantheon+}, BI fits 3.1$\sigma$ confidence of $\Lambda$CDM with $w_ 0 = -0.919 \pm 0.038$ and $w_{ \mathrm{a}} = -0.37 \pm 0.12$, and it prefers evolving dark energy than the PL case with $w_ 0 = -0.960 \pm 0.074$ and $w_{ \mathrm{a}} = -0.15^{ +0.28}_{ -0.25}$.</description>

      <title>The Interaction of Moving $\mathbf{Q\bar{Q}}$ and QQq in the Thermal Plasma</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02791v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The strength of the interaction between heavy quarks is studied for heavy quarkonium ($\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$) and doubly heavy baryons ($\mathrm{QQq}$) at finite temperature and rapidity using the gauge/gravity duality in this paper. We show that this theoretical framework is capable of simultaneously and accurately describing both $\mathrm{Q\bar{Q}}$ and $\mathrm{QQq}$ by fitting lattice potentials. In this framework, we study their interaction at long distances or low temperature and rapidity through effective string tension, while the interaction at short distances or high temperature and rapidity is studied through effective running coupling. Additionally, we plot their state diagram in the $T-\eta$ plane and systematically calculate their respective screening distances.</description>

      <title>Majorana CP Violation Insights from Decaying Neutrinos</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.21428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is well-known that within the standard three flavor neutrino oscillation formalism, the Majorana phases appearing in the neutrino mixing matrix cannot have any effect on neutrino oscillation probabilities thereby evading testability at neutrino oscillation experiments. We consider an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian describing three flavor neutrino oscillations with the possibility of neutrino decay and demonstrate that the two Majorana phases can entangle with the off-diagonal decay terms and appear at the level of oscillation probabilities. Using the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, we derive approximate analytical expressions for three flavor neutrino oscillation probabilities in the presence of neutrino decay, taking into account matter effects. In the context of a long baseline neutrino experiment, we then analyse the impact of Majorana phases on the oscillation probabilities for different channels as well as on observables related to CP violation effects in neutrino oscillations. Finally, we discuss the effect of Majorana phases on the parameter degeneracies in the neutrino oscillation framework.</description>

      <title>On the quantum numbers of the $X(1880)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07599v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the properties of the $X(1880)$, the structure around the $\bar{p}p$ threshold that appears in the $3(\pi^+\pi^-)$ invariant mass spectrum in the decay process of $J/\psi \to \gamma 3(\pi^+\pi^-)$. Nucleon-antinucleon rescattering is taken into account in our analysis, and the decay amplitude of $J/\psi \to \gamma 3(\pi^+\pi^-)$ can be obtained by the distorted wave Born approximation. With these amplitudes, we analyze the contributions to the $X(1880)$ from different partial waves. Our analysis suggests that the $X(1880)$ should be isoscalar $0^{-+}$, and it is generated by the threshold behavior.</description>

      <title>Predictions of masses for light hybrid baryons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14878v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Within the method of parity-projected QCD sum rules, we study the mass spectra of light hybrid baryons with $I(J^{P})=1/2(1/2^{\pm}), 3/2(1/2^{\pm}), 1/2(3/2^{\pm}), 3/2(3/2^{\pm})$ by constructing the local $qqqg$ interpolating currents. We calculate the correlation functions up to dimension eight condensates at the leading order of $\alpha_{s}$. The stable QCD Lapalce sum rules can be established for the positive-parity $N_{1/2^+}, \Delta_{3/2^+}, \Delta_{1/2^+}$ and negative-parity $N_{1/2^-}, N_{3/2^-}, \Delta_{1/2^-}$ channels to extract their mass spectra. The lowest-lying hybrid baryons are predicted to be the positive-parity $N_{1/2^+}$ state around 2.01 GeV. These hybrid baryons mainly decay into conventional baryon plus meson final states. We propose to search for the light hybrid baryons through the $\Upsilon/\psi(3686)$ decays via the three-gluon emission mechanism in BESIII and BelleII experiments. Hopefully our studies of the light hybrid baryons will be useful for understanding the excited baryon spectrum and the behavior of gluonic degrees of freedom in QCD.</description>

      <title>The $\beta$-decay spectrum of Tritiated graphene: combining nuclear quantum mechanics with Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13259v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the results of a multi-methodological study aimed at investigating the interaction between graphene and Tritium during its $\beta$-decay to Helium, under different levels of loading and geometrical configurations. We combine Density Functional Theory (DFT), to evaluate the interaction potentials, with calculations of the decay rate, in order to study the consequences that the presence of the substrate has on the $\beta$-decay spectrum of Tritium. We determine the shape of the event rate, accounting for the effects of (part of) the corresponding condensed matter degrees of freedom. In the context of future neutrino experiments, our results provide important information aimed at the optimization of hosting material, as well as the determination of the physics reach. Furthermore, our work outlines a novel theoretical and computational scheme to address a question at the boundary between high and low energy physics. This requires non-conventional declinations of DFT combined with full quantum treatments of the nuclear configuration involved in the decay process.</description>

      <title>Physics beyond the Standard Model with the DSA-2000</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23892v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The upcoming Deep Synoptic Array 2000 (DSA-2000) will map the radio sky at $0.7-2$ GHz ($2.9 - 8.3 \, \mu$eV) with unprecedented sensitivity. This will enable searches for dark matter and other physics beyond the Standard Model, of which we study four cases: axions, dark photons, dark matter subhalos and neutrino masses. We forecast DSA-2000's potential to detect axions through two mechanisms in neutron star magnetospheres: photon conversion of axion dark matter and radio emission from axion clouds, developing the first analytical treatment of the latter. We also forecast DSA-2000's sensitivity to discover kinetically mixed dark photons from black hole superradiance, constrain dark matter substructure and fifth forces through pulsar timing, and improve cosmological neutrino mass inference through fast radio burst dispersion measurements. Our analysis indicates that in its planned five year run the DSA-2000 could reach sensitivity to QCD axion parameters, improve current limits on compact dark matter by an order of magnitude, and enhance cosmological weak lensing neutrino mass constraints by a factor of three.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.06436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the scalaron, a scalar degree of freedom, emerging from the $f(R)$ theory of gravity, can account for the observed dark matter (DM) abundance if its mass is around the MeV scale, to ensure its cosmological stability. Focusing on two well-known $f(R)$ gravity models, we systematically show that if scalaron production proceeds via the freeze-in mechanism, the right relic abundance is satisfied over a very narrow window of reheating temperature $10^{14}\lesssim T_{\rm rh}\lesssim 10^{16}$ GeV. We delineate the viable parameter space of the $f(R)$ models consistent with the observed DM abundance, and highlight relevant experimental constraints from searches targeting DM decay signatures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.12589v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore an interacting dark matter (DM)-dark energy (DE) framework that naturally yields an effective dynamical DE equation of state crossing the phantom barrier at early times, as indicated by recent DESI data, while also accounting for the observed isotropic rotation of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) linear polarization. Within this unified framework, we also explain the DM relic abundance without introducing additional fields or couplings. Depending on the DE potential, we identify two viable scenarios: a superheavy freeze-in DM requiring a high reheating temperature, or a strongly interacting dark sector with a GeV-TeV scale thermal DM candidate.</description>

      <title>Thermal Radiation from an Analytic Hydrodynamic Model with Hadronic and QGP Sources in Heavy-Ion Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13240v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In high-energy heavy-ion collisions, a nearly perfect fluid is formed, known as the strongly coupled quark-gluon plasma (QGP). After a short thermalization period, the evolution of this medium can be described by the equations of relativistic hydrodynamics. As the system expands and cools, the QGP undergoes a transition into hadronic matter, marking the onset of quark confinement. Direct photons offer insights into an essential stage of evolution, spanning from the onset of thermalization to the suppression of thermal photon production, which occurs within the hadronic phase. This paper builds upon and extends a previously published solution of relativistic hydrodynamics, incorporating an equation of state that falls within the same class as that predicted by lattice QCD. Based on this solution, a completely analytic model is constructed to describe thermal photon production, accounting for the quark-hadron transition. The model is tested against PHENIX measurements of non-prompt direct photon spectra in Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} = 200$ GeV. Good agreement is observed between the model predictions and the experimental data, enabling the investigation of the centrality dependence of the initial temperature. These results provide a benchmark for future theoretical and experimental studies of thermal radiation in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.23092v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-photon exchange (TPE) is one of the leading explanations for discrepancies in measurements of the proton electromagnetic form factors. It has been proposed that TPE could impact not only elastic scattering, but also the cross sections for both inclusive deep inelastic scattering (DIS) and semi-inclusive DIS, thereby affecting the interpretation of DIS structure functions in terms of parton distributions. It is expected that higher-order QED effects such as TPE should manifest as a deviation from unity in the ratio of \epp and \emp DIS cross sections. We use the existing inclusive $e^{\pm}p$ DIS data from HERA and SLAC to constrain higher-order QED effects on inclusive DIS.</description>

      <title>Scale dependence improvement of the quartic scalar field thermal effective potential in the optimized perturbation theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.07250v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Perturbation theory, as well as most thermal field resummation methods widely used to study finite-temperature quantum field theories, presents a non-negligible renormalization scale dependence. To address this limitation, we propose an alternative method that combines the Renormalization Group Improvement (RGI) prescription for the thermal effective potential with the Optimized Perturbation Theory (OPT) variational resummation technique. Here, we apply this new framework, termed Variational Renormalization Group (VRG), to evaluate the effective potential of the scalar $\lambda \phi^4$ theory at finite temperatures, which represents a benchmark model for phase transition studies. We show that the proposed approach significantly improves scale stability, compared to the use of OPT alone, across key thermodynamic quantities, including the effective potential, critical temperature, and pressure. These results establish the VRG as a robust alternative tool for precision studies of thermal phase transitions, with direct implications for cosmological applications (e.g., early-universe thermodynamics) and condensed matter systems.</description>

      <title>Transition Form-Factor for $\eta_Q$ at NNLO in the strong coupling $\alpha_s$ and with all-order $v^2$ resummation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15310v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we discuss both relativistic and perturbative QCD corrections to the transition form-factor ${\cal F}_{\eta_Q}{(t_1,t_2)}$ for the process $\gamma^*(q_1) \gamma^*(q_2) \leftrightarrow \eta_Q(P)$ with dependencies on the normalised photon virtualities $t_1=q_1^2/m_Q^2$ and $t_2=q_2^2/m_Q^2$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark mass. We resum a class of relativistic corrections to all orders in the relativistic parameter $\langle v^2 \rangle_{\eta_Q}$. In addition, we include perturbative QCD corrections up to Next-to-Next-to-Leading Order (NNLO) in the strong coupling constant $\alpha_s$. This involves the computation of two-loop amplitudes with two off-shell photons. We explore three different phenomenological applications of our transition form-factors for the charmonium case. We first study the ratio $\vert {\cal F}_{\eta_c}{(t_1,0)} \vert/ \vert {\cal F}_{\eta_c}{(0,0)} \vert$ for the single space-like photon case and compare our results with the existing $\eta_c$ measurements from the BaBar collaboration. Secondly, we consider observables for the case of double space-like photons and discuss the impact of the different corrections. The NNLO corrections for this case are presented here for the first time in the literature. Finally, we revisit the decay width $\Gamma[\eta_c \rightarrow \gamma \gamma]$ and compare it with the existing PDG value.</description>

      <title>CP violation in the hyperon decays $\Sigma\to N\pi$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01134v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The study of $CP$ violation in hyperon transitions has a long history. In the early 2000s the HyperCP experiment made a major effort to seek $CP$-odd signals in the decay sequence $\Xi^-\to\Lambda \pi^-$ and $\Lambda\to p\pi^-$, which motivated more searches. Most recently the BESIII and LHCb Collaborations have acquired or improved the upper bounds on $CP$ violation in a variety of hyperon nonleptonic processes, including $\Sigma^+\to n\pi^+$ and $\Sigma^+\to p\pi^0$. These measurements have not reached the standard-model level yet, but have stimulated a renewed interest in $CP$-violating new physics in strange-quark decay beyond what is constrained by the parameters $\varepsilon$ and $\varepsilon^\prime$ from the kaon sector. In this paper, after updating the standard-model expectations for $CP$-odd observables in the modes $\Sigma^\pm\to N\pi$, we revisit new-physics scenarios that could enhance the corresponding quantities in $\Lambda\to N\pi$ and $\Xi\to\Lambda\pi$ and apply them to the $\Sigma^\pm$ modes. We find that the $CP$ asymmetries in the latter can be significantly increased over the standard-model expectations, at levels which may be tested in the ongoing BESIII experiment and in future endeavors such as PANDA and the Super Tau Charm Facility.</description>

      <title>High-energy $\eta^{(\prime)}\pi$ photoproduction and the nature of exotic waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.14549v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of hybrid mesons in photoproduction experiments can provide essential insight into the inner workings of quantum chromodynamics in the strong coupling regime. In particular, the study of final $\eta^{(\prime)}\pi$ states is of great interest due to the presence of the lowest lying hybrid candidate with manifestly exotic quantum numbers, the $\pi_1(1600)$. In this work, a double-vector exchange model with Reggeized $\rho$ and $\omega$ trajectories is developed to describe the photoproduction of $\eta^{(\prime)}\pi$ in the high-mass region. Results are presented for the differential cross sections and forward-backward asymmetries in the energy region of interest to the GlueX experiment. The model contains no free parameters, and reproduces the magnitude and $t$-dependence of existing CLAS data at $E_\gamma=5$\gev. The model predicts a stronger asymmetry in the $\eta^\prime \pi$ channel than in the $\eta \pi$ channel, consistent with what has previously been observed in pion beam experiments. This suggests that the sizeable production of exotic odd waves in $\eta'\pi$ is not necessarily related to the presence of gluon-rich environments. Confirmation of these predicted asymmetries from forthcoming GlueX data would enable further predictions of the low-energy spectrum.</description>

      <title>A new determination of higher-order QCD corrections to hadronic $\tau$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16119</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16119v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ \textit{Levin-type sequence transformations} to accelerate the convergence of the perturbative fixed-order expansion of the QCD correction $\delta^{(0)}$ in terms of the strong coupling $\alpha_s$. The method efficiently resums the series, yielding a stable and self-consistent determination of higher-order QCD corrections to hadronic $\tau$ decays, consistent with existing results. We find $\delta^{(0)}_{\text{Levin-FOPT}} = 0.2089 \pm 0.0040 \, \pm 0.0060_{\alpha_s} \, $, and predict $ c_{5,1} = 278^{+27}_{-19}, \quad c_{6,1} = 3375^{+489}_{-209}, \quad c_{7,1} = (2.03^{+0.41}_{-0.25}) \times 10^4. $ Our results demonstrate that Levin-type transformations provide an efficient framework for analyzing asymptotic perturbative series, and studying the higher order perturbative behaviour of the hadronic $\tau$ decays.</description>

      <title>Modelling $b\bar b H$ production for the LHC at 13.6 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18815v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present new state-of-the-art predictions for Standard Model Higgs boson production in association with a bottom-quark pair ($b\bar bH$). Updated cross sections are computed in accordance with the recommendations of the LHC Higgs Working Group, including the use of the PDF4LHC21 set of parton distribution functions, with a center-of-mass energy of 13.6 TeV. For the total inclusive cross section, we provide matched predictions of the massless five-flavour scheme and the massive four-flavour scheme at the fixed-order level. We further present recently obtained simulations matched to parton showers in both flavour schemes within the Standard Model, and also discuss them in the context of potential Beyond-the-Standard-Model scenarios. In the massless scheme, we compare different next-to-next-to-leading order predictions matched to parton showers obtained through the MiNNLOPS and GENEVA generators. In addition, the role of four-flavour scheme predictions is studied as a background to $HH$ searches, considering both the top-quark and bottom-quark Yukawa contributions to $b\bar bH$ production. Finally, we analyse the sensitivity of the Higgs transverse momentum spectrum to light-quark Yukawa couplings in the diphoton decay channel based on MiNNLOPS simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.02155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manual describes the usage and implementation of SE+BSF4DM, an add-on package for micrOMEGAs that includes the Sommerfeld effect and bound state formation in the numerical evaluation of the dark matter relic density for QCD-colored dark sectors, applicable to any model that can be mapped onto a simplified t-channel framework. The package seamlessly integrates these non-perturbative effects into the standard micrOMEGAs workflow, requiring minimal user modification. This document provides a comprehensive guide to the installation, configuration, and usage of SE+BSF4DM, serving as a practical user guide for dark matter phenomenologists.</description>

      <title>TauSpinner algorithms for including spin and New Physics effects in $\bar q q \rightarrow Z/\gamma^* \to \tau \tau$ process</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.22971v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The possible anomalous New Physics contributions to dipole and weak dipole moments of the $\tau$ lepton bring renewed interest in development and revisiting charge-parity violating signatures in $\tau$-pair production in $Z$-boson decay at energies of the LHC. In this paper, we discuss effects of anomalous contributions to polarisation and spin correlations in the $\bar q q \to \tau^+ \tau^-$ production processes, with $\tau$ decays included. Because of the complex nature of the resulting distributions, Monte Carlo techniques are useful, in particular of event reweighing with studied New Physics phenomena. Extensions of the Standard Model spin amplitudes, within Improved Born Approximation used for matrix element, are implemented in the TauSpinner program. This is mainly with $\tau$ dipole and weak dipole moments in mind, but is applicable to arbitrary New Physics interactions, provided they can be encapsulated into the Standard Model $2 \to 2$ structure of matrix element extensions. Implementation allows one also to introduce arbitrary phase-shift between vector and axial-vector couplings of $Z$ boson to $\tau$ leptons, which would have impact on observed transverse spin correlations. Basic formulas and algorithm principles are presented, together with distributions for spin correlation matrix. Numerical examples of impact on experimental signatures are shown in case of $\tau^\pm \to \rho^\pm \nu_\tau \to \pi^\pm \pi^0 \nu_\tau$ decays. Information on how to use and configure the TauSpinner program is given in Appendix.</description>

      <title>Correlating Resonant Di-Higgs and Tri-Higgs Production to $H\to VV$ in the 2HDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.24868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of resonant di-Higgs production, which would strongly suggest the existence of a new heavy neutral scalar $H$, has been searched for extensively at the LHC. In the two-Higgs doublet model (2HDM) with $m_H\gg m_h$, where $h$ is the Higgs boson of mass 125 GeV observed at the LHC, we show that a direct correlation emerges between Br$(H\to hh)$ and Br$(H\to VV)$, with $V=Z,W$, which depends only on $m_H$ (and $m_V$). In particular, for heavy scalar masses between 500\,GeV and 1\,TeV, we find that Br($H\to hh$)/ Br($H\to ZZ)\approx 9.5$. The origin of this prediction is most transparent in the Higgs basis, where the term in the scalar potential proportional to $\mathcal H_1^\dagger \mathcal H_1 \mathcal H_1^\dagger \mathcal H_2$ (and its hermitian conjugate) generates the leading contributions to the $Hhh$ and $Hhhh$ couplings in the decoupling limit of the 2HDM. Moreover, the latter coupling governs the resonant prompt tri-Higgs production via $H\to hhh$, which is also directly correlated to $H\to hh$ (and $H\to VV$), and can yield rates large enough to be measured at the High-Luminosity LHC.</description>

      <title>Constraints on heavy decaying dark matter from 570 days of LHAASO observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15989v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Kilometer Square Array~(KM2A) of the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) aims at surveying the northern gamma-ray sky at energies above 10 TeV with unprecedented sensitivity. Gamma-ray observations have long been one of the most powerful tools for dark matter searches, as e.g., high-energy gamma-rays could be produced by the decays of heavy dark matter particles. In this letter, we present the first dark matter analysis with LHAASO-KM2A, using the first 340~days of data from 1/2-KM2A and 230~days of data from 3/4-KM2A. Several regions of interest are used to search for a signal and account for the residual cosmic-ray background after gamma/hadron separation. We find no excess of dark matter signals, and thus place some of the strongest gamma-ray constraints on the lifetime of heavy dark matter particles with mass between 10^5 and 10^9~GeV. Our results with LHAASO are robust, and have important implications for dark matter interpretations of the diffuse astrophysical high-energy neutrino emission.</description>

      <title>Universality of scaled particle spectra in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15208v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the transverse momentum spectra of identified particles in ultrarelativistic collisions of large and small collision systems. In order to isolate information contained in the momentum dependence, we propose to scale the spectra by the total particle number and mean transverse momentum -- global quantities which are already well studied. We observe an interesting, nearly universal, centrality-independent shape in the scaled spectra, similar to scalings that have been studied previously. This scaling behavior breaks down at large transverse momentum and for very small systems, such as those produced in p-p collisions. We perform hybrid hydrodynamic simulations and show that, in these simulations, a centrality-independent shape is a consequence of an event-by-event independence. Our results motivate further theoretical and experimental investigations of the regime of validity of this scaling phenomenon and their physical interpretation at different collision energies and systems.</description>

      <title>Monitoring the daily variation of Sun-Earth magnetic fields using galactic cosmic rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09064v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) between the Sun and Earth is an extension of the solar magnetic field carried by the solar wind into interplanetary space. Monitoring variations in the IMF upstream of the Earth would provide very important information for the prediction of space weather effects, such as effects of solar storms and the solar wind, on human activity. In this study, the IMF between the Sun and Earth was measured daily for the first time using a cosmic-ray observatory. Cosmic rays mainly consist of charged particles that are deflected as they pass through a magnetic field.Therefore, the cosmic-ray Sun shadow, caused by high-energy charged cosmic rays blocked by the Sun and deflected by the magnetic field, can be used to explore the transverse IMF between the Sun and Earth. By employing the powerful kilometer-square array at the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory, the cosmic-ray Sun shadows were observed daily with high significance for the first time. The displacement of the Sun shadow measured in 2021 correlates well with the transverse IMF component measured in situ by spacecraft near the Earth, with a time lag of 3:31 $\pm$ 0:12 days. The displacement of the Sun shadow was also simulated using Parker's classic IMF model, yielding a time lag of 2:06 $\pm$ 0:04 days. This deviation may provide valuable insights into the magnetic field structure, which can improve space weather research.</description>

      <title>Charge-dependent nucleon-nucleon interaction at N$^3$LO in nuclear lattice effective field theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT) is an efficient tool for solving nuclear many-body problems, which takes high-fidelity lattice chiral interactions as input and computes nuclear low-energy observables via quantum Monte Carlo techniques. In this work, we present the first next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) chiral forces on the lattice with the isospin-breaking effects fully taken into account. We focus on both the charge-independence breaking (CIB) and charge-symmetry breaking (CSB) effects. Specifically, we include the isospin-breaking effect from the mass difference between the charged and neutral pions in the one-pion-exchange potential (OPEP), the Coulomb force for the $pp$ interaction and the contribution of two additional charge-dependent contact operators. We also explicitly incorporate the two-pion-exchange potentials which was mostly neglected in previous NLEFT calculations. With these improvements, we are able to accurately reproduce the $np$ and $pp$ scattering phase shifts up to relative momentum $p \sim 200$ MeV as well as the deuteron properties. The construction of these charge-dependent lattice nuclear forces establishes a solid foundation for future high-precision nuclear ab initio calculations within the NLEFT framework.</description>

Abstract: The Muon Collider, recently highlighted as Recommendation 1 in the U.S. National Academies report on Elementary Particle Physics, offers a unique opportunity for fixed-target experiments with high energy and luminosity. This paper outlines some of the challenges and possibilities for fixed-target experiments to study the multi-dimensional structure of hadrons at the Muon Collider. We present a sketch of an experiment making use of the high-energy muon beam from the Muon Collider that could serve as the next-generation hadronic physics experiment after the Electron-Ion Collider.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22318v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study topological properties of a quantum mechanical system with $U(1)$-symmetry within the functional renormalisation group (fRG) approach. These properties include the vacuum energy structure and the topological susceptibility. Our approach works with a complexification of the flow equation, and specifically we embed the original symmetry into the complex plane, $U(1)\rightarrow \mathbb{C}$. We compute the effective potential of a given topological sector by restricting ourselves to field configurations with a given generalised non-trivial Chern-Simons numbers. The full potential is directly constructed from these sector potentials. Our results compare well with the benchmark results obtained from solving the corresponding Schr\"odinger equation.</description>

      <title>Beyond $\rho^{2/3}$ Scaling: Microscopic Origins and Multimessengers of High-Density Nuclear Symmetry Energy</title>

Abstract: Nuclear symmetry energy $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ encoding the cost to make nuclear matter more neutron rich has been the most uncertain component of the EOS of dense neutron-rich nucleonic matter. It affects significantly the radii, tidal deformations, cooling rates and frequencies of various oscillation modes of isolated neutron stars as well as the strain amplitude and frequencies of gravitational waves from their mergers, besides its many effects on structures of nuclei as well as the dynamics and observables of their collisions. Siemens (1970s) observed that $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ scales as $(\rho/\rho_0)^{2/3}$ near the saturation density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter, since both the kinetic part and the potential contribution (quadratic in momentum) exhibit this dependence. The scaling holds if: (1) the nucleon isoscalar potential is quadratic in momentum, and (2) the isovector interaction is weakly density dependent. After examining many empirical evidences and understanding theoretical findings in the literature we conclude that: (1) Siemens' $\rho^{2/3}$ scaling is robust and serves as a valuable benchmark for both nuclear theories and experiments up to $2\rho_0$ but breaks down at higher densities, (2) Experimental and theoretical findings about $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ up to $2\rho_0$ are broadly consistent, but uncertainties remain large for its curvature $K_{\mathrm{sym}}$ and higher-order parameters, (3) Above $2\rho_0$, uncertainties grow due to poorly constrained spin-isospin dependent tensor and three-body forces as well as the resulting nucleon short-range correlations. Looking forward, combining multimessengers from both observations of neutron stars and terrestrial heavy-ion reaction experiments is the most promising path to finally constraining precisely the high-density $E_{\mathrm{sym}}(\rho)$ and the EOS of supradense neutron-rich matter.</description>

      <title>Charged-Current Elastic Scattering at the Electron-Ion Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.02049v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss the measurement of the charged-current elastic scattering process $e^-p\rightarrow\nu_e n$ at the Electron-Ion Collider (EIC). This process provides sensitivity to the poorly constrained axial form factor of the nucleon, which encodes the spatial distribution of weak charge. Collisions of electrons with polarized protons enable measuring the axial form factor via the $e^{-\!}\,\vec{p} \to \nu_e\,n$ target-spin asymmetry for the first time. We conclude that a measurement of charged-current elastic scattering at the EIC will, perhaps unsurprisingly, prove very challenging. However, with dedicated instrumentation at a second EIC detector, the measurement may be possible.</description>
