      <title>Signatures of ballistic and diffusive transport in the time-dependent Kerr-response of magnetic materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18686</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18686v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calculate the influence of diffusive and ballistic transport on ultrafast magnetization in thick metallic films. When only diffusive transport is present, gradients of magnetization in the material remain up to picosecond timescales. In contrast, in the extreme superdiffusive limit where ballistic transport dominates, the magnetization changes homogeneously in space. We calculate the measurable magneto-optical responses for a $\SI{40}{\nano\meter}$ Nickel film. Although the resulting Kerr rotation dynamics are found to be very similar in the two limits of transport, our simulations reveal a clear signature of magnetization gradients in the Kerr ellipticity dynamics, namely a strong probe-angle dependence for the case when diffusive transport allows gradients to persist. We then perform probe-angle dependent complex magneto-optical Kerr effect (CMOKE) measurements on an excited \SI{40}{\nano\meter} Nickel film. The angle dependence of the measured Kerr signals closely matches the simulated response with diffusive transport. Therefore we conclude that the influence of ballistic transport on ultrafast magnetization dynamics in such films is negligible.</description>

      <title>The local structure, electronic and optical properties of Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$-PbTiO$_3$: first-principles study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pb(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)O$_3$-PbTiO$_3$ perovskite-based crystals attract considerable scientific interest due to their interesting properties and possible use in piezoelectricity and photovoltaics. To understand the local structure and fundamental properties of such materials, in this work, we focused on the study within the density functional theory of structural, electronic, and optical properties of Pb[(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)$_{0.75}$Ti$_{0.25}$]O$_3$. Using GGA(PBEsol) approximation for structure optimization gives a good agreement with experimental data. Through the variation in Hubbard $U$ parameters to GGA(PBEsol) functional, we achieve the bandgap for the Pb[(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)$_{0.75}$Ti$_{0.25}$]O$_3$ which is in good agreement with the experimental results. The study of the bond populations showed that the Mg-O bond demonstrates no covalency, whereas there is a significant Ti-O and Nb-O covalent bonding. Such different bonding characteristics must be responsible for the relaxor properties of Pb[(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)$_{0.75}$Ti$_{0.25}$]O$_3$ compound. In addition, the investigations of the optical properties of the Pb[(Mg$_{1/3}$Nb$_{2/3}$)$_{0.75}$Ti$_{0.25}$]O$_3$ by adopting Hubbard $U$ corrections, modifying the error of the GGA approximation, and confirming the electronic analysis, were performed.</description>

      <title>Thermoelectric transport in molecular crystals driven by gradients of thermal electronic disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18785v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermoelectric materials convert a temperature gradient into a voltage. This phenomenon is relatively well understood for inorganic materials, but much less so for organic semiconductors (OSs). These materials present a challenge because the strong thermal fluctuations of electronic coupling between the molecules result in partially delocalized charge carriers that cannot be treated with traditional theories for thermoelectricity. Here we develop a novel quantum dynamical simulation approach revealing in atomistic detail how the charge carrier wavefunction moves along a temperature gradient in an organic molecular crystal. We find that the wavefunction propagates from hot to cold in agreement with experiment and we obtain a Seebeck coefficient in good agreement with values obtained from experimental measurements that are also reported in this work. Detailed analysis of the dynamics reveals that the directional charge carrier motion is due to the gradient in thermal electronic disorder, more specifically in the spatial gradient of thermal fluctuations of electronic couplings. It causes an increase in the density of thermally accessible electronic states, the delocalization of states and the non-adiabatic coupling between states with decreasing temperature. As a result, the carrier wavefunction transitions with higher probability to a neighbouring electronic state towards the cold side compared to the hot side generating a thermoelectric current. Our dynamical perspective of thermoelectricity suggests that the temperature dependence of electronic disorder plays an important role in determining the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient in this class of materials, opening new avenues for design of OSs with improved Seebeck coefficients.</description>

      <title>Lattice Energy Reservoir in Metal Halide Perovskites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Metal halide perovskite-based technologies have been rapidly developed during the last decade. However, to date, the fundamental question, why are halide perovskites superior to conventional semiconductors? has remained elusive. Here, we propose a new theory of lattice energy reservoir (LER) in halide perovskites and elucidate that LER can comprehensively impact charge carrier dynamics and thus enhance device performance, from hot carrier cooling, carrier recombination, anomalous upconversion fluorescence, illumination induced fluorescence enhancement (photobrightening), to high efficiency solar cells and light-emitting diodes. An LER is a dynamic nanodomain in halide perovskites with suppressed thermal transport that can accumulate energy from phonon coupling and then feedback to subgap carriers and result in subgap carrier upconversion. The LER directly results in slowed cooling of hot carriers and significantly prolonged carrier recombination, anomalous upconversion fluorescence, as usually termed as defect tolerance, as well as the anomalous ultraslow phenomena including persistent polarization, memory effect, and photobrightening. The LER theory rationalizes the superior optoelectronic properties and device performance and provides a novel physical understanding for anomalous phenomena observed uniquely in halide perovskites.</description>

      <title>ViPErLEED package I: Calculation of $I(V)$ curves and structural optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-energy electron diffraction (LEED) is a widely used technique in surface-science. Yet, it is rarely used to its full potential. The quantitative information about the surface structure, contained in the modulation of the intensities of the diffracted beams as a function of incident electron energy, LEED I(V), is underutilized. To acquire these data, minor adjustments would be required in most experimental setups, but existing analysis software is cumbersome to use. ViPErLEED (Vienna package for Erlangen LEED) lowers these barriers, introducing a combined solution for data acquisition, extraction, and computational analysis. These parts are discussed in three separate publications. Here, the focus is on the computational part of ViPErLEED, which performs automated LEED-I(V) calculations and structural optimization. Minimal user input is required, and the functionality is significantly enhanced compared to existing solutions. Computation is performed by embedding the Erlangen tensor-LEED package (TensErLEED). ViPErLEED manages parallelization, monitors convergence, and processes input and output. This makes LEED I(V) more accessible to new users while minimizing the potential for errors and the manual labor. Added functionality includes structure-dependent defaults, automatic detection of bulk and surface symmetries and their relationship, automated symmetry-preserving search procedures, adjustments to the TensErLEED code to handle larger systems, as well as parallelization and optimization. Modern file formats are used as input and output, and there is a direct interface to the Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) package. The software is implemented primarily in Python (version &gt;=3.7) and provided as an open-source package (GNU GPLv3 or later). A structure determination of the $\alpha$-Fe2O3(1-102)-(1x1) surface is presented as an example for the application of the software.</description>

      <title>Electric-field control of the perpendicular magnetization switching in ferroelectric/ferrimagnet heterostructures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electric field control of the magnetic state in ferrimagnets holds great promise for developing spintronic devices due to low power consumption. Here, we demonstrate a non-volatile reversal of perpendicular net magnetization in a ferrimagnet by manipulating the electric-field driven polarization within the Pb (Zr0.2Ti0.8) O3 (PZT)/CoGd heterostructure. Electron energy loss spectra and X-ray absorption spectrum directly verify that the oxygen ion migration at the PZT/CoGd interface associated with reversing the polarization causes the enhanced/reduced oxidation in CoGd. Ab initio calculations further substantiate that the migrated oxygen ions can modulate the relative magnetization of Co/Gd sublattices, facilitating perpendicular net magnetization switching. Our findings offer an approach to effectively control ferrimagnetic net magnetization, holding significant implications for ferrimagnetic spintronic applications.</description>

      <title>Slow polymer dynamics in poly(3-hexylthiophene) probed by muon spin relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The molecular dynamics of regioregulated poly(3-hexylthiophene) P3HT is investigated using muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR). The response of the $\mu$SR spectra to a longitudinal magnetic field ($B_{\rm LF}$, parallel to the initial muon spin direction) indicates that the implanted muons form both muonated radicals localized on the thiophene ring and diamagnetic states with comparable yields. Moreover, the unpaired electron in the radical undergoes hyperfine interactions with muon bound to thiophene and with neighboring protons, whose fluctuations can serve as a measure for the molecular dynamics. The $B_{\rm LF}$ dependence of the longitudinal muon spin relaxation rate ($1/T_{1\mu}$) measured in detail at several temperatures is found to be well reproduced by the spectral density function $J(\omega)$ derived from the local susceptibility that incorporates the Havriliak-Negami (H-N) function used in the analysis of dielectric relaxation, $\chi(\omega)\propto1/[1-i(\omega/\tilde{\nu})^\delta]^\gamma$ (where $\tilde{\nu}$ is the mean fluctuation rate, and $0&lt;\gamma, \delta\le1$). The magnitude of $\tilde{\nu}$ and its temperature dependence deduced from the analysis of $1/T_{1\mu}$ are found to be consistent with the motion of hexyl chains and thiophene rings suggested by $^{13}$C-NMR. The present result marks a methodological milestone in the application of $\mu$SR to the dynamics of complex systems with coexisting fluctuations over a wide range of time scales, such as polymers.</description>

      <title>Topotaxial Mutual-Exchange Growth of Magnetic Zintl Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$ Nanowires with Axion Insulator Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18956v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanomaterials bring to expression unique electronic properties that promote advanced functionality and technologies. Albeit, nanoscale growth presents paramount challenges for synthesis limiting the diversity in structures and compositions. Here, we demonstrate solid-state topotactic exchange that converts Wurtzite InAs nanowires into Zintl phase Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$ nanowires. In situ evaporation of Eu and As over InAs nanowire cores in molecular beam epitaxy results in mutual exchange of Eu from the shell and In from the core. A continuous Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$ shell thereby grows that gradually consumes the InAs core and converts it into a single phase Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$ nanowire. Topotaxy, which facilitates the mutual exchange, is supported by the substructure of the As matrix which is similar across the Wurtzite InAs and Zintl Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$. We provide initial evidence of an antiferromagnetic transition at T$_N$ $\sim$ 6.5 K in the Zintl phase Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$ nanowires. Ab initio calculation confirms the antiferromagnetic state and classifies Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$ as a $C_2 T$ axion insulator hosting both chiral hinge modes and unpinned Dirac surface states. The topotactic mutual-exchange growth of Zintl Eu$_3$In$_2$As$_4$ nanowires thus enables the exploration of intricate magneto-topological states of nanomaterials. Moreover, it may open the path for topotactic mutual-exchange synthesis of nanowires made of other exotic compounds.</description>

      <title>Antiferromagnetic nanoscale bit arrays of magnetoelectric Cr$_2$O$_3$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetism of oxide antiferromagnets (AFMs) has been studied in single crystals and extended thin films. The properties of AFM nanostructures still remain underexplored. Here, we report on the fabrication and magnetic imaging of granular 100-nm-thick magnetoelectric Cr$_2$O$_3$ films patterned in circular bits with diameters ranging from 500 down to 100 nm. With the change of the lateral size, the domain structure evolves from a multidomain state for larger bits to a single domain state for the smallest bits. Based on spin-lattice simulations, we show that the physics of the domain pattern formation in granular AFM bits is primarily determined by the energy dissipation upon cooling, which results in motion and expelling of AFM domain walls of the bit. Our results provide a way towards the fabrication of single domain AFM-bit-patterned memory devices and the exploration of the interplay between AFM nanostructures and their geometric shape.</description>

      <title>Temperature Dependence of Phonon Energies and Lifetimes in Single- and Few-layered Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19155v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we have studied the phonon properties of multi-layered graphene with the use of Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations and the k-space Autocorrelation Sequence (k-VACS) method. We calculate the phonon dispersion curves, densities of states and lifetimes $\tau$ of few-layered graphene of 1-5 layers and graphite. $\Gamma$-point phonon energies and lifetimes are investigated for different temperatures ranging from 80 K to 1000 K. The study focuses on the impact of the interlayer interaction and temperature on the energies and lifetimes of the $\Gamma$-point phonons, as well as the type of interlayer potential used. For the later we used the Kolmogorov-Crespi (KC) and the Lennard-Jones (LJ) potentials. We have found that the number of layers $N$ has little effect on the intra-layer (ZO and G) mode energies and greater effect on the inter-layer (Layer Shearing and Layer Breathing) modes, while $\tau$ is generally affected by $N$ for all modes, except for the Layer Shear mode. The trend of $N$ on the lifetimes was also found to independent of the type of potential used. For the Raman-active G phonon, our calculations show that the lifetime increase with $N$ and that this increase is directly connected to the strength of the interlayer coupling and how this is modelled.</description>

      <title>Flat band physics in the charge-density wave state of $1T$-TaS$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: 1$T$-TaS$_2$ is the only insulating transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) with an odd number of electrons per unit cell. This insulating state is non-magnetic, making it a potential spin-liquid candidate. The unusual electronic behavior arises from a naturally occurring nearly flat mini-band, where the properties of the strongly correlated states are significantly influenced by the microscopic starting point, necessitating a detailed and careful investigation. We revisit the electronic band structure of 1$T$-TaS$_2$, starting with the tight-binding model without CDW order. Symmetry dictates the nature of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which, unlike in the 2H TMD structure, allows for strong off-diagonal "spin-flip" terms as well as Ising SOC. Incorporating the CDW phase, we construct a 78$\times$78 tight-binding model to analyze the band structure as a function of various parameters. Our findings show that an isolated flat band is a robust feature of this model. Depending on parameters such as SOC strength and symmetry-allowed orbital splittings, the flat band can exhibit non-trivial topological classifications. These results have significant implications for the strongly correlated physics emerging from interacting electrons in the half-filled or doped flat band.</description>

      <title>The Origin of Sound Damping in Amorphous Solids: Defects and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18667</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18667v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Comprehending sound damping is integral to understanding the anomalous low temperature properties of glasses. After decades of theoretical and experimental studies, Rayleigh scattering scaling of the sound attenuation coefficient with frequency, $\Gamma \sim \omega^{d+1}$, became generally accepted when quantum and finite temperature effects can be neglected. Rayleigh scaling invokes a picture of scattering from defects. However, it is unclear how to define glass defects, or even if defects are necessary for Rayleigh scaling. Here we determine a particle level contribution to sound damping in the Rayleigh scaling regime. We find that there are areas in the glass that contribute more to sound damping than other areas over a range of frequencies, which allows us to define defects. We show that over a range of glass stability, sound damping scales linearly with the fraction of particles in the defects. However, sound is still attenuated in ultra-stable glasses where no defects are identified. We show that sound damping in these glasses is due to nearly uniformly distributed non-affine, microscopic forces that arise after macroscopic deformations of non-centrosymetric structures. To fully understand sound attenuation in glasses one has to consider contributions from defects and a defect-free background, which represents a new paradigm of sound damping in glasses.</description>

      <title>Superconducting phase diagram in Bi$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$ thin films$\colon$ the effects of Bi stoichiometry on superconductivity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.18704v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Bi${-}$Ni binary system has been of interest due to possible unconventional superconductivity aroused therein, such as time-reversal symmetry breaking in Bi/Ni bilayers or the coexistence of superconductivity and ferromagnetism in Bi$_3$Ni crystals. While Ni acts as a ferromagnetic element in such systems, the role of strong spin-orbit-coupling element Bi in superconductivity has remained unexplored. In this work, we systematically studied the effects of Bi stoichiometry on the superconductivity of Bi$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$ thin films (${x} \approx$ 0.5 to 0.9) fabricated via a composition-spread approach. The superconducting phase map of Bi$_x$Ni$_{1-x}$ thin films exhibited a superconducting composition region attributable to the intermetallic Bi$_3$Ni phase with different amount of excess Bi, revealed by synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis. Interestingly, the mixed phase region with Bi$_3$Ni and Bi showed unusual increases in the superconducting transition temperature and residual resistance ratio as more Bi impurities were included, with the maximum ${T}_{c}$ ($=$ 4.2 K) observed at $x \approx$ 0.79. A correlation analysis of structural, electrical, and magneto-transport characteristics across the composition variation revealed that the unusual superconducting $"$dome$"$ is due to two competing roles of Bi$\colon$ impurity scattering and carrier doping. We found that the carrier doping effect is dominant in the mild doping regime (0.74 $\leq {x} \leq$ 0.79), while impurity scattering becomes more pronounced at larger Bi stoichiometry.</description>

      <title>Angle-dependent planar thermal Hall effect by quasi-ballistic phonons in black phosphorus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18816v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the phonon thermal Hall effect in insulators is a matter of ongoing debate. The large amplitude of the signal in an elemental non-magnetic solid, such as black phosphorus (BP) calls for a minimal mechanism with no role for spin degree of freedom. Here, we show that a longitudinal heat flow generates a transverse temperature gradient in BP even when the magnetic field, the heat current and the thermal gradient lie in the same plane. The long phonon mean-free-path leaves little room for scattering by point-like symmetry breaking defects. we show that the signal peaks when the magnetic field is oriented along one of the two diagonal orientations of the puckered honeycomb plane and argue that this can be understood as the sum of two distinct contributions each parallel to a mirror plane. This angular dependence as well as the order of magnitude of the observed signal points to the torque exerted by magnetic field on electric dipoles traveling with heat-carrying phonons as the driver of the effect.</description>

Abstract: Since entering the information era, electronic devices gradually play an important role in daily lives. However, the abuse of electronic devices leads to corresponding electromagnetic EM wave pollution. The complex external environment causes the potential for physical impact. In this work, an ANF MXene SSG flexible sandwich structure was fabricated according to methods of vacuum filtration, directional freeze-casting solidification, and polyurethane encapsulation. Apart from its excellent protection function, the sandwich structure also acts as a human body movement sensor.</description>

      <title>Anisotropy in Electronic and Magneto-transport of 2D superconductor NbSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This article reports the successful synthesis of single crystalline two-dimensional thin flakes of NbSe$_2$. The XRD pattern of the grown crystal ensured its crystallization in a single phase with a hexagonal structure. The EDAX endorsed the stoichiometry of the as grown sample. To study the vibrational modes, the Raman spectra were recorded, which exhibited the expected four Raman active modes. The resistance vs temperature measurement showed a well-established superconducting transition (Tc) at 7.3 K. The ZFC (Zero-Field Cooled) &amp; FC (Field Cooled) magnetization curves, as well as the isothermal MH (Magnetization vs. field) measurements, have been performed for both in plane and out-of-plane H directions. Distinct anisotropy is observed in both magnetization and magneto-transport measurements with field direction, leading to different critical fields (Hc). Out-of-plane magneto-transport data hints towards the existence of a filamentary state. The density functional theory (DFT) has been used to study the band structure of NbSe$_2$. Although the bulk band structure confirmed metallic behavior, the same for mono-layers of NbSe$_2$ within the GGA+U framework showed a band gap of 1.17eV. The article addresses the anisotropy in the electronic and magneto-transport of 2D superconductor NbSe$_2$.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18971v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The synergy of strong spin-orbit coupling and electron-electron interactions gives rise to unconventional topological states, such as topological Mott insulator, Weyl semimetal, and quantum spin liquid. In this study, we have grown single crystals of the pyrochlore iridate Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ and explored its magnetic, lattice dynamical, and electronic properties. While Raman spectroscopy data reveal six phonon modes confirming the cubic \textit{Fd$\bar{3}$m} crystal symmetry, dc magnetic susceptibility data show no anomalies and hence indicate the absence of magnetic phase transitions down to 2~K. Both temperature-dependent electric transport and optical conductivity data reveal the metallic character of Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$. The optical conductivity spectrum contains a mid-infrared absorption band, which becomes more pronounced with decreasing temperature due to spectral weight transfer from high to low energies. The presence of the mid-infrared band hints at the importance of correlation physics. The optical response furthermore suggests that Pr$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ is close to the Weyl semimetal phase.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study presents the development of an integrated device for measuring magnetoelastic resonance, utilizing a gain/phase detector and the Arduino platform. The device stands out for its simplicity, low cost, and efficiency. It employs the Arduino's ATmega328P microcontroller, coupled with the AD8302, and an intuitive graphical interface developed in Python, which facilitates the measurement of magnetoelastic signals in sensors.

      <title>Light-induced optical orientation of magnetic moments in transition-metal doped hybrid metal halide perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19127v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using optical orientation to manipulate magnetic moments in matter with light is a key objective in opto-spintronics, however, realizations of such control on ultrafast timescales are limited. Here, we report ultrafast optical control of magnetic moment orientation in magnetically doped metal halide perovskites. Employing intense pulses of circularly polarized light, we inject populations of spin-polarized charge carriers in pristine and manganese-doped MAPbBr3 thin films. Using transient Faraday rotation spectroscopy, we probe the ultrafast magnetic moment dynamics following photoexcitation and find that light-induced magnetization in doped samples is increased by a factor of 10. We attribute this to photoexcited carriers acting on the magnetic moments of manganese dopant-ions via the sp-d exchange interaction, which forces them to align on picosecond timescales. Our findings open new avenues for device structures that use hybrid metal halide perovskites for ultrafast optical manipulation and read-out of magnetic order with the potential for high switching rates.</description>

      <title>Competition between metal bonding and strain in tetragonal V$_{1-x}$M$_x$O$_2$ (M = Nb, Mo)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.19200v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Though the effects of metal dopants on the electrostructural transition of rutile VO$_2$ have been studied for many decades, there is still no consensus explanation for the observed trends. A major challenge has been to separate the impact of a dopant's size from other factors such as its electronic configuration, which stems from the difficulty in directly probing the local bonding environment around a dopant atom. This work addresses the special case of larger dopant ions by combining X-ray total scattering experiments on V$_{0.83}$Mo$_{0.17}$O$_2$ and V$_{0.89}$Nb$_{0.11}$O$_2$ single crystals with multiple Monte Carlo method models to simulate local size effects in the high-temperature tetragonal phase (R). We find that sufficiently long apical metal-oxygen bonds (M$-$O$_{ap}$) induce a strain field in the neighboring chains that locally resembles the metal-metal dimer formation present in the low-temperature distorted structure of VO$_2$ (M1). The dimer mode in the M1 structure is antisymmetric along M$-$O$_{ap}$, however, while the strain-induced pseudodimer motif is symmetric. The implied direct competition between motifs is verified experimentally. This finding provides a new mechanistic parameter toward understanding the phase transition. More generally, the work highlights how local strain fields around dopants can lead to complex distortions that are ordinarily attributed to electronic origins.</description>

      <title>Imaging semiconductor-to-metal transition and topological flat bands of twisted bilayer MoTe2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.19310v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) moir\'e materials have emerged as a highly tunable platform for investigating novel quantum states of matter arising from strong electronic correlations and nontrivial band topology. Recently, topological flat bands formed in 2D semiconducting moir\'e superlattices have attracted great interests. In particular, a series of topological quantum phases, including the long-sought fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, have recently been experimentally observed in twisted bilayer MoTe2 (tMoTe2). However, the microscopic information of tMoTe2 moir\'e superlattice and its electronic structure is still lacking. Here, we present scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) studies of the tMoTe2 moir\'e superlattice, with twist angles ranging from about 2.3{\deg} to 2.8{\deg}. We developed a contact-STM mode to apply pressure on tMoTe2 and observed a phase transition from band insulator to metal of tMoTe2 under pressure at the charge neutrality point. STM imaging reveals a pronounced in-plane lattice reconstruction with periodic strain redistribution in the tMoTe2, which serves as gauge fields for generating topological moir\'e bands. Importantly, the electronic states of the low-energy moir\'e flat bands primarily concentrate at the XM and MX regions as revealed by STS imaging. Such spatial distributions are nicely reproduced by our first principal calculations with a large-scale basis, suggesting the low-energy moir\'e flat bands are formed through the hybridization of K valley bands of the top layer and K' valley bands of the bottom layer. Overall, our findings provide compelling real-space evidence of electronic structure under pressure and topological flat bands of tMoTe2, paving the way for further STM/STS investigations of correlated topological states within the topological flat band in gate-tunable tMoTe2 devices.</description>

      <title>Role of magnetic ions in the thermal Hall effect of the paramagnetic insulator TmVO$_{4}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.10643v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a growing number of materials, phonons have been found to generate a thermal Hall effect, but the underlying mechanism remains unclear. Inspired by previous studies that revealed the importance of Tb$^{3+}$ ions in generating the thermal Hall effect in a family of pyrochlores, we investigated the role of Tm$^{3+}$ ions in TmVO$_{4}$, a paramagnetic insulator with a different crystal structure. We observe a negative thermal Hall conductivity in TmVO$_{4}$ with a magnitude such that the Hall angle, $|\kappa_{xy}$/$\kappa_{xx}|$, is approximately 1 x 10$^{-3}$ at $H$ = 15 T and $T$ = 20 K, typical for a phonon-generated thermal Hall effect. In contrast to the negligible $\kappa_{xy}$ found in the nonmagnetic pyrochlore analog (where the Tb$^{3+}$ ions are replaced with Y$^{3+}$), we observe a negative $\kappa_{xy}$ in YVO$_{4}$ with a Hall angle of magnitude comparable to that of TmVO$_{4}$. This shows that the Tm$^{3+}$ ions are not essential for the thermal Hall effect in this family of materials. Interestingly, at an intermediate Y concentration of $x$ = 0.3 in Tm$_{1-x}$Y$_{x}$VO$_{4}$, $\kappa_{xy}$ was found to have a positive sign, pointing to the importance of impurities in the thermal Hall effect of phonons.</description>

      <title>Establishing the relationship between generalized crystallographic texture and macroscopic yield surfaces using partial input convex neural networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.03863v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a methodology to predict the macroscopic yield surface of metals and metallic alloys with general crystallographic textures. In previous work, we have established the use of partially input convex neural networks (pICNN) as macroscopic yield functions of crystal plasticity simulations. However, this work was performed with an over-abundance of data, and on limited crystallographic textures. Here, we extend this study to approach more realistic material states (i.e., complex crystallographic textures), and consider data-availability as a major driver for our approach. We present our modified framework capable of handling generalized material states and demonstrate its effectiveness on samples with multi-modal textures deformed under plane stress conditions. We further describe an adaptive algorithm for the generation of training data as informed by the shape of yield surfaces to reduce the time for both the generation of training data as well as pICNN training. Finally, we will discuss errors in both training and test datasets, limitations, and future extensibility.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.10818v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diffusion in a two-phase system is a classical problem discussed in the literature. The general solution of the one-dimensional case to this problem is revisited and a detailed derivation is proposed. The solution is discussed in relationship with ion exchange in silicate glasses. The general solution is compared with the complementary error function solution and they have identified the assumptions under which the general solution reduces to the erfc one. Interface or glass surface issues related to ion exchange are discussed in terms of the ratio between the diffusion coefficients of the diffusing alkali ions in the glass and the ion reservoir phases respectively. Another relevant issue can be identified in the assumption of instantaneous equilibrium at the two-phase interface once the contact is established. Even though this last assumption is somehow unphysical it is the common approach used in the technological application of ion exchange in silicate glass which is justified when the contact time that is immersion time of glass with an ion reservoir is much larger than the time to achieve thermodynamic equilibrium at the surface.</description>

      <title>Evaluating and improving the predictive accuracy of mixing enthalpies and volumes in disordered alloys from universal pre-trained machine learning potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17499v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The advent of machine learning in materials science opens the way for exciting and ambitious simulations of large systems and long time scales with the accuracy of ab-initio calculations. Recently, several pre-trained universal machine learned interatomic potentials (UPMLIPs) have been published, i.e., potentials distributed with a single set of weights trained to target systems across a very wide range of chemistries and atomic arrangements. These potentials raise the hope of reducing the computational cost and methodological complexity of performing simulations compared to models that require for-purpose training. However, the application of these models needs critical evaluation to assess their usability across material types and properties. In this work, we investigate the application of the following UPMLIPs: MACE, CHGNET, and M3GNET to the context of alloy theory. We calculate the mixing enthalpies and volumes of 21 binary alloy systems and compare the results with DFT calculations to assess the performance of these potentials over different properties and types of materials. We find that small relative energies necessary to correctly predict mixing energies are generally not reproduced by these methods with sufficient accuracy to describe correct mixing behaviors. However, the performance can be significantly improved by supplementing the training data with relevant training data. The potentials can also be used to partially accelerate these calculations by replacing the ab-initio structural relaxation step.</description>

      <title>Fragile 3D Order in V$_{1-x}$Mo$_x$O$_2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:1909.12704v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The metal-to-insulator transition (MIT) in rutile VO$_2$ has proven uniquely difficult to characterize because of the complex interplay between electron correlations and atomic structure. Here we report the discovery of the sudden collapse of three-dimensional order in the low-temperature phase of V$_{1-x}$Mo$_x$O$_2$ at $x=0.17$ and the emergence of a novel frustrated two-dimensional order at $x=0.19$, with only a slight change in electronic properties. Single crystal diffuse x-ray scattering reveals that this transition from the 3D M1 phase to a 2D variant of the M2 phase results in long-range structural correlations along symmetry-equivalent (11L) planes of the tetragonal rutile structure, yet extremely short-range correlations transverse to these planes. These findings suggest that this two-dimensionality results from a novel form of geometric frustration that is essentially structural in origin.</description>

Abstract: We give a complete and rigorous derivation of the mechanical energy for twisted 2D bilayer heterostructures without any approximation beyond the existence of an empirical many-body site energy. Our results apply to both the continuous and discontinuous continuum limit. Approximating the intralayer Cauchy-Born energy by linear elasticity theory and assuming an interlayer coupling via pair potentials, our model reduces to a modified Allen-Cahn functional. We rigorously control the error, and, in the case of sufficiently smooth lattice displacements, provide a rate of convergence for twist angles satisfying a Diophantine condition.</description>

Abstract: The formalism of composite and intertwined orders has been remarkably successful in discussing the complex phase diagrams of strongly correlated materials and high-$T_c$ superconductors. Here, we propose that composite orders are also realized in ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials when lattice anisotropy is taken into account. This composite order emerges above the ferroic phase transition, and its existence is determined by the easy axis of magnetization or polarization, respectively. In multiferroic materials, where polarization and magnetization are coupled, composites of both orders are possible. This formalism of composite orders naturally accounts for magnetoelectric monopole, toroidal, and quadrupole orders. More broadly, composite orders may explain precursor phenomena in incipient (multi)ferroic materials, arising at temperatures above the ferroic phase transition and potentially contributing to the characterization of currently hidden orders.</description>

      <title>Towards the superlubricity of polymer-steel interfaces with ionic liquids and carbon nanotubes</title>

Abstract: Frictional losses are responsible for significant energy waste in many practical applications, and superlubricity with a coefficient of friction lower than 0.01 is the goal of tribologists. In this paper, metal-on-polymer contact was analysed and close to superlubricity conditions for this material configuration were explored. A new lubricant has been proposed hinge on the phosphorus-based ionic liquid and carbon nanotubes as thickeners. Additionally, carbon nanotube mesh was doped with copper nanoparticles that allowed for the close to superlubricity state in a mild steel/polymer contact configuration under low normal load conditions. The adsorption of phosphorus onto metallic and polymer surfaces has been reported in EDS analysis. The formulation of the new lubricant allowed for stable dispersion with a carbon nanotube content as low as 0.1% wt. The carbon nanotubes and Cu nanoparticles have been analysed using TEM and SEM imaging. A tribological test in a block-on-ring system has been carried out. The wear of material, topography, and surface free energy have been analysed along with SEM/EDS images to explore the underlying mechanisms of friction and wear.</description>

      <title>Ab initio modeling of superconducting alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15174v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Designing new, technologically relevant superconductors has long been at the forefront of solid-state physics and chemistry research. However, developing efficient approaches for modeling the thermodynamics of superconducting alloys while accurately evaluating their physical properties has proven to be a very challenging task. To fill this gap, we propose an ab initio thermodynamic statistical method, the Extended Generalized Quasichemical Approximation (EGQCA), to describe off-stoichiometric superconductors. Within EGQCA, one can predict any computationally accessible property of the alloy, such as the critical temperature in superconductors and the electron-phonon coupling parameter, as a function of composition and crystal growth conditions by computing the cluster occurrence probabilities that minimize the overall mixing Gibbs free energy. Importantly, EGQCA incorporates directly chemical ordering, lattice distortions, and vibrational contributions. As a proof of concept, we applied EGQCA to the well-known Al-doped MgB$_2$ and to niobium alloyed with titanium and vanadium, showing a remarkable agreement with the experimental data. Additionally, we model the near-room temperature sodalite-like Y$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$H$_6$ superconducting solid solution, demonstrating that EGQCA particularly possesses a promising potential for designing in silico high-$T_{\text{c}}$ superhydride alloys. Our approach notably enables the high-throughput screening of complex superconducting solid solutions, intrinsically providing valuable insights into the interplay between synthesis, thermodynamics, and physical properties.</description>

      <title>Odd Dipole Screening in Radial Inflation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16075v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The inflation of an inner radial (or spherical) cavity in an amorphous solids confined in a disk (or a sphere), served as a fruitful case model for studying the effects of plastic deformations on the mechanical response. It was shown that when the field associated with Eshelby quadrupolar charges is non-uniform, the displacement field is riddled with dipole charges that screen elasticity, reminiscent of Debye monopoles screening in electrostatics. In this paper we look deeper into the screening phenomenon, taking into account the consequences of irreversibility that are associated with the breaking of Chiral symmetry. We consider the equations for the displacement field with the presence of "Odd Dipole Screening", solve them analytically and compare with numerical simulations. Suggestions how to test the theory in experiments are provided.</description>
