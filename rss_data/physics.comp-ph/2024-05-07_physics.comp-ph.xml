      <title>High Energy Density Radiative Transfer in the Diffusion Regime with Fourier Neural Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radiative heat transfer is a fundamental process in high energy density physics and inertial fusion. Accurately predicting the behavior of Marshak waves across a wide range of material properties and drive conditions is crucial for design and analysis of these systems. Conventional numerical solvers and analytical approximations often face challenges in terms of accuracy and computational efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel approach to model Marshak waves using Fourier Neural Operators (FNO). We develop two FNO-based models: (1) a base model that learns the mapping between the drive condition and material properties to a solution approximation based on the widely used analytic model by Hammer &amp; Rosen (2003), and (2) a model that corrects the inaccuracies of the analytic approximation by learning the mapping to a more accurate numerical solution. Our results demonstrate the strong generalization capabilities of the FNOs and show significant improvements in prediction accuracy compared to the base analytic model.</description>

      <title>Unveiling the optimization process of Physics Informed Neural Networks: How accurate and competitive can PINNs be?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the potential accuracy boundaries of physics-informed neural networks, contrasting their approach with previous similar works and traditional numerical methods. We find that selecting improved optimization algorithms significantly enhances the accuracy of the results. Simple modifications to the loss function may also improve precision, offering an additional avenue for enhancement. Despite optimization algorithms having a greater impact on convergence than adjustments to the loss function, practical considerations often favor tweaking the latter due to ease of implementation. On a global scale, the integration of an enhanced optimizer and a marginally adjusted loss function enables a reduction in the loss function by several orders of magnitude across diverse physical problems. Consequently, our results obtained using compact networks (typically comprising 2 or 3 layers of 20-30 neurons) achieve accuracies comparable to finite difference schemes employing thousands of grid points. This study encourages the continued advancement of PINNs and associated optimization techniques for broader applications across various fields.</description>

      <title>Approximating a branch of solutions to the Navier--Stokes equations by reduced-order modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03796v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper extends a low-rank tensor decomposition (LRTD) reduced order model (ROM) methodology to simulate viscous flows and in particular to predict a smooth branch of solutions for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Additionally, it enhances the LRTD-ROM methodology by introducing a non-interpolatory variant, which demonstrates improved accuracy compared to the interpolatory method utilized in previous LRTD-ROM studies. After presenting both the interpolatory and non-interpolatory LRTD-ROM, we demonstrate that with snapshots from a few different viscosities, the proposed method is able to accurately predict flow statistics in the Reynolds number range $[25,400]$. This is a significantly wider and higher range than state of the art (and similar size) ROMs built for use on varying Reynolds number have been successful on. The paper also discusses how LRTD may offer new insights into the properties of parametric solutions.</description>

      <title>Tensor Network Computations That Capture Strict Variationality, Volume Law Behavior, and the Efficient Representation of Neural Network States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03797v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce a change of perspective on tensor network states that is defined by the computational graph of the contraction of an amplitude. The resulting class of states, which we refer to as tensor network functions, inherit the conceptual advantages of tensor network states while removing computational restrictions arising from the need to converge approximate contractions. We use tensor network functions to compute strict variational estimates of the energy on loopy graphs, analyze their expressive power for ground-states, show that we can capture aspects of volume law time evolution, and provide a mapping of general feed-forward neural nets onto efficient tensor network functions. Our work expands the realm of computable tensor networks to ones where accurate contraction methods are not available, and opens up new avenues to use tensor networks.</description>

      <title>TRACE: a Time-Reversible Algorithm for Close Encounters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03800v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TRACE, a time-reversible hybrid integrator for the planetary N-body problem. Like hybrid symplectic integrators, TRACE can resolve close encounters between particles while retaining many of the accuracy and speed advantages of a fixed timestep symplectic method such the Wisdom-Holman map. TRACE switches methods time-reversibly during close encounters following the prescription of Hernandez and Dehnen (2023). In this paper we describe the derivation and implementation of TRACE and study its performance for a variety of astrophysical systems. In all our test cases TRACE is at least as accurate and fast as the hybrid symplectic integrator MERCURIUS. In many cases TRACE's performance is vastly superior to that of MERCURIUS. In test cases with planet-planet close encounters, TRACE is as accurate as MECURIUS with a 13x speedup. If close encounters with the central star are considered, TRACE achieves good error performance while MERCURIUS fails to give qualitatively correct results. In ensemble tests of violent scattering systems, TRACE matches the high-accuracy IAS15 while providing a 20x speed-up. In large N systems simulating lunar accretion, TRACE qualitatively gives the same results as IAS15 but at a 47x speedup. We also discuss some cases such as von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai cycles where hybrid integrators perform poorly and provide some guidance on which integrator to use for which system. TRACE is freely available within the REBOUND package.</description>

      <title>AniMAIRE -- A New Openly Available Tool for Calculating Atmospheric Ionising Radiation Dose Rates and Single Event Effects During Anisotropic Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Occasionally an eruption occurs on the surface of the Sun, ejecting high energy particles into the solar system in what are known as solar particle events. If this eruption of particles happens to hit Earth and have a sufficiently high kinetic energy, the particles can penetrate Earth's magnetosphere and atmosphere, creating particle radiation showers that increase radiation dose rates in Earth's atmosphere. These situations are known as Ground-Level Enhancements (GLEs), which typically occur once every few years. GLEs can cause aircraft electronics issues and cause passengers and crew to experience heightened radiation doses. In this paper, we describe a new, openly available model we've created to calculate dose rates in the atmosphere during GLEs, called AniMAIRE. Most models that currently exist can only calculate radiation dose rates when all particles are hitting Earth equally from all directions, however this approximation is generally only reliable during the later stages of events, and isn't accurate for many GLEs. AniMAIRE has been designed so it doesn't require this approximation, and can calculate dose rates for situations where it's supplied a direction-dependent particle flux. We also analyse the dose rate maps AniMAIRE produces when running across the GLE from 2012, finding several interesting results.</description>

      <title>Optical Photon Emission in Extended Airshowers -- Hybrid computing in the context of CORSIKA 8</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04229v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the motivation to improve experimental gains and precision, established astroparticle experiments are currently undergoing massive upgrades. In addition, several new experiments are being built or planned. With the resulting gain in observational quality, the amount and accuracy of simulated data required for the analysis is also rising. In order to meet the increasing requirements and complexity due to the experiments' growth and to provide a unified software ecosystem, it was decided to re-develop the de facto standard extensive air shower simulation CORSIKA completely in C++ based on the original Fortran code. Since one of the largest runtime consumers is the propagation of millions of optical Cherenkov and fluorescence photons, and many experiments are starting to use them for measurements, it was decided to develop hardware-accelerated code to speed up the simulation. Specific methods have been developed to propagate photons on deep learning acceleration hardware similar to classical GPUs to take additional advantage of the current and future growth of the deep learning sector. In particular, Nvidia accelerators were tested.</description>

      <title>A fully differentiable GNN-based PDE Solver: With Applications to Poisson and Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04466</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04466v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we present a novel computational framework that integrates the finite volume method with graph neural networks to address the challenges in Physics-Informed Neural Networks(PINNs). Our approach leverages the flexibility of graph neural networks to adapt to various types of two-dimensional unstructured grids, enhancing the model's applicability across different physical equations and boundary conditions. The core innovation lies in the development of an unsupervised training algorithm that utilizes GPU parallel computing to implement a fully differentiable finite volume method discretization process. This method includes differentiable integral and gradient reconstruction algorithms, enabling the model to directly solve partial-differential equations(PDEs) during training without the need for pre-computed data. Our results demonstrate the model's superior mesh generalization and its capability to handle multiple boundary conditions simultaneously, significantly boosting its generalization capabilities. The proposed method not only shows potential for extensive applications in CFD but also establishes a new paradigm for integrating traditional numerical methods with deep learning technologies, offering a robust platform for solving complex physical problems.</description>

      <title>OptPDE: Discovering Novel Integrable Systems via AI-Human Collaboration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04484v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Integrable partial differential equation (PDE) systems are of great interest in natural science, but are exceedingly rare and difficult to discover. To solve this, we introduce OptPDE, a first-of-its-kind machine learning approach that Optimizes PDEs' coefficients to maximize their number of conserved quantities, $n_{\rm CQ}$, and thus discover new integrable systems. We discover four families of integrable PDEs, one of which was previously known, and three of which have at least one conserved quantity but are new to the literature to the best of our knowledge. We investigate more deeply the properties of one of these novel PDE families, $u_t = (u_x+a^2u_{xxx})^3$. Our paper offers a promising schema of AI-human collaboration for integrable system discovery: machine learning generates interpretable hypotheses for possible integrable systems, which human scientists can verify and analyze, to truly close the discovery loop.</description>

      <title>Material Property Prediction using Graphs based on Generically Complete Isometry Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.11246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.11246v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The structure-property hypothesis says that the properties of all materials are determined by an underlying crystal structure. The main obstacle was the ambiguity of conventional crystal representations based on incomplete or discontinuous descriptors that allow false negatives or false positives. This ambiguity was resolved by the ultra-fast Pointwise Distance Distribution (PDD), which distinguished all periodic structures in the world's largest collection of real materials (Cambridge Structural Database). The state-of-the-art results in property predictions were previously achieved by graph neural networks based on various graph representations of periodic crystals, including the Crystal Graph with vertices at all atoms in a crystal unit cell. This work adapts the Pointwise Distance Distribution for a simpler graph whose vertex set is not larger than the asymmetric unit of a crystal structure. The new Distribution Graph reduces mean-absolute-error by 0.6\%-12\% while having 44\%-88\% of the number of vertices when compared to the crystal graph when applied on the Materials Project and Jarvis-DFT datasets using CGCNN and ALIGNN. Methods for hyper-parameters selection for the graph are backed by the theoretical results of the Pointwise Distance Distribution and are then experimentally justified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10270v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Modern security proofs of quantum key distribution (QKD) must take finite-size effects and composable aspects into consideration. This is also the case for continuous-variable (CV) protocols which are based on the transmission and detection of bosonic coherent states. In this paper, we refine and advance the previous theory in this area providing a more rigorous formulation for the composable key rate of a generic CV-QKD protocol. Thanks to these theoretical refinements, our general formulas allow us to prove more optimistic key rates with respect to previous literature.</description>

      <title>Machine-Learning-Based Interatomic Potentials for Group IIB to VIA Semiconductors: Towards a Universal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11305v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rapid advancements in machine-learning methods have led to the emergence of machine-learning-based interatomic potentials as a new cutting-edge tool for simulating large systems with ab initio accuracy. Still, the community awaits universal inter-atomic models that can be applied to a wide range of materials without tuning neural network parameters. We develop a unified deep-learning inter-atomic potential (the DPA-Semi model) for 19 semiconductors ranging from group IIB to VIA, including Si, Ge, SiC, BAs, BN, AlN, AlP, AlAs, InP, InAs, InSb, GaN, GaP, GaAs, CdTe, InTe, CdSe, ZnS, and CdS. In addition, independent deep potential models for each semiconductor are prepared for detailed comparison. The training data are obtained by performing density functional theory calculations with numerical atomic orbitals basis sets to reduce the computational costs. We systematically compare various properties of the solid and liquid phases of semiconductors between different machine-learning models. We conclude that the DPA-Semi model achieves GGA exchange-correlation functional quality accuracy and can be regarded as a pre-trained model towards a universal model to study group IIB to VIA semiconductors.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Material Property Prediction using Generically Complete Isometry Invariants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.15089v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Periodic material or crystal property prediction using machine learning has grown popular in recent years as it provides a computationally efficient replacement for classical simulation methods. A crucial first step for any of these algorithms is the representation used for a periodic crystal. While similar objects like molecules and proteins have a finite number of atoms and their representation can be built based upon a finite point cloud interpretation, periodic crystals are unbounded in size, making their representation more challenging. In the present work, we adapt the Pointwise Distance Distribution (PDD), a continuous and generically complete isometry invariant for periodic point sets, as a representation for our learning algorithm. The PDD distinguished all (more than 660 thousand) periodic crystals in the Cambridge Structural Database as purely periodic sets of points without atomic types. We develop a transformer model with a modified self-attention mechanism that combines PDD with compositional information via a spatial encoding method. This model is tested on the crystals of the Materials Project and Jarvis-DFT databases and shown to produce accuracy on par with state-of-the-art methods while being several times faster in both training and prediction time.</description>
