      <title>Superconducting Diode Effect in Multiphase Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify a new mechanism for the intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE) in multiphase superconductors. Using a Ginzburg-Landau and a microscopic two-band model, we find phase transitions into a mixed phase with finite-momentum Cooper pairs and SDE with high (including maximal) diode efficiencies, despite the individual phases exhibiting no SDE and equal inversion parity. We thus show that parity mixing $-$ invoked in previous proposals $-$ is not a crucial ingredient for SDE. The new mechanism may be relevant in a multitude of known multiphase superconductors like UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Extremely weak sub-kelvin electron-phonon coupling in InAs On Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15040</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We are proposing a hybrid superconductor-semiconductor platform using indium arsenide (InAs) grown on an insulating layer of indium aluminum arsenide (InAlAs) heterostructure (InAsOI) as an ideal candidate for coherent caloritronic devices. These devices aim to heat or cool electrons out of equilibrium with respect to the phonon degree of freedom. However, their performances are usually limited by the strength of the electron-phonon (e-ph) coupling and the associated power loss. Our work discusses the advantages of the InAsOI platform, which are based on the significantly low e-ph coupling measured compared to all-metallic state-of-the-art caloritronic devices. Our structure demonstrates values of the e-ph coupling constant up to two orders of magnitude smaller than typical values in metallic structures.</description>

      <title>Ab initio modeling of superconducting alloys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15174v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing new, technologically relevant superconductors has long been at the forefront of solid-state physics and chemistry research. However, developing efficient approaches for modeling the thermodynamics of superconducting alloys while accurately evaluating their physical properties has proven to be a very challenging task. To fill this gap, we propose an ab initio thermodynamic statistical method, the Extended Generalized Quasichemical Approximation (EGQCA), to describe off-stoichiometric superconductors. Within EGQCA, one can predict any computationally accessible property of the alloy, such as the critical temperature in superconductors and the electron-phonon coupling parameter, as a function of composition and crystal growth conditions by computing the cluster occurrence probabilities that minimize the overall mixing Gibbs free energy. Importantly, EGQCA incorporates directly chemical ordering, lattice distortions, and vibrational contributions. As a proof of concept, we applied EGQCA to the well-known Al-doped MgB$_2$ and to niobium alloyed with titanium and vanadium, showing a remarkable agreement with the experimental data. Additionally, we model the near-room temperature sodalite-like Y$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$H$_6$ superconducting solid solution, demonstrating that EGQCA particularly possesses a promising potential for designing in silico high-$T_{\text{c}}$ superhydride alloys. Our approach notably enables the high-throughput screening of complex superconducting solid solutions, intrinsically providing valuable insights into the interplay between synthesis, thermodynamics, and physical properties.</description>

      <title>Sublattice Dichotomy in Monolayer FeSe Superconductor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15239v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pairing mechanism behind the monolayer FeSe is one essential question for iron-based superconductors. In this work, we show the sublattice degree of freedoms of monolayer FeSe plays a special role in its pairing properties, namely the sublattice dichotomy. The high-quality monolayer FeSe samples with atomic flat $1\times1$ topography on the SrTiO$_3$(001) substrates are grown by molecular beam epitaxy. By comparing the tunneling spectra at $\alpha$ and $\beta$ Fe sublattices, we find the coherence peak of $\alpha$-Fe at the inner gap $+V_i$ is higher than $\beta$-Fe while the coherence peak of $\beta$-Fe at $-V_i$ is higher than $\alpha$-Fe with a similar amount. We also observed a reversed effect at the outer gap $\pm V_o$. We propose the $\eta$-pairing mechanism between $k$ and $-k+Q$ is the key mechanism for this unconventional sublattice dichotomy effect.</description>

      <title>Impact of Charge Density Waves on Superconductivity and Topological Properties in AV$_3$Sb$_5$ Kagome Superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigates the electronic structure and superconducting gaps in the charge density wave (CDW) states of vanadium-based Kagome superconductors AV$_3$Sb$_5$, focusing on the concurrent presence of CDW and superconducting orders. Two predominant CDW configurations are explored: the trihexagonal (TrH) and star-of-David (SoD) patterns, involving charge bond order (CBO) and chiral flux phase (CFP), corresponding to real and imaginary bond orders. In the isotropic $s$-wave superconducting state, the presence of CBO alone maintains an isotropic superconducting gap, whereas the introduction of CFP induces anisotropy in the gap, manifesting time-reversal symmetry breaking due to the CFP. Our analysis extends to the topological properties of these states, revealing a marked topological phase transition in the TrH configuration from a trivial to a non-trivial state with increasing CFP intensity. This transition suggests that the introduction of CFP could catalyze the emergence of topological superconductivity, potentially leading to the presence of Majorana excitations. The results contribute significantly to understanding the complex interplay between various CDW patterns and superconductivity in Kagome superconductors. They provide a theoretical framework for the diverse experimental observations of energy gaps and open new avenues for research into topological superconductivity and its potential applications. This study underscores the necessity for further experimental and theoretical exploration to unveil novel interwinded quantum states and functionalities in these intriguing materials.</description>

      <title>Nature of Andreev bound states in Josephson junctions of triple-point semimetals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15350v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study superconductor-barrier-superconductor (S-B-S) Josephson junctions constructed out of two-dimensional and three-dimensional triple-point semimetals, which feature a threefold degeneracy at a single nodal point. We assume a weak and homogeneous s-wave pairing in each superconducting region, and a potential difference is applied across a piece of normal-state semimetal to create the barrier region. We apply the BdG formalism to compute the wavefunctions of the subgap Andreev bound states (ABSs), considering the thin-barrier limit, in a piecewise-continuous manner. The appropriate boundary conditions at the S-B and B-S junctions allow us to compute the discrete energy eigenvalues $\pm |\varepsilon| $ of the ABSs. We get two distinct solutions for $|\varepsilon| $. This result is different from the S-B-S set-ups in graphene and Weyl semimetals (each featuring twofold-degenerate nodal points), where one obtains only one solution for $|\varepsilon| $. Although the three bands of the triple-point fermions comprise a nondispersive flat band, the multifold nature of the bandstructure is responsible for this difference. We also illustrate the behaviour of the Josephson current flowing across the S-B-S junction, contributed by the two pairs of ABSs.</description>

      <title>Identifying impurities in a silicon substrate by using a superconducting flux qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.14948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A bismuth-doped silicon substrate was analyzed by using a magnetometer based on a superconducting flux qubit. The temperature dependence of the magnetization indicates that the silicon substrate contains at least two signal sources, intentionally doped bismuth spins and a spin 1/2 system with a ratio of 0.873 to 0.127. In combination with a conventional electron spin resonance spectrometer, a candidate origin of the spin 1/2 system was identified as a dangling bond on the silicon surface. In addition, the spin sensitivity of the magnetometer was also estimated to be 12 spins/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ by using optimized dispersive readout.</description>

      <title>Decoupled static and dynamical charge correlations in La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relation between charge order, its quantum fluctuations and optical phonon modes in cuprate superconductors remains an unsolved problem. The exploration of these excitations is however complicated by the presence of twinned domains. Here, we use uniaxial strain in combination with ultra-high-resolution Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) at the oxygen K- and copper L3-edges to study the excitations stemming from the charge ordering wave vector in La1.875Sr0.125CuO4. By detwinning stripe ordering, we demonstrate that the optical phonon anomalies do not show any stripe anisotropy. The low-energy charge excitations also retain an in-plane four-fold symmetry. As such, we find that both phonon and charge excitations are decoupled entirely from the strength of static charge ordering. The almost isotropic character of charge excitations remains a possible source for the strange metal properties found in the normal state of cuprate superconductors.</description>

      <title>Revealing novel aspects of light-matter coupling in terahertz two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy: the case of the amplitude mode in superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16449v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently developed terahertz (THz) two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) is a powerful technique to obtain materials information in a fashion qualitatively different from other spectroscopies. Here, we utilized THz 2DCS to investigate the THz nonlinear response of conventional superconductor NbN. Using broad-band THz pulses as light sources, we observed a third-order nonlinear signal whose spectral components are peaked at twice the superconducting gap energy $2\Delta$. With narrow-band THz pulses, a THz nonlinear signal was identified at the driving frequency $\Omega$ and exhibited a resonant enhancement at temperature when $\Omega = 2\Delta$. General theoretical considerations show that such a resonance can only arise from a disorder-activated paramagnetic coupling between the light and the electronic current. This proves that the nonlinear THz response can access processes distinct from the diamagnetic Raman-like density fluctuations, which are believed to dominate the nonlinear response at optical frequencies in metals. Our numerical simulations reveal that even for a small amount of disorder, the $\Omega=2\Delta$ resonance is dominated by the superconducting amplitude mode over the entire investigated disorder range. This is in contrast to other resonances, whose amplitude-mode contribution depends on disorder. Our findings demonstrate the unique ability of THz 2DCS to explore collective excitations inaccessible in other spectroscopies.</description>

      <title>Emergence of spatial patterns and synchronization in superconducting time crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14216v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We identify a time crystal phase characterized by a frequency half of the driving frequency in disordered superconductors by employing the time dependent Bogoliubov-de Gennes formalism at zero temperature with a periodically driven coupling constant. After a period of exponential increase of spatial inhomogeneities and exponential suppression of the order parameter amplitude, the time crystal develops islands of different sizes. Each of these islands is a time crystal with the same frequency albeit with a phase shift $\pi$ with respect to the homogeneous time crystal. After its emergence, the island gradually becomes smaller, though the phase shift persists, until it is abruptly synchronized at a time that it depends on its initial size. We find a critical disorder strength, still deep in the metallic phase, at which the time crystal phase terminates. For even stronger disorder, the order parameter oscillates with the driving frequency in regions where localization effects are not important.</description>

      <title>Magnetoresistance hysteresis in the superconduting state of Kagome CsV$_3$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.13164</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.13164v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The hysteresis of magnetoresistance observed in superconductors is of great interest due to its potential connection with unconventional superconductivity. In this study, we perform electrical transport measurements on Kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ nanoflakes and uncover unusual hysteretic behaviour of magnetoresistance in the superconducting state. This hysteresis can be induced by applying either a large DC or AC current at temperatures ($T$) well below the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$). As $T$ approaches $T_{\rm c}$, similar weak hysteresis is also detected by applying a small current. Various scenarios are discussed, with particular focus on the effects of vortex pinning and the presence of time-reversal-symmtery-breaking superconducting domains. Our findings support the latter, hinting at chiral superconductivity in Kagome superconductors.</description>
