      <title>Landscapes of integrable long-range spin chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We clarify how the elliptic integrable spin chain recently found by Matushko and Zotov (MZ) relates to various other known long-range spin chains.
  We evaluate various limits. More precisely, we tweak the MZ chain to allow for a short-range limit, and show it is the XX model with q-deformed antiperiodic boundary conditions. Taking $q\to 1$ gives the elliptic spin chain of Sechin and Zotov (SZ), whose trigonometric case is due to Fukui and Kawakami. It, too, can be adjusted to admit a short-range limit, which we demonstrate to be the antiperiodic XX model. By identifying the translation operator of the MZ chain, which is nontrivial, we show that antiperiodicity is a persistent feature.
  We compare the resulting (vertex-type) landscape of the MZ chain with the (face-type) landscape containing the Heisenberg XXX and Haldane--Shastry chains. We find that the landscapes only share a single point: the rational Haldane--Shastry chain. Using wrapping we show that the SZ chain is the antiperiodic version of the Inozemtsev chain in a precise sense, and expand both chains around their nearest-neighbour limits to facilitate their interpretations as long-range deformations.</description>

      <title>Tetrahedron equation and Schur functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tetrahedron equation introduced by Zamolodchikov is a three-dimensional generalization of the Yang-Baxter equation. Several types of solutions to the tetrahedron equation that have connections to quantum groups can be viewed as $q$-oscillator valued vertex models with matrix elements of the $L$-operators given by generators of the $q$-oscillator algebra acting on the Fock space. Using one of the $q=0$-oscillator valued vertex models introduced by Bazhanov-Sergeev, we introduce a family of partition functions that admits an explicit algebraic presentation using Schur functions. Our construction is based on the three-dimensional realization of the Zamolodchikov-Faddeev algebra provided by Kuniba-Okado-Maruyama. Furthermore, we investigate an inhomogeneous generalization of the three-dimensional lattice model. We show that the inhomogeneous analog of (a certain subclass of) partition functions can be expressed as loop elementary symmetric functions.</description>

      <title>A systematic path to non-Markovian dynamics II: Probabilistic response of nonlinear multidimensional systems to Gaussian colored noise excitation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10236v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The probabilistic characterization of non-Markovian responses to nonlinear dynamical systems under colored excitation is an important issue, arising in many applications. Extending the Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation, governing the first-order response probability density function (pdf), to this case is a complicated task calling for special treatment. In this work, a new pdf-evolution equation is derived for the response of nonlinear dynamical systems under additive colored Gaussian noise. The derivation is based on the Stochastic Liouville equation (SLE), transformed, by means of an extended version of the Novikov-Furutsu theorem, to an exact yet non-closed equation, involving averages over the history of the functional derivatives of the non-Markovian response with respect to the excitation. The latter are calculated exactly by means of the state-transition matrix of variational, time-varying systems. Subsequently, an approximation scheme is implemented, relying on a decomposition of the state-transition matrix in its instantaneous mean value and its fluctuation around it. By a current-time approximation to the latter, we obtain our final equation, in which the effect of the instantaneous mean value of the response is maintained, rendering it nonlinear and non-local in time. Numerical results for the response pdf are provided for a bistable Duffing oscillator, under Gaussian excitation. The pdfs obtained from the solution of the novel equation and a simpler small correlation time (SCT) pdf-evolution equation are compared to Monde Carlo (MC) simulations. The novel equation outperforms the SCT equation as the excitation correlation time increases, keeping good agreement with the MC simulations.</description>

      <title>Fermionic quantum criticality through the lens of topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We utilize the topological holographic framework to characterize and gain insights into the nature of quantum critical points and gapless phases in fermionic quantum systems. Topological holography is a general framework that describes the generalized global symmetry and the symmetry charges of a local quantum system in terms of a slab of a topological order, termed as the symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), in one higher dimension. In this work, we consider a generalization of the topological holographic picture for $(1+1)d$ fermionic quantum phases of matter. We discuss how spin structures are encoded in the SymTFT and establish the connection between the formal fermionization formula in quantum field theory and the choice of fermionic gapped boundary conditions of the SymTFT. We demonstrate the identification and the characterization of the fermionic gapped phases and phase transitions through detailed analysis of various examples, including the fermionic systems with $\mathbb{Z}_{2}^{F}$, $\mathbb{Z}_{2} \times \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{F}$, $\mathbb{Z}_{4}^{F}$, and the fermionic version of the non-invertible $\text{Rep}(S_{3})$ symmetry. Our work uncovers many exotic fermionic quantum critical points and gapless phases, including two kinds of fermionic symmetry enriched quantum critical points, a fermionic gapless symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, and a fermionic gapless spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) phase that breaks the fermionic non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Computable entanglement cost</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum information theory is plagued by the problem of regularisations, which require the evaluation of formidable asymptotic quantities. This makes it computationally intractable to gain a precise quantitative understanding of the ultimate efficiency of key operational tasks such as entanglement manipulation. Here we consider the problem of computing the asymptotic entanglement cost of preparing noisy quantum states under quantum operations with positive partial transpose (PPT). A previously claimed solution to this problem is shown to be incorrect. We construct instead an alternative solution in the form of two hierarchies of semi-definite programs that converge to the true asymptotic value of the entanglement cost from above and from below. Our main result establishes that this convergence happens exponentially fast, thus yielding an efficient algorithm that approximates the cost up to an additive error $\varepsilon$ in time $\mathrm{poly}\big(D,\,\log(1/\varepsilon)\big)$, where $D$ is the underlying Hilbert space dimension. To our knowledge, this is the first time that an asymptotic entanglement measure is shown to be efficiently computable despite no closed-form formula being available.</description>

      <title>Holevo Cram\'er-Rao bound: How close can we get without entangling measurements?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In multi-parameter quantum metrology, the resource of entanglement can lead to an increase in efficiency of the estimation process. Entanglement can be used in the state preparation stage, or the measurement stage, or both, to harness this advantage; here we focus on the role of entangling measurements. Specifically, entangling or collective measurements over multiple identical copies of a probe state are known to be superior to measuring each probe individually, but the extent of this improvement is an open problem. It is also known that such entangling measurements, though resource-intensive, are required to attain the ultimate limits in multi-parameter quantum metrology and quantum information processing tasks. In this work we investigate the maximum precision improvement that collective quantum measurements can offer over individual measurements for estimating parameters of qudit states, calling this the 'collective quantum enhancement'. We show that, whereas the maximum enhancement can, in principle, be a factor of $n$ for estimating $n$ parameters, this bound is not tight for large $n$. Instead, our results prove an enhancement linear in dimension of the qudit is possible using collective measurements and lead us to conjecture that this is the maximum collective quantum enhancement in any local estimation scenario.</description>

      <title>Entanglement dynamics of two modes coupled through a dissipative movable mirror in an optomechanical system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09641v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nonclassical states are an important class of states in quantum mechanics, especially for their applications in quantum information theory. Optomechanical systems serve as an invaluable platform for exploring and harnessing these states test bed for search and application of such states. In this study, we focused on the studied the mirror-in-the-middle optomechanical system. We observed that in the absence of losses, a coherent state evolves into a entangled one. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generation of a Schr\"odinger-cat state depends on the optomechanical coupling. We exactly solved the Gorini-Kossalokowinki-Sudarshan-Lindblad master equation, highlighting the direct influence of the reservoir on the dynamics when mechanical losses are considered. We later discussed vacuum one-photon superposition states to obtain exact entanglement dynamics using concurrence as a quantifier. Our results show that the overall entanglement of the system is attenuated by mechanical losses in the mirror.</description>

      <title>Scaling Symmetry Reductions of Coupled KdV Systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we discuss the Painlev\'e reductions of coupled KdV systems. We start by comparing the procedure with that of {\em stationary reductions}. Indeed, we see that exactly the same construction can be used at each step and parallel results obtained. For simplicity, we restrict attention to the $t_2$ flow of the KdV and DWW hierarchies and derive respectively 2 and 3 compatible Poisson brackets, which have identical {\em structure} to those of their stationary counterparts. In the KdV case, we derive a discrete version, which is a non-autonomous generalisation of the well known Darboux transformation of the stationary case.</description>

      <title>Hidden zero modes and topology of multiband non-Hermitian systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09728</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09728v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In a finite non-Hermitian system, the number of zero modes does not necessarily reflect the topology of the system. This is known as the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence and has lead to misconceptions about the topological protection of edge modes in such systems. Here we show why this breakdown does occur and that it typically results in hidden zero modes, extremely long-lived zero energy excitations, which are only revealed when considering the singular value instead of the eigenvalue spectrum. We point out, furthermore, that in a finite multiband non-Hermitian system with Hamiltonian $H$, one needs to consider also the reflected Hamiltonian $\tilde H$, which is in general distinct from the adjoint $H^\dagger$, to properly relate the number of protected zeroes to the winding number of $H$.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of a higher-dimension Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet cosmology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of the field equations in a five-dimensional spatially flat Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker metric in the context of a Gauss-Bonnet-Scalar field theory where the quintessence scalar field is coupled to the Gauss-Bonnet scalar. Contrary to the four-dimensional Gauss-Bonnet theory, where the Gauss-Bonnet term does not contribute to the field equations, in this five-dimensional Einstein-Scalar-Gauss-Bonnet model, the Gauss-Bonnet term contributes to the field equations even when the coupling function is a constant. Additionally, we consider a more general coupling described by a power-law function. For the scalar field potential, we consider the exponential function. For each choice of the coupling function, we define a set of dimensionless variables and write the field equations into a system of ordinary differential equations. We perform a detailed analysis of the dynamics for both systems and classify the stability of the equilibrium points. We determine the presence of scaling and super-collapsing solutions using the cosmological deceleration parameter. This means that our models can explain the Universe's early and late-time acceleration phases. Consequently, this model can be used to study inflation or as a dark energy candidate.</description>

      <title>Receptivity of a supersonic jet due to acoustic excitations near the nozzle lip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09761v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop an analytical model to investigate the generation of instability waves triggered by the upstream acoustic forcing near the nozzle lip of a supersonic jet. This represents an important stage, i.e. the jet receptivity, of the screech feedback loop. The upstream acoustic forcing, resulting from the shock-instability interaction, reaches the nozzle lip and excites new shear-layer instability waves. To obtain the newly-excited instability wave, we first determine the scattered sound field due to the upstream forcing using the Wiener-Hopf technique, with the kernel function factored using asymptotic expansions and overlapping approximations. Subsequently, the unsteady Kutta condition is imposed at the nozzle lip, enabling the derivation of the dispersion relation for the newly-excited instability wave. A linear transfer function between the upstream forcing and the newly-excited instability wave is obtained. We calculate the amplitude and phase delay in this receptivity process and examine their variations against the frequency. The phase delay enables us to re-evaluate the phase condition for jet screech and propose a new frequency prediction model. The new model shows improved agreement between the predicted screech frequencies and the experimental data compared to classical models. It is hoped that this model may help in developing a full screech model.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, Lie symmetry analysis method is applied to the (2+1)-dimensional time fractional Kadomtsev-Petviashvili (KP) equation with the mixed derivative of Riemann-Liouville time-fractional derivative and integer-order $x$-derivative. We obtained all the Lie symmetries admitted by the KP equation and used them to reduce the (2+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equation with Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative to some (1+1)-dimensional fractional partial differential equations with Erd\'{e}lyi-Kober fractional derivative or Riemann-Liouville fractional derivative, thereby getting some exact solutions of the reduced equations. In addition, the new conservation theorem and the generalization of Noether operators are developed to construct the conservation laws for the equation studied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.09949v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We address the homogenization of the two-dimensional Dirac operator with position-dependent mass. The mass is piecewise constant and supported on small pairwise disjoint inclusions evenly distributed along an $\varepsilon$-periodic square lattice. Under rather general assumptions on geometry of these inclusions we prove that the corresponding family of Dirac operators converges as $\varepsilon\to 0$ in the norm resolvent sense to the Dirac operator with a constant effective mass provided the masses in the inclusions are adjusted to the scaling of the geometry. We also estimate the speed of this convergence in terms of the scaling rates.</description>

Abstract: We explore statistical properties of BPS q-series for 3d N=2 strongly coupled supersymmetric theories that correspond to a particular family of 3-manifolds Y. We discover that gaps between exponents in the q-series are statistically more significant at the beginning of the q-series compared to gaps that appear in higher powers of q. Our observations are obtained by calculating saliencies of q-series features used as input data for principal component analysis, which is a standard example of an explainable machine learning technique that allows for a direct calculation and a better analysis of feature saliencies.</description>

Abstract: We consider Dirac operators on the half-line, subject to generalised infinite-mass boundary conditions. We derive sufficient conditions which guarantee the stability of the spectrum against possibly non-self-adjoint potential perturbations and study the optimality of the obtained results. Finally, we establish a non-relativistic limit which makes a relationship of the present model to the Robin Laplacian on the half-line.</description>

      <title>On the coupled Maxwell-Bloch system of equations with non-decaying fields at infinity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10117v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study an initial-boundary-value problem (IBVP) for a system of coupled Maxwell-Bloch equations (CMBE) that model two colors or polarizations of light resonantly interacting with a degenerate, two-level, active optical medium with an excited state and a pair of degenerate ground states. We assume that the electromagnetic field approaches non-vanishing plane waves in the far past and future. This type of interaction has been found to underlie nonlinear optical phenomena including electromagnetically induced transparency, slow light, stopped light, and quantum memory. Under the assumptions of unidirectional, lossless propagation of slowly-modulated plane waves, the resulting CMBE become completely integrable in the sense of possessing a Lax Pair. In this paper, we formulate an inverse scattering transform (IST) corresponding to these CMBE and their Lax pair, allowing for the spectral line of the atomic transitions in the active medium to have a finite width. The scattering problem for this Lax pair is the same as for the Manakov system. The main advancement in this IST for CMBE is calculating the nontrivial spatial propagation of the spectral data and determining the state of the optical medium in the distant future from that in the distant past, which is needed for the complete formulation of the IBVP. The Riemann-Hilbert problem is used to extract the spatio-temporal dependence of the solution from the evolving spectral data. We further derive and analyze several types of solitons and determine their velocity and stability, as well as find dark states of the medium which fail to interact with a given pulse.</description>

      <title>Scattering problem for Vlasov-type equations on the $d$-dimensional torus with Gevrey data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.10182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.10182v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we consider Vlasov-type equations describing the evolution of single-species type plasmas, such as those composed of electrons (Vlasov-Poisson) or ions (screened Vlasov-Poisson/Vlasov-Poisson with massless electrons). We solve the final data problem on the torus $\mathbb{T}^d$, $d \geq 1$, by considering asymptotic states of regularity Gevrey-$\frac{1}{\gamma}$ with $\gamma&gt;\frac13$, small perturbations of homogeneous equilibria satisfying the Penrose stability condition. This extends to the Gevrey perturbative case, and to higher dimension, the scattering result in analytic regularity obtained by E. Caglioti and C. Maffei in [14], and answers an open question raised by J. Bedrossian in arXiv:2211.13707.</description>

      <title>On fusing matrices associated with conformal boundary conditions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10189v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of rational conformal field theories (RCFT) we look at the fusing matrices that arise when a topological defect is attached to a conformal boundary condition. We call such junctions open topological defects. One type of fusing matrices arises when two open defects fuse while another arises when an open defect passes through a boundary operator. We use the topological field theory approach to RCFTs based on Frobenius algebra objects in modular tensor categories to describe the general structure associated with such matrices and how to compute them from a given Frobenius algebra object and its representation theory. We illustrate the computational process on the rational free boson theories. Applications to boundary renormalisation group flows are briefly discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider quantum systems with energy constraints. In general, quantum channels and continuous-time dynamics need not satisfy energy conservation. Physically meaningful channels, however, can only introduce a finite amount of energy to the system, and continuous-time dynamics may only increase the energy gradually over time. We systematically study such "energy-limited" channels and dynamics. For Markovian dynamics, energy-limitedness is equivalent to a single operator inequality in the Heisenberg picture. By tracking the output energy, we observe that the energy-constrained operator and diamond norms of Shirokov and Winter satisfy submultiplicativity estimates with respect to energy-limited channels. This makes for a powerful toolkit for quantitative analyses of dynamical problems in finite and infinite-dimensional systems. As an application, we derive state-dependent bounds for quantum speed limits and related problems that outperform the usual operator/diamond norm estimates, which have to account for fluctuations in high-energy states.</description>

Abstract: We construct the vector field associated with the GKLS generator for systems described by Gaussian states. This vector field is defined on the dual space of the algebra of operators, restricted to operators quadratic in position and momentum. It is shown that the GKLS dynamics accepts a decomposition principle, that is, this vector field can be decomposed in three parts, a conservative Hamiltonian component, a gradient-like and a Choi-Krauss vector field. The last two terms are considered a "perturbation" associated with dissipation. Examples are presented for a harmonic oscillator with different dissipation terms.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1910.12355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We deal in this work with a class of graphs, namely, the class of distance-regular graphs, in which on the basis of $k$-adjacency operators, the adjacency operator $A$ of a distance-regular graph is identified as a Jacobi matrix. To get so, the set of the $k$-adjacency operators is recognized as a canonical basis in a certain Hilbert space, where the spectrum of the Jacobi matrix coincides with the support of the measure of $A$. The obtained identification permits a deeper spectral analysis of the graph. The finite-dimensional case is addressed by means of the extension theory of nondensely defined, symmetric linear operators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.00948v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Choquard equation is a partial differential equation that has gained significant interest and attention in recent decades. It is a nonlinear equation that combines elements of both the Laplace and Schr\"odinger operators, and it arises frequently in the study of numerous physical phenomena, from condensed matter physics to nonlinear optics.
  In particular, the steady states of the Choquard equation were thoroughly investigated using a variational functional acting on the wave functions.
  In this article, we introduce a dual formulation for the variational functional in terms of the potential indiced by the wave function, and use it to explore the existence of steady states of a multi-state version the Choquard equation in critical and sub-critical cases.</description>

      <title>Edge states in super honeycomb structures with PT_]-symmetric deformations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15702v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The existence of edge states is one of the most vital properties of topological insulators. Although tremendous success has been accomplished in describing and explaining edge states associated with PT symmetry breaking, little work has been done on PT symmetry preserving cases. Two-dimensional Schroedinger operators with super honeycomb lattice potentials always have double Dirac cones at the Gamma point - the zero momentum point on their energy bands due to C6 symmetry, PT symmetry, and the "folding" symmetry - caused by an additional translation symmetry. There are two topologically different ways to deform such a system by PT symmetry preserving but folding symmetry breaking perturbations. Interestingly, there exist two gapped edge states on the interface between such two kinds of perturbed materials. In this paper, we illustrate the existence of such PT preserving edge states rigorously for the first time. We use a domain wall modulated Schroedinger operator to model the phenomenon under small perturbations and rigorously prove the existence of two gapped edge states. We also provide a brief interpretation from the point of view of "topology" by the parities of degenerate bulk modes. Our work thoroughly explains the existence of "helical" like edge states in super honeycomb configurations and lays a foundation for the descriptions of topologies of such systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.03523v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the resource marginal problems, which concern the possibility of having a resource-free target subsystem compatible with a given collection of marginal density matrices. By identifying an appropriate choice of resource R and target subsystem T, our problems reduce, respectively, to the well-known marginal problems for quantum states and the problem of determining if a given quantum system is a resource. More generally, we say that a set of marginal states is resource-free incompatible with a target subsystem T if all global states compatible with this set must result in a resourceful state in T of type R. We show that this incompatibility induces a resource theory that can be quantified by a monotone and obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for this monotone to be computable as a conic program with finite optimum. We further show, via the corresponding witnesses, that (1) resource-free incompatibility is equivalent to an operational advantage in some channel-discrimination tasks, and (2) some specific cases of such tasks fully characterize the convertibility between marginal density matrices exhibiting resource-free incompatibility. Through our framework, one sees a clear connection between any marginal problem -- which implicitly involves some notion of incompatibility -- for quantum states and a resource theory for quantum states. We also establish a close connection between the physical relevance of resource marginal problems and the ground state properties of certain many-body Hamiltonians. In terms of application, the universality of our framework leads, for example, to a further quantitative understanding of the incompatibility associated with the recently-proposed entanglement marginal problems and entanglement transitivity problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.00614v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the variational problem associated with the Freidlin--Wentzell Large Deviation Principle (LDP) for the Stochastic Heat Equation (SHE). For a general class of initial-terminal conditions, we show that a minimizer of this variational problem exists, and any minimizer solves a system of imaginary-time Nonlinear Schr\"{o}dinger equations. This system is integrable. Utilizing the integrability, we prove that the formulas from the physics work Krajenbrink and Le Doussal (2021) hold for every minimizer of the variational problem. As an application, we consider the Freidlin--Wentzell LDP for the SHE with the delta initial condition. Under a technical assumption on the poles of the reflection coefficients, we prove the explicit expression for the one-point rate function that was predicted in the physics works Le Doussal, Majumdar, Rosso, and Schehr (2016) and Krajenbrink and Le Doussal (2021). Under the same assumption, we give detailed pointwise estimates of the most probable shape in the upper-tail limit.</description>

Abstract: Quantum contextuality supports quantum computation and communication. One of its main vehicles is hypergraphs. The most elaborated are the Kochen-Specker ones, but there is also another class of contextual sets that are not of this kind. Their representation has been mostly operator-based and limited to special constructs in three- to six-dim spaces, a notable example of which is the Yu-Oh set. Previously, we showed that hypergraphs underlie all of them, and in this paper, we give general methods - whose complexity does not scale up with the dimension - for generating such non-Kochen-Specker hypergraphs in any dimension and give examples in up to 16-dim spaces. Our automated generation is probabilistic and random, but the statistics of accumulated data enable one to filter out sets with the required size and structure.</description>

      <title>Globally optimal interferometry with lossy twin Fock probes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.05871v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Parity or quadratic spin (e.g., $J_{z}^{2}$) readouts of a Mach-Zehnder (MZ) interferometer probed with a twin Fock input state allow to saturate the optimal sensitivity attainable among all mode-separable states with a fixed total number of particles, but only when the interferometer phase $\theta$ is near zero. When more general Dicke state probes are used, the parity readout saturates the quantum Fisher information (QFI) at $\theta=0$, whereas better-than-standard quantum limit performance of the $J_{z}^{2}$ readout is restricted to an $o(\sqrt{N})$ occupation imbalance. We show that a method of moments readout of two quadratic spin observables $J_{z}^{2}$ and $J_{+}^{2}+J_{-}^{2}$ is globally optimal for Dicke state probes, i.e., the error saturates the QFI for all $\theta$. In the lossy setting, we derive the time-inhomogeneous Markov process describing the effect of particle loss on twin Fock states, showing that method of moments readout of four at-most-quadratic spin observables is sufficient for globally optimal estimation of $\theta$ when two or more particles are lost. The analysis culminates in a numerical calculation of the QFI matrix for distributed MZ interferometry on the four mode state $\vert {N\over 4},{N\over 4},{N\over 4},{N\over 4}\rangle$ and its lossy counterparts, showing that an advantage for estimation of any linear function of the local MZ phases $\theta_{1}$, $\theta_{2}$ (compared to independent probing of the MZ phases by two copies of $\vert {N\over 4},{N\over 4}\rangle$) appears when more than one particle is lost.</description>

      <title>Designs from Local Random Quantum Circuits with SU(d) Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08155v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generation of $k$-designs (pseudorandom distributions that emulate the Haar measure up to $k$ moments) with local quantum circuit ensembles is a problem of fundamental importance in quantum information and physics. Despite the extensive understanding of this problem for ordinary random circuits, the crucial situations where symmetries or conservation laws are in play are known to pose fundamental challenges and remain little understood. We construct, for the first time, explicit local unitary ensembles that can achieve high-order unitary $k$-designs under transversal continuous symmetry, in the particularly important SU$(d)$ case. Specifically, we define the Convolutional Quantum Alternating group (CQA) generated by 4-local SU$(d)$-symmetric Hamiltonians as well as associated 4-local SU$(d)$-symmetric random unitary circuit ensembles, and prove that they form and converge to SU$(d)$-symmetric $k$-designs, respectively, for all $k &lt; n(n-3)/2$ with $n$ being the number of qudits. A key technique that we employ to obtain the results is the Okounkov--Vershik approach to $S_n$ representation theory. To study the convergence time of the CQA ensemble, we develop a numerical method using the Young orthogonal form and $S_n$ branching rule. We provide strong evidence for a subconstant spectral gap and certain convergence time scales of various important circuit architectures, which contrast with the symmetry-free case. We also provide comprehensive explanations of the difficulties and limitations in rigorously analyzing the convergence time using methods that have been effective for cases without symmetries, including Knabe's local gap threshold and Nachtergaele's martingale methods. This suggests that a novel approach is likely necessary for understanding the convergence time of SU$(d)$-symmetric local random circuits.</description>

      <title>Topological lower bounds for the R\"ossler System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.14066v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The R\"ossler System is one of the best known chaotic dynamical systems, exhibiting a plethora of complex phenomena - and yet, only a few studies tackled its complexity analytically. Building on previous work by the author, in this paper we characterize the dynamical complexity for the R\"ossler System at parameter values at which the flow satisfies a certain heteroclinic condition. This will allow us to characterize the knot type of infinitely many periodic trajectories for the flow - and reduce the R\"ossler system to a simpler hyperbolic flow, capturing its essential dynamics.</description>

      <title>Non-Abelian discrete Toda chains and related lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.11124v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have derived a non-abelian analog for the two-dimensional discrete Toda lattice which possesses solutions in terms of quasideterminants and admits Lax pairs of different forms. Its connection with non-abelian analogs for several well-known (1+1) and one-dimensional lattices is discussed. In particular, we consider a non-commutative analog of the scheme: discrete Toda equations $\rightarrow$ Somos-$N$ sequences $\rightarrow$ discrete Painlev\'e equations.</description>

      <title>Boundary Overlaps from Functional Separation of Variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.11612v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we show how the Functional Separation of Variables (FSoV) method can be applied to the problem of computing overlaps with integrable boundary states in integrable systems. We demonstrate our general method on the example of a particular boundary state, a singlet of the symmetry group, in an su(3) rational spin chain in an alternating fundamental--anti-fundamental representation. The FSoV formalism allows us to compute in determinant form not only the overlaps of the boundary state with the eigenstates of the transfer matrix, but in fact with any factorisable state. This includes off-shell Bethe states, whose overlaps with the boundary state have been out of reach with other methods. Furthermore, we also found determinant representations for insertions of so-called Principal Operators (forming a complete algebra of all observables) between the boundary and the factorisable state as well as certain types of multiple insertions of Principal Operators. Concise formulas for the matrix elements of the boundary state in the SoV basis and su(N) generalisations are presented. Finally, we managed to construct a complete basis of integrable boundary states by repeated action of conserved charges on the singlet state. As a result, we are also able to compute the overlaps of all of these states with integral of motion eigenstates.</description>

      <title>Cyclic measurements and simplified quantum state tomography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tomographic reconstruction of quantum states plays a fundamental role in benchmarking quantum systems and retrieving information from quantum computers. Among the informationally complete sets of quantum measurements the tight ones provide a linear reconstruction formula and minimize the propagation of statistical errors. However, implementing tight measurements in the lab is challenging due to the high number of required measurement projections, involving a series of experimental setup preparations. In this work, we introduce the notion of cyclic tight measurements, that allow us to perform full quantum state tomography while considering only repeated application of a single unitary-based quantum device during the measurement stage process. This type of measurements significantly simplifies the complexity of the experimental setup required to retrieve the quantum state of a physical system. Additionally, we design feasible setup preparation procedure that produce well-approximated cyclic tight measurements, in every finite dimension.</description>

      <title>Illustrating the Categorical Landau Paradigm in Lattice Models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent years have seen the concept of global symmetry extended to non-invertible (or categorical) symmetries, for which composition of symmetry generators is not necessarily invertible. Such non-invertible symmetries lead to a generalization of the standard Landau paradigm. In this work we substantiate this framework by providing a (1+1)d lattice model, whose gapped phases and phase transitions can only be explained by symmetry breaking of non-invertible symmetries.</description>

      <title>An Infinite Family of Integrable Sigma Models Using Auxiliary Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05899v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a class of sigma models in two spacetime dimensions which are parameterized by an interaction function of one real variable. In addition to the physical group-valued field $g$, these models include an auxiliary vector field $v_\alpha$ which mediates interactions in a prescribed way. We prove that every model in this family is weakly integrable, in the sense that the classical equations of motion are equivalent to flatness of a Lax connection for any value of a spectral parameter. We also show that these models are strongly integrable, in the sense that the Poisson bracket of the Lax connection takes the Maillet form, which guarantees the existence of an infinite set of conserved charges in involution. This class of theories includes the principal chiral model (PCM) and all deformations of the PCM by functions of the energy-momentum tensor, such as $T \overline{T}$ and root-$T \overline{T}$.</description>

      <title>Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05964v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing in the IR limit these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.</description>

      <title>On Hagedorn wavepackets associated with different Gaussians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07880</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hagedorn functions are carefully constructed generalizations of Hermite functions to the setting of many-dimensional squeezed and coupled harmonic systems. Wavepackets formed by superpositions of Hagedorn functions have been successfully used to solve the time-dependent Schr\"{o}dinger equation exactly in harmonic systems and variationally in anharmonic systems. For evaluating typical observables, such as position or kinetic energy, it is sufficient to consider orthonormal Hagedorn functions with a single Gaussian center. Here, we instead derive various relations between Hagedorn bases associated with different Gaussians, including their overlaps, which are necessary for evaluating quantities nonlocal in time, such as time correlation functions needed for computing spectra. First, we use the Bogoliubov transformation to obtain commutation relations between the ladder operators associated with different Gaussians. Then, instead of using numerical quadrature, we employ these commutation relations to derive exact recurrence relations for the overlap integrals between Hagedorn functions with different Gaussian centers. Finally, we present numerical experiments that demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our algebraic method as well as its suitability to treat problems in spectroscopy and chemical dynamics.</description>

      <title>Static spherically symmetric perfect fluid solutions in teleparallel F(T) gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09257v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate static spherically symmetric teleparallel F(T) gravity containing a perfect isotropic fluid. We first write the field equations and proceed to find new teleparallel F(T) solutions for perfect isotropic and linear fluids. By using a power-law ansatz for the coframe components, we find several classes of new non-trivial teleparallel F(T) solutions. We also find a new class of teleparallel F(T) solutions for a matter dust fluid. After we solve the field equations for a non-linear perfect fluid. Once again, there are several new exact teleparallel F(T) solutions and also some approximated teleparallel F(T) solutions. All these classes of new solutions may be relevant for future cosmological and astrophysical applications.</description>
