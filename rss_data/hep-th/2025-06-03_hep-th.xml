      <title>The Role of Berry Phases in the QCD Vacuum Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the origin of the vacuum angle $\theta$ in QCD using the adiabatic approximation combined with Fujikawa's method. By implementing a local chiral transformation and selecting a constant parameter $\alpha(x) = \theta$, we show that the QCD $\theta$-term emerges naturally in the effective action. This construction provides a non-perturbative interpretation of the axial anomaly and highlights the role of the adiabatic gauge condition in isolating the topological sector of the theory. As a consequence, the physical states acquire topological information encoded in the functional Berry phase $\Delta \alpha$, which manifests itself as a holonomy over the space of gauge configurations. This result offers a geometric and dynamical perspective on the structure of the QCD vacuum and its relation to anomaly-induced phases.</description>

      <title>Type II RR string fields and exotic diffeomorphisms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the theory of massless fields of type II strings arising from the string field theory that uses two string fields, a physical one and an extra one that allows the writing of an action, but whose degrees of freedom ultimately decouple. The mechanism allowing the description of the self-dual five-form of type IIB, anticipated by Sen, is used by the SFT to describe all Ramond-Ramond forms in type IIB and IIA in a manifestly duality-invariant way. We find explicit expressions for the leading terms in the gauge transformation of the RR fields and focus on diffeomorphisms, which are exotic for both the physical and the extra fields, perhaps as needed to describe propagating degrees of freedom that do not gravitate. The algebra of diffeomorphisms includes field-dependent structure constants and only closes on-shell, as predicted by the type II SFT gauge algebra.</description>

      <title>$\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ families of Kerr black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00184</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00184v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The stationary, axisymmetric sector of vacuum general relativity (with zero cosmological constant) enjoys an $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry called the Matzner-Misner group. We study the action of the Matzner-Misner group on the Kerr black hole. We show that the group acts naturally on a three parameter generalization of the usual two parameter Kerr solution. The new parameter represents a large diffeomorphism which gives the spacetime an asymptotic angular velocity. We explain how the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ symmetry organizes the space of three parameter Kerr solutions into the classical analogue of principal series representations. We show that the $\mathrm{SL}(2,\mathbb{R})$ Casimir operator is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. The Matzner-Misner group sits inside a much larger Kac-Moody symmetry called the Geroch group. We show that the Kac-Moody level of the Kerr black hole is the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</description>

      <title>Influence of a Perfectly Conducting Plate on the Uehling Potential of QED</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00243v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the influence of a perfectly conducting plate on the Uehling potential of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED), corresponding to the first loop correction to the classical Coulomb potential in that situation. We use the method of images adapted to the photon propagator, extending the method beyond the standard (classical) tree level calculation. We show that the effect of the plate on the quantum correction is much stronger than the expectation from a naive application of the method of images.</description>

      <title>A Constructive Proof of Existence and Mass Gap for Pure SU(3) Yang-Mills in Four-Dimensional Space-Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00284</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00284v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work we present a constructive proof that pure SU(3) Yang-Mills theory on R^4 exists as a nontrivial Wightman quantum field theory and exhibits a strictly positive mass gap. Our approach embeds the four-dimensional gauge theory as the zero-mode sector of a five-dimensional orbifold regulator that preserves gauge invariance and reflection positivity. A convergent joint polymer expansion on the Wilson lattice provides uniform control of the continuum (a-&gt;0) and infinite-volume (L-&gt;inf) limits; an Osterwalder-Schrader reconstruction yields a unique-vacuum Wightman theory; a nonperturbative BRST/Nielsen argument ensures gauge-parameter independence; a rigorously controlled operator-product expansion matches one-loop beta-function data; and a Sturm-Liouville analysis of five-dimensional fluctuations, combined with transfer-matrix spectral projections, isolates a strictly positive glueball mass m0. All steps rest on explicit epsilon-delta estimates and combinatorial bounds for SU(3), leaving no remaining gap between heuristic physics and mathematical proof.</description>

      <title>Gravitomagnetism from Temporal Dimensional Reduction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose that the Taub-NUT metric can be envisaged as a (3+1) dimensional analog of the Kaluza-Klein (4+1) dimensional metric. After dimensional reduction of the Taub-NUT metric to (3) spatial dimensions, by treating time as the extra curled dimension (since the closed time-like curves can exist in the Taub-NUT framework, such a dimensional reduction is justified), we end up with three dimensional Einstein field equations plus the Maxwell equations for the gravitomagnetic field, which also acts as a source to Einstein field equations. Hence, the Taub-NUT metric unifies gravity and the NUT charge related gavitomagnetism in four dimensions, at the same footing the Kaluza-Klein metric unifies gravity and electromagnetism in five dimensions. We also find an interesting relation between the four dimensional gravitational constant and the Taub-NUT charge. The result is derived from classical field equations in Lorentzian signature.</description>

      <title>Soft theorems of tree-level ${\rm Tr}(\phi^3)$, YM and NLSM amplitudes from $2$-splits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the method proposed in \cite{Arkani-Hamed:2024fyd} for deriving soft theorems of amplitudes, which relies exclusively on factorization properties including conventional factorizations on physical poles, as well as newly discovered $2$-splits on special loci in kinematic space. Using the extended approach, we fully reproduce the leading and sub-leading single-soft theorems for tree-level ${\rm Tr}(\phi^3)$ and Yang-Mills (YM) amplitudes, along with the leading and sub-leading double-soft theorems for tree-level amplitudes of non-linear sigma model (NLSM). Furthermore, we establish universal representations of higher-order single-soft theorems for tree-level ${\rm Tr}(\phi^3)$ and YM amplitudes in reduced lower-dimensional kinematic spaces. All obtained soft factors maintain consistency with momentum conservation; that is, while each explicit expression of the resulting soft behavior may changes under re-parameterization via momentum conservation, the physical content remains equivalent. Additionally, we find two interesting by-products: First, the single-soft theorems of YM amplitudes and the double-soft theorems of NLSM, at leading and sub-leading orders, are related by a simple kinematic replacement. This replacement also transmutes gauge invariance to Adler zero. Second, we obtain universal sub-leading soft theorems for the resulting pure YM and NLSM currents in the corresponding $2$-splits.</description>

      <title>Moduli space of Conformal Field Theories and non-commutative Riemannian geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the analogy between collapsing Conformal Field Theories and measured Gromov-Hausdorff limit of Riemannian manifolds with non-negative Ricci curvature. Motivated by this analogy we propose the notion of non-commutative (``quantum") Riemannian d-geometry. We explain how this structure is related to Connes's spectral triples in the case d=1. In the Appendix based on the unpublished joint work with Maxim Kontsevich we discuss deformation theory of Quantum Field Theories as well as an approach to QFTs in the case when the space-time is an arbitrary compact metric space.</description>

      <title>Simple holograpic dual of the Maxwell-Cattaneo model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diffusion, as described by Fick's laws, governs the spreading of particles, information, data, and even financial fluctuations. However, due to its parabolic structure, the diffusion equation leads to an unphysical prediction: any localized disturbance instantaneously affects the entire system. The Maxwell-Cattaneo (MC) model, originally introduced to address relativistic heat conduction, refines the standard diffusion framework by incorporating a finite relaxation time $\tau$, associated with the onset of local equilibrium. This modification yields physically relevant consequences, including the emergence of propagating shear waves in liquids and second sound in solids. Holographic methods have historically provided powerful tools for describing the hydrodynamics of strongly correlated systems. However, they have so far failed to capture the dynamics governed by the MC model, limiting their ability to model intermediate time-scale phenomena. In this work, we construct a simple holographic dual of the Maxwell-Cattaneo model and rigorously establish its equivalence through a combination of analytical and numerical techniques.</description>

      <title>A Celestial Kinematical Interpretation for an Extended BMS$_4$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Longhi and Materassi, who constructed a realisation of the (centreless) BMS$_4$ algebra for the massive Klein-Gordon field in $3+1$, we build a realisation of the (centreless) BMS$_4$ algebra including super-rotations by using celestial coordinates. This realisation depends only on the momenta in the lightcone in the celestial coordinates without any reference to the Klein--Gordon field. The quadratic Casimir of the Lorentz algebra written in terms of a second order differential operator and the volume form plays an essential role in this construction. The BMS algebra in terms of vector fields shows its kinematical nature, like the Poincar\'e algebra. We also construct a dynamical realisation of BMS from the symplectic structure on the solutions of the massless four-dimensional Klein--Gordon field in terms of quadratic expressions of the Fourier modes.</description>

      <title>An atom in front of Lorentz violating Kalb-Ramond black hole background</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01006v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the role of Lorentz violation in the acceleration radiation
  produced when an atom falls into a Kalb-Ramond (KR) black hole and observe
  that the amplitude and an exponential (Planck-like) factor are both shaped
  by the Lorentz-violating parameter, indicating a breach of the equivalence
  principle and resembling characteristics observed in bumblebee gravity models.
  We further investigate how Lorentz violation and conformal symmetry work
  together to determine the thermodynamic behavior of the system and the
  implications for the equivalence principle by looking at the transition
  probabilities of a two-level atomic detector interacting with the black hole.
  These findings provide new information about the interaction of black hole
  entropy, symmetry breaking, and possible observational probes of novel physics
  beyond general relativity. The horizon brightening acceleration radiation (HBAR) entropy in the KR black hole spacetime is also calculated in detail. Although the corrections are very different from those in bumblebee gravity, our study demonstrates that even though Lorentz-violating events alter the entropy, it nevertheless maintains a structural resemblance to the ordinary Bekenstein-Hawking entropy.</description>

      <title>Free field construction of Heterotic string compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type in the Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01068v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Heterotic string models in $4$-dimensions are the hybrid theories of a left-moving $N=1$ fermionic string whose additional $6$-dimensions are compactified on a $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and a right-moving bosonic string, whose additional dimensions are also compactified on $N=2$ SCFT theory with the central charge $9$, and the remaining $13$ dimensions of which form the torus of $E(8)\times SO(10)$ Lie algebra.
  The important class of exactly solvable Heterotic string models considered earlier by D. Gepner corresponds to the products of $N=2$ minimal models with the total central charge $c=9$. These models are known to describe Heterotic string models compactified on Calabi-Yau manifolds, which belong a special subclass of general CY manifolds of Berglund-Hubsch type. We generalize this construction to all cases of compactifications on Calabi-Yau manifolds of general Berglund-Hubsch type, using Batyrev-Borisov combinatorial approach. In particular, we show how the number of $27$, $\overline{27}$ and Singlet representations of $E(6)$ is determined by the data of reflexive Batyrev polytope that determines this CY-manifold.</description>

      <title>Correlation Functions and Chaotic Behavior of the SYK Chain Model in Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent investigations of R\'enyi entanglement entropy in the SYK chain of Majorana fermions have indicated that the model exhibits slow thermalization when initialized in certain states. The extent to which the heavy modes -- believed to underlie this behavior -- affect other aspects of the model remains an open question. In this work, I study thermalization and scrambling of information in individual energy eigenstates of the SYK chain using exact diagonalization. I show that two-point correlation functions in finite-energy eigenstates closely match their thermal counterparts and that information scrambling occurs efficiently within these pure states. These results suggest that the slow thermalization observed in entanglement dynamics does not extend to all probes of thermalization and scrambling, even in pure states. I discuss the implications of these findings for thermal states in a potential holographic dual theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We find matching pairs of the line defect indices for 3d supersymmetric Abelian gauge theories as strong evidence of dualities of the BPS line operators. They lead to novel duality maps of the BPS line operators for $\mathcal{N}\ge 4$ supersymmetric circular and linear quiver gauge theories which can be realized as brane configurations in Type IIB string theory, including SQED, ADHM and ABJM theories.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the relation of the super Macdonald polynomials and the BPS state counting on the blow-up of $\mathbb{P}^2$, which is mathematically described by framed stable perverse coherent sheaves. Fixed points of the torus action on the moduli space of BPS states are labeled by super partitions. From the equivariant character of the tangent space at the fixed points we can define the Nekrasov factor for a pair of super partitions, which is used for the localization computation of the partition function. The Nekrasov factor also allows us to compute matrix elements of the action of the quantum toroidal algebra of type $\mathfrak{gl}_{1|1}$ on the $K$ group of the moduli space. We confirm that these matrix elements are consistent with the Pieri rule of the super Macdonald polynomial.</description>

      <title>The Exact and Approximate Tales of Boost-Breaking Cosmological Correlators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01555v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological correlators offer a remarkable window into the high-energy physics governing Universe's earliest moments, with the tantalising prospect of discovering new particles. However, extracting new physics from these observables requires both precise theoretical predictions of inflationary theories and accurate, analytical templates suitable for data analysis throughout parameter and kinematic spaces. In this paper, we extend the current analytical results by computing the most general boost-breaking seed correlator mediated by the tree-level exchange of a massive spinning particle. We derive the result using two complementary approaches, bootstrapping from boundary differential equations, and direct spectral integration. Both representations are packaged as a single partially resummed series that converges in all physical kinematics. Computing this correlator marks a milestone for carving out the space of all boost-breaking correlators, and therefore completes the tree-level catalogue. We then introduce a general procedure to obtain accurate approximations for cosmological collider signals based on the saddle-point method. This approach allows for a clear physical intuition of various signals hidden in correlators, as the bulk physics is made manifest through the location of these saddles in the complex time plane, which depend on the external kinematics. Evaluating the time integrals at these saddles yields results given as elementary functions that remain valid beyond soft limits and provide intuitive control over both the signal shape and amplitude. We demonstrate the power of this method in both de Sitter-invariant and boost-breaking scenarios, and uncover novel refined waveform and strength dependence for oscillatory signals from massive fields. We provide a complete cosmological collider shape template capturing all boost-breaking effects for upcoming cosmological surveys.</description>

      <title>Six-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ Conformal Superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01630</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01630v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a new off-shell formulation for six-dimensional conformal supergravity obtained by gauging the 6D $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ superconformal algebra in superspace. We provide the complete gauged algebra, which proves to be considerably constrained compared to other conformal superspaces constructed in the past. This formulation is employed to obtain the unique 6D $\mathcal{N}=(2,0)$ Bach tensor superfield, which describes the multiplet of equations of motions for conformal supergravity, by using a general ansatz fixed by truncation to 6D $\mathcal{N}=(1,0)$ results. We also translate some results into components for precise matching against the literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01766v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we calculate two-point correlation functions of a massive probe scalar field in the background of the three-dimensional Janus solution. We relate the equation of motion of the scalar to Heun's equation and use the recently obtained expressions for the connection coefficients to obtain the two-point function of operators dual to the probe scalar. From the correlators we obtain the corrections to the spectrum of boundary operators and bulk-boundary operator product coefficients to second order in the Janus deformation parameter.</description>

      <title>Gauge-invariant Slavnov-Taylor Decomposition for Trilinear Vertices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We continue the analysis of the gauge-invariant decomposition of amplitudes in spontaneously broken massive gauge theories by providing a characterization of separately gauge-invariant subsectors for amplitudes involving trilinear interaction vertices for an Abelian theory with chiral fermions. We show that the use of Frohlich-Morchio-Strocchi gauge-invariant dynamical (i.e. propagating inside loops) fields yields a very powerful handle on the cancellations among unphysical degrees of freedom (the longitudinal mode of the massive gauge field, the Goldstone scalar and the ghosts). The resulting cancellations are encoded into separately Slavnov-Taylor invariant sectors for 1-PI amplitudes. The construction works to all orders in perturbation theory. This decomposition suggests a novel strategy for the determination of finite counter-terms required to restore the Slavnov-Taylor identities in chiral theories in the absence of an invariant regularization scheme.</description>

      <title>S-algebra in Gauge Theory: Twistor, Spacetime and Holographic Perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01888</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01888v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The celestial $S$-algebra arose from a reinterpretation of collinear limits of the Yang-Mills S-matrix as OPEs in celestial holography. It was subsequently represented via asymptotic charge aspects defined in the Yang-Mills radiative phase space defined at null infinity on the one hand, and via a twisted holography vertex algebra construction in twistor space on the other. Here we first identify it with the traditional symmetry algebra of self-dual Yang-Mills theory as an integrable system via its hierarchies of conserved quantities and associated flows; the self-dual phase space can be canonically identified with that of full Yang-Mills at null infinity $\mathscr{I}$. We derive the associated canonical generators from the twistor space action, identifying two infinite towers of charges corresponding to the two gluon helicities. These expressions are translated into spacetime data at null infinity using twistor integral formulae. Examining the charge algebra at spacelike infinity reveals the vertex algebras studied in the context of twisted holography. Our discussion extends directly to the celestial LHam$(\mathbb{C}^2)$ symmetries of self-dual gravity. This analysis provides a unified framework for celestial symmetries, connecting twistor, spacetime, and holographic approaches and culminating in a nonlinear extrapolate dictionary for self-dual gauge theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that a large central charge conformal field theory with $W_3$ symmetry exhibits violation of the conjectured operator growth bound if the Liouvillian is modified to incorporate $W_3$ generators. We get 23 classes of Lanczos coefficients, obtained by the action of the Liouvillian on a descendant state. Among these, 10 classes of Lanczos coefficients violate the conjectured upper bound by exhibiting a faster than linear growth with descendant level $N$. Two classes of them have asymptotic growth saturating at $N^2$.</description>

      <title>On the analogue of Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in 3+1 dimensions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Higher curvature corrections to the Einstein-Hilbert term may play an important role in probing the strong-field regime of gravity. In this letter, we demonstrate that the local effective action reproducing the trace anomaly can resemble the Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory in four dimensions on specific backgrounds. The two key observations support this claim: 1) the covariant equation of the trace anomaly coincides with the trace of the metric variation in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, and 2) on the FRW space-time, the Friedmann-like equations in both frameworks coincide, with this correspondence extending to the quadratic and cubic perturbations. As an intrinsically four-dimensional construct, the trace anomaly effective action emerges as a promising framework for exploring higher curvature corrections to Einstein's General Relativity in a self-consistent manner.</description>

      <title>The Einstein Equation from an Informational-Geometrical Equivalence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00265v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While any observer perceives its immediate neighborhood as locally flat, the metric field deviates from Minkowski space to relate infinitesimal distances assigned by local observers at distinct spacetime points. In a quantum description, these events should emerge from interactions (and thus correlations) between quantum systems, with one of them acting as a reference frame that defines relational localization. In this context, the metric field connects distances between interactions (events) \textit{from the perspective of} distinct physical local reference frames (LRFs). Building on this idea -- together with the connection between entanglement entropy and area (which, in turn, may be linked to the metric itself), and the fact that the Einstein equation does not require the explicit presence of these material frames -- we propose an \emph{informational-geometrical equivalence} (IGE): for a sufficiently small spacelike region $ B $, let $\rho_B $ and $ \sigma_B$ denote the reduced states of the quantum fields and the LRF within $ B $, respectively. In this picture, the relational content of the entropy of the quantum fields as seen by the LRF -- quantified by the conditional entropy $ \delta_\rho S(\rho_B | \sigma_B) $ -- is encoded in the variation $ \delta_{g,\rho} S(\rho_B) $ induced by a smooth geometric perturbation. When the reference frame has complete information about the infrared sector, this IGE recovers the semiclassical Einstein equation. Furthermore, considering the presence of quantum correlations between the system and the LRF reveals a positive cosmological constant related to the density of quantum correlation within $B$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The violation of the Bell-CHSH inequality in a relativistic scalar Quantum Field Theory is analysed by means of a set of bounded Hermitian operators constructed out of the unitary Weyl operators. These operators allow for both analytic and numerical approaches. While the former relies on the modular theory of Tomita-Takesaki, the latter is devised through an explicit construction of the test functions needed for the localization of the aforementioned operators. The case of causal tangent diamonds in $1+1$ Minkowski spacetime is scrutinized.</description>

      <title>Exponential speedup in quantum simulation of Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian via orbifold lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00755v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that the orbifold lattice Hamiltonian -- an approach known for its efficiency in simulating SU($N$) Yang-Mills theory and QCD on digital quantum computers -- can reproduce the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian in a controlled limit. While the original Kogut-Susskind approach faces significant implementation challenges on quantum hardware, we show that it emerges naturally as the infinite scalar mass limit of the orbifold lattice formulation, even at finite lattice spacing. Our analysis provides both a general analytical framework applicable to SU($N$) gauge theories in arbitrary dimensions and specific numerical evidence for $(2+1)$-dimensional SU($N$) Yang-Mills theories ($N=2,3$). Using Euclidean path integral methods, we quantify the convergence rate by comparing the standard Wilson action with the orbifold lattice action, matching lattice parameters, and systematically extrapolating results as the bare scalar mass approaches infinity. This reformulation resolves longstanding technical obstacles and offers a straightforward implementation protocol for digital quantum simulation of the Kogut-Susskind Hamiltonian with exponential speedup compared to classical methods and previously known quantum methods.</description>

      <title>Bound on Lyapunov exponent for a charged particle in Kerr-Sen-AdS Black Hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00833v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the upper bound of the Lyapunov exponent for a charged particle in the Gibbons--Maeda--Garfinkle--Horowitz--Strominger (GMGHS)--AdS and Kerr--Sen--AdS black hole backgrounds, which originate from the low-energy effective actions of heterotic string theory and gauged supergravity. We analyze the Lyapunov exponent near the unstable orbit to examine possible violations of the bound. Our results indicate that the bound is sensitive to the signs and magnitudes of the charges, the angular momentum of the particle, the black hole spin, and the negative cosmological constant. The violations are pronounced in the extremal or near-extremal regime. Numerical analysis supports the analytical predictions and highlights the interplay between the string-inspired black hole and the charged particle.</description>

      <title>Finite Curvature Construction of Regular Black Holes and Quasinormal Mode Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01035v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a class of regular black holes by prescribing finite curvature invariants and reconstructing the corresponding spacetime geometry. Two distinct approaches are employed: one based on the Ricci scalar and the other on the Weyl scalar. In each case, we explore a variety of analytic profiles for the curvature functions, including Gaussian, hyperbolic secant, and rational forms, ensuring regularity, asymptotic flatness, and compatibility with dominant energy conditions. The resulting mass functions yield spacetime geometries free from curvature singularities and exhibit horizons depending on model parameters. To assess the stability of these solutions, we perform a detailed analysis of quasinormal modes (QNMs) under axial gravitational perturbations. We show that the shape of the effective potential, particularly its width and the presence of potential valleys, plays a critical role in determining the QNMs. Models with a large peak-to-valley ratio in the potential barrier exhibit stable, exponentially decaying waveforms, while a small ratio may induce late-time instabilities. Our results highlight the significance of potential design in constructing physically viable and dynamically stable regular black holes, offering potential observational implications in modified gravity and quantum gravity scenarios.</description>

      <title>Analogs of deconfined quantum criticality for non-invertible symmetry breaking in 1d</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.01131v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spontaneous breaking of non-invertible symmetries can lead to exotic phenomena such as coexistence of order and disorder. Here we explore second-order phase transitions in 1d spin chains between two phases that correspond to distinct patterns of non-invertible symmetry breaking. The critical point shares several features with well-understood examples of deconfined quantum critical points, such as enlarged symmetry and identical exponents for the two order parameters participating in the transition. Interestingly, such deconfined transitions involving non-invertible symmetries allow one to construct a whole family of similar critical points by gauging spin-flip symmetries. By employing gauging and bosonization, we characterize the phase diagram of our model in the vicinity of the critical point. We also explore proximate phases and phase transitions in related models, including a deconfined quantum critical point between invertible order parameters that is enforced by a non-invertible symmetry.</description>

      <title>Emergent symmetry in a two-Higgs-doublet model from quantum information and magic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Studies of scattering processes in scalar models with two Higgs doublets have recently hinted at a connection between the absence of flavour-space entanglement in $\Phi^+\Phi^0$ scattering and an emergent $\mathrm{SO}(8)$ symmetry in the scalar potential. We extend the analysis to all scattering channels with two particles in the external states by treating the process as a four-qubit system in the weak isospin and flavour subspaces of the $2$-particle state. We work with a generic quantum information-theoretic principle encoded by the commutativity of the initial state density matrix with the transition matrix (at leading order in perturbation theory). This yields a special case of the entanglement minimisation conditions previously derived in the literature, and we interpret the principle in terms of the conservation of non-stabiliserness (or magic). Working at leading order in the quartic couplings, we find a consistent set of conditions that implies an $\mathrm{SO}(8)$ symmetry on the quartic part of the potential for scattering an arbitrary initial state, but a smaller $\mathrm{SU}(2)_R$ symmetry when the initial state is chosen to have definite isospin. This follows by accounting for Bose symmetry in the initial state, which introduces entanglement between the isospin and flavour subspaces.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the axial anomaly in Hamiltonian lattice gauge theory. The definition of axial charge operators is ambiguous, especially between conserved and nonconserved axial charges. While these charges appear to differ only by a higher-order term in lattice spacing, they do not coincide in the continuum limit. We demonstrate, through analytical and numerical calculations, that the conserved axial charge correctly reproduces the axial anomaly relation in continuous spacetime. Our finding would provide valuable insights for future studies on quantum computing for lattice gauge theory.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy in the no-scale Brans-Dicke gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01543</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01543v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We add a new scalar field in the no-scale Brans-Dicke gravity and require it to have a global O(2) symmetry with the original scalar field in the Brans-Dicke gravity. This gives us a new massless scalar field in the Einstein frame due to the SO(2) symmetry. We then explicitly break the O(2) symmetry to a $D_4$ symmetry, and this scalar field gains a periodic potential. This scalar field can serve as the quintessence field to explain dark energy. If we further add the $R^2$ term and the non-minimal coupling to the Higgs field, we can realize inflation and reheating, and this leads to a super-Planckian decay constant of the quintessence potential. The super-Planckian decay constant is consistent with the newly released observational data according to a recent analysis.</description>

      <title>Analytical self-force on scalar particle in eccentric orbits around a Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we analytically investigate the effects of scalar self-force exerted by a massless scalar field on a particle in a slightly eccentric orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. By solving the Klein-Gordon equation in the curved spacetime background, using a combination of post-Newtonian (PN) expansion, and small-eccentricity approximation, we derive explicit expressions for the self-force components at the particle location, as well as for the associated energy and angular momentum fluxes. Our results are valid up to sixth post-Newtonian (6PN) order and fourth order in eccentricity ($e^4$). We compare asymptotic fluxes with those obtained in arXiv:2401.06844 for scalar-tensor (ST) theories. Once that the relation between the two approaches has been established, we found perfect agreement by fixing the asymptotic value of the scalar field in ST theory $\phi_0 = 1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2007.07190v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently it was shown that the scaling dimension of the operator $\phi^n$ in scale-invariant $d=3$ theory may be computed semiclassically, and this was verified to leading order (two loops) in perturbation theory at leading and subleading $n$. Here we extend this verification to six loops, once again at leading and subleading $n$. We then perform a similar exercise for a theory with a multiplet of real scalars and an $O(N)$ invariant hexic interaction. We also investigate the strong-coupling regime for this example.</description>

      <title>The BRST Double Complex for the Coupling of Gravity to Gauge Theories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.00780v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider (effective) Quantum General Relativity coupled to the Standard Model (QGR-SM) and clarify whether graviton-ghosts couple to matter particles. To this end, we examine the corresponding BRST and anti-BRST symmetries, which are generated by infinitesimal diffeomorphisms and infinitesimal gauge transformations. In particular, we study their properties and relations: We find that all differentials mutually anticommute, which implies that they form a double complex. In particular, we introduce the total BRST differential as the sum of the diffeomorphism and gauge BRST differentials and similarly the total anti-BRST differential as the sum of the respective anti-BRST differentials. Furthermore, we identify the functionals in particle fields that are (co)cycles up to total derivatives with respect to the diffeomorphism differentials as scalar tensor densities of weight one: This implies that graviton-ghosts decouple from matter particles if and only if the Yang--Mills gauge fixing Lagrange density has said tensor density weight. Moreover, we discuss the relevant gauge fixing fermions: Starting from the de Donder and Lorenz gauge fixing conditions, we introduce a total gauge fixing fermion that generates the complete gauge fixing and ghost Lagrange density of QGR-SM. Finally, we show that the BRST cocomplexes are isomorphic to their corresponding anti-BRST complexes via ghost conjugation. Notably, this relates the BRST cohomologies to their respective anti-BRST homologies.</description>

      <title>Resurgence in the Scalar Quantum Electrodynamics Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the ideas of resurgence and Pad\'{e}-Borel resummation in the Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian of scalar quantum electrodynamics, which has remained largely unexamined in these contexts. We thereby extend the related seminal works in spinor quantum electrodynamics, while contrasting the similarities and differences in the two cases. We investigate in detail the efficacy of resurgent extrapolations starting from just a finite number of terms in the weak-field expansions of the 1-loop and 2-loop scalar quantum electrodynamics Euler-Heisenberg Lagrangian. While we re-derive some of the well-known 1-loop and 2-loop contributions in representations suitable for Pad\'{e}-Borel analyses, other contributions have been derived for the first time. For instance, we find a closed analytic form for the one-particle reducible contribution at 2-loop, which until recently was thought to be zero. It is pointed out that there could be an interesting interplay between the one-particle irreducible and one-particle reducible terms in the strong-field limit. The 1-loop scalar electrodynamics contribution may be effectively mapped into two copies of the spinor quantum electrodynamics, and the particle reducible contribution may be mapped to the 1-loop contribution. It is suggested that these mappings cannot be trivially used to map the corresponding resurgent structures. The singularity structures in the Pad\'{e}-Borel transforms at 1-loop and 2-loop are examined in some detail. Analytic continuation to the electric field case and the generation of an imaginary part is also studied. We compare the Pad\'{e}-Borel reconstructions to closed analytic forms or to numerically computed values in the full theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.08923v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the interrelation between topology and Narain T-duality of heterotic flux vacua. We present evidence that all 5 and 4-dimensional Minkowski space heterotic flux backgrounds with 8 supercharges have a locus in the moduli space with a T-dual description in terms of a compactification on the product of a K3 surface with a circle or a torus. A test of this equivalence is provided by calculating the new supersymmetric index on both sides of the duality. We examine the implications of these dualities for CHL-like orbifolds that reduce the rank of the gauge group, as well as those that lead to minimal supersymmetry in 4 dimensions. We also discuss properties of flux vacua that preserve minimal supersymmetry in 4 dimensions that cannot be related to conventional compactifications by Narain T-duality. Along the way we point out a number of properties of these vacua, including the role played by non-trivial flat gerbes, the appearance of rational worldsheet CFTs in decompactification limits, and the role of attractive K3 surfaces in backgrounds with minimal supersymmetry. Finally, we discuss the dual pairs from the perspective of M-theory/heterotic duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06006v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study real-time finite-temperature correlators for free scalars of any mass in a $dS_{d+1}$ static patch in any dimension. We show that whenever the inverse temperature is a rational multiple of the inverse de Sitter temperature, certain Matsubara poles of the symmetric Wightman function disappear. At the de Sitter temperature, we explicitly show how the Lorentzian thermal correlators can all be obtained by analytic continuations from the round $S^{d+1}$. We establish the precise relation between the Harish-Chandra character for $SO(1,d+1)$ and the integrated spectral function, providing a novel dynamical perspective on the former and enabling generalizations. Furthermore, we study scalars with exceptional non-positive masses. We provide a physical picture for the distinctive structures of their characters. For the massless case, we perform a consistent static patch quantization, and find the unique $S^{d+1}$ correlator that analytically continues to the correlators in the quantum theory.</description>

      <title>Monopole Breaking of Chern-Weil Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gauge theories in $d$ dimensions with a nontrivial fundamental group admit a $(d-3)$-form magnetic symmetry and a $(d-5)$-form instantonic symmetry. These are examples of Chern-Weil symmetries, with conserved currents built out of the gauge field strength, which can only be explicitly broken through violations of the Bianchi identity. For U(1) gauge theory, it is clear that magnetic monopoles violate not only the $(d-3)$-form magnetic symmetry but also lower-form symmetries like the instantonic symmetry. It is also known that an improved instanton number symmetry current, which is conserved, can be constructed in the case that the magnetic monopole admits a dyonic excitation. We study the generalization to other gauge groups, showing that magnetic monopoles also violate instantonic symmetries for nonabelian groups like PSU($n$), and that dyon modes can restore such symmetries. Furthermore, we show that in many (but not all) examples where a gauge group $G$ is Higgsed to a gauge group $H$, the structure of monopoles and dyons emerging from the Higgsing process explicitly breaks the instantonic symmetries of $H$ to those of $G$. The meaning of explicit breaking of a $(d-5)$-form symmetry is clearest for $d &gt; 4$, but these results also extend to $d = 4$, where the breaking is interpreted as an obstruction to coupling the theory to a background axion field.</description>

      <title>Critical Dynamics of Random Surfaces: Time Evolution of Area and Genus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05547v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Conformal field theories with central charge $c\le1$ on random surfaces have been extensively studied in the past. Here, this discussion is extended from their equilibrium distribution to their critical dynamics. This is motivated by the conjecture that these models describe the time evolution of certain social networks that are self-driven to a critical point. This paper focuses on the dynamics of the overall area and the genus of the surface. The time evolution of the area is shown to follow a Cox Ingersol Ross process. Planar surfaces shrink, while higher genus surfaces grow to a size of order of the inverse cosmological constant. The time evolution of the genus is argued to lead to two different phases, dominated by (i) planar surfaces, and (ii) ``foamy'' surfaces, whose genus diverges. In phase (i), which exhibits critical phenomena, time variations of the order parameter are approximately t-distributed with 4 or more degrees of freedom.</description>

      <title>Beyond the ensemble paradigm in low dimensional quantum gravity: Schwarzian density, quantum chaos and wormhole contributions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.02270v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Based on periodic orbit theory we address the individual-system versus ensemble interpretation of quantum gravity from a quantum chaos perspective. To this end we show that the spectrum of geodesic motion on high-dimensional hyperbolic manifolds, described by the Selberg trace formula, displays a Schwarzian ($\sinh 2\pi\sqrt{E}$) mean level density. Due to its chaotic classical limit, this quantum system also shows all universal signatures of quantum chaos. These two properties imply a possible duality to Jackiw-Teitelboim-type quantum gravity at the level of a single system instead of an ensemble of systems like matrix theories and SYK models. Beyond the universal regime we show how the full wormhole geometry on the gravity side emerges from the discreteness of the set of periodic orbits. Thereby, we take initial steps towards a duality between gravitational and mesoscopic chaotic quantum systems through the topological, respectively, periodic orbit expansions of their correlators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17704v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of supersymmetric Froggatt-Nielsen (FN) models with multiple U(1) symmetries and Standard Model (SM) singlets inspired by heterotic string compactifications on Calabi-Yau threefolds. The string-theoretic origin imposes a particular charge pattern on the SM fields and FN singlets, dividing the latter into perturbative and non-perturbative types. Employing systematic and heuristic search strategies, such as genetic algorithms, we identify charge assignments and singlet VEVs that replicate the observed mass and mixing hierarchies in the quark sector, and subsequently refine the Yukawa matrix coefficients to accurately match the observed values for the Higgs VEV, the quark and charged lepton masses and the CKM matrix. This bottom-up approach complements top-down string constructions and our results demonstrate that string FN models possess a sufficiently rich structure to account for flavour physics. On the other hand, the limited number of distinct viable charge patterns identified here indicates that flavour physics imposes tight constraints on string theory models, adding new constraints on particle spectra that are essential for achieving a realistic phenomenology.</description>

      <title>A New Genuine Multipartite Entanglement Measure: from Qubits to Multiboundary Wormholes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce the Latent Entropy (L-entropy) as a novel measure to characterize the genuine multipartite entanglement in quantum systems. Our measure leverages the upper bound of reflected entropy and its maximal values attained by 2-uniform states for $n$-party ($n= 4,5$) and GHZ state for 3-party quantum systems. We demonstrate that the measure functions as a multipartite pure state entanglement monotone and briefly address its extension to mixed multipartite states. We then analyze its interesting characteristics in spin chain models and the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Subsequently, we explore its implications to holography by deriving a Page-like curve for the L-entropy in the CFT dual to a multi-boundary wormhole model. Furthermore, we examine the behavior of L-entropy in Haar random states, deriving analytical expressions and validating them against numerical results. In particular, we show that for $n =5$, random states approximate 2-uniform states with maximal multipartite entanglement. Furthermore, we propose a potential connection between random states and multi-boundary wormhole geometries. Extending to finite-temperature systems, we introduce the Multipartite Thermal Pure Quantum (MTPQ) state, a multipartite generalization of the thermal pure quantum state, and explore its entanglement properties. By incorporating state dependent construction of MTPQ state, we resolve the factorization issue in the random average of the MTPQ state, ensuring consistency with the correlation functions in the holographic dual multiboundary wormhole. Finally, we apply this construction to the multi-copy SYK model and examine its multipartite entanglement structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16527v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study various N=2 multiplets in four dimensions by looking at the supersymmetric truncation of four dimensional N=3 multiplets. Under supersymmetric truncation, the off-shell N=3 Weyl multiplet reduces to the off-shell N=2 Weyl multiplet and the off-shell N=2 vector multiplet (which we will refer to as the central charge multiplet). Under the same truncation, the on-shell N=3 vector multiplet reduces to the on-shell N=2 vector multiplet and an on-shell massive hypermultiplet with a broken rigid SU(2) and a non-trivial central charge transformation. We use the field equations of this hypermultiplet to eliminate some of the fields of the central charge multiplet in terms of the fields of the hypermultiplet and a dual tensor gauge field (similar in spirit to how a dilaton Weyl multiplet is constructed). This results in a new off-shell matter multiplet, with 8+8 degrees of freedom, containing scalar fields and a tensor gauge field, which we refer to as the scalar-tensor multiplet.</description>

Abstract: We study maximal supergravity in two dimensions, obtained from reduction of IIA supergravity on an $S^8$ sphere. The theory captures the low-lying fluctuations around the non-conformal D0-brane near-horizon geometry, dual to operators in the BFSS matrix model. Upon exciting some of the supergravity scalars, we construct half-supersymmetric domain wall solutions preserving $SO(p)\times SO(9-p)$ subgroups of the original $SO(9)$ symmetry. We determine their uplift to ten dimensions and the corresponding distributions of D0-branes. Finally, we compute the fluctuations around these domain wall backgrounds, corresponding to holographic two-point correlation functions in the Coulomb branch of the matrix model.</description>

Abstract: The polarised IKKT matrix model is the worldpoint theory of $N$ D-instantons in a background three-form flux of magnitude $\Omega$, and promises to be a highly tractable model of holography. The matrix integral can be viewed as a statistical physics partition function with inverse temperature $\Omega^4$. At large $\Omega$ the model is dominated by a matrix configuration corresponding to a 'polarised' spherical D1-brane. We show that at a critical value of $\Omega^2 N$ the model undergoes a first order phase transition, corresponding to tunneling into a collection of well-separated D-instantons. These instantons are the remnant of a competing saddle in the high $\Omega$ phase corresponding to spherical $(p,q)$ fivebranes. We use a combination of numerical and analytical arguments to capture the different regimes of the model.</description>

      <title>Generalized Symmetries of Non-SUSY and Discrete Torsion String Backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10484v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: String / M-theory backgrounds with degrees of freedom at a localized singularity provide a general template for generating strongly correlated systems decoupled from lower-dimensional gravity. There are by now several complementary procedures for extracting the associated generalized symmetry data from orbifolds of the form $\mathbb{R}^6 / \Gamma$, including methods based on the boundary topology of the asymptotic geometry, as well as the adjacency matrix for fermionic degrees of freedom in the quiver gauge theory of probe branes. In this paper we show that this match between the two methods also works in non-supersymmetric and discrete torsion backgrounds. In particular, a refinement of geometric boundary data based on Chen-Ruan cohomology matches the expected answer based on quiver data. Additionally, we also show that free (i.e., non-torsion) factors count the number of higher-dimensional branes which couple to the localized singularity. We use this to also extract quadratic pairing terms in the associated symmetry theory (SymTh) for these systems, and explain how these considerations generalize to a broader class of backgrounds.</description>

      <title>A Perturbatively Stable Non-Supersymmetric String Model with AdS Vacuum</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.19364v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a construction of a perturbatively stable non-supersymmetric type II closed string model in four dimensions. It is based on a freely acting Scherk-Schwarz Z2-deformation of a supersymmetric construction which is recovered in appropriate decompactification limits. The model exhibits also the so-called misaligned supersymmetry with alternating signs for the number difference between bosons and fermions at successive mass levels. The tree-level spectrum is tachyon free for any value of the radii and moduli. At one loop level, the scalar potential has a non-supersymmetric minimum at the self-dual (free fermionic) point with negative energy, around which all tree-level massless scalars acquire positive masses. The model is thus non-supersymmetric and perturbatively stable.</description>

      <title>What is a photon in de Sitter spacetime?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00761v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The states of a single photon in four-dimensional de Sitter (dS) spacetime form a Unitary Irreducible Representation (UIR) of SO(1,4), which we call the photon UIR. While in flat spacetime photons are intimately tied to gauge symmetry, we demonstrate that in de Sitter, photon states emerge generically in any quantum field theory, even without an underlying U(1) gauge field. We derive a K\"all\'en-Lehmann representation for antisymmetric tensor two-point functions and show that numerous composite operators constructed from massive free fields can create states in the photon UIR. Remarkably, we find that some of these operators exhibit two-point functions with slower late-time and large-distance decay than the electromagnetic field strength itself, challenging the conventional notion that photons dominate the infrared regime. Using our spectral representation, we establish non-perturbative bounds on the late-time behavior of electric and magnetic fields in de Sitter, with potential implications for primordial magnetogenesis. Through one-loop calculations, we demonstrate that both the creation of photon states and the enhanced late-time large-distance behavior persist in weakly interacting theories.</description>

Abstract: We compute the two-point open string and closed string amplitudes at tree level and show that, in a 't Hooft-like limit, they take a form structurally analogous to boundary-to-boundary transition amplitudes of a scalar field in Euclidean AdS space. Interestingly, while both amplitudes yield equivalent expressions, the associated 't Hooft couplings are defined by different worldsheet curvatures-geodesic for the disk and Gaussian for the sphere-suggesting a possible geometric aspect of open/closed string duality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present an improved notion of internal tetrad shifts in 4 dimensions which is always integrable in the presence of corners. This allows us to study the fully extended corner symmetry algebra of gauge charges, which is a deformation of $ISO(1,3)^S$ involving spacetime curvature. We argue this implies corner noncommutativity of the spin connection $\omega$. The latter in particular hints that an extended BF theory might be a better way understand the dynamics of tetrad gravity. This result presents us with an integrable, complete set of edge modes for gravity in 4D, with potential ramifications for asymptotic symmetries and quantisation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16546v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For quantum field theories with global symmetry, we can study the behavior of the partition function with the background gauge field to diagnose different quantum phases. For the case of discrete symmetries, we find that the symmetry-twisted partition function works as an order parameter that discriminates spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states, and symmetry-enriched topological (SET) states. We then consider its application to the case of 4d Yang-Mills theory with adjoint matters to understand the relation between the twisted partition function and the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. We also study its behavior for the spontaneously broken U(1) symmetry and interpret the result from the viewpoint of the mixed anomaly with the emergent solitonic symmetry.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20514v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We advance the loop calculus in momentum loop space to the Yang-Mills gradient flow, deriving momentum loop equations for the Wilson loop. These equations possess fixed points corresponding to superpositions of Wilson loops associated with classical Yang-Mills solutions. We identify two distinct classes of solutions: one converging toward a trivial free-field configuration (vanishing field strength) and another converging toward configurations characterized by self-dual field strengths. Both solutions exhibit spontaneous stochasticity, analogous to the turbulent solutions found in the Navier-Stokes equations. We explicitly express these Wilson loops as averages over algebraic structures equivalent to random walks on compact manifolds, effectively representing string theories with nonlinear target spaces defined by the momentum loop. Finally, we discuss the potential connection of the self-dual solution to the confining phase in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD).</description>

      <title>On construction of correlation numbers in super Minimal Liouville Gravity in the Ramond sector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.23122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the construction of correlation numbers in super minimal Liouville gravity. In particular, we construct the fundamental physical fields in the Ramond sector and compute the three-point correlation number involving two physical fields in the Ramond sector and one in the NS sector. Furthermore, we establish the relation between Ramond physical fields and the elements of the ground ring. Using the higher equations of motion of super Liouville theory, this relation leads to a new representation of the Ramond physical fields. This formulation enables a direct analytic computation of correlation numbers involving Ramond field insertions. As an application, we demonstrate the method in the simplest case of a three-point correlation function.</description>

Abstract: Bousso and Stanford (BS) argued that the black hole final state proposal leads to acausal effects and ill-defined probabilities for the AMPS experiment. We identify a loophole in their analysis using insights from entanglement wedge reconstruction and replica wormholes. We trace the cause of the BS problems to the misidentification of the physical interior where the second AMPS measurement happens from among the multiple interiors introduced by the first measurement.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2106.03914v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In any conformally invariant gravitational theory, the space of exact solutions is greatly enlarged. Therefore, we cannot exclude the Weyl's conformal invariance to be spontaneously broken to spherically symmetric vacuum solutions that exclude the spacetime region inside the black hole's event horizon from our Universe. We baptize these solutions {\it conformalons}. It turns out that for all such spacetimes nothing can reach the Schwarzschild event horizon in a finite amount of proper time for conformally coupled ``massive'' particles, or finite values of the affine parameter for massless particles. Therefore, for such vacuum solutions the surface $r = 2 M$ becomes an asymptotic region of the Universe. As a general feature, all conformalons show a gravitational blueshift instead of a gravitational redshift at the unattainable Schwarzschild event horizon, hence avoiding the Trans-Planckian problem in the Hawking evaporation process. Unexpectedly, the Hawking's temperature of the conformalons turns out to be negative and the thermodynamic interpretation leads us to speculate about a possible maximum energy state of the Hawking radiation. Contrary to the Schwarzschild spacetime, for the conformalons the gravitational collapse consists of matter that falls down forever towards the Schwarzschild horizon without ever reaching it. Hence, the annihilation process between the matter and Hawking's negative energy particles takes place outside the surface at $r = 2 M$. Finally, the information is not lost in the whole process of singularity-free collapse and evaporation.</description>

Abstract: Topological holography is a holographic principle that describes the generalized global symmetry of a local quantum system in terms of a topological order in one higher dimension. This framework separates the topological data from the local dynamics of a theory and provides a unified description of the symmetry and duality in gapped and gapless phases of matter. In this work, we develop the topological holographic picture for (1+1)d quantum phases, including both gapped phases as well as a wide range of quantum critical points, including phase transitions between symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, symmetry enriched quantum critical points, deconfined quantum critical points, and intrinsically gapless SPT phases. Topological holography puts a strong constraint on the emergent symmetry and the anomaly for these critical theories. We show how the partition functions of these critical points can be obtained from dualizing (orbifolding) more familiar critical theories. The topological responses of the defect operators are also discussed in this framework. We further develop a topological holographic picture for conformal boundary states of (1+1)d rational conformal field theories. This framework provides a simple physical picture to understand conformal boundary states and also uncovers the nature of the gapped phases corresponding to the boundary states.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11394v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Panic-induced herding in individuals often leads to social disasters, resulting in people being trapped and trampled in crowd stampedes triggered by panic. We introduce a novel approach that offers fresh insights into studying the phenomenon of asymmetrical panic-induced escape. Our approach is based on the concept of Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking (SSB), a fundamental governing mechanism in the Physical Sciences. By applying the principles of SSB, we conjecture that the onset of disastrous effects of panic can be understood as a SSB phenomenon, and we formulate the process accordingly. We highlight that this way of understanding panic escape leads to simple general measures of preventing catastrophic situations, by considering two crucial parameters: \emph{population density} and \emph{external information}. The interplay of these two parameters is responsible for either breaking or restoring the symmetry of a system. We describe how these parameters are set by design conditions as well as crowd control. Based on these parameters, we discuss strategies for preventing potential social disasters caused by asymmetrical panic escape.</description>

      <title>Higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function: Obstructions to symmetry-preserving gapped edge of (2+1)D topological order</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10814v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A (2+1)D topological ordered phase with U(1) symmetry may or may not have a symmetric gapped edge state, even if both thermal and electric Hall conductivity are vanishing. It is recently discovered that there are "higher" versions of Hall conductivity valid for fermionic fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states, which obstructs symmetry-preserving gapped edge state beyond thermal and electric Hall conductivity. In this paper, we show that one can extract higher Hall conductivity from a single wave function of an FQH state, by evaluating the expectation value of the "partial rotation" unitary which is a combination of partial spatial rotation and a U(1) phase rotation. This result is verified numerically with the fermionic Laughlin state with $\nu=1/3$, $1/5$, as well as the non-Abelian Moore-Read state. Together with topological entanglement entropy, we prove that the expectation values of the partial rotation completely determines if a bosonic/fermionic Abelian topological order with U(1) symmetry has a symmetry-preserving gappable edge state or not. We also show that thermal and electric Hall conductivity of Abelian topological order can be extracted by partial rotations. Even in non-Abelian FQH states, partial rotation provides the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis type theorem constraining the low-energy spectrum of the bulk-boundary system. The generalization of higher Hall conductivity to the case with Lie group symmetry is also presented.</description>

Abstract: A relativistic action for scalar condensate-fermion mixture is considered where both the scalar boson and the fermion fields are coupled to a $U(1)$ gauge field. The dynamics of the gauge field is governed by a linear combination of the Maxwell term, and the Lorentz invariant $\mathbf{E\cdot B}$ term with a constant coefficient $\theta$. We obtain an effective action describing an emergent fermion-fermion interaction and fermion-vortex tube interaction by using the particle-string duality, and find that the $\theta$ term can significantly affect the interaction of fermions and vortices. We also perform a dimensional reduction to show a $\theta$ dependent flux attachment to the itinerant fermions.</description>

      <title>The index of lattice Dirac operators and $K$-theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We mathematically show an equality between the index of a Dirac operator on a flat continuum torus and the $\eta$ invariant of a lattice Dirac operator known as the Wilson Dirac operator with a negative mass when the lattice spacing is sufficiently small. Unlike the standard approach, our formulation using $K$-theory does not require modified chiral symmetry on the lattice. We prove that a one-parameter family of continuum massive Dirac operators and the corresponding Wilson Dirac operators belong to the same equivalence class of the $K^1$ group at a finite lattice spacing. Their indices, which are evaluated by the spectral flow or equivalently by the $\eta$ invariant at a finite mass, are proved to be equal.</description>

      <title>Transfer Matrix and Lattice Dilatation Operator for High-Quality Fixed Points in Tensor Network Renormalization Group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13012v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Tensor network renormalization group maps study critical points of 2d lattice models like the Ising model by finding the fixed point of the RG map. In a prior work arXiv:2408.10312 we showed that by adding a rotation to the RG map, the Newton method could be implemented to find an extremely accurate fixed point. For a particular RG map (Gilt-TNR) we studied the spectrum of the Jacobian of the RG map at the fixed point and found good agreement between the eigenvalues corresponding to relevant and marginal operators and their known exact values. In this companion work we use two further methods to extract many more scaling dimensions from this Newton method fixed point, and compare the numerical results with the predictions of conformal field theory (CFT). The first method is the well-known transfer matrix. We introduce some extensions of this method that provide spins of the CFT operators modulo an integer. We find good agreement for the scaling dimensions and spins up to $\Delta=3\frac1 8$. The second method we refer to as the lattice dilatation operator (LDO). This lesser-known method obtains good agreement with CFT up to $\Delta=6$. Moreover, the inclusion of a rotation in the RG map makes it possible to extract spins of the CFT operators modulo 4 from this method. Some of the eigenvalues of the Jacobian of the RG map can come from perturbations associated with total derivative interactions and so are not universal. In some past studies (arXiv:2102.08136, arXiv:2305.09899) such non-universal eigenvalues did not appear in the Jacobian. We explain this surprising result by showing that their RG map has the unusual property that the Jacobian is equivalent to the LDO operator.</description>

      <title>Do Observations Prefer Thawing Quintessence?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13637v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In light of recent observations by the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), we study evidence for thawing quintessence over a cosmological constant as dark energy, with emphasis on the effect of the choice of priors. Working with a parametrization for the equation of state parameter motivated by the theory, we analyse the DESI BAO data jointly with Planck 2018 and Pantheon+ or Dark Energy Survey supernovae data, and find a preference for thawing quintessence compared to a bare cosmological constant only if we use priors which are heavily informed by the data itself. If we extend the priors to physically better motivated ranges, the evidence for thawing quintessence disappears.</description>

      <title>How to Falsify String Theory at a Collider</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13192v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The string landscape accommodates a broad range of possible effective field theories. This poses a challenge for extracting verifiable predictions as well as falsifiable signatures of string theory. Motivated by these considerations, in this work we observe that all known stringy Standard Models support only low-dimensional representations of the gauge group. While it is in principle possible to produce contrived models with higher-dimensional representations, these generically appear in a tower of states with lighter ones in lower-dimensional representations, i.e., not in isolation. With this in mind, we consider the phenomenologically well-motivated scenario given by adding a single Majorana field in a real, $n$-dimensional representation of $SU(2)_L$ with $n \geq 5$ \textit{and nothing else}. This scenario is not realized in any known string construction, and we conjecture that this is true of string theory in general. Detection of this scenario would thus amount to falsifying the (known) string landscape. We recast existing LHC searches for new electroweak states to extract updated bounds on this class of scenarios. Improved limits from future colliders and dark matter detection experiments provide additional routes to potentially falsifying string theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.13800v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the electron-positron to muon--anti-muon cross-section in the asymptotically safe Standard Model. In particular, we include the graviton contributions to the scattering amplitude, which is computed from momentum-dependent timelike one-particle-irreducible correlation functions. Specifically, we employ reconstruction techniques for the graviton spectral functions. We find that the full asymptotically safe quantum cross section decreases in the ultraviolet with the centre-of-mass energy, and is compatible with unitarity bounds. Importantly, our findings provide non-trivial evidence for the unitarity of the asymptotically safe Standard Model.</description>

      <title>HBT Interferometry and Quantum Nature of Primordial Gravitational Waves in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19514</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.19514v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity (to be precise, its projectable version) is recognized as a renormalizable, unitary, and asymptotically free quantum field theory of gravity. Notably, one of its cosmological predictions is that it can produce scale-invariant primordial density fluctuations and primordial gravitational waves without relying on inflation. In this paper, we investigate the quantum nature of the primordial gravitational waves generated in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity. It has been suggested that, for some inflationary models, the non-classicality of primordial gravitational waves in the squeezed coherent quantum state can be detected using the Hanbury Brown - Twiss (HBT) interferometry. We show that in Ho\v{r}ava-Lifshitz gravity, scale-invariant primordial gravitational waves can be generated during both the radiation-dominated and matter-dominated eras of the Universe. Moreover, the frequency range of their quantum signatures is shown to extend beyond that of inflationary models.</description>

      <title>The (in)stability of quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black hole in the hyperboloidal framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.21092v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the quasinormal modes of Boulware-Deser-Wheeler black hole in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity theory within the hyperboloidal framework. The effective potentials for the test Klein-Gordon field and gravitational perturbations of scalar, vector, and tensor types are thoroughly investigated and put into several typical classes. The effective potentials for the gravitational perturbations have more diverse behaviors than those in general relativity, such as double peaks, the existence of the negative region adjacent to or far away from the event horizon, etc. These lead to the existence of unstable modes ($\text{Im} \omega&lt;0$), and the presence of gravitational wave echoes. These rich phenomenons are inherent in Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, rather than artificially introduced by hand. What's more, the (in)stability of quasinormal modes is studied in frequency domain and time domain, respectively. For the frequency-domain, the pseudospectrum is used to account for the instability of the spectrum. For the time-domain, we add a small bump to the effective potential, and find that the new waveform does not differ significantly from the original one, where the comparison is characterized by the so-called mismatch functions. This means that quasinormal modes are stable in time-domain regardless of the shapes of the original effective potentials. In this way, our study reveals the non-equivalence of the stability of quasinormal modes in the frequency-domain and the time-domain. Besides, we also numerically investigate Price's law at both finite distances and infinity with the assistance of the hyperboloidal approach.</description>

      <title>Are Hilbert Spaces Unphysical? Hardly, My Dear!</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03294v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is widely accepted that the states of any quantum system are vectors in a Hilbert space. Not everyone agrees, however. The recent paper ``The unphysicality of Hilbert spaces'' by Carcassi, Calder\'on and Aidala is a thoughtful dissection of the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics that seeks to pinpoint supposedly unsurmountable difficulties inherent in postulating that the physical states are elements of a Hilbert space. Its pivotal charge against Hilbert spaces is that by a change of variables, which is a change-of-basis unitary transformation, one ``can map states with finite expectation values to those with infinite ones''. In the present work it is shown that this statement is incorrect and the source of the error is spotted. In consequence, the purported example of a time evolution that makes ``the expectation value oscillate from finite to infinite in finite time" is also faulty, and the assertion that Hilbert spaces ``turn a potential infinity into an actual infinity'' is unsubstantiated. Two other objections to Hilbert spaces on physical grounds, both technically correct, are the isomorphism of separable Hilbert spaces and the unavoidable existence of infinite-expectation-value states. The former turns out to be quite irrrelevant but the latter remains an issue without a fully satisfactory solution, although the evidence so far is that it is physically innocuous. All in all, while the authors' thesis that Hilbert spaces must be given up deserves some attention, it is a long way from being persuasive as it is founded chiefly on a misconception and, subsidiarily, on immaterial or flimsy arguments.</description>

      <title>Combinatorial quantization of 4d 2-Chern-Simons theory I: the Hopf category of higher-graph states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: 2-Chern-Simons theory, or more commonly known as 4d BF-BB theory with gauged shift symmetry, is a natural generalization of Chern-Simons theory to 4-dimensional manifolds. It is part of the bestiary of higher-homotopy Maurer-Cartan theories. In this article, we present a framework towards the combinatorial quantization of 2-Chern-Simons theory on the lattice, taking inspiration from the work of Aleskeev-Grosse-Schomerus three decades ago. The central geometric input is the 2-truncation $\Gamma^2$ of the $\infty$-groupoid of simplices formed by the underlying lattice $\Gamma$. On such a "2-graph", we model states of 2-Chern-Simons holonomies as Crane-Yetter's \textit{measureable fields}. We show that the 2-Chern-Simons action endows the 2-graph states -- as well as their quantum 2-gauge symmetries -- the structure of a Hopf category, and that their associated higher $R$-matriex gives it a comonoidal {\it cobraiding} structure. This is an explicit realization of the categorical ladder proposal of Baez-Dolan, in the context of Lie group lattice 2-gauge theories. Moreover, we will also analyze the lattice 2-algebra on the graph $\Gamma$, and extract the observables of discrete 2-Chern-Simons theory from it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.02070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study QCD at finite temperature and non-zero chemical potential to derive the critical temperature at the chiral phase transition (crossover). We solve a set of Dyson--Schwinger partial differential equations using the exact solution for the Yang--Mills quantum field theory based on elliptical functions. We derive a Nambu-Jona--Lasino (NJL) model of the quarks and obtain a very good agreement with recent lattice computations regarding the dependence of the critical temperature on the strong coupling scale. The solution depends on a single scale parameter, as typical for the theory and already known from studies about asymptotic freedom. The study is analytically derived from QCD.</description>

      <title>Global Gauge Symmetries and Spatial Asymptotic Boundary Conditions in Yang-Mills theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In Yang-Mills gauge theory on a Euclidean Cauchy surface the group of physical gauge symmetries carrying direct empirical significance is often believed to be $\mathcal{G}_\text{DES}=\mathcal{G}^I/\mathcal{G}^\infty_0$, where $\mathcal{G}^I$ is the group of boundary-preserving gauge symmetries and $\mathcal{G}^\infty_0$ is its subgroup of transformations that are generated by the constraints of the theory. These groups are identified respectively as the gauge transformations that become constant asymptotically and those that become the identity asymptotically. In the Abelian case $G=U(1)$ the quotient is then identified as the group of global gauge symmetries, i.e. $U(1)$ itself. However, known derivations of this claim are imprecise, both mathematically and conceptually. We derive the physical gauge group rigorously for both Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theory. Our main new point is that the requirement to restrict to $\mathcal{G}^I$ does not follow from finiteness of energy only, but also from the requirement that the Lagrangian of Yang-Mills theory be defined on a tangent bundle to configuration space. Moreover, by carefully considering the rates of asymptotic behavior of the various types of gauge transformations through conformal methods, we explain why the physical quotient consists precisely of a copy of the global gauge group for every homotopy class. Lastly, we consider Yang-Mills-Higgs theory in our framework and show that asymptotic boundary conditions and the physical gauge group differ in the unbroken and broken phases.</description>

      <title>Korteweg-de Vries Integrals for Modified Black Hole Potentials: Instabilities and other Questions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quasi-normal modes (QNMs) and greybody factors are some of the most characteristic features of the dynamics of black holes (BHs) and represent the basis for a number of fundamental physics tests with gravitational wave observations. It is therefore important to understand the properties of these quantities, naturally introduced within BH perturbation theory, in particular the stability properties under modifications of the BH potential. Instabilities in the QNMs have been recently shown to appear in the BH pseudospectrum under certain circumstances. In this work, we give a novel point of view based on the existence of some recently discovered hidden symmetries in BH dynamics and the associated infinite series of conserved quantities, the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) integrals. We provide different motivations to use the KdV integrals as indicators of some crucial BH spectral properties. In particular, by studying them in different scenarios described by modified BH barriers, we find strong evidence that the KdV conserved quantities represent a useful tool to look for instabilities in the BH spectrum of QNMs and in their greybody factors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.16620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute two-loop electroweak corrections to double Higgs boson production in gluon fusion mediated by light quarks in a fully analytical way. We determine a basis of master integrals satisfying canonical differential equations in $\mathrm{d}\log$ form, enhanced by subsequent rotations to remove unnecessary functions that do not appear in the analytic expressions of the amplitudes. We determine the integration constants by matching our expressions to the large mass expansion limit of the canonical integrals. We express the solution of differential equations in terms of Chen iterated integrals up to transcendental weight six over logarithmic kernels with algebraic arguments, and further decompose them by employing a basis of uniform weight functions. By deriving differential equations for such basis, we provide numerical results as well as routines for optimised numerical evaluations.</description>

      <title>R-matrix valued Lax pair for elliptic Calogero-Inozemtsev system and associative Yang-Baxter equations of ${\rm BC}_n$ type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.22659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the elliptic Calogero-Inozemtsev system of ${\rm BC}_n$ type with five arbitrary constants and propose $R$-matrix valued generalization for $2n\times 2n$ Takasaki's Lax pair. For this purpose we extend the Kirillov's ${\rm B}$-type associative Yang-Baxter equations to the similar relations depending on the spectral parameters and the Planck constants. General construction uses the elliptic Shibukawa-Ueno $R$-operator and the Komori-Hikami $K$-operators satisfying reflection equation. Then, using the Felder-Pasquier construction the answer for the Lax pair is also written in terms of the Baxter's 8-vertex $R$-matrix. As a by-product of the constructed Lax pair we also propose ${\rm BC}_n$ type generalization for the elliptic XYZ long-range spin chain, and we present arguments pointing to its integrability.</description>

      <title>Fixed Point Stability Switches from Attractive to Repulsive at 2d Pomeranchuk/Stoner Instabilities via Field-Theoretical RG</title>

Abstract: We study an interacting two-flavor fermionic system via field-theoretical functional renormalization group (RG). Each flavor, labeled by $\pm$, has a dispersion of $E^{\pm}=c k^{2\alpha}-\mu^\pm$ with tunable real exponent $\alpha&gt;0$. The effective theory is parametrized by intra-flavor and inter-flavor interactions, preserving global U(1) $\times$ U(1) symmetry, which can be enhanced to U(2). The U(2) symmetric system has a Fermi liquid phase and two possible instabilities, leading to spontaneous spatial rotational or flavor symmetry breaking, known as the Pomeranchuk and Stoner instabilities, respectively. The key discovery of this work is the following. The Stoner instability possesses an RG fixed point that preserves the U(2) symmetry. For $\alpha&lt;1$, this fixed point is attractive, indicating a continuous transition. Conversely, for $\alpha&gt;1$, the fixed point becomes repulsive, and without fine-tuning, there is runaway RG flow, resulting in a discontinuous transition. The U(1) $\times$ U(1) symmetric system, with $\mu^+\neq \mu^-$, exhibits richer physics. This system have two Pomeranchuk instabilities. At one of them, a non-trivial RG fixed point switches its nature from attractive to repulsive as $\alpha$ increases across $1$. Notably, the runaway flow at $\alpha&gt;1$ results in the depletion of a Fermi surface at the transition. Collective modes in these Fermi liquids are also investigated. A universal Fermi surface deformation ratio $\delta\mu^+/\delta\mu^-$ is predicted for $\alpha&lt;1$ at the instability as a continuous transition, which can be observed experimentally.</description>

      <title>What is the Hierarchy Problem?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.00694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Is there a Hierarchy Problem? If so, what, exactly, is the problem? Almost every theorist has a personal answer to these questions. In this article, I give my answers. I will explain that the Hierarchy Problem is not a formal problem but rather our ignorance of a crucial physics explanation -- the explanation of the nature of the Higgs boson. Without the solution to this problem, we cannot make progress on the major questions of our field.</description>

      <title>Polarization modes of gravitational waves in general symmetric teleparallel gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.13298v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the polarization modes of gravitational waves within the most general symmetric teleparallel gravity theory that allows for second-order field equations We consider both scenarios where test particles either carry or do not carry a hypermomentum charge. Our findings reveal the existence of tensor, vector, and scalar modes of gravitational waves. Firstly, the theory supports the + and $\times$ tensor modes propagating at the speed of light. Secondly, in the case where particles do not carry hypermomentum, vector modes propagating at the speed of light exist only within a very specific parameter space. However, when particles do carry hypermomentum, there are two shear modes that propagate at the speed of light, while the vector-$x$ and vector-$y$ modes emerge only under very specific conditions. Thirdly, in the presence of hypermomentum, there is always a longitudinal mode propagating at the speed of light. The universal existence of the shear modes and the longitudinal mode in the presence of hypermomentum is a key feature of symmetric teleparallel gravity, distinguishing it from the Riemannian framework through gravitational wave polarization detection. We also analyze the polarization modes in two widely studied special theories: $f(Q)$ theory and quadratic non-metricity theory. Our study reveals that, within the $f(Q)$ gravity framework, it is crucial to assume that matter fields are independent of the connection, as any dependence would lead to unphysical results.</description>

      <title>Generalized Hall Conductivities in Local Commuting Projector Models: Generalized Symmetries and Protected Surface Modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.20384v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hall conductivities are important characterizations of phases of matter. It is known that nonzero Hall conductivities are difficult to realize in local commuting projector lattice models due to no-go theorems in (2+1)D. In this work we construct local commuting projector models in (2+1)D and (3+1)D with nonzero generalized Hall conductivities for ordinary and higher-form continuous symmetries on tensor product Hilbert space of finite local dimension. The model is given by a standard $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, but the symmetries do not admit expression in terms of onsite charge operators. The symmetry do not have local charges or currents on the lattice in the absence of boundaries, but there is still notion of Hall conductivities that coincide with the continuum field theories. We construct protected gapless boundaries of the lattice models using modified Villain formalism. The generalized Hall conductivities are computed by surface currents as well as bulk flux insertion and many body Chern number.</description>
