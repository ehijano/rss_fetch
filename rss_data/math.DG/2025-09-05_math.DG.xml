      <title>Volume comparison on finite-volume hyperbolic 3-manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On finite-volume hyperbolic $3$-manifolds, we compare volumes of different metrics using the exponential convergence of Ricci-DeTurck flow toward the hyperbolic metric $h_0$. We prove that among metrics with scalar curvature bounded below by $-6$, $h_0$ minimizes the volume. Moreover, for metrics that are either uniformly $C^2$-close to $h_0$ or asymptotically cusped of order at least two, equality holds if and only if the metric is isometric to $h_0$.</description>

      <title>A note on pullbacks and blowups of Lie algebroids, singular foliations, and Dirac structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lie algebroids, singular foliations, and Dirac structures are closely related objects. We examine the relation between their pullbacks under maps satisfying a constant rank or transversality assumption. A special case is given by blowdown maps. In that case, we also establish the relation between the blowup of a Lie algebroid and its singular foliation.</description>

      <title>Higher genus Angel surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.03925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove the existence of complete minimal surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^3$ of arbitrary genus $p\, \ge\, 1$ and least total absolute curvature with precisely two ends -- one catenoidal and one Enneper-type -- thereby solving, affirmatively, a problem posed by Fujimori and Shoda. These surfaces, which are called \emph{Angel surfaces}, generalize some examples numerically constructed earlier by Weber. The construction of these minimal surfaces involves extending the orthodisk method developed by Weber and Wolf \cite{weber2002teichmuller}. A central idea in our construction is the notion of \emph{partial symmetry}, which enables us to introduce controlled symmetry into the surface.</description>

      <title>Entire conformal curves are affine or have super-Euclidean energy growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.04414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that entire conformal curves $\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^m$ fall into two classes: either the curve is affine or the average energy in a ball is strictly increasing for large radii and diverges to infinity. This rigidity follows from a blow-down argument and the strong interaction of the generalized Cauchy--Riemann equations with calibrated geometries and the sharp isoperimetric inequality for integral currents due to Almgren. As an application, we prove that every entire Lipschitz conformal curve is affine. This can be considered a higher-dimensional analog of the statement that an entire holomorphic function with a bounded complex differential is affine.
  We also recall that a certain punctured cone over a Legendrian torus provides a submanifold in $\mathbb{R}^n$, for $n \geq 3$, for which an entire conformal curve yields a conformal covering map. As a related result, we prove that if a non-constant entire conformal curve factors through an $n$-dimensional submanifold, then the submanifold is calibrated and conformally equivalent to a flat non-compact quotient of $\mathbb{R}^n$.</description>

      <title>Rigidity aspects of a cosmological singularity theorem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.00524v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Improving a singularity theorem in General Relativity by Galloway and Ling we show the following (cf.\ Theorem 1): If a globally hyperbolic spacetime $M$ satisfying the null energy condition contains a closed, spacelike Cauchy surface $(V,g,K)$ (with metric $g$ and extrinsic curvature $K$) which is 2-convex (meaning that the sum of the lowest two eigenvalues of $K$ is non-negative), then either $M$ is past null geodesically incomplete, or $V$ is a spherical space, or $V$ or some finite cover is a surface bundle over the circle, with totally geodesic fibers. Moreover, (cf.\ Theorem 2) if $(V,g,K)$ admits a $U(1)$ isometry group with corresponding Killing vector $\xi$, we can relax the convexity requirement in terms of a decomposition of $K$ with respect to the directions parallel and orthogonal to $\xi$. Finally, (cf. Propositions 1-3) in the special cases that $V$ is either non-orientable, or non-prime, or an orientable Haken manifold with vanishing second homology, we obtain stronger statements in both Theorems without passing to covers.</description>

      <title>A conformal Hopf-Rinow theorem for semi-Riemannian spacetimes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2309.08682v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The famous Hopf-Rinow Theorem states, amongst others, that a Riemannian manifold is metrically complete if and only if it is geodesically complete. The Clifton-Pohl torus fails to be geodesically complete proving that this theorem cannot be generalized to compact Lorentzian manifolds. On the other hand, Hopf and Rinow characterized metric completeness also by properness. Garc\'ia-Heveling and the author recently obtained a Lorentzian completeness-compactness result for open manifolds with a similar flavor. In this manuscript, we extend the null distance used in this approach and our theorem to proper cone structures and to a new class of semi-Riemannian manifolds, dubbed $(n-\nu,\nu)$-spacetimes. Moreover, we demonstrate that our result implies, and hence generalizes, the metric part of the Hopf-Rinow Theorem.</description>

Abstract: Riemannian four-manifolds in which the triple contraction of the curvature tensor against itself yields a functional multiple of the metric are called weakly Einstein. We focus on weakly Einstein K\"ahler surfaces. We provide several conditions characterizing those K\"ahler surfaces which are weakly Einstein, classify weakly Einstein K\"ahler surfaces having some specific additional properties, and construct new examples.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Cartan calculus, the Patterson-Walker metric and symmetric cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12442v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop symmetric Cartan calculus, an analogue of classical Cartan calculus for symmetric differential forms. We first show that the analogue of the exterior derivative, the symmetric derivative, is not unique and its different choices are parametrized by torsion-free affine connections. We use a choice of symmetric derivative to generate the symmetric bracket and the symmetric Lie derivative, and give geometric interpretations of all of them. By proving the structural identities and describing the role of affine morphisms, we reveal an unexpected link of symmetric Cartan calculus with the Patterson-Walker metric, which we recast as a direct analogue of the canonical symplectic form on the cotangent bundle. We show that, in the light of the Patterson-Walker metric, symmetric Cartan calculus becomes a complete analogue of classical Cartan calculus. As an application of this new framework, we introduce symmetric cohomology, which involves Killing tensors, or, in the case of the Levi-Civita connection, Killing vector fields. We characterize the Levi-Civita connections of $\mathrm{S}^1$ in terms of symmetric cohomology and develop further techniques.</description>

      <title>The three obdurate conjectures of differential geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the role of symmetry in three obdurate conjectures of differential geometry: the Carath\'eodory, the Willmore and the Lawson Conjectures. All three Conjectures concern surfaces in 3-dimensional space-forms, which have a high degree of symmetry. It is shown that this symmetry is broken and more general ambient metrics are considered, none of the Conjectures continue to hold.
  The subtle manner in which symmetry enters the first Conjecture is also explained in detail.</description>

      <title>Toward Riemannian diffeology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04170v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for Riemannian diffeology. To this end, we use the tangent functor in the sense of Blohmann and one of the options of a metric on a diffeological space in the sense of Iglesias-Zemmour. As a consequence, the category consisting of weak Riemannian diffeological spaces and isometries is established. With a technical condition for a definite weak Riemannian metric, we show that the psudodistance induced by the metric is indeed a distance. As examples of weak Riemannian diffeological spaces, an adjunction space of manifolds, a space of smooth maps and the mixed one are considered.</description>

      <title>On the non-existence of left-invariant hypercomplex structures on $SU(2)^{4n}$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.21766v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using elementary algebraic arguments, it is shown that $SU(2)^{m}:=SU(2)\times \cdots \times SU(2)$ ($m$ times) admits no left-invariant hypercomplex structures for all $m\ge 1$. This result answers (in a clear and easily accessible way) the question of whether every compact Lie group of dimension $4n$ admits a left-invariant hypercomplex structure. The aforementioned question has apparently been the source of some confusion in the recent literature.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show how factorisation with respect to nonlocal pseudosymmetries allows one to obtain B\"acklund transformations, interpreted as nonlocal $\mathcal{C}$-morphisms of differential equations. According to this approach, which is illustrated through several examples, the B\"acklund transformations are determined by basic invariants of the exploited nonlocal pseudosymmetries.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of the existence of the bounded harmonic functions on a simply connected Riemannian manifold $\widetilde{M}$ without conjugate points, which can be compactified via the ideal boundary $\widetilde{M}(\infty)$. Let $\widetilde{M}$ be a uniform visibility manifold which satisfy the Axiom $2$, or a rank $1$ manifold without focal points, suppose that $\Gamma$ is a cocompact discrete subgroup of $Iso(\widetilde{M})$, we show that for a given continuous function on $\widetilde{M}(\infty)$, there exists a harmonic extension to $\widetilde{M}$. And furthermore, when $\widetilde{M}$ is a rank $1$ manifold without focal points, the Brownian motion defines a family of harmonic measures $\nu_{\ast}$ on $\widetilde{M}(\infty)$, we show that $(\widetilde{M}(\infty),\nu_{\ast})$ is isomorphic to the Poisson boundary of $\Gamma$.</description>

Abstract: By leveraging a new Laplacian comparison theorem, we derive a Li-Yau type gradient estimate for a particular nonlinear parabolic equation, namely, the Finslerian logarithmic Schrodinger equation on a non-compact, complete Finsler manifold with mixed weighted Ricci curvature bounded from below. In our framework, all coefficients are time-dependent functions defined on the manifold. As applications, we establish both a Harnack inequality and an a priori estimate for the positive solutions of this specific equation</description>

Abstract: We investigate the lower bound for higher eigenvalues $\lambda_i$ of the poly-Laplace operator on a bounded domain and improve the famous Li-Yau inequality and its related results. Firstly, we consider the low dimensional cases for the P\'{o}lya conjecture, the clamped plate problem and the eigenvalue problem of the poly-Laplacian and deliver a series of deep eigenvalue inequalities for these problems respectively. Secondly, we establish a sharp lower bound for the eigenvalues of the poly-Laplacia in arbitrary dimension under some certain restrictive conditions. Finally, we provide an improved inequality for $\lambda_i$ in arbitrary dimension without any restrictive conditions. Our results also yield the improvement of the lower bounds for the Stokes eigenvalue problems and the Generalized P\'{o}lya conjecture.</description>

We define a Lie group-rack triple whose tangent structure is a Lie-Leibniz triple, which is a generalization of an augmented Lie rack whose tangent structure is an augmented Leibniz algebra. We show that any finite-dimensional Lie-Leibniz triple can be integrated to a local Lie group-rack triple by generalizing the integration procedure of an augmented Leibniz algebra into an augmented Lie rack.</description>

      <title>On extension of closed complex (basic) differential forms: (basic) Hodge numbers and (transversely) $p$-K\"ahler structures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06870v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inspired by a recent work of D. Wei--S. Zhu on the extension of closed complex differential forms and Voisin's usage of the $\partial\bar{\partial}$-lemma, we obtain several new theorems of deformation invariance of Hodge numbers and reprove the local stabilities of $p$-K\"ahler structures with the $\partial\bar{\partial}$-property. Our approach is more concerned with the $d$-closed extension by means of the exponential operator $e^{\iota_\varphi}$.
  Furthermore, we prove the local stabilities of transversely $p$-K\"ahler structures with mild $\partial\bar{\partial}$-property by adapting the power series method to the foliated case, which strengthens the works of A. El Kacimi Alaoui--B. Gmira and P. Ra\'zny on that of the transversely K\"ahler foliations with homologically orientability. We observe that a transversely K\"ahler foliation, even without homologically orientability, also satisfies the $\partial\bar{\partial}$-property. So even when $p=1$ (transversely K\"ahler), our results are new as we can drop the assumption in question on the initial foliation. Several theorems on the deformation invariance of basic Hodge/Bott--Chern numbers with mild $\partial\bar{\partial}$-properties are also presented.</description>

Abstract: This paper is concerned with long-time interest of us, especially, the author, in realizing graphs as Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions of certain nice classes.
  The Reeb graph of a differentiable function is the set consisting of all components of preimages of all single points and endowed with the quotient topology canonically. In tame cases, such objects are graphs. The Reeb graph of the natural height of the unit sphere of dimension at least $2$ is a graph with exactly one edge and homeomorphic to a closed interval. These graphs have been fundamental and strong tools in geometry since theory of Morse functions has been established in the former half of the last century.
  We present a new answer to the problem, saying that generically embedded planar graphs are homeomorphic to the Reeb graphs of real algebraic functions obtained by elementary polynomials and elementary procedures.</description>
