      <title>Phase structure of lattice QCD in the heavy quark high-density region and the three-state Potts model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the nature of the QCD phase transition in the heavy quark high-density region by considering an effective theory in which Polyakov loops are dynamical variables. The Polyakov loop is an order parameter of $Z_3$ symmetry, and the fundamental properties of the phase transition are thought to be determined by the $Z_3$ symmetry broken by the phase transition. By replacing the Polyakov loop with $Z_3$ spin, we find that the effective model becomes a three-dimensional three-state Potts model ($Z_3$ spin model) with a complex external field term. We investigate the phase structure of the Potts model and discuss QCD in the heavy quark region. The critical points are determined by finite volume scaling analysis, and in the region where the sign problem is severe, the tensor renormalization group is used to investigate. As the density varies from $\mu=0$ to $\mu=\infty$, we find that the phase transition is first order in the low-density region, changes to a crossover at the critical point, and then becomes first order again. This strongly suggests the existence of a first order phase transition in the high-density heavy quark region of QCD.</description>

      <title>Magic of discrete lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of quantum field theories and fundamental interactions are one of the most challenging tasks in modern particle physics. Classical computers generally fail to reproduce accurate results when it comes to strongly coupled theories such as QCD. Recent developments in quantum technologies open up the possibility of simulating such physical regimes by using quantum computers. In this paper, we study the quantum resource related to the simulability of a quantum theory, i.e. non-stabilizerness for Lattice Gauge Theory (LGT) with discrete symmetry gauge groups. We show that enforcing gauge constraints for $\mathbb{Z}_l$ LGTs has no cost in terms of this resource and discuss the relation between non-abelianity of the gauge group with the average non-stabilizerness of the gauge invariant Hilbert space.</description>

      <title>Critical scaling in the $N=1$ Thirring Model in $(2+1)d$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16051v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Thirring model in 2+1$d$ with $N$ Dirac flavors can exhibit spontaneous U($2N)\to$U($N)\otimes$U($N$) breaking through fermion - antifermion condensation in the limit $m\to0$. With no small parameter in play the symmetry-breaking dynamics is strongly-interacting and quantitative work requires a fermion formulation accurately capturing global symmetries. We present simulation results for $N=1$ obtained with Wilson kernel domain wall fermions on $16^3\times L_s$, with $L_s=24,\ldots,120$. The $L_s\to\infty$ extrapolation of the bilinear condensate $\langle\bar\psi\psi\rangle$ as a function of coupling and bare mass is fitted to an empirical equation of state; the resulting critical exponents are significantly altered from previously obtained values, and for the first time resemble those emerging from analytic predictions based on approximate solutions to Schwinger-Dyson equations, consistent with a putative UV-stable renormalisation group fixed point. To address the non-perturbative issue of the value $N_c$ below which such a fixed point exists we present preliminary results obtained with $N=2$.</description>

      <title>String Breaking and Glueball Dynamics in $2+1$D Quantum Link Electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: At the heart of quark confinement and hadronization, the physics of flux strings has recently become a focal point in the field of quantum simulation of high-energy physics (HEP). Despite considerable progress, a detailed understanding of the behavior of flux strings in quantum simulation-relevant lattice formulations of gauge theories has remained limited to the lowest truncations of the gauge field, which are severely limited in their ability to draw conclusions about the quantum field theory limit. Here, we employ tensor network simulations to investigate the behavior of flux strings in a quantum link formulation of $2+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED) with a spin-$1$ representation of the gauge field. We first map out the ground-state phase diagram of this model in the presence of two spatially separated static charges, revealing distinct microscopic processes responsible for string breaking, including a two-stage breaking mechanism not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. Starting in different initial product state string configurations, we then explore far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics across various parameter regimes, demonstrating genuine $2+1$D real-time string breaking and glueball-like bound state formation, with the latter not possible in the spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ formulation. In and out of equilibrium, we consider different values and placements of the static charges. Finally, we provide efficient qudit circuits for a quantum simulation experiment in which our results can be observed in state-of-the-art ion-trap setups. Our findings lay the groundwork for quantum simulations of flux strings towards the quantum field theory limit.</description>

      <title>Fermion Doubling in Dirac Quantum Walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider discrete spacetime models known as quantum walks, which can be used to simulate Dirac particles. In particular we look at fermion doubling in these models, in which high momentum states yield additional low energy solutions which behave like Dirac particles. The presence of doublers carries over to the `second quantised' version of the walks represented by quantum cellular automata, which may lead to spurious solutions when introducing interactions. Moreover, we also consider pseudo-doublers, which have high energy but behave like low energy Dirac particles, and cause potential problems regarding the stability of the vacuum. To address these issues, we propose a family of quantum walks, that are free of these doublers and pseudo-doublers, but still simulate the Dirac equation in the continuum limit. However, there remain a small number of additional low energy solutions which do not directly correspond to Dirac particles. While the conventional Dirac walk always has a zero probability for the walker staying at the same point, we obtain the family of walks by allowing this probability to be non-zero.</description>

      <title>A Lattice U(1) Chern-Simons Theory via Lattice Deligne-Beilinson Cohomology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15939v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We define Deligne-Beilinson (DB) cohomology on a cubic lattice and use it to formulate and analyze lattice $U(1)$ Chern-Simons theory at even levels. The continuum DB cohomology provides a refined mathematical framework for continuum $U(1)$ connections constructed in a patchwise manner. The lattice DB cohomology we construct retains many essential properties of the continuum DB cohomology and naturally incorporates a notion of self-linking number. The lattice $U(1)$ Chern-Simons action formulated using the lattice DB cohomology is expressed as a simple quadratic form via the star product, which naturally exhibits level quantization. Framed Wilson lines respecting staggered symmetry are defined in a gauge-invariant manner, and their expectation values are shown to be given by the self-linking number, as follows from completing the square. Using the lattice Hodge decomposition, we explicitly characterize the DB cohomology on a three-dimensional cubic toroidal lattice and present a gauge-fixed, rigorous path integral for the lattice Chern-Simons theory. To regulate divergences in the lattice Chern-Simons path integral arising from staggered symmetry, we introduce a small Maxwell term. The resulting error is controlled by the linear order in the small Maxwell coupling.</description>

      <title>Quark-lepton correlations in gauge anomaly free abelian extension of the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.16001v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study $b \to s \ell_1^+ \ell_2^-$ transitions, both for the lepton flavour conserving $\ell_1=\ell_2$ and violating case $\ell_1 \neq \ell_2$, in a minimal extension of the Standard Model proposed in [1]. In this framework, the Standard Model (SM) gauge group is enlarged by a new $U(1)^\prime$ component. The fermion $U(1)^\prime$ charges are assigned in a generation-dependent way, and involve three rational parameters $\epsilon_{1,2,3}$ summing to zero by the condition of cancellation of the gauge anomalies. Each $\epsilon_i$ is common to all fermions in a generation, which produces correlations among quark and lepton observables. The new neutral gauge boson $Z^\prime$ has flavour violating couplings to quarks and leptons. For SM allowed processes, small deviations with respect to the SM predictions are found: this is a consequence of a feature of the model where quark and lepton sectors preclude each other large deviations from SM. Lepton flavour violating processes are allowed at tree-level. The experimental upper bounds for the rates of the processes $\tau^- \to \mu^- \mu^+ \mu^-$, $\mu^- \to e^- \gamma$, $\mu^- \to e^- e^+ e^-$ and the $ \mu^- \to e^-$ conversion in nuclei play a hierarchical role in constraining the branching fractions of lepton flavour violating $B$ and $B_s$ decays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.12664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article is an introduction to parton distribution functions and their generalizations which describe the quark and gluon structure of hadrons, and can be measured in various high-energy scattering processes. We provide the theoretical background, highlight both historical and recent developments, explain the connections between the different functions, and expose in which processes these functions can be accessed and what we can learn from them about hadron structure.</description>

      <title>Quantum Bootstrap Approach to a Non-Relativistic Potential for Quarkonium systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.02916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.02916v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The quantum bootstrap method is applied to determine the bound-state spectrum of Quarkonium systems using a non-relativistic potential approximation. The method translates the Schr\"odinger equation into a set of algebraic recursion relations for radial moments $\langle r^m \rangle$, which are constrained by the positive semidefiniteness of their corresponding Hankel matrices. The numerical implementation is first validated by calculating the $1S$ and $1P$ mass centroids for both charmonium ($c\bar{c}$) and bottomonium ($b\bar{b}$) systems, finding deviations of less than 0.5\% from experimental data from the Particle Data Group (PDG). This analysis is then extended to the hypothetical toponium ($t\bar{t}$) system, predicting a $1S$ ground state mass of $M \approx 344.3 \text{ GeV}$. This theoretical mass is in agreement with the energy of the recently observed resonance-like enhancement in the $t\bar{t}$ cross-section by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations. This result provides theoretical support for the interpretation of this experimental phenomenon as the formation of a quasi-bound toponium state and highlights the predictive power of the non-relativistic potential approach for systems of two massive quarks.</description>
