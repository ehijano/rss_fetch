      <title>Microscopic derivation of non-local models with anomalous diffusions from stochastic particle systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper considers a large class of nonlinear integro-differential scalar equations which involve an anomalous diffusion (e.g. driven by a fractional Laplacian) and a non-local singular convolution kernel. Each of those singular equations is obtained as the macroscopic limit of an interacting particle system modeled as N coupled stochastic differential equations driven by L\'evy processes. In particular we derive quantitative estimates between the microscopic empirical measure of the particle system and the solution to the limit equation in some non-homogeneous Sobolev space.
  Our result only requires very weak regularity on the interaction kernel, therefore it includes numerous applications, e.g.: the 2d turbulence model (including the quasi-geostrophic equation) in sub-critical regime, the 2d generalized Navier-Stokes equation, the fractional Keller-Segel equation in any dimension, and the fractal Burgers equation.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic optimality of dynamic first-fit packing on the half-axis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03797</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit a classical problem in dynamic storage allocation. Items arrive in a linear storage medium, modeled as a half-axis, at a Poisson rate $r$ and depart after an independent exponentially distributed unit mean service time. The arriving item sizes are assumed to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) from a common distribution $H$. A widely employed algorithm for allocating the items is the ``first-fit'' discipline, namely, each arriving item is placed in the the left-most vacant interval large enough to accommodate it. In a seminal 1985 paper, Coffman, Kadota, and Shepp [6] proved that in the special case of unit length items (i.e. degenerate $H$), the first-fit algorithm is asymptotically optimal in the following sense: the ratio of expected empty space to expected occupied space tends towards $0$ as the occupied space tends towards infinity. In a sequel to [6], the authors of [5] conjectured that the first-fit discipline is also asymptotically optimal for non-degenerate $H$.
  In this paper we provide the first proof of first-fit asymptotic optimality for a non-degenerate distribution $H$, namely the case when items can be of sizes 1 and 2. Specifically, we prove that, under first-fit, the steady-state packing configuration, scaled down by $r$, converges in distribution to the optimal limiting packing configuration, i.e. the one with smaller items on the left, larger items on the right, and with no gaps between.</description>

      <title>Malliavin structure for conditionally independent random variables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On any denumerable product of probability spaces, we extend the discrete Malliavin structure for conditionally independent random variables. As a consequence, we obtain the chaos decomposition for functionals of conditionally independent random variables. We also show how to derive some concentration results in that framework. The Malliavin-Stein method yields Berry-Esseen bounds for U-Statistics of such random variables. It leads to quantitative statements of conditional limit theorems: Lyapunov's central limit theorem, De Jong's limit theorem for multilinear forms. The latter is related to the fourth moment phenomenon. The final application consists of obtaining the rates of normal approximation for subhypergraph counts in random exchangeable hypergraphs including the Erd{\"o}s-R{\'e}nyi hypergraph model. The estimator of subhypergraph counts is an example of homogeneous sums for which we derive a new decomposition that extends the Hoeffding decomposition.</description>

      <title>Balanced two-type annihilation: mean-field asymptotics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an interacting particle system where equal-sized populations of two types of particles move by random walk steps on a graph, the two types may have different speeds, and meetings of opposite-type particles result in annihilation. The key quantity of interest is the expected extinction time. Even for the mean-field setting of complete graphs, the correct order of magnitude was not previously known. Under essentially optimal assumptions on the starting configuration, we determine not only the order of magnitude but also the asymptotics: the expected extinction time on $K_{2n}$ is $(2+o(1))n\log n$, independently of the relative speeds of the two types.</description>

      <title>Dissipative particle systems on expanders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a general framework for multi-type interacting particle systems on graphs, where particles move one at a time by random walk steps, different types may have different speeds, and may interact, possibly randomly, when they meet. We study the equilibrium time of the process, by which we mean the number of steps taken until no further interactions can occur. Under a rather general framework, we obtain high probability upper and lower bounds on the equilibrium time that match up to a constant factor and are of order $n\log n$ if there are order $n$ vertices and particles. We also obtain similar results for the balanced two-type annihilation model of chemical reactions; here, the balanced case (equal density of types) does not fit into our general framework and makes the analysis considerably more difficult. Our models do not admit any exact solution as for integrable systems or the duality approach available for some other particle systems, so we develop a variety of combinatorial tools for comparing processes in the absence of monotonicity.</description>

      <title>On count data models based on Bernstein functions or their inverses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a class of positive discrete random variables extending the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson distribution. This class emerges in a natural way from an application in queueing theory and contains distributions exhibiting quite different features. Some of these distributions are characterized by the presence of Bernstein and inverse Bernstein functions. As a byproduct, we describe these inverses for which the existing literature is limited. Moreover, we investigate dispersion properties for these count data models, giving necessary and/or sufficient conditions to obtain both over and underdispersion. We also provide neat expressions for the factorial moments of any order. This furnishes us with a compact form also in the case of the Conway-Maxwell-Poisson.</description>

      <title>Seat Allocation and Seat Bias under the Jefferson--D'Hondt Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.08291</link>
      <description>arXiv:1805.08291v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that under the Jefferson--D'Hondt method of apportionment, given certain distributional assumptions regarding mean rounding residuals, as well as absence of correlations between party vote shares, district sizes (in votes), and multipliers, the seat share of each relevant party is an affine function of the aggregate vote share, the number of relevant parties, and the mean district magnitude. We further show that the first of those assumptions follows approximately from more general ones regarding smoothness, vanishing at the extremes, and total variation of the density of the distribution of vote shares. We also discuss how our main result differs from the simple generalization of the single-district asymptotic seat bias formulae, and how it can be used to derive an estimate of the natural threshold and certain properties thereof.</description>

      <title>An Optimal Control Problem Arising in Sailboat Trajectory Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03773v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We formulate the optimal control problem for a sailboat that seeks to reach an upwind buoy, under the hypothesis that the wind speed is constant and the wind direction is a Brownian motion. The yacht moves in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and the target is a ball of radius $\eta \geq 0$ centered at the origin. The yacht can be subject to a tacking cost $c\geq 0$. We consider three control problems depending on the value of the parameters: the first one corresponds to the case $\eta =0$, $c=0$, the second to the case $\eta &gt;0$, $c=0$, and the third to the case $\eta \geq 0$, $c&gt;0$. We define the control problems, and prove that their value function is finite. We guess the optimal strategy $A^\star$ for $\eta \geq 0$, $c=0$. The process controlled by $A^\star$ has non continuous and unbounded coefficients near the origin, so the standard results on existence and uniqueness of a strong solution do not apply. We provide a proof using the Yamada-Watanabe argument.</description>

      <title>The Low-Degree Hardness of Finding Large Independent Sets in Sparse Random Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03842v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the algorithmic task of finding large independent sets in Erdos-Renyi $r$-uniform hypergraphs on $n$ vertices having average degree $d$. Krivelevich and Sudakov showed that the maximum independent set has density $\left(\frac{r\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. We show that the class of low-degree polynomial algorithms can find independent sets of density $\left(\frac{\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ but no larger. This extends and generalizes earlier results of Gamarnik and Sudan, Rahman and Virag, and Wein on graphs, and answers a question of Bal and Bennett. We conjecture that this statistical-computational gap holds for this problem.
  Additionally, we explore the universality of this gap by examining $r$-partite hypergraphs. A hypergraph $H=(V,E)$ is $r$-partite if there is a partition $V=V_1\cup\cdots\cup V_r$ such that each edge contains exactly one vertex from each set $V_i$. We consider the problem of finding large balanced independent sets (independent sets containing the same number of vertices in each partition) in random $r$-partite hypergraphs with $n$ vertices in each partition and average degree $d$. We prove that the maximum balanced independent set has density $\left(\frac{r\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$ asymptotically. Furthermore, we prove an analogous low-degree computational threshold of $\left(\frac{\log d}{(r-1)d}\right)^{1/(r-1)}$. Our results recover and generalize recent work of Perkins and the second author on bipartite graphs.
  While the graph case has been extensively studied, this work is the first to consider statistical-computational gaps of optimization problems on random hypergraphs. Our results suggest that these gaps persist for larger uniformities as well as across many models. A somewhat surprising aspect of the gap for balanced independent sets is that the algorithm achieving the lower bound is a simple degree-1 polynomial.</description>

      <title>Dimension-free Relaxation Times of Informed MCMC Samplers on Discrete Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Convergence analysis of Markov chain Monte Carlo methods in high-dimensional statistical applications is increasingly recognized. In this paper, we develop general mixing time bounds for Metropolis-Hastings algorithms on discrete spaces by building upon and refining some recent theoretical advancements in Bayesian model selection problems. We establish sufficient conditions for a class of informed Metropolis-Hastings algorithms to attain relaxation times that are independent of the problem dimension. These conditions are grounded in high-dimensional statistical theory and allow for possibly multimodal posterior distributions. We obtain our results through two independent techniques: the multicommodity flow method and single-element drift condition analysis; we find that the latter yields a tighter mixing time bound. Our results and proof techniques are readily applicable to a broad spectrum of statistical problems with discrete parameter spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.10142v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider a system of identical server pools where tasks with exponentially distributed service times arrive as a time-inhomogenenous Poisson process. An admission threshold is used in an inner control loop to assign incoming tasks to server pools while, in an outer control loop, a learning scheme adjusts this threshold over time to keep it aligned with the unknown offered load of the system. In a many-server regime, we prove that the learning scheme reaches an equilibrium along intervals of time where the normalized offered load per server pool is suitably bounded, and that this results in a balanced distribution of the load. Furthermore, we establish a similar result when tasks with Coxian distributed service times arrive at a constant rate and the threshold is adjusted using only the total number of tasks in the system. The novel proof technique developed in this paper, which differs from a traditional fluid limit analysis, allows to handle rapid variations of the first learning scheme, triggered by excursions of the occupancy process that have vanishing size. Moreover, our approach allows to characterize the asymptotic behavior of the system with Coxian distributed service times without relying on a fluid limit of a detailed state descriptor.</description>

Abstract: In this article we prove large deviations principles for high minima of Gaussian processes with nonnegatively correlated increments on arbitrary intervals. Furthermore, we prove large deviations principles for the increments of such processes on intervals $[a,b]$ where $b-a$ is either less than the increment or twice the increment, assuming stationarity of the increments. As a chief example, we consider fractional Brownian motion and fractional Gaussian noise for $H\geq 1/2$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2112.06081v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper focuses on systems of nonlinear second-order stochastic differential equations with multi-scales. The motivation for our study stems from mathematical physics and statistical mechanics, for examples, Langevin dynamics and stochastic acceleration in a random environment. Our effort is to carry out asymptotic analysis to establish large deviations principles. Our focus is on obtaining the desired results for systems under weaker conditions. When the fast-varying process is a diffusion, neither Lipschitz continuity nor linear growth needs to be assumed. Our approach is based on combinations of the intuition from Smoluchowski-Kramers approximation, and the methods initiated in [34] relying on the concepts of relatively large deviations compactness and the identification of rate functions. When the fast-varying process is under a general setup with no specified structure, the paper establishes the large deviations principle of the underlying system under the assumption on the local large deviations principles of the corresponding first-order system.</description>

      <title>A general multi-scale description of metastable adaptive motion across fitness valleys</title>

      <description>arXiv:2112.12675v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a stochastic individual-based model of adaptive dynamics on a finite trait graph $G=(V,E)$. The evolution is driven by a linear birth rate, a density dependent logistic death rate an the possibility of mutations along the (possibly directed) edges in $E$. We study the limit of small mutation rates for a simultaneously diverging population size. Closing the gap between the works of Bovier, Coquille and Smadi (2019) and Coquille, Kraut and Smadi (2021), we give a precise description of transitions between evolutionary stable conditions (ESC), where multiple mutations are needed to cross a valley in the fitness landscape. The system shows a metastable behaviour on several divergent time scales associated to a degree of stability. We develop the framework of a meta graph that is constituted of ESCs and possible metastable transitions between those. This allows for a concise description of the multi-scale jump chain arising from concatenating several jumps. Finally, for each of the various time scale, we prove the convergence of the population process to a Markov jump process visiting only ESCs of sufficiently high stability.</description>

      <title>Poisson Equations with locally-Lipschitz coefficients and Uniform in Time Averaging for Stochastic Differential Equations via Strong Exponential Stability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02679</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.02679v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study averaging for Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) and Poisson equations. We succeed in obtaining a uniform in time (UiT) averaging result, with a rate, for fully coupled SDE models with super-linearly growing coefficients. This is the main result of this paper and is, to the best of our knowledge, the first UiT multiscale result with a rate. Very few UiT averaging results exist in the literature, and they almost exclusively apply to multiscale systems of Ordinary Differential Equations. Among these few, none of those we are aware of comes with a rate of convergence. The UiT nature of this result and the rate of convergence given by the main theorem, make it important as theoretical underpinning for a range of applications, such as applications to statistical methodology, molecular dynamics etc. Key to obtaining both our UiT averaging result and to enable dealing with the super-linear growth of the coefficients is conquering exponential decay in time of the space-derivatives of appropriate Markov semigroups. We refer to this property as being Strongly Exponentially Stable (SES). The analytic approach to proving averaging results we take requires studying a family of Poisson problems associated with the generator of the (fast component of the) SDE dynamics. The study of Poisson equations in non-compact state space is notoriously difficult, with current literature mostly covering the case when the coefficients of the Partial Differential Equation (PDE) are either bounded or satisfy linear growth assumptions. In this paper we treat Poisson equations on non-compact state spaces for coefficients that can grow super-linearly. We demonstrate how SES can be employed not only to prove the UiT result for the slow-fast system but also to overcome some of the technical hurdles in the analysis of Poisson problems, which is of independent interest as well.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2204.06902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate final outcome properties of an SIR (susceptible $\to$ infective $\to$ recovered) epidemic model defined on a population of large sub-communities in which there is stronger disease transmission within the communities than between them. Our analysis involves approximation of the epidemic process by a chain of within-community large outbreaks spreading between the communities. We derive law of large numbers and central limit type results for the number of individuals and the number of communities affected and the so-called severity of the outbreak. These results are valid as the size of communities tends to infinity, with the number of communities either fixed or also tending to infinity. The weaker between-community connections lead to randomness even in the law of large numbers type limit. As part of our proofs we also obtain a new result concerning the rate of convergence of the expected fraction infected in a standard SIR epidemic to its large-population limit.</description>

      <title>On random polynomials with an intermediate number of real roots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For each $\alpha \in (0, 1)$, we construct a bounded monotone deterministic sequence $(c_k)_{k \geq 0}$ of real numbers so that the number of real roots of the random polynomial $f_n(z) = \sum_{k=0}^n c_k \varepsilon_k z^k$ is $n^{\alpha + o(1)}$ with probability tending to one as the degree $n$ tends to infinity, where $(\varepsilon_k)$ is a sequence of i.i.d. (real) random variables of finite mean satisfying a mild anti-concentration assumption. In particular, this includes the case when $(\varepsilon_k)$ is a sequence of i.i.d. standard Gaussian or Rademacher random variables. This result confirms a conjecture of O. Nguyen from 2019. More generally, our main results also describe several statistical properties for the number of real roots of $f_n$, including the asymptotic behavior of the variance and a central limit theorem.</description>

      <title>The golf model on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$ and on $\mathbb{Z}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.13380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a particle model, that we call the $\textit{golf model}$. Initially, on a graph $G$, balls and holes are placed at random on some distinct vertices. Balls then move one by one, doing a random walk on $G$, starting from their initial vertex and stopping at the first empty hole they encounter, filling it. On finite graphs, under reasonable assumptions (if there are more holes than balls, and if the Markov chain characterizing the random walks is irreducible) a final configuration is reached almost surely. In the paper, we are mainly interested in ${\bf H}^1$, the set of remaining holes. We give the distribution of ${\bf H}^1$ on $\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}$, and describe a phase transition on the largest distance between two consecutive holes when the number of remaining holes has order $\sqrt{n}$. We show that the model on $\mathbb{Z}$ is well-defined when every vertex contains either a ball with probability $d_{\sf b}$, a hole with probability $d_{\sf h}$, or nothing, independently from the other vertices, as long as $d_{\sf b} \leq d_{\sf h}$, and we describe the law of ${\bf H}^1$ in this case.</description>

      <title>On the existence and uniqueness of unbounded solutions to quadratic BSDEs with monotonic-convex generators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17560</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the terminal value $\xi^-$ admitting a certain exponential moment and $\xi^+$ admitting every exponential moments or being bounded, we establish several existence and uniqueness results for unbounded solutions of backward stochastic differential equations (BSDEs) whose generator $g$ satisfies a monotonicity condition with general growth in the first unknown variable $y$ and a convexity condition with quadratic growth in the second unknown variable $z$. In particular, the generator $g$ may be not locally-Lipschitz continuous in $y$. This generalizes some results reported in \cite{Delbaen 2011} by relaxing the continuity and growth of $g$ in $y$. We also give an explicit expression of the first process in the unique unbounded solution of a BSDE when the generator $g$ is jointly convex in $(y,z)$ and has a linear growth in $y$ and a quadratic growth in $z$. Finally, we put forward the corresponding comparison theorems for unbounded solutions of the preceding BSDEs. These results are proved by those existing ideas and some innovative ones.</description>

      <title>Deep learning scheme for forward utilities using ergodic BSDEs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.15039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a probabilistic numerical method for a class of forward utilities in a stochastic factor model. For this purpose, we use the representation of dynamic consistent utilities with mean of ergodic Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (eBSDEs) introduced by Liang and Zariphopoulou in [27]. We establish a connection between the solution of the ergodic BSDE and the solution of an associated BSDE with random terminal time $\tau$ , defined as the hitting time of the positive recurrent stochastic factor V . The viewpoint based on BSDEs with random horizon yields a new characterization of the ergodic cost $\lambda$ which is a part of the solution of the eBSDEs. In particular, for a certain class of eBSDEs with quadratic generator, the Cole-Hopf transform leads to a semi-explicit representation of the solution as well as a new expression of the ergodic cost $\lambda$. The latter can be estimated with Monte Carlo methods. We also propose two new deep learning numerical schemes for eBSDEs, where the ergodic cost $\lambda$ is optimized according to a loss function at the random horizon $\tau$ or taking into account the whole trajectory. Finally, we present numerical results for different examples of eBSDEs and forward utilities along with the associated investment strategies.</description>

      <title>Approximating quantum channels by completely positive maps with small Kraus rank</title>

      <description>arXiv:1711.00697v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of approximating a quantum channel by one with as few Kraus operators as possible (in the sense that, for any input state, the output states of the two channels should be close to one another). Our main result is that any quantum channel mapping states on some input Hilbert space $\mathrm{A}$ to states on some output Hilbert space $\mathrm{B}$ can be compressed into one with order $d\log d$ Kraus operators, where $d=\max(|\mathrm{A}|,|\mathrm{B}|)$, hence much less than $|\mathrm{A}||\mathrm{B}|$. In the case where the channel's outputs are all very mixed, this can be improved to order $d$. We discuss the optimality of this result as well as some consequences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2102.00618v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The expectation is an example of a descriptive statistic that is monotone with respect to stochastic dominance, and additive for sums of independent random variables. We provide a complete characterization of such statistics, and explore a number of applications to models of individual and group decision-making. These include a representation of stationary monotone time preferences, extending the work of Fishburn and Rubinstein (1982) to time lotteries. This extension offers a new perspective on risk attitudes toward time, as well as on the aggregation of multiple discount factors. We also offer a novel class of nonexpected utility preferences over gambles which satisfy invariance to background risk as well as betweenness, but are versatile enough to capture mixed risk attitudes.</description>

      <title>Random planar trees and the Jacobian conjecture</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.08221v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a probabilistic approach to the celebrated Jacobian conjecture, which states that any Keller map (i.e. any polynomial mapping $F\colon \mathbb{C}^n \to \mathbb{C}^n$ whose Jacobian determinant is a nonzero constant) has a compositional inverse which is also a polynomial. The Jacobian conjecture may be formulated in terms of a problem involving labellings of rooted trees; we give a new probabilistic derivation of this formulation using multi-type branching processes. Thereafter, we develop a simple and novel approach to the Jacobian conjecture in terms of a problem involving shuffling subtrees of $d$-Catalan trees, i.e. planar $d$-ary trees. We also show that, if one can construct a certain Markov chain on large $d$-Catalan trees which updates its value by randomly shuffling certain nearby subtrees, and in such a way that the stationary distribution of this chain is uniform, then the Jacobian conjecture is true. Finally, we use the local limit theory of large random trees to show that the subtree shuffling conjecture is true in a certain asymptotic sense, and thereafter use our machinery to prove an approximate version of the Jacobian conjecture, stating that inverses of Keller maps have small power series coefficients for their high degree terms.</description>

      <title>Rough Paths above Weierstrass Functions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2304.11646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Rough paths theory allows for a pathwise theory of solutions to differential equations driven by highly irregular signals. The fundamental observation of rough paths theory is that if one can define "iterated integrals" above a signal, then one can construct solutions to differential equations driven by the signal.
  The typical examples of the signals of interest are stochastic processes such as (fractional) Brownian motion. However, rough paths theory is not inherently random and therefore can treat irregular deterministic driving signals such as a (multivariate) Weierstrass function. To the authors' best knowledge, no explicit construction of a rough path (the "iterated integrals") above a multivariate Weierstrass function has been constructed, nor has there been an explicit solution to a differential equation driven by a multivariate Weierstrass function. This note supplies a construction of a rough path above a multivariate Weierstrass function. We conclude with some illustrations and some examples of solving differential equations driven by rough Weierstrass functions.</description>

      <title>Optimal Vaccination Policy to Prevent Endemicity: A Stochastic Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.13633v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We examine here the effects of recurrent vaccination and waning immunity on the establishment of an endemic equilibrium in a population. An individual-based model that incorporates memory effects for transmission rate during infection and subsequent immunity is introduced, considering stochasticity at the individual level. By letting the population size going to infinity, we derive a set of equations describing the large scale behavior of the epidemic. The analysis of the model's equilibria reveals a criterion for the existence of an endemic equilibrium, which depends on the rate of immunity loss and the distribution of time between booster doses. The outcome of a vaccination policy in this context is influenced by the efficiency of the vaccine in blocking transmissions and the distribution pattern of booster doses within the population. Strategies with evenly spaced booster shots at the individual level prove to be more effective in preventing disease spread compared to irregularly spaced boosters, as longer intervals without vaccination increase susceptibility and facilitate more efficient disease transmission. We provide an expression for the critical fraction of the population required to adhere to the vaccination policy in order to eradicate the disease, that resembles a well-known threshold for preventing an outbreak with an imperfect vaccine. We also investigate the consequences of unequal vaccine access in a population and prove that, under reasonable assumptions, fair vaccine allocation is the optimal strategy to prevent endemicity.</description>

      <title>The Underlying Scaling Laws and Universal Statistical Structure of Complex Datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.14975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.14975v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study universal traits which emerge both in real-world complex datasets, as well as in artificially generated ones. Our approach is to analogize data to a physical system and employ tools from statistical physics and Random Matrix Theory (RMT) to reveal their underlying structure. We focus on the feature-feature covariance matrix, analyzing both its local and global eigenvalue statistics. Our main observations are: (i) The power-law scalings that the bulk of its eigenvalues exhibit are vastly different for uncorrelated normally distributed data compared to real-world data, (ii) this scaling behavior can be completely modeled by generating Gaussian data with long range correlations, (iii) both generated and real-world datasets lie in the same universality class from the RMT perspective, as chaotic rather than integrable systems, (iv) the expected RMT statistical behavior already manifests for empirical covariance matrices at dataset sizes significantly smaller than those conventionally used for real-world training, and can be related to the number of samples required to approximate the population power-law scaling behavior, (v) the Shannon entropy is correlated with local RMT structure and eigenvalues scaling, is substantially smaller in strongly correlated datasets compared to uncorrelated ones, and requires fewer samples to reach the distribution entropy. These findings show that with sufficient sample size, the Gram matrix of natural image datasets can be well approximated by a Wishart random matrix with a simple covariance structure, opening the door to rigorous studies of neural network dynamics and generalization which rely on the data Gram matrix.</description>

      <title>Product states optimize quantum $p$-spin models for large $p$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.11709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.11709v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the maximal energy of quantum $p$-local spin glass random Hamiltonians, the quantum analogues of widely studied classical spin glass models. Denoting by $E^*(p)$ the (appropriately normalized) maximal energy in the limit of a large number of qubits $n$, we show that $E^*(p)$ approaches $\sqrt{2\log 6}$ as $p$ increases. This value is interpreted as the maximal energy of a much simpler so-called Random Energy Model, widely studied in the setting of classical spin glasses.
  Our most notable and (arguably) surprising result proves the existence of near-maximal energy states which are product states, and thus not entangled. Specifically, we prove that with high probability as $n\to\infty$, for any $E&lt;E^*(p)$ there exists a product state with energy $\geq E$ at sufficiently large constant $p$. Even more surprisingly, this remains true even when restricting to tensor products of Pauli eigenstates. Our approximations go beyond what is known from monogamy-of-entanglement style arguments -- the best of which, in this normalization, achieve approximation error growing with $n$. Our results not only challenge prevailing beliefs in physics that extremely low-temperature states of random local Hamiltonians should exhibit non-negligible entanglement, but they also imply that classical algorithms can be just as effective as quantum algorithms in optimizing Hamiltonians with large locality -- though performing such optimization is still likely a hard problem.
  Our results are robust with respect to the choice of the randomness (disorder) and apply to the case of sparse random Hamiltonian using Lindeberg's interpolation method. The proof of the main result is obtained by estimating the expected trace of the associated partition function, and then matching its asymptotics with the extremal energy of product states using the second moment method.</description>

      <title>A Framework for Asymptotic Limit Problems of Probabilistic Nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03513v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A convenient framework for dealing with asymptotic limit problems of probabilistic nature is provided. These problems include questions such as finding the asymptotic proportion of terms of a sequence falling inside a given interval, or the limit of the arithmetic mean of its partial sums; but several classes of problems are examined in a much more general setting. The proposed framework, which aims to unify those questions and their solution, is based on the idea that to any finite multiset $E_n$, one can associate a finitely distributed atomic probability $\mu_n$; assuming $\mu_n$ tends in distribution to a probability $\mu$, it provides the tools needed to establish the desired asymptotic limit. Few examples are worked out in order to illustrate how using the framework.</description>
