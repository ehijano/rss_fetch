      <title>Geometric Convergence to an Extreme Limit Space with nonnegative scalar curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2014, Gromov conjectured that sequences of manifolds with nonnegative scalar curvature should have subsequences which converge in some geometric sense to limit spaces with some notion of generalized nonnegative scalar curvature. In recent joint work with Changliang Wang, the authors found a sequence of warped product Riemannian metrics on $\Sph^2\times \Sph^1$ with nonnegative scalar curvature whose metric tensors converge in the $W^{1,p}$ sense for $p&lt;2$ to an extreme warped product limit space where the warping function hits infinity at two points. Here we study this extreme limit space as a metric space and as an integral current space and prove the sequence converges in the volume preserving intrinsic flat and measured Gromov-Hausdorff sense to this space. This limit space may now be used to test any proposed definitions for generalized nonnegative scalar curvature. One does not need expertise in Geometric Measure Theory or in Intrinsic Flat Convergence to read this paper.</description>

      <title>Undecidability of Translational Tiling of the Plane with Orthogonally Convex Polyominoes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12726v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first undecidability result on the tiling is the undecidability of translational tiling of the plane with Wang tiles, where there is an additional color matching requirement. Later, researchers obtained several undecidability results on translational tiling problems where the tilings are subject to the geometric shapes of the tiles only. However, all these results are proved by constructing tiles with extremely concave shapes. It is natural to ask: can we obtain undecidability results of translational tiling with convex tiles? Towards answering this question, we prove the undecidability of translational tiling of the plane with a set of 7 orthogonally convex polyominoes.</description>

      <title>Boundary rigidity of systolic and Helly complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this article, we prove that finite (weakly) systolic and Helly complexes can be reconstructed from their boundary distances (computed in their 1-skeleta). Furthermore, Helly complexes and 2-dimensional systolic complexes can be reconstructed by an algorithm that runs in polynomial time with respect to the number of vertices of the complex. Both results can be viewed as a positive contribution to a general question of Haslegrave, Scott, Tamitegama, and Tan (2025). The reconstruction of a finite cell complex from the boundary distances is the discrete analogue of the boundary rigidity problem, which is a classical problem from Riemannian geometry.</description>

      <title>Isoperimetric profiles of lamplighter-like groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13235v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a finitely generated amenable group $H$ satisfying some mild assumptions, we relate isoperimetric profiles of the lampshuffler group $\mathsf{Shuffler}(H)=\mathsf{FSym}(H)\rtimes H$ to those of $H$. Our results are sharp for all exponential growth groups for which isoperimetric profiles are known, including Brieussel-Zheng groups. This refines previous estimates obtained by Erschler and Zheng and by Saloff-Coste and Zheng. The most difficult part is to find an optimal upper bound, and our strategy consists in finding suitable lamplighter subgraphs in lampshufflers. This novelty applies more generally for many examples of halo products, a class of groups introduced recently by Genevois and Tessera as a natural generalisation of wreath products. Lastly, we also give applications of our estimates on isoperimetric profiles to the existence problem of regular maps between such groups.</description>

      <title>No-dimensional Tverberg-type problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Adiprasito et al. have initiated the study of the so-called no-dimensional Tverberg problem. This problem can be informally stated as follows: Given $n\geq k$, partition an $n$-point set in Euclidean space into $k$ parts such that their convex hulls intersect a ball of relatively small radius.
  In this survey, we aim to present the recent progress towards solving the no-dimensional Tverberg problem and new open questions arising in its context. Also, we discuss the colorful variation of this problem and its algorithmic aspects, particularly focusing on the case when each part of a partition contains exactly 2 points. The latter turns out to be related to the following no-dimensional Tverberg-type problem of Huemer et al.: For an even set of points in Euclidean space, find a perfect matching such that the balls with diameters induced by its edges intersect.</description>

      <title>The Stepanov theorem for Q-valued functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14554v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we prove the Stepanov differentiation theorem for multiple-valued functions. This theorem is proved in the wide generality of metric-space-multiple-valued functions without relying on a Lipschitz extension result. General definitions of differentiability and approximate differentiability for functions between suitable metric spaces are also introduced.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic area measures of convex bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08803</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.08803v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the relative differential geometry, where the Euclidean normal vector of hypersurfaces is generalized by a relative normalization, we introduce anisotropic area measures of convex bodies, constructed with respect to a gauge body. Together with the anisotropic curvature measures, they are special cases of the newly introduced anisotropic support measures. We show that a convex body in ${\mathbb R}^n$, for which the anisotropic area measure of some order $k\in\{0,\dots,n-2\}$ is proportional to the area measure of order $n-1$, must be a $k$-tangential body of the gauge body.</description>

      <title>Sharp estimates for the Cram\'{e}r transform of log-concave measures and geometric applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.07253v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We establish a new comparison between the Legendre transform of the cumulant generating function and the half-space depth of an arbitrary log-concave probability distribution on the real line, that carries on to the multidimensional setting. Combined with sharp estimates for the Cram\'{e}r transform of rotationally invariant measures, we are led to some new phase-transition type results for the asymptotics of the expected measure of random polytopes. As a byproduct of our analysis, we address a question on the sharp exponential separability constant for log-concave distributions, in the symmetric case.</description>

      <title>Diverse beam search to find densest-known planar unit distance graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15317v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of determining the maximum number of edges in a unit distance graph (UDG) of $n$ vertices using computer search. An unsolved problem of Paul Erd\H{o}s asks the maximum number of edges $u(n)$ a UDG of $n$ vertices can have. Those UDGs that attain $u(n)$ are called "maximally dense." In this paper, we seek to demonstrate a computer algorithm to generate dense UDGs for vertex counts up to at least 100. Via beam search with an added visitation metric, our algorithm finds all known maximally dense UDGs up to isomorphism at the push of a button. In addition, for $15 &lt; n$, where $u(n)$ is unknown, i) the algorithm finds all previously published densest UDGs up to isomorphism for $15 &lt; n \le 30$, and ii) the rate of growth of $u(n)/n$ remains similar for $30 &lt; n$. The code and database of over 60 million UDGs found by our algorithm can be found at https://codeberg.org/zsamboki/dbs-udg.</description>

      <title>Realizations of homology classes and projection areas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08881v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The relationship between convex geometry and algebraic geometry has deep historical roots, tracing back to classical works in enumerative geometry. In this paper, we continue this theme by studying two interconnected problems regarding projections of geometric objects in four-dimensional spaces:
  (1) Let $A$ be a convex body in $\mathbb{R}^4$, and let $(p_{12}, p_{13}, p_{14}, p_{23}, p_{24}, p_{34})$ be the areas of the six coordinate projections of $A$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. Which tuples of six nonnegative real numbers can arise in this way?
  (2) Let $S$ be an irreducible surface in $(\mathbb{P}^1)^4$, and let $(p_{12}, p_{13}, p_{14}, p_{23}, p_{24}, p_{34})$ be the degrees of the six coordinate projections from $S$ to $(\mathbb{P}^1)^2$. Which tuples of six nonnegative integers can arise in this way?
  We show that these questions are governed by the Pl\"ucker relations for the Grassmannian $\text{Gr}(2,4)$ over the triangular hyperfield $\mathbb{T}_2$. We extend our analysis by determining the homology classes in $(\mathbb{P}^m)^n$ proportional to the fundamental classes of irreducible algebraic surfaces, resolving the algebraic Steenrod problem in this setting. Our results lead to several conjectures on realizable homology classes in smooth projective varieties and on the projection volumes of convex bodies.</description>
