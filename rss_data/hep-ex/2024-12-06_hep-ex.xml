      <title>Model-agnostic search for dijet resonances with anomalous jet substructure in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a model-agnostic search for narrow resonances in the dijet final state in the mass range 1.8-6 TeV. The signal is assumed to produce jets with substructure atypical of jets initiated by light quarks or gluons, with minimal additional assumptions. Search regions are obtained by utilizing multivariate machine-learning methods to select jets with anomalous substructure. A collection of complementary anomaly detection methods - based on unsupervised, weakly supervised, and semisupervised algorithms - are used in order to maximize the sensitivity to unknown new physics signatures. These algorithms are applied to data corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$, recorded by the CMS experiment at the LHC, at a center-of-mass energy of 13 TeV. No significant excesses above background expectations are seen. Exclusion limits are derived on the production cross section of benchmark signal models varying in resonance mass, jet mass, and jet substructure. Many of these signatures have not been previously sought, making several of the limits reported on the corresponding benchmark models the first ever. When compared to benchmark inclusive and substructure-based search strategies, the anomaly detection methods are found to significantly enhance the sensitivity to a variety of models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.04033v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The NA62 experiment at the CERN SPS reports the first detection of a tagged neutrino candidate based on the data collected in 2022. The candidate consists of a $K^+ \rightarrow \mu^+ \nu_\mu$ decay where the charged particles are reconstructed and the neutrino is detected through a charged-current interaction in a liquid krypton calorimeter.</description>

      <title>Modification on thermal motion in Geant4 for neutron capture simulation in Gadolinium loaded water</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04186v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutron tagging is a fundamental technique for electron anti-neutrino detection via the inverse beta decay channel. A reported discrepancy in neutron detection efficiency between observational data and simulation predictions prompted an investigation into neutron capture modeling in Geant4. The study revealed that an overestimation of the thermal motion of hydrogen atoms in Geant4 impacts the fraction of captured nuclei. By manually modifying the Geant4 implementation, the simulation results align with calculations based on evaluated nuclear data and show good agreement with observables derived from the SK-Gd data.</description>

      <title>Search for heavy neutral resonances decaying to tau lepton pairs in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A search for heavy neutral gauge bosons (Z') decaying into a pair of tau leptons is performed in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV at the CERN LHC. The data were collected with the CMS detector and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The observations are found to be in agreement with the expectation from standard model processes. Limits at 95% confidence level are set on the product of the Z' production cross section and its branching fraction to tau lepton pairs for a range of Z' boson masses. For a narrow resonance in the sequential standard model scenario, a Z' boson with a mass below 3.5 TeV is excluded. This is the most stringent limit to date from this type of search.</description>

      <title>Precision calibration of calorimeter signals in the ATLAS experiment using an uncertainty-aware neural network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04370v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ATLAS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider explores the use of modern neural networks for a multi-dimensional calibration of its calorimeter signal defined by clusters of topologically connected cells (topo-clusters). The Bayesian neural network (BNN) approach not only yields a continuous and smooth calibration function that improves performance relative to the standard calibration but also provides uncertainties on the calibrated energies for each topo-cluster. The results obtained by using a trained BNN are compared to the standard local hadronic calibration and to a calibration provided by training a deep neural network. The uncertainties predicted by the BNN are interpreted in the context of a fractional contribution to the systematic uncertainties of the trained calibration. They are also compared to uncertainty predictions obtained from an alternative estimator employing repulsive ensembles.</description>

      <title>Searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with spin sensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03288v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Numerous theories have postulated the existence of exotic spin-dependent interactions beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Spin-based quantum sensors, which utilize the quantum properties of spins to enhance measurement precision, emerge as powerful tools for probing these exotic interactions. These sensors encompass a wide range of technologies, such as optically pumped magnetometers, atomic comagnetometers, spin masers, nuclear magnetic resonance, spin amplifiers, and nitrogen-vacancy centers. These technologies stand out for their ultrahigh sensitivity, compact tabletop design, and cost-effectiveness, offering complementary approaches to the large-scale particle colliders and astrophysical observations. This article reviews the underlying physical principles of various spin sensors and highlights the recent theoretical and experimental progress in the searches for exotic spin-dependent interactions with these quantum sensors. Investigations covered include the exotic interactions of spins with ultralight dark matter, exotic spin-dependent forces, electric dipole moment, spin-gravity interactions, and among others. Ongoing and forthcoming experiments using advanced spin-based sensors to investigate exotic spin-dependent interactions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Direct Deflection of Millicharged Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Millicharged particles are generic in theories of dark sectors. A cosmic or local abundance of them may be produced by the early universe, stellar environments, or the decay or annihilation of dark matter/dark energy. Furthermore, if such particles are light, these production channels result in a background of millicharged radiation. We show that light-shining-through-wall experiments employing superconducting RF cavities can also be used as ``direct deflection" experiments to search for this relativistic background. The millicharged plasma is first subjected to an oscillating electromagnetic field of a driven cavity, which causes charge separation in the form of charge and current perturbations. In turn, these perturbations can propagate outwards and resonantly excite electromagnetic fields in a well-shielded cavity placed nearby, enabling detection. We estimate that future versions of the existing Dark SRF experiment can probe orders of magnitude of currently unexplored parameter space, including millicharges produced from the Sun, the cosmic neutrino background, or other mechanisms that generate a thermal abundance with energy density as small as $\sim 10^{-4}$ that of the cosmic microwave background.</description>

      <title>Tribute to Henry Primakoff:Tests of Chiral Perturbation Theory via Primakoff Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03669v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Henry Primakoff founded a field of study based on the scattering of very high energy particles (pions, kaons, {\gamma} gamma-rays) from photon targets, {\gamma}* virtual photons in the Coulomb field of an atomic nucleus. Primakoff was the first to describe how to determine the {\pi}0 lifetime by measuring the {\gamma}{\gamma}* -&gt; {\pi}0 production cross section. For the case that a high energy (190 GeV/c) pion beam is used, Primakoff scattering, viewed in the rest frame of the pion, is effectively low-energy soft scattering of ~250 MeV gamma rays from a pion at rest. Together, low-energy soft scattering and high-energy hard scattering studies play crucial complementary roles in testing the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) framework. A short description is presented of Primakoff's scientific career and personal life. Here, we focus on a review of Primakoff Scattering studies of pion polarizability and the {\gamma}-&gt;{\pi}{\pi}{\pi} chiral anomaly at CERN COMPASS, and of the {\pi}0 lifetime at Jefferson Laboratory (Jlab). Following a brief review of Chiral Perturbation Theory (ChPT), we discuss the good agreement of the results of these studies with 2-flavor (u,d) ChPT predictions. We discuss why Primakoff studies at CERN AMBER for kaon polarizability and {\gamma}-&gt;{\pi}{\pi}{\eta} and {\gamma}-&gt;KK{\pi} chiral anomalies, and at Jlab for the {\pi}0 and {\eta} lifetimes, are important for validating the theoretical framework of 3-flavor (u,d,s) ChPT. The transition from 2-flavor to 3-flavor ChPT incorporates the strange quark, which is crucial for understanding the full dynamics of the light mesons (pions, kaons, and etas). By comparing 3-flavor ChPT predictions with data for kaons, {\pi}0 and {\eta}, it will be possible to assess how well the model captures the interplay of the additional flavor and the effects of strange quarks.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Transformers for Jet Tagging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03673</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03673v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) algorithms, particularly attention-based transformer models, have become indispensable for analyzing the vast data generated by particle physics experiments like ATLAS and CMS at the CERN LHC. Particle Transformer (ParT), a state-of-the-art model, leverages particle-level attention to improve jet-tagging tasks, which are critical for identifying particles resulting from proton collisions. This study focuses on interpreting ParT by analyzing attention heat maps and particle-pair correlations on the $\eta$-$\phi$ plane, revealing a binary attention pattern where each particle attends to at most one other particle. At the same time, we observe that ParT shows varying focus on important particles and subjets depending on decay, indicating that the model learns traditional jet substructure observables. These insights enhance our understanding of the model's internal workings and learning process, offering potential avenues for improving the efficiency of transformer architectures in future high-energy physics applications.</description>

      <title>Darkonia at Colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03677v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter may form bound states in a dark sector with an attractive force between two dark matter particles. Searches for dark matter at colliders can differ dramatically from routine searches if bound states, dubbed darkonia, are produced and decay into visible Standard-Model particles. In this work, we use three representative models with scalar, pseudo-scalar, and vector force carriers to map out the darkonium signatures at both high-energy and low-energy colliders. Some of the bound states can be stable due to generalized parity and charge-conjugation symmetries, while others decay into light dark-force carriers, which subsequently can decay at a displaced vertex. New signatures with a mix of missing energy and multiple di-lepton or di-jet vertices reconstructing intermediate darkonium resonances are within reach at the LHC and Belle II.</description>

      <title>Reconstruction of boosted and resolved multi-Higgs-boson events with symmetry-preserving attention networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.03819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The production of multiple Higgs bosons at the CERN LHC provides a direct way to measure the trilinear and quartic Higgs self-interaction strengths as well as potential access to beyond the standard model effects that can enhance production at large transverse momentum $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. The largest event fraction arises from the fully hadronic final state in which every Higgs boson decays to a bottom quark-antiquark pair ($b\bar{b}$). This introduces a combinatorial challenge known as the \emph{jet assignment problem}: assigning jets to sets representing Higgs boson candidates. Symmetry-preserving attention networks (SPA-Nets) have been been developed to address this challenge. However, the complexity of jet assignment increases when simultaneously considering both $H\rightarrow b\bar{b}$ reconstruction possibilities, i.e., two "resolved" small-radius jets each containing a shower initiated by a $b$-quark or one "boosted" large-radius jet containing a merged shower initiated by a $b\bar{b}$ pair. The latter improves the reconstruction efficiency at high $p_{\mathrm{T}}$. In this work, we introduce a generalization to the SPA-Net approach to simultaneously consider both boosted and resolved reconstruction possibilities and unambiguously interpret an event as "fully resolved'', "fully boosted", or in between. We report the performance of baseline methods, the original SPA-Net approach, and our generalized version on nonresonant $HH$ and $HHH$ production at the LHC. Considering both boosted and resolved topologies, our SPA-Net approach increases the Higgs boson reconstruction purity by 57--62\% and the efficiency by 23--38\% compared to the baseline method depending on the final state.</description>

      <title>Search for the non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs via gluon fusion and vector-boson fusion in the $b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ final state in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV with the ATLAS detector</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.12660v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for the non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs in the $HH\rightarrow b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ channel is performed using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $13$ TeV recorded by the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The analysis strategy is optimised to probe anomalous values of the Higgs boson self-coupling modifier $\kappa_\lambda$ and of the quartic $HHVV$ ($V = W,Z$) coupling modifier $\kappa_{2V}$. No significant excess above the expected background from Standard Model processes is observed. An observed (expected) upper limit $\mu_{HH}&lt;5.9$ $(3.3)$ is set at 95% confidence-level on the Higgs boson pair production cross-section normalised to its Standard Model prediction. The coupling modifiers are constrained to an observed (expected) 95% confidence interval of $-3.1 &lt; \kappa_\lambda &lt; 9.0$ ($-2.5 &lt; \kappa_\lambda &lt; 9.3$) and $-0.5 &lt; \kappa_{2V} &lt; 2.7$ ($-0.2 &lt; \kappa_{2V} &lt; 2.4$), assuming all other Higgs boson couplings are fixed to the Standard Model prediction. The results are also interpreted in the context of effective field theories via constraints on anomalous Higgs boson couplings and Higgs boson pair production cross-sections assuming different kinematic benchmark scenarios.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.20926v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A search for a hypothetical heavy scalar particle, $X$, decaying into a singlet scalar particle, $S$, and a Standard Model Higgs boson, $H$, using 140 fb$^{-1}$ of proton-proton collision data at the centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV recorded with the ATLAS detector at the LHC is presented. The explored mass range is $300 \leq m_X \leq 1000$ GeV and $170 \leq m_S \leq 500$ GeV. The signature of this search is one or two leptons ($e$ or $\mu$) from the decay of vector bosons originating from the $S$ particle, $S \rightarrow W^{\pm}W^{\mp}/ZZ$, and two photons from the Higgs boson decay, $H\rightarrow \gamma\gamma$. No significant excess is observed above the expected Standard Model background. The observed (expected) upper limits at the 95% confidence level on the cross-section for $gg\rightarrow X\rightarrow SH$, assuming the same $S\rightarrow WW/ZZ$ branching ratios as for a SM-like heavy Higgs boson, are between 530 (800) fb and 120 (170) fb.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a search for exotic decays of the Higgs boson into a pair of new pseudoscalar particles, $H\rightarrow aa$, where one pseudoscalar decays into a $b$-quark pair and the other decays into a $\tau$-lepton pair, in the mass range $12\leq m_{a}\leq 60$ GeV. The analysis uses $pp$ collision data at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV collected with the ATLAS detector at the LHC, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 140 ${fb}^{-1}$. No significant excess above the Standard Model (SM) prediction is observed. Assuming the SM Higgs boson production cross-section, the search sets upper limits at 95% confidence level on the branching ratio of Higgs bosons decaying into $b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$, $\mathcal{B}(H \rightarrow aa \rightarrow b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-)$, between 2.2% and 3.9% depending on the pseudoscalar mass.</description>

      <title>Correlated Systematic Uncertainties and Errors-on-Errors in Measurement Combinations: Methodology and Application to the 7-8 TeV ATLAS-CMS Top Quark Mass Combination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05322v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Gamma Variance Model (GVM) is a statistical model that incorporates uncertainties in the assignment of systematic errors (informally called errors-on-errors). The model is of particular use in analyses that combine the results of several measurements. In the past, combinations have been carried out using two alternative approaches: the Best Linear Unbiased Estimator (BLUE) method or what we will call the nuisance-parameter method. In this paper we derive useful relations that allow one to connect the BLUE and nuisance-parameter methods when the correlations induced by systematic uncertainties are non-trivial (1, -1 or 0), and we generalise the nuisance-parameter approach to include errors-on-errors. We then illustrate some of the properties of the GVM by applying it to the 7-8 TeV ATLAS-CMS top quark mass combination. We present results by considering the largest systematic uncertainties as uncertain, one at a time, and we vary their associated error-on-error parameters. This procedure is useful for identifying the systematic uncertainties to which a combination is sensitive when they are themselves uncertain. We also explore the hypothetical scenario of including an outlier in the combination, which could become relevant for future combinations, by artificially adding a fictitious measurement to it. This example highlights a key feature of the GVM: its sensitivity to the internal consistency of the input data.</description>

      <title>Extracting Signal Electron Trajectories in the COMET Phase-I Cylindrical Drift Chamber Using Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04795v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a pioneering approach to tracking analysis within the COMET Phase-I experiment, which aims to search for the charged lepton flavor violating $\mu\to e$ conversion process in a muonic atom, at J-PARC, Japan. This paper specifically introduces the extraction of signal electron trajectories in the COMET Phase-I cylindrical drift chamber (CDC) amidst a high background hit rate, with more than $40\,\%$ occupancy of the total CDC cells, utilizing deep learning techniques of semantic segmentation. Our model achieved remarkable results, with a purity rate of $98\,\%$ and a retention rate of $90\,\%$ for CDC cells with signal hits, surpassing the design-goal performance of $90\,\%$ for both metrics. This study marks the initial application of deep learning to COMET tracking, paving the way for more advanced techniques in future research.</description>

      <title>Toward discovering the excited $\Omega$ baryons through nonleptonic weak decays of $\Omega_c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.04458v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The nonleptonic weak decay processes $\Omega_c \to \Omega\pi^+/\Omega(1P)\pi^+/\Omega(1D)\pi^+/\Omega(2S)\pi^+$ are studied using the constituent quark model. The branching fraction of $\Omega_c \to \Omega\pi^+$ is predicted to be $1.0\%$. Considering the newly observed $\Omega(2012)$ resonance as a conventional $1P$-wave $\Omega$ excite state with spin-parity $J^P=3/2^-$, the newly measured ratio $\mathcal{B}[\Omega_c\to \Omega(2012)\pi^+ \to (\Xi\bar{K})^-\pi^+ ]/\mathcal{B}[\Omega_c\to \Omega \pi^+]$ at Belle can be well understood. Besides, the production rates for the missing $1P-$wave state $\Omega (1^2P_{1/2^-})$, two spin quartet $1D-$wave states $\Omega (1^4D_{1/2^+})$ and $\Omega (1^4D_{3/2^+})$, and two $2S$-wave states $\Omega(2^2S_{1/2^+})$ and $\Omega(2^4S_{3/2^+})$ are also investigated. It is expected that these missing excited $\Omega$ baryons should have large potentials to be discovered through the nonleptonic weak decays of $\Omega_c$ in forthcoming experiments by Belle II and/or LHCb.</description>

      <title>In-medium mass shift of two-flavored heavy mesons, $B_c$, $B^*_c$, $B_s$, $B^*_s$, $D_s$ and $D^*_s$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.00250v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For the first time, we estimate the in-medium mass shift of the two-flavored heavy mesons $B_c, B_c^*, B_s, B_s^*, D_s$ and $D_s^*$ in symmetric nuclear matter. The estimates are made by evaluating the lowest order one-loop self-energies. The enhanced excitations of intermediate state heavy-light mesons in symmetric nuclear matter are the origin of their negative mass shift. This negative mass shift may be regarded as a signature of partial restoration of chiral symmetry in an empirical sense because the origin of the negative mass shift in the study is not directly related to the chiral symmetry mechanism. Our results show that the magnitude of the mass shift for the $B_c$ meson ($\bar{b} c$ or $b \bar{c}$) is larger than those of the $\eta_c (\bar{c} c)$ and $\eta_b (\bar{b} b)$, different from a naive expectation that it would be in between them. While, that of the $B_c^*$ shows the in between of the $J/\psi$ and $\Upsilon$. We observe that the lighter vector meson excitation in each meson self-energy gives a dominant contribution for the corresponding meson mass shift, $B_c, B_s,$ and $D_s$.</description>

      <title>Collective excitations and low-energy ionization signatures of relativistic particles in silicon detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.00123v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solid-state detectors with a low energy threshold have several applications, including searches of non-relativistic halo dark-matter particles with sub-GeV masses. When searching for relativistic, beyond-the-Standard-Model particles with enhanced cross sections for small energy transfers, a small detector with a low energy threshold may have better sensitivity than a larger detector with a higher energy threshold. In this paper, we calculate the low-energy ionization spectrum from high-velocity particles scattering in a dielectric material. We consider the full material response including the excitation of bulk plasmons. We generalize the energy-loss function to relativistic kinematics, and benchmark existing tools used for halo dark-matter scattering against electron energy-loss spectroscopy data. Compared to calculations commonly used in the literature, such as the Photo-Absorption-Ionization model or the free-electron model, including collective effects shifts the recoil ionization spectrum towards higher energies, typically peaking around 4--6 electron-hole pairs. We apply our results to the three benchmark examples: millicharged particles produced in a beam, neutrinos with a magnetic dipole moment produced in a reactor, and upscattered dark-matter particles. Our results show that the proper inclusion of collective effects typically enhances a detector's sensitivity to these particles, since detector backgrounds, such as dark counts, peak at lower energies.</description>

      <title>Rewording Theoretical Predictions at Colliders with Vacuum Amplitudes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05491v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose multiloop vacuum amplitudes as the optimal building blocks for efficiently assembling theoretical predictions at high-energy colliders. This hypothesis is strongly supported by the manifestly causal properties of the loop-tree duality (LTD) representation of a vacuum amplitude. The vacuum amplitude, acting as a kernel, encodes all the final states contributing to a given scattering or decay process through residues in the on-shell energies of the internal propagators. It also naturally implements gauge invariance and the wave function renormalisation of the external legs. This methodological approach, dubbed LTD causal unitary, leads to a novel representation of differential cross sections and decay rates that is locally free of ultraviolet and infrared singularities at all orders in perturbation theory. Threshold singularities also match between different phase-space residues. Most notably, it allows us to conjecture for the first time the local functional form of initial-state collinear singularities. The fulfillment of all these properties provides a theoretical description of differential observables at colliders that is well defined in the four physical dimensions of the space-time.</description>

      <title>Cutting the Scotogenic loop: Adding flavor to Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.00188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.00188v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a framework for hybrid neutrino mass generation, wherein scotogenic dark sector particles, including dark matter, are charged non-trivially under the $A_4$ flavor symmetry. The spontaneous breaking of the $A_4$ group to residual $\mathcal{Z}_2$ subgroup results in the ``cutting" of the radiative loop. As a consequence the neutrinos acquire mass through the hybrid ``scoto-seesaw" mass mechanism, combining aspects of both the tree-level seesaw and one-loop scotogenic mechanisms, with the residual $\mathcal{Z}_2$ subgroup ensuring the stability of the dark matter. The flavor symmetry also leads to several predictions including the normal ordering of neutrino masses and ``generalized $\mu-\tau$ reflection symmetry" in leptonic mixing. Additionally, it gives testable predictions for neutrinoless double beta decay and a lower limit on the lightest neutrino mass. Finally, $A_4 \to \mathcal{Z}_2$ breaking also leaves its imprint on the dark sector and ties it with the neutrino masses and mixing. The model allows only scalar dark matter, whose mass has a theoretical upper limit of $\lesssim$ 600 GeV, with viable parameter space satisfying all dark matter constraints, available only up to about 80 GeV. Conversely, fermionic dark matter is excluded due to constraints from the neutrino sector. Various aspects of this highly predictive framework can be tested in both current and upcoming neutrino and dark matter experiments.</description>

      <title>Probing gluonic saturation in deeply virtual meson production beyond leading power</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18203v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exclusive diffractive meson production represents a golden channel for investigating gluonic saturation inside nucleons and nuclei. In this letter, we settle a systematic framework to deal with beyond leading power corrections at small-$x$, including the saturation regime, and obtain the $\gamma^{*} \rightarrow M (\rho, \phi, \omega)$ impact factor with both incoming photon and outgoing meson carrying arbitrary polarizations. This is of particular interest since the saturation scale at modern colliders, although entering a perturbative regime, is not large enough to prevents higher-twist effects to be sizable.</description>

      <title>Construction of Isoscalar $2^{-+}$ Mesonic States Inspired by the $X(2600)$ Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05908v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The BESIII observation of the $X(2600)$ suggests that one possible assignment for its spin-parity quantum numbers is $J^{PC}=2^{-+}$. This finding motivates us to systematically revisit isoscalar pseudotensor mesonic states through a comprehensive spectroscopic study. In this work, we employ a potential model to calculate the mass spectrum of isoscalar pseudotensor meson states with varying radial quantum numbers. Additionally, we analyze their strong decay behaviors, as allowed by the Okubo-Zweig-Iizuka (OZI) rule, using the quark pair creation model. Our findings yield valuable information about their resonant parameters and partial decay widths, which can aid in identifying the observed isoscalar pseudotensor states when combined with current experimental data. Importantly, we also predict several radial excitations of isoscalar pseudotensor mesons that remain unobserved experimentally. Furthermore, we exclude the $X(2600)$ from being classified as an isoscalar pseudotensor meson, which is critical for elucidating the properties of the $X(2600)$.</description>

      <title>Probing Type-I 2HDM light Higgs in the top-pair-associated diphoton channel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.13636v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the Type-I Two-Higgs-Doublet Model (2HDM-I) as a potential explanation for the 95 GeV diphoton excess reported at the LHC and evaluate the feasibility of discovering a 95 GeV Higgs boson at future hadron colliders. By analyzing the dependence of Higgs boson couplings and decay branching ratios on model parameters, we identify regions of parameter space that are consistent with current theoretical and experimental constraints. Our analysis indicates that direct Higgs search data place stringent constraints on the Higgs-mixing angle parameter $\alpha$, excluding samples within the range $-0.9 \lesssim \alpha \lesssim 1.3$. Subsequent collider simulations focus on the $pp \to t(\to W^+b)\bar{t}(\to W^-\bar{b})h(\to \gamma\gamma)$ process and its relevant backgrounds. These simulations reveal that at the 14 TeV High-Luminosity LHC (HL-LHC), statistical significances of $2\sigma$ and $5\sigma$ can be achieved at integrated luminosities of 137 fb$^{-1}$ and 859 fb$^{-1}$, respectively. Comparable statistical significance can be achieved more efficiently at the 27 TeV High-Energy LHC (HE-LHC) with integrated luminosities of $L=69 \text{fb}^{-1}$ and $L=430\ \text{fb}^{-1}$, and at the 100 TeV Future Circular Collider (FCC-hh) with $L=6.8\ \text{fb}^{-1}$ and $L=42\ \text{fb}^{-1}$. However, achieving comprehensive coverage of the parameters with $\alpha + \beta\approx 0$ at the $2\sigma$ level via the diphoton channel remains challenging, even with higher collision energies or increased integrated luminosities.</description>
