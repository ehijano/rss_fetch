      <title>Free-falling motion of an elastic rigid rod towards a Schwarzschild black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the motion of an elastic rigid rod which is radially free-falling towards a Schwarzschild black hole. This is accomplished by reducing the corresponding free-boundary PDE problem to a sequence of ODEs, which we integrate numerically. Starting with a rod at rest, we show that it is possible to choose its initial compression profile so that its midpoint falls substantially faster, or slower, than a free-falling particle with the same initial conditions. This seems to be a purely kinematic effect, since on average there is no net transfer of elastic to mechanical energy.</description>

      <title>Primordial black holes captured by neutron stars: relativistic point-mass treatment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs), if they exist, may collide with and be captured by neutron stars. We adopt a relativistic point-mass approximation to study this capture, the subsequent confinement of the PBH of mass $m$ inside the neutron star of mass $M_* \gg m$, and the PBH's growth by accretion of stellar material. Building on earlier treatments we systematically study the capture, confinement, and accretion process, characterize the emitted quasiperiodic continuous gravitational-wave signal, track the evolution of the PBH's orbital parameters, and compare the effects of different choices for the prescription of the dissipative forces. Our point-mass treatment here is applicable in the limit of small PBH masses, for which its effects on the neutron star can be ignored.</description>

      <title>Self-interactions can (also) destabilize bosonic stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08740v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the dynamical stability of Proca-Higgs stars, in spherical symmetry. These are solutions of the Einstein-Proca-Higgs model, which features a Higgs-like field coupled to a Proca field, both of which minimally coupled to the gravitational field. The corresponding stars can be regarded as Proca stars with self-interactions, while avoiding the hyperbolicity issues of self-interacting Einstein-Proca models. We report that these configurations are stable near the Proca limit in the candidate stable branches, but exhibit instabilities in certain parts of the parameter space, even in the candidate stable branches, regaining their stability for very strong self-interactions. This shows that for these models, unlike various examples of scalar boson stars, self-interactions can deteriorate, rather than improve, the dynamical robustness of bosonic stars.</description>

      <title>KG- oscillators in a spinning cosmic string spacetime and an external magnetic field</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the Klein-Gordon (KG) oscillators in a spinning cosmic string spacetime and an external magnetic field. The corresponding KG-equation is shown to admit a solution in the form of the confluent hypergeometric functions/polynomials. Consequently, the corresponding energies are shown to be given in a quadratic equation of a delicate nature that has to be solved in an orderly manner (for it involves the energies for KG-particles/antiparticles, $E=E_{\pm}=\pm\left\vert E\right\vert $ along with the magnetic quantum number $m=m_{\pm }=\pm |m|$). Following a case-by-case strategy allowed us to clearly observe the effects of the spinning cosmic string on the spectroscopic structure of the KG-oscillators. We have observed that, under some parametric settings, whilst the Landau-like energies of the KG-particles ($E=E_{+}$), with $m=m_{+}$, have no explicit dependence on the spinning string parameter or wedge parameter $\alpha$, the KG-antiparticles ($E=E_{-}$), with $m=m_{-}$, have such explicit dependence. Interestingly, the co-existence of a spinning cosmic string and external magnetic field eliminates the effect of the wedge parameter ( a byproduct of the string) for KG-particles ($E=E_{+}$), with $m=m_{+}$, but not for the KG-antiparticles ($E=E_{-}$), with $m=m_{-}$. Such co-existence is observed to break the symmetry of the energies of the KG-particles and antiparticles about $E=0$ for KG-oscillators. However, for KG-particles ($E=E_{+}$), with $m=m_{-}$, and KG-antiparticles ($E=E_{-}$), with $m=m_{+}$, are observed to be unfortunate for being indeterminable. Moreover, for the spinning parameter $\beta &gt;&gt;1$, clustering of the energy levels is observed eminent to indicate that there is no distinction between energy levels at such values of $\beta $.</description>

      <title>Inhomogeneous brane models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intrinsic Conformal Symmetries have emerged as a tool for developing viable and physically coherent models, particularly in scenarios incorporating a negative cosmological constant. This study demonstrates that when the bulk geometry accommodates a set of $10$ Intrinsic Conformal Symmetries, which operate on three-dimensional hypersurfaces (be they spacelike or timelike), it leads to the existence of two distinct families of five-dimensional spacetimes. These spacetimes represent the general solutions to the bulk field equations. An aspect of these models is the composition of their energy-momentum tensor, which includes two key components: a negative cosmological constant and a parallel pressure $p_{\parallel}$ aligned with the extra spatial dimension. This framework can be perceived as a $5D$ extension of the recently identified Spatially Inhomogeneous and Irrotational spacetimes. Significantly, these models offer a novel perspective for investigating the impacts of spatial inhomogeneity on the cosmological evolution of the Universe, particularly within the context of the Randall-Sundrum theory. This exploration is essential for deepening our understanding of the role of higher dimensions in cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Status of Electromagnetic Accelerating Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To describe the dark side of the Universe, we adopt a novel approach where dark energy is explained as an electrically charged majority of dark matter. Dark energy, as such, does not exist. The Friedmann equation at the present time coincides with that in a conventional approach, although the cosmological "constant" in the Electromagnetic Accelerating Universe (EAU) Model shares a time dependence with the matter component. Its equation of state is $\omega \equiv P/\rho \equiv -1$ within observational accuracy.</description>

      <title>Quantum deformed phantom dynamics in light of the generalized uncertainty principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09049v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum gravity has been baffling the theoretical physicist for decades now: both for its mathematical obscurity and phenomenological testing. Nevertheless, the new era of precision cosmology presents a promising avenue to test the effects of quantum gravity. In this study, we consider a bottom-up approach. Without resorting to any candidate quantum gravity, we invoke a generalized uncertainty principle (GUP) directly into the cosmological Hamiltonian for a universe sourced by a phantom scalar field with potential to study the early epoch of the evolution. This is followed by a systematic analysis of the dynamics, both qualitatively and quantitatively. Our qualitative analysis shows that the introduction of GUP significantly alters the existence of fixed points for the potential considered in this contribution. In addition, we confirm the existence of an inflationary epoch and analyze the behavior of relevant cosmological parameters with respect to the strength of GUP distortion.</description>

      <title>Dymnikova black hole from an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, in [arXiv:2403.04827], it was demonstrated that various regular black hole metrics can be derived within a theory featuring an infinite number of higher curvature corrections to General Relativity. Moreover, truncating this infinite series at the first few orders already yields a reliable approximation of the observable characteristics of such black holes [arXiv:2403.07848]. Here, we further establish the existence of another regular black hole solution, particularly the $D$-dimensional extension of the Dymnikova black hole, within the equations of motion incorporating an infinite tower of higher-curvature corrections. This solution is essentially nonperturbative in the coupling parameter, rendering the action, if it exists, incapable of being approximated by a finite number of powers of the curvature.</description>

      <title>Power law coupling Higgs-Palatini inflation with a congruence between physical and geometrical symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09107v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we investigate a power law coupling Higgs inflationary model in which the background geometry is determined by the Palatini's variational principle. The geometrical symmetries of the background geometry determine the invariant form of the action of the model and the background geometry resulted is of the Weyl-integrable type. The invariant action results also invariant under the $U(1)$ group, which in general is not compatible with the Weyl group of invariance of the background geometry. However, we found compatibility conditions between the geometrical and physical symmetries of the action in the strong coupling limit. We found that if we start with a non-minimally coupled to gravity action, when we impose the congruence between the both groups of symmetries we end with an invariant action of the scalar-tensor type. We obtain a nearly scale invariant power spectrum for the inflaton fluctuations for certain values of some parameters of the model. Also we obtain va\-lues for the tensor to scalar ratio in agreement with PLANCK and BICEP observational data: $r&lt;0.032$.</description>

      <title>The Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna: Mission Studies and Science Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09181v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lunar Gravitational-wave Antenna (LGWA) is a proposed array of next-generation inertial sensors to monitor the response of the Moon to gravitational waves (GWs). Given the size of the Moon and the expected noise produced by the lunar seismic background, the LGWA would be able to observe GWs from about 1 mHz to 1 Hz. This would make the LGWA the missing link between space-borne detectors like LISA with peak sensitivities around a few millihertz and proposed future terrestrial detectors like Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer. In this article, we provide a first comprehensive analysis of the LGWA science case including its multi-messenger aspects and lunar science with LGWA data. We also describe the scientific analyses of the Moon required to plan the LGWA mission.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09274</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09274v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript we examine the Unruh-thermalized CERN-NA63 radiation reaction data set from the point of view of a diphoton Rindler bath. Under the assumption that these Hawking-Unruh diphoton pairs are microscopic trans-Planckian black holes, we find the resultant heat capacity describes the measured energy spectrum and is thus a dual description of the data set. Then, employing an n-dimensional Stefan-Boltzmann analysis, we find the power radiated by a black hole in the standard 3+1 spacetime dimensions in complete agreement with the data. Finally, we utilize this power spectrum to directly measure Newtons constant of gravitation.</description>

      <title>Upper Bound of Barrow Entropy Index from Black Hole Fragmentation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Both classical and quantum arguments suggest that if Barrow entropy is correct, its index $\delta$ must be energy dependent, which would affect the very early universe. Based on thermodynamic stability that sufficiently large black holes should not fragment, we argue that Barrow entropy correction must be small except possibly at the Planckian regime. Furthermore, the fact that a solar mass black hole does not fragment implies an upper bound $\delta \lesssim O(10^{-3})$, which surprisingly lies in the same range as the bound obtained from some cosmological considerations assuming fixed $\delta$. This indicates that allowing $\delta$ to run does not raise its allowed value. We briefly comment on the case of Kaniadakis entropy.</description>

      <title>pp-waves in conformal Killing gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently Harada has proposed a gravitational theory which is of third order in the derivatives of the metric tensor. This has attracted some attention particularly as it predicts a late-time transition from cosmological decelaration to accelerated expansion without assuming the presence of dark energy or a non-zero cosmological constant. This theory has been dubbed conformal Killing gravity by Mantica &amp; Molinari.
  The most general exact solutions of the Harada field equations are known for a number of important physical situations: homogeneous and isotropic cosmological models, static spherically symmetric vacuum and electrovac spacetimes. These are analogues of the well-known FRWL, Schwarzschild and Reissner-Nordstr\"om metrics of General Relativity(GR). In this study the pp-waves in Harada's theory are studied and the most general exact solution is obtained together with its specialisation for plane waves. The generalisation from GR to Harada's theory turns out to be straightforward and the solutions only involve an extra non-propagating term. The solutions have Petrov type N (or 0) and the Ricci tensor is either zero or the Segr\'e type is [(211)] with zero eigenvalue.
  For any metric in conformal Killing gravity it is shown that more than one possible matter source can generate the solution. If the metric admits one or more Killing vectors, the ambiguity in the possible matter sources increases.</description>

      <title>Late time decay of scalar and Dirac fields around an asymptotically de Sitter black hole in the Euler-Heisenberg electrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the quasinormal modes of massive scalar and Dirac fields within the framework of asymptotically de Sitter black holes in Euler-Heisenberg non-linear electrodynamics. We pay particular attention to the regime $\mu M/m_{P}^2 \gg 1$, where $\mu$ and $M$ denote the masses of the field and the black hole, respectively, and $m_{P}$ represents the Planck mass, covering a range from primordial to large astrophysical black holes. Through time-domain integration, we demonstrate that, contrary to the asymptotically flat case, the quasinormal modes also dictate the asymptotic decay of fields. Employing the 6th order WKB formula, we derive a precise analytic approximation for quasinormal modes in the regime $\mu M/m_{P}^2 \gg 1$ without resorting to expansion in terms of the inverse multipole number. This analytic expression takes on a concise form in the limit of linear electrodynamics, represented by the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes.</description>

      <title>Classical double copy in the black hole mini-superspace</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a novel formulation of classical double copy in the mini-superspace of static, spherically symmetric black holes where the map between the solutions of general relativity and Maxwell's theory can be realized in Boyer-Lindsquit coordinates. By employing the reduced action principle, we show that the double copy structure can be generalized to Lovelock gravities and quasi-topological gravities. However, the gravitational solutions are mapped to the purely electric solutions of Maxwell's theory: instead of a direct match between the Kerr-Schild scalar in the gravity side and the scalar potential in the gauge theory side, the scalar potential becomes a polynomial in the Kerr-Schild scalar, giving rise to a generalization of the Kerr-Schild double copy. We calculate the Regge-Teitelboim surface charges and prove that the mass of the black hole solution is identified with the electric charge corresponding to the Coulomb part of the gauge theory solution in the same way it does in the case of general relativity.</description>

      <title>Linear stability of vector Horndeski black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Horndeski's vector-tensor (HVT) gravity is described by a Lagrangian in which the field strength $F_{\mu \nu}=\partial_{\mu} A_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu} A_{\mu}$ of a vector field $A_{\mu}$ interacts with a double dual Riemann tensor $L^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta}$ in the form $\beta L^{\mu \nu \alpha \beta} F_{\mu \nu} F_{\alpha \beta}$, where $\beta$ is a constant. In Einstein-Maxwell-HVT theory, there are static and spherically symmetric black hole (BH) solutions with electric or magnetic charges, whose metric components are modified from those in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om geometry. The electric-magnetic duality of solutions is broken even at the background level by the nonvanishing coupling constant $\beta$. We compute a second-order action of BH perturbations containing both the odd- and even-parity modes and show that there are four dynamical perturbations arising from the gravitational and vector-field sectors. We derive all the linear stability conditions associated with the absence of ghosts and radial/angular Laplacian instabilities for both the electric and magnetic BHs. These conditions exhibit the difference between the electrically and magnetically charged cases by reflecting the breaking of electric-magnetic duality at the level of perturbations. In particular, the four angular propagation speeds in the large-multipole limit are different from each other for both the electric and magnetic BHs. This suggests the breaking of eikonal correspondence between the peak position of at least one of the potentials of dynamical perturbations and the radius of photon sphere. For the electrically and magnetically charged cases, we elucidate parameter spaces of the HVT coupling and the BH charge in which the BHs without naked singularities are linearly stable.</description>

      <title>The final burst of the moving mirror is unrelated to the partner mode of analog Hawking radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flying mirrors with appropriate trajectories have been recognized as an analog system that mimics black hole Hawking evaporation and have been widely investigated. It has recently been suggested that the partner mode of the analog Hawking radiation emitted from a moving mirror would manifest itself through a final burst when the mirror executes a sudden stop. Here we argue the opposite via the partner formula for the moving mirror model. By expanding the theoretical foundation of the partner formula and augmenting it with numerical analysis, we demonstrate that the supposed final burst is induced by a shock that requires the input of external energy, whereas the Hawking radiation partner mode, which is associated with the zero-point vacuum fluctuations, is not responsible for the burst.</description>

      <title>Parametrized Black Hole Quasinormal Ringdown Formalism for Higher Overtones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the parametrized black hole quasinormal ringdown formalism, which is a robust framework used to analyze quasinormal modes in systems that closely resemble general relativity, paying particular attention to the higher overtones. We find that larger deviations from the general relativity case typically appear in the quasinormal frequencies for the higher overtones. This growing tendency for higher overtones can be understood using an analytical method, and its relations to previous works are briefly discussed. Our findings indicate that we can impose a strong constraint on gravity theories by considering the overtones of quasinormal modes.</description>

      <title>Myrzakulov $F(T,Q)$ gravity: cosmological implications and constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate some exact cosmological models in Myrzakulov $F(T,Q)$ gravity or the Myrzakulov gravity-III (MG-III) proposed in [arXiv:1205.5266], with observational constraints. The MG-III gravity is some kind of unification of two known gravity theories, namely, the $F(T)$ gravity and the $F(Q)$ gravity. The field equations of the MG-III theory are obtained by regarding the metric tensor and the general affine connection as independent variables. We then focus on the particular case in which the $F(T,Q)$ function characterizing the aforementioned metric-affine models is linear that is $F(T,Q)=\lambda T+\mu Q$. We investigate this linear case and consider a Friedmann-Lema\^{i}tre-Robertson-Walker background to study cosmological aspects and applications. We have obtained three exact solutions of the modified field equations in different cases $T$ and $Q$, in the form of Hubble function $H(t)$ and scale factor $a(t)$ and placed observational constraints on it through the Hubble $H(z)$ datasets on it using the MCMC analysis. We have investigated the deceleration parameter $q(z)$, effective EoS parameters and a comparative study of all three models with $\Lambda$CDM model has been carried out.</description>

      <title>Constraints on graviton mass from Schwarzschild precession in the orbits of S-stars around the Galactic Center</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we use a modification of the Newtonian gravitational potential with a non-linear Yukawa-like correction, as it was proposed by C. Will earlier to obtain new bounds on graviton mass from the observed orbits of S-stars around the Galactic Center (GC). This phenomenological potential differs from the gravitational potential obtained in the weak field limit of Yukawa gravity, which we used in our previous studies. We also assumed that the orbital precession of S-stars is close to the prediction of General Relativity (GR) for Schwarzschild precession, but with a possible small discrepancy from it. This assumption is motivated by the fact that the GRAVITY Collaboration in 2020 and in 2022 detected Schwarzschild precession in the S2 star orbit around the Supermassive Black Hole (SMBH) at the GC. Using this approach, we were able to constrain parameter $\lambda$ of the potential and, assuming that it represents the graviton Compton wavelength, we also found the corresponding upper bound of graviton mass. The obtained results were then compared with our previous estimates, as well as with the estimates of other authors.</description>

      <title>Measuring a gravitomagentic effect with the triple pulsar PSR J0337+1715</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To the first post--Newtonian order, the orbital angular momentum of the fast--revolving inner binary of the triple system PSR J0337+1715, made of a millisecond pulsar and a white dwarf, induces an annular gravitomagnetic field which displaces the line of apsides of the slower orbit of the other, distant white dwarf by $-1.2$ milliarcseconds per year. The current accuracy in determining the periastron of the outer orbit is $63.9$ milliarcseconds after 1.38 years of data collection. By hypothesizing a constant rate of measurement of the pulsar's times of arrivals over the next 10 years, assumed equal to the present one, it can be argued that the periastron will be finally known to a $\simeq 0.15$ milliarcseconds level, while its cumulative gravitomagnetic retrograde shift will be as large as $-12$ milliarcseconds. The competing post--Newtonian gravitolectric periastron advance due to the inner binary's masses, nominally amounting to $74.3$ milliarcseconds per year, can be presently modelled to an accuracy level as good as $\simeq 0.04$ milliarcseconds per year. The mismodelling in the much larger Newtonian periastron rate due to the quadrupolar term of the multipolar expansion of the gravitational potential of a massive ring, whose nominal size for PSR J0337+1715 is $0.17$ degrees per year, might be reduced down to the $\simeq 0.5$ milliarcseconds per year level over the next 10 years. Thus, a first measurement of such a novel form of gravitomagnetism, although challenging, may be somehow feasible in a not too distant future.</description>

Abstract: We revise the work of Scholtz, Flandera and G\"urlebeck [Kerr-Newman black hole in the formalism of isolated horizons, Phys. Rev. D 96, 064024 (2017)]. We cast the Kerr metric explicitly in the form suitable for the framework of isolated horizons. We proceed in a geometrical fashion and are capable to provide the results in a compact closed manner, without any unevaluated integrals. We also discuss the uniqueness and drawbacks of this construction. We suggest a new vector field to generate the null geodesic foliation.</description>

      <title>The generalized second law in Euclidean Schwarzschild black hole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discuss the Bekenstein generalized entropy of Schwarzschild black hole, with the contribution of an external matter field affected by degrees of freedom inside the event horizon. To take into accountthis effect to the generalized entropy, we use Euclidean functional methods. In the Euclidean section of the Schwarzschild manifold, we consider an Euclidean quantum effective model, a scalar theory in the presence of an additive quenched disorder. The average the Gibbs free energy over the ensemble of possible configurations of the disorder is obtained by the distributional zeta-function method. In the series representation for the average free energy with respective effective actions emerges the generalized Schr\"{o}dinger operators on Riemannian manifolds. Finally, is presented the generalized entropy density with the contributions of the black hole geometric entropy and the external matter fields affected by the internal degrees of freedom. The validity of the generalized second law using Euclidean functional methods is obtained.</description>

      <title>Black Hole - Neutron Star Binary Mergers: The Impact of Stellar Compactness</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09924v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent gravitational wave observations include possible detections of black hole - neutron star binary mergers. As with binary black hole mergers, numerical simulations help characterize the sources. For binary systems with neutron star components, the simulations help to predict the imprint of tidal deformations and disruptions on the gravitational wave signals. In a previous study, we investigated how the mass of the black hole has an impact on the disruption of the neutron star and, as a consequence, on the shape of the gravitational waves emitted. We extend these results to study the effects of varying the compactness of the neutron star. We consider neutron star compactness in the 0.123 to 0.2 range for binaries with mass ratios of 3 and 5. As the compactness and the mass ratio increase, the binary system behaves during the late inspiral and merger more like a black hole binary. For the case with the highest mass ratio and most compact neutron star, the gravitational waves emitted, in terms of mismatches, are almost indistinguishable from those by a binary black hole. The disruption of the star significantly suppresses the kicks on the final black hole. The disruption also affects, although not dramatically, the spin of the final black hole. Lastly, for neutron stars with low compactness, the quasi-normal ringing of the black hole after the merger does not show a clean quasi-normal ringing because of the late accretion of debris from the neutron star.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09936v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the propagation of a scalar field in a $(2+1)$-dimensional accelerated black hole, recently revisited in \cite{Arenas_Henriquez_2022}. We briefly describe the minimally-coupled configuration as rendering a trivial scalar perturbation with a rescale of the field mass. On the contrary, the free scalar field propagation presents an intricate dynamic, whose equation may be reduced through the use of Israel junction conditions and a non-trivial ansatz. In this case, using two different methods we calculate the quasinormal modes of the solution also obtaining unstable field profiles delivered by the linear scalar perturbation to the background geometry. We scrutinize the parameter space of angular eigenvalue of the field and accelerations under which such instabilities happen.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08056v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The latest results on baryon acoustic oscillations from DESI (Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument), when combined with cosmic microwave background and supernova data, show indications of a deviation from a cosmological constant in favour of evolving dark energy. Use of a pivot scale for the equation of state $w$ shows that this evidence is concentrated in the derivative of $w$ rather than its mean offset from -1, indicating a new cosmic coincidence where the mean equation of state matches that of the $\Lambda$CDM model precisely in the region probed by the observations. We argue that conclusions on dark energy evolution are strongly driven by the assumed parameter priors and that this coincidence, which we are naming the PhantomX coincidence (where X stands for crossing), may be a signature of an inappropriate choice of priors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08697v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: By using gamma-ray burst (GRB) data to simultaneously constrain Amati correlation parameters and cosmological parameters in six spatially-flat and nonflat dark energy cosmological models, we show that an updated 220 GRB version of the Jia et al. [Mon. Not. R. Astron. Soc. 516, 2575 (2022)] GRB data compilation are standardizable through the Amati correlation and so can be used for cosmological analyses. However, the resulting GRB data constraints on the current value of the nonrelativistic matter density parameter, $\Omega_{m0}$, are in $&gt;2\sigma$ tension with those from a joint analysis of better-established Hubble parameter [$H(z)$] and baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) data for most of the cosmological models we consider, indicating that these GRB data cannot be jointly used with better-established $H(z)$ + BAO data to constrain cosmological parameters.</description>

Abstract: This paper is the second part of a series that develops the mathematical framework necessary for studying field theories on ``T-Minkowski'' noncommutative spacetimes. These spacetimes constitute a class of noncommutative geometries, introduced in Part I, that are each invariant under distinct quantum group deformations of the Poincar\'e group. All these noncommutative geometries possess certain physically desirable characteristics, which allow me to develop all the tools of differential geometry and functional analysis, that are necessary in order to build consistent and T-Poincar\'e invariant noncommutative classical field theories.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter Mounds: towards a realistic description of dark matter overdensities around black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08731</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08731v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dark matter overdensities around black holes can be searched for by looking at the characteristic imprint they leave on the gravitational waveform of binary black hole mergers. Current theoretical predictions of the density profile of dark matter overdensities are based on highly idealised formation scenarios, in which black holes are assumed to grow adiabatically from an infinitesimal seed to their final mass, compressing dark matter cusps at the center of galactic halos into very dense `spikes'. These scenarios were suitable for dark matter indirect detection studies, since annihilating dark matter cannot reach very high densities, but they fail to capture the dark matter distribution in the innermost regions where the gravitational wave signal is produced. We present here a more realistic formation scenario where black holes form from the collapse of supermassive stars, and follow the evolution of the dark matter density as the supermassive star grows and collapses to a black hole. We show that in this case dark matter forms shallower `mounds', instead of `spikes', on scales comparable with the size of the supermassive stars originating them. We discuss the implications for the detectability of these systems.</description>

      <title>Nonlinearly charging the conformally dressed black holes preserving duality and conformal invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We start this paper by concisely rederiving ModMax, which is nothing but the unique nonlinear extension of Maxwell's equations preserving conformal and duality invariance. The merit of this new derivation is its transparency and simplicity since it is based on an approach where the elusive duality invariance is manifest. In the second part, we couple the ModMax electrodynamics to Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant together with a standard conformal scalar field, and new stationary spacetimes with dyonic charges are found. These solutions are later used as seed configurations to generate nonlinearly charged (super-)renormalizably dressed spacetimes by means of a known generating method that we extend to include any nonlinear conformal electrodynamics. We end by addressing the issue of how to generalize some of these results to include the recently studied non-Noetherian conformal scalar fields, whose equation of motion still enjoys conformal symmetry even though its action does not. It results that the static non-Noetherian conformally dressed black holes also become amenable to being charged by ModMax.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We explore the asymptotic future evolution of holographic dark energy (HDE) models, in which the density of the dark energy is a function of a cutoff scale $L$. We develop a general methodology to determine which models correspond to future big rip, little rip, and pseudo-rip (de Sitter) evolution, and we apply this methodology to a variety of well-studied HDE models. None of these HDE models display little rip evolution, and we are able to show, under very general assumptions, that HDE models with a Granda-Oliveros cutoff almost never evolve toward a future little rip. We extend these results to HDE models with nonstandard Friedman equations and show that a similar conclusion applies: little rip evolution is a very special case that is almost never realized in such models.</description>

Abstract: Conformal back-reaction generates cosmological models where the trace anomaly reflects the breaking of Weyl invariance. Analyzing these actions yields a dynamic approach to dark energy through anomaly-induced actions (AIAs), that are variational solutions of the trace anomaly functional constraint. Expanded around Minkowski space, they produce semiclassical correlators subject to hierarchical anomalous Ward identities, tied to conformal symmetry and diffeomorphism invariance. We focus on comparing the hierarchy of a specific 4-point function, particularly the 2-gravitons-2-photons correlator $(TTJJ)$, generated by AIAs, to free field theory realizations of the same correlator. We observe that the free field theory original hierarchy splits into one ordinary and one anomalous hierarchy, both satisfying the conservation Ward identities from diffeomorphism invariance. However, we find that the anomalous hierarchy derived from ordinary AIAs in both the Riegert or Fradkin-Vilkovisky gauges, are either affected by double poles or violate the hierarchy of the trace Ward identity, respectively. We show that correct forms of the anomalous hierarchies of 4-point functions (for the $TTTT$ and $TTJJ$), identified in a perturbative free field theory expansion around flat space, are characterised by anomaly poles, corresponding to a curvature expansion in $R\Box^{-1}$, together with Weyl invariant terms. We derive the effective action that generates the correct form of the hierarchy for the $TTJJ$.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Correlators with Double Massive Exchanges: Bootstrap Equation and Phenomenology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.09547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using the recently developed cosmological bootstrap method, we compute the exact analytical solution for the seed integral appearing in cosmological correlators with double massive scalar exchanges. The result is explicit, valid in any kinematic configuration, and free from spurious divergences. It is applicable to any number of fields' species with any masses. With an appropriate choice of variables, the results contain only single-layer summations. We also propose simple approximate formulas valid in different limits, enabling direct and instantaneous evaluation.Supported by exact numerical results using CosmoFlow, we explore the phenomenology of double massive exchange diagrams. Contrary to single-exchange diagrams with ubiquitous Lorentz-covariant interactions, the size of the cubic coupling constant can be large while respecting perturbativity bounds. Because of this property, the primordial bispectrum from double-exchange diagrams can be as large as, coincidentally, current observational constraints. In addition to being sizable on equilateral configurations, we show that the primordial bispectrum exhibits a large cosmological collider signal in the squeezed limit, making the double massive exchanges interesting channels for the detection of massive primordial fields. We propose to decisively disentangle double-exchange channels from single-exchange ones with cosmological observations by exploiting the phase information of the cosmological collider signal, the inflationary flavor oscillations from multiple fields' species exchanges and the double soft limit in the primordial trispectrum.</description>

      <title>An Approximate Kerr-Newman-like Metric Endowed with a Magnetic Dipole and Mass Quadrupole</title>

      <description>arXiv:2308.00270v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Approximate all-terrain spacetimes for astrophysical applications are presented. The metrics possess five relativistic multipole moments, namely mass, rotation, mass quadrupole, charge, and magnetic dipole moment. All these spacetimes approximately satisfy the Einstein-Maxwell field equations. The first metric is generated by means of the Hoenselaers-Perj\'es method from given relativistic multipoles. The second metric is a perturbation of the Kerr-Newman metric, which makes it a relevant approximation for astrophysical calculations. The last metric is an extension of the Hartle-Thorne metric that is important for obtaining internal models of compact objects perturbatively. The electromagnetic field is calculated using Cartan forms for locally nonrotating observers. These spacetimes are relevant to infer properties of compact objects from astrophysical observations. Furthermore, the numerical implementations of these metrics are straightforward, making them versatile for simulating the potential astrophysical applications.</description>

      <title>Optical features of rotating quintessential charged black holes in de-Sitter spacetime</title>

Abstract: One of the most important and actual issues in relativistic astrophysics is testing gravity theories and obtaining constraint values for the parameters of black holes using observational data. In this research, we aimed to explore the optical features of a Kerr-Newman black hole model in the presence of a quintessential field, which may be a candidate for a dark-energy model with a nonzero cosmological constant. First, we obtain the equations of motion for photons using the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We also study the horizons and shapes of the apparent regions of the photon region around the said black hole. We investigate shadows cast by the black hole using celestial coordinates in various scenarios. In addition, the impacts of quintessential field and black hole charge on the shadow radius and distortion are examined. Moreover, we look into the constraints on the spin and charge of the supermassive black holes M87$^*$ and Sagittarius A$^*$ for different values of the quintessential field using their shadow size measured by the Event Horizon Telescope Collaboration. Finally, we study the effects of the quintessential field together with black hole spin and charge on its energy emission rate by Hawking radiation and compare our result with available literature.</description>

      <title>How I wonder where you are: pinpointing coalescing binary neutron star sources with the IGWN, including LIGO-Aundha</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15695</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15695v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LIGO-Aundha (A1), the Indian gravitational wave detector, is expected to join the IGWN and begin operations in the early 2030s. We study the impact of A1 on the accuracy of determining the direction of incoming transient signals from coalescing BNS sources with moderately high SNRs. It is conceivable that A1's sensitivity, effective bandwidth, and duty cycle will improve incrementally through multiple detector commissioning rounds to achieve the desired `LIGO-A+' design sensitivity. For this purpose, we examine A1 under two distinct noise PSDs. One mirrors the conditions during the O4 run of the LIGO Hanford and Livingston detectors, simulating an early commissioning stage, while the other represents the A+ design sensitivity. We consider various duty cycles of A1 at the sensitivities mentioned above for a comprehensive analysis. We show that even at the O4 sensitivity with a modest $20\%$ duty cycle, A1's addition to the IGWN leads to a $15\%$ reduction in median sky-localization errors ($\Delta \Omega_{90\%}$) to $5.6$~sq.~deg. At its design sensitivity and $80\%$ duty cycle, this error shrinks further to $2.4$~sq.~deg, with 84\% sources localized within a nominal error box of $10$~sq.~deg! Even in the worst-case scenario, where signals are sub-threshold in A1, we demonstrate its critical role in reducing the localization uncertainties of the BNS source. Our results are obtained from a large Bayesian PE study using simulated signals injected in a heterogeneous network of detectors using the recently developed meshfree approximation aided rapid Bayesian inference pipeline. We consider a seismic cut-off frequency of 10 Hz for all the detectors. We also present hypothetical improvements in sky localization for a few GWTC-like events injected in real data and demonstrate A1's role in resolving the degeneracy between the luminosity distance and inclination angle parameters.</description>

      <title>Can we distinguish black holes with electric and magnetic charges from quasinormal modes?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.03191v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We compute the quasinormal modes of static and spherically symmetric black holes (BHs) with electric and magnetic charges. For the electrically charged case, the dynamics of perturbations separates into the odd- and even-parity sectors with two coupled differential equations in each sector. In the presence of both electric and magnetic charges, the differential equations of four dynamical degrees of freedom are coupled with each other between odd- and even-parity perturbations. Despite this notable modification, we show that, for a given total charge and mass, a BH with mixed electric and magnetic charges gives rise to the same quasinormal frequencies for fundamental modes. This includes the case in which two BHs have equal electric and magnetic charges for each of them. Thus, the gravitational-wave observations of quasinormal modes during the ringdown phase alone do not distinguish between electrically and magnetically charged BHs.</description>

      <title>Constraints on Einstein-dilaton Gauss-Bonnet gravity with Taiji</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the 2030s, space-based gravitational-wave (GW) detectors will exhibit unprecedented sensitivity in the millihertz frequency band, greatly expanding the potential for testing theories of gravity compared to ground-based GW detectors. Inspired by effective string theory, Einstein-dilaton Gauss-Bonnet (EdGB) gravity introduces an extra dilaton scalar field that is directly coupled to higher curvature terms. Here, we investigate the capability of Taiji to constrain the parameters of EdGB gravity by analyzing GWs from massive black hole binaries (MBHBs). We utilize the parameterized post-Einsteinian (ppE) waveform with the leading order EdGB corrections for the inspiral phase of MBHBs. The constraints on the coupling constants are obtained by performing Fisher matrix analysis. With different mass ratios and spins $\chi_i$ at redshifts $z=2,3,4,5$, the $1\sigma$ bounds on the parameter $\alpha$ have the same order of magnitude: $\sqrt{\alpha}\sim 10^7$m.</description>

      <title>Two Regimes of Asymptotic Fall-off of a Massive Scalar Field in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter Spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.17106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.17106v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decay behavior of a massless scalar field in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime is well-known to follow an exponential law at asymptotically late times $t \rightarrow \infty$. In contrast, a massive scalar field in the asymptotically flat Schwarzschild background exhibits a decay with oscillatory (sinusoidal) tails enveloped by a power law. We demonstrate that the asymptotic decay of a massive scalar field in the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime is exponential. Specifically, if $\mu M \gg 1$, where $\mu$ and $M$ represent the mass of the field and the black hole, respectively, the exponential decay is also oscillatory. Conversely, in the regime of small $\mu M$, the decay is purely exponential without oscillations. This distinction in decay regimes underscores the fact that, for asymptotically de Sitter spacetimes, a particular branch of quasinormal modes, instead of a "tail", governs the decay at asymptotically late times. There are two branches of quasinormal modes for the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime: the modes of an asymptotically flat black hole corrected by a non-zero $\Lambda$-term, and the modes of an empty de Sitter spacetime corrected by the presence of a black hole. We show that the latter branch is responsible for the asymptotic decay. When $\mu M$ is small, the modes of pure de Sitter spacetime are purely imaginary (non-oscillatory), while at intermediate and large $\mu M$ they have both real and imaginary parts, what produces the two pictures of the asymptotic decay. In addition, we show that the asymptotic decay of charged and higher dimensional black hole is also exponential.</description>

Abstract: In this article, we investigate the gravitational field of a charged, non-vacuum, non-rotating, spherically symmetric body of mass $M$ assuming a static solution to the Einstein-Maxwell field equations. We demonstrate that the characteristics of perihelion precession of orbits in Schwarzschild and Null singularity spacetimes are similar, whereas, in the case of charged naked singularity (CNS) spacetime, the characteristics are the opposite of those in Schwarzschild and Null singularity spacetime. Here we discuss some novel features of the timelike and lightlike geodesics in this spacetime. We also discuss the comparative study of tidal force in the null singularity spacetime and charged naked singularity spacetime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.08709v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a cosmological model in Rastall's theory of gravity in the framework of the flat FLRW metric. We formulate the value of the Hubble parameter, which contains two model parameters, $ \alpha $ and $ j $. Employing the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling technique, we determine the values of these model parameters along with their uncertainties. Moreover, we derive the equation of state (EoS) parameter, which converges around the quintessence region. We perform a dynamical system analysis using the linearization technique to validate the results independently. Also, we discuss various physical attributes of the model, highlighting the transition to acceleration and the violation of the strong energy condition (SEC) in the late stages of evolution. In conclusion, our model mimics the behavior of a dark matter fluid during the past epoch and transitions into a quintessence dark energy model in the future epoch.</description>

      <title>Understanding gravitationally induced decoherence parameters in neutrino oscillations using a microscopic quantum mechanical model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03106v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, a microscopic quantum mechanical model for gravitationally induced decoherence introduced by Blencowe and Xu is investigated in the context of neutrino oscillations. The focus is on the comparison with existing phenomenological models and the physical interpretation of the decoherence parameters in such models. The results show that for neutrino oscillations in vacuum gravitationally induced decoherence can be matched with phenomenological models with decoherence parameters of the form $\Gamma_{ij}\sim \Delta m^4_{ij}E^{-2}$. When matter effects are included, the decoherence parameters show a dependence on matter effects, which vary in the different layers of the Earth, that can be explained with the form of the coupling between neutrinos and the gravitational wave environment inspired by linearised gravity. Consequently, in the case of neutrino oscillations in matter, the microscopic model does not agree with many existing phenomenological models that assume constant decoherence parameters in matter, and their existing bounds cannot be used to further constrain the model considered here. The probabilities for neutrino oscillations with constant and varying decoherence parameters are compared and it is shown that the deviations can be up to 10%. On a theoretical level, these different models can be characterised by a different choice of Lindblad operators, with the model with decoherence parameters that do not include matter effects being less suitable from the point of view of linearised gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.07848v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, Bueno, Cano, and Hennigar [arXiv: 2403.04827] proposed a generic approach for incorporating an infinite tower of higher curvature corrections into the Einstein theory. In this study, we compute quasinormal modes for certain regular D-dimensional black holes resulting from this infinite series of higher curvature corrections, specifically focusing on the D-dimensional extensions of the Bardeen and Hayward black holes. We demonstrate that while the fundamental mode is minimally affected by moderate coupling constants, the higher overtones exhibit significant sensitivity even to small coupling values, yielding unconventional modes characterized by vanishing real oscillation frequencies. When comparing the frequencies derived from the metric truncated at several orders of higher curvature corrections with those resulting from the infinite series of terms, we observe a rapid convergence of the frequencies to their limit for the complete regular black hole. This validates the extensive research conducted on specific theories with a finite number of higher curvature corrections, such as the Lovelock theory.</description>

      <title>On black bounce space-times in non-linear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12897v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: One of the main issues in gravitation is the presence of singularities in the most common space-time solutions of General Relativity, as the case of black holes. A way of constructing regular solutions that remove spacelike singularities consists in implement a bounce on such space-time, leading to what is usually known as black bounce space-times. Such space-times are known to describe regular black holes or traversable wormholes. However, one of the main issues lies on reconstructing the appropriate source that leads to such a solution. In this paper, a reconstruction method is implemented to show that such types of metrics can be well accommodated in non-linear electrodynamics with the presence of a scalar field. Some of the most important black bounces solutions are reconstructed in this framework, both in 3+1 as in 2+1 dimensions. For the first time in the literature, these solutions have an electrically charged source of matter from non-linear electrodynamics. Specific features are indicated that distinguish electric sources from magnetic ones, previously found for the same space-times.</description>

      <title>Tipler Naked Singularities in $N$ Dimensions</title>

Abstract: A spacetime singularity, identified by the existence of incomplete causal geodesics in the spacetime, is called a (Tipler) strong curvature singularity if the volume form acting on independent Jacobi fields along causal geodesics vanishes in the approach of the singularity. It is called naked if it is the past endpoint of causal curves in spacetime. Here, we study the formation of strong curvature naked singularities arising from spherically symmetric gravitational collapse of general type-I matter fields in an arbitrarily finite number of dimensions. In the spirit of Joshi and Dwivedi [1], and Goswami and Joshi [2], we first construct regular initial data in terms of matter variables and geometric quantities, subject to the dominant and null energy conditions. Using this initial data, we derive two distinct (but not mutually exclusive) conditions, which we call the positive root condition (PRC) and the simple positive root condition (SPRC), that serve as necessary and sufficient conditions, respectively, for the existence of naked singularities. In doing so, we generalize the results of [1] and [2]. We further restrict the PRC and the SPRC by imposing the curvature growth condition (CGC) of Clarke and Krolak [3] on all causal curves that satisfy the causal convergence condition. The CGC then gives a sufficient condition ensuring that the naked singularities implying the PRC and implied by the SPRC, are of strong curvature type and hence correspond to the inextendibility of the spacetime. Using the CGC, we extend the results of [4] (that hold for dimension $N=4$) to the case $N=5$, showing that strong curvature naked singularities can occur in this case. However, for the case $N\geq6$, we show that past-incomplete causal curves that identify naked singularities do not satisfy the CGC. These results shed light on the validity of the cosmic censorship conjectures in arbitrary dimensions.</description>

Abstract: One of the unique features of quantum gravity is the lack of local observables and the completeness of boundary observables. We show that the existence of boundary observables for particles with mass $\lim\limits_{t\rightarrow\infty}\frac{m}{H}=\infty$ in scalar field cosmologies where $a(t)\sim t^{p}$ is equivalent to TCC, which implies $p\leq 1$. Moreover, the mass of weakly-coupled particles must decay like $m\lesssim t^{1-2p}$ to ensure that they yield non-trivial boundary observables. This condition can be expressed in terms of the scalar field that drives the cosmology as $m\lesssim\exp(-c\phi)$ where $c$ depends on the scalar potential. The strongest bound we find is achieved for $V\sim \exp(-2\phi/\sqrt{d-2})$ where $c=1/\sqrt{d-2}$. These results connect some of the most phenomenologically interesting Swampland conjectures to the most basic version of holography.</description>

      <title>Resolving the stellar-collapse and hierarchical-merger origins of the coalescing black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.02973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.02973v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Spin and mass properties provide essential clues in distinguishing the origins of coalescing black holes (BHs). With a dedicated semi-parametric population model for the coalescing binary black holes (BBHs), we identify two distinct categories of BHs among the GWTC-3 events, which is {favored over the one population scenario by} a logarithmic Bayes factor ($\ln\mathcal{B}$) of 7.5. One category, with a mass ranging from $\sim 25M_\odot$ to $\sim 80M_\odot$, is distinguished by the high spin-magnitudes ($\sim0.75$) and consistent with the hierarchical merger origin. The other category, characterized by low spins, has a sharp mass cutoff at $\sim 40M_\odot$, which is natural for the stellar-collapse origin and in particular the pair-instability explosion of massive stars. We infer the local hierarchical merger rate density as $0.46^{+0.61}_{-0.24}~{\rm Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}}$. Additionally, we find that a fraction of the BBHs has a cosine-spin-tilt-angle distribution concentrated preferentially around $1$, which is consistent with the expectation of the isolated field binaries and the dynamically formed BBHs in the accretion disks of Active Galactic Nuclei.</description>

      <title>Semiclassical transport in two-dimensional Dirac materials with spatially variable tilt</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06030v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We use Boltzmann model to study the semi-classical dynamics of electrons in a two-dimensional (2D) tilted Dirac material in which the tilt varies in space. The spatial variation of the tilt parameter induces a non-trivial spacetime geometry on the background of which the electrons roam about. As the first manifestation of graivto-electric phenomena, we find a geometric planar Hall effect according to which a current flows in a direction transverse to the chemical potential gradient and is proportional to component $g^{xy}$ of the emergent spacetime structure. The longitudinal conductivity contains information about the gravitational red-shift factors. Furthermore, in the absence of externally applied electric field there can be "free-fall" or zero-bias currents that can be used as detectors of terahertz radiation.</description>

      <title>Kerr stability in external regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.12758v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2003, Klainerman and Nicol\`o \cite{Kl-Ni} proved the stability of Minkowski in the case of the exterior of an outgoing null cone. Relying on the method used in \cite{Kl-Ni}, Caciotta and Nicol\`o \cite{Ca-Ni} proved the stability of Kerr spacetime in external regions, i.e. outside an outgoing null cone far away from the Kerr event horizon. In this paper, we give a new proof of \cite{Ca-Ni}. Compared to \cite{Ca-Ni}, we reduce the number of derivatives needed in the proof, simplify the treatment of the last slice, and provide a unified treatment of the decay of initial data which contains in particular the initial data considered by Klainerman and Szeftel in \cite{KS:main}. Also, concerning the treatment of curvature estimates, similar to \cite{ShenMink}, we replace the vectorfield method used in \cite{Kl-Ni,Ca-Ni} by $r^p$-weighted estimates introduced by Dafermos and Rodnianski in \cite{Da-Ro}.</description>

      <title>Role of Future SNIa Data from Rubin LSST in Reinvestigating Cosmological Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.08786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.08786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study how future Type-Ia supernovae (SNIa) standard candles detected by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory (LSST) can constrain some cosmological models. We use a realistic three-year SNIa simulated dataset generated by the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC) Time Domain pipeline, which includes a mix of spectroscopic and photometrically identified candidates. We combine this data with Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements to estimate the dark energy model parameters for two models -- the baseline $\Lambda$CDM and Chevallier-Polarski-Linder (CPL) dark energy parametrization. We compare them with the current constraints obtained from joint analysis of the latest real data from the Pantheon SNIa compilation, CMB from Planck 2018 and BAO. Our analysis finds tighter constraints on the model parameters along with a significant reduction of correlation between $H_0$ and $\sigma_{8,0}$. We find that LSST is expected to significantly improve upon the existing SNIa data in the critical analysis of cosmological models.</description>

      <title>Unimodular Proca Theory: Breaking the U(1) gauge symmetry of unimodular gravity via a mass term</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09380v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian structure of unimodular-like theories, where the cosmological constant (or other supposed constants of nature) are demoted from fixed parameters to classical constants of motion. No new local degrees of freedom are present as a result of a $U(1)$ gauge invariance of the theory. Hamiltonian analysis of the action reveals that the only possible gauge fixing that can be enforced is setting the spatial components of the four-volume time vector ${\cal T}^{i}\approx0$. As a consequence of this, the gauge-fixed unimodular path integral is equivalent to the minisuperspace unimodular path integral. However, should we break the $U(1)$ gauge invariance, two things happen: a massless propagating degree of freedom appears, and the (gauge-invariant) zero-mode receives modified dynamics. The implications are investigated, with the phenomenology depending crucially on the target ``constant''.</description>

      <title>Amplitude Bootstrap in (Anti) de Sitter Space And The Four-Point Graviton from Double Copy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.13894</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.13894v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose studying a new representation of on-shell Anti de Sitter (AdS) amplitude in Mellin Momentum space, where it encodes all the dynamical information in Cosmological Correlators. At tree level, we demonstrate that this amplitude has a similar analytic structure as the S-matrix, with residues of poles made up of on-shell lower-point amplitudes. We use this structure to bootstrap 4-point scalar amplitudes with spin-1 and spin-2 exchange. In the second part of the paper, we use double copy to construct the 4-point graviton amplitude in general dimension. This leads us to a novel, concise formula that exhibits the flat space structure. We also verified this formula for the case when d=3 with literature.</description>

      <title>Coupled Quintessence scalar field model in light of observational datasets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.03740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We do a detailed analysis of a well-theoretically motivated interacting dark energy scalar field model with a time-varying interaction term. Using current cosmological datasets from CMB, BAO, Type Ia Supernova, $H(z)$ measurements from cosmic chronometers, angular diameter measurements from Megamasers, growth measurements, and local SH0ES measurements, we found that dark energy component may act differently than a cosmological constant at early times. The observational data also does not disfavor a small interaction between dark energy and dark matter at late times. When using all these datasets in combination, our value of $H_0$ agrees well with SH0ES results but in 2.5$\sigma$ tension with Planck results. We also did AIC and BIC analysis, and we found that the cosmological data prefer coupled quintessence model over $\Lambda$CDM, although the chi-square per number of degrees of freedom test prefers the latter.</description>

      <title>Renormalized stress-energy tensor on global anti-de Sitter space-time with Robin boundary conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.05623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.05623v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the renormalized stress-energy tensor (RSET) for a massless, conformally coupled scalar field on global anti-de Sitter space-time in four dimensions. Robin (mixed) boundary conditions are applied to the scalar field. We compute both the vacuum and thermal expectation values of the RSET. The vacuum RSET is a multiple of the space-time metric when either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary conditions are applied. Imposing Robin boundary conditions breaks the maximal symmetry of the vacuum state and results in an RSET whose components with mixed indices have their maximum (or maximum magnitude) at the space-time origin. The value of this maximum depends on the boundary conditions. We find similar behaviour for thermal states. As the temperature decreases, thermal expectation values of the RSET approach those for vacuum states and their values depend strongly on the boundary conditions. As the temperature increases, the values of the RSET components tend to profiles which are the same for all boundary conditions. We also find, for both vacuum and thermal states, that the RSET on the space-time boundary is independent of the boundary conditions and determined entirely by the trace anomaly.</description>

      <title>Vortex Effects in Merging Black Holes and Saturons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.02288v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Vorticity has recently been suggested to be a property of highly-spinning black holes. The connection between vorticity and limiting spin represents a universal feature shared by objects of maximal microstate entropy, so-called saturons. Using $Q$-ball-like saturons as a laboratory for black holes, we study the collision of two such objects and find that vorticity can have a large impact on the emitted radiation as well as on the charge and angular momentum of the final configuration. As black holes belong to the class of saturons, we expect that the formation of vortices can cause similar effects in black hole mergers, leading to macroscopic deviations in gravitational radiation. This could leave unique signatures detectable with upcoming gravitational-wave searches, which can thereby serve as a portal to macroscopic quantum effects in black holes.</description>

      <title>Optimal Inflationary Potentials</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Inflation is a highly favoured theory for the early Universe. It is compatible with current observations of the cosmic microwave background and large scale structure and is a driver in the quest to detect primordial gravitational waves. It is also, given the current quality of the data, highly under-determined with a large number of candidate implementations. We use a new method in symbolic regression to generate all possible simple scalar field potentials for one of two possible basis sets of operators. Treating these as single-field, slow-roll inflationary models we then score them with an information-theoretic metric ("minimum description length") that quantifies their efficiency in compressing the information in current data. We explore two possible priors on the parameter space of potentials, one related to the functions' structural complexity and one that uses a Katz back-off language model to prefer functions that may be theoretically motivated. This enables us to identify the inflaton potentials that optimally balance simplicity with accuracy at explaining current data, which may subsequently find theoretical motivation. Our exploratory study opens the door to extraction of fundamental physics directly from data, and may be augmented with more refined theoretical priors in the quest for a complete understanding of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Cutoff brane vs the Karch-Randall brane: the fluctuating case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03531</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03531v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, certain holographic Weyl transformed CFT$_2$ is proposed to capture the main features of the AdS$_3$/BCFT$_2$ correspondence \cite{Basu:2022crn,Basu:2023wmv}. In this paper, by adapting the Weyl transformation, we simulate a generalized AdS/BCFT set-up where the fluctuation of the Karch-Randall (KR) brane is considered. In the gravity dual of the Weyl transformed CFT, the so-called cutoff brane induced by the Weyl transformation plays the same role as the KR brane. Unlike the non-fluctuating configuration, in the $2d$ effective theory the additional twist operator is inserted at a different place, compared with the one inserted on the brane. Though this is well-understood in the Weyl transformed CFT set-up, it is confusing in the AdS/BCFT set-up where the effective theory is supposed to locate on the brane. This confusion indicates that the KR brane may be emergent from the boundary CFT$_2$ via the Weyl transformations.
  We also calculate the balanced partial entanglement (BPE) in the fluctuating brane configurations and find it coincide with the entanglement wedge cross-section (EWCS). This is a non-trivial test for the correspondence between the BPE and the EWCS, and a non-trivial consistency check for the Weyl transformed CFT set-up.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We describe a method for defining dynamical black hole entropy in gravitational effective field theories (EFTs). The entropy is constructed order by order in derivatives. For any fixed number of derivatives, the entropy satisfies a non-perturbative second law of black hole mechanics if the black hole remains within the regime of validity of EFT. In equilibrium the entropy reduces to the Wald entropy. It reduces to the entropy defined by Hollands et al in theories of vacuum gravity with up to 10 derivatives.</description>

      <title>Moving frame theory of zero-bias photocurrent on the surface of topological insulators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Motivated by observations of zero-biased photocurrent on the surface of topological insulators, we show that the in-plane effective magnetic field $\tilde B$ implements a moving frame transformation on the topological insulators' helical surface states. As a result, photo-excited electrons on the surface undergo a Galilean boost proportional to the effective in-plane magnetic field $\tilde B$. The boost velocity is transversely proportional to $\tilde B$. This explains why the experimentally observed photocurrent depends linearly on $\tilde B$. Our theory while consistent with the observation that at leading order the effect does not depend on the polarization of the incident radiation, at next leading order in $\tilde B$ predicts a polarization dependence in both parallel and transverse directions to the polarization. We also predict two induced Fermi surface effects that can serve as further confirmation of our moving frame theory. Based on the estimated value $\zeta\approx 0.34$ of the tilt parameter for a magnetic fields of $\tilde B\sim 3$T, our geometric picture qualifies the surface Dirac cone of magnetic topological insulators as an accessible platform for the synthesis and experimental investigation of strong synthetic gravitational phenomena.</description>

      <title>Effective action of the Horava theory: Cancellation of divergences</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.16327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We compute the one-loop effective action of the Horava theory, in its nonprojectable formulation. We take the quantization of the (2+1)-dimensional theory in the Batalin-Fradkin-Vilkovisky formalism, and comment on the extension to the (3+1) case. The second-class constraints and the appropriate gauge-fixing condition are included in the quantization. The ghost fields associated with the second-class constraints can be used to get the integrated form of the effective action, which has the form of a Berezinian. We show that all irregular loops cancel between them in the effective action. The key for the cancellation is the role of the ghosts associated with the second-class constraints. These ghosts form irregular loops that enter in the denominator of the Berezinian, eliminating the irregular loops of the bosonic nonghost sector. Irregular loops produce dangerous divergences; hence their cancellation is an essential step for the consistency of the theory. The cancellation of this kind of divergences is in agreement with the previous analysis done on the (2+1) quantum canonical Lagrangian and its Feynman diagrams.</description>

      <title>Testing an exact diffraction formula with gravitational wave source lensed by a supermassive black hole in binary systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01581v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When it comes to long-wavelength gravitational waves (GWs), diffraction effect becomes significant when these waves are lensed by celestial bodies. Typically, the traditional diffraction integral formula neglects large-angle diffraction, which is often adequate for most of cases. Nonetheless, there are specific scenarios, such as when a GW source is lensed by a supermassive black hole in a binary system, where the lens and source are in close proximity, where large-angle diffraction can play a crucial role. In our prior research, we have introduced an exact, general diffraction integral formula that accounts for large-angle diffraction as well. This paper explores the disparities between this exact diffraction formula and the traditional, approximate one under various special conditions. Our findings indicate that, under specific parameters, such as a lens-source distance of $D_{\rm LS}=0.1$\,AU and a lens mass of $M_{\rm L}=4\times10^{6}M_\odot$, the amplification factor for the exact diffraction formula is notably smaller than that of the approximate formula, differing by a factor of approximately $r_F\simeq0.806$. This difference is substantial enough to be detectable. Furthermore, our study reveals that the proportionality factor $r_F$ gradually increases from 0.5 to 1 as $D_{\rm LS}$ increases, and decreases as $M_{\rm L}$ increases. Significant differences between the exact and approximate formulas are observable when $D_{\rm LS}\lesssim0.2$ AU (assuming $M_{\rm L}=4\times10^{6}M_\odot$) or when $M_{\rm L}\gtrsim2\times10^6M_\odot$ (assuming $D_{\rm LS}=0.1$ AU). These findings suggest that there is potential to validate our general diffraction formula through future GW detections.</description>

      <title>Search for dormant black holes in the OGLE data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11293v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Light curves of ellipsoidal variables collected by the Optical Gravitational Lensing Experiment (OGLE) were analyzed, in order to search for dormant black hole candidates. After the preselection based on the amplitude of ellipsoidal modulation, each object was investigated by means of the spectral energy distribution fit, which allowed us to select objects that are in close agreement with the spectrum of a single stellar object. After this final step of the preselection process, we were left with only fourteen objects that were then investigated in detail. For each candidate, we estimated basic physical parameters such as temperature, mass, luminosity, and, in some cases, radial velocity semi-amplitude. One of the objects turned out to be a spotted star while the rest are considered black-hole binary candidates. In the end, we present an alternative explanation for the ellipsoidal modulation in the form of contact binaries, which are not only vast in number, contrary to black-hole binaries, but are also in much better agreement with the radial velocity estimates for some of the systems analyzed. Even if the presented arguments suggest a noncompact character of the companion objects, each of them should be observed spectroscopically in order to verify the compact object hypothesis.</description>

      <title>Relativistic single-electron wavepacket in quantum electromagnetic fields: Quantum coherence, correlations, and the Unruh effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.15404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.15404v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional formulation of QED since the 50s works very well for stationary states and for scattering problems, but with newly arisen challenges from the 80s on, where real time evolution of particles in a nonequilibrium setting are required, and quantum features such as coherence, dissipation, correlation and entanglement in a system interacting with its quantum field environment are sought after, new ways to formulate QED suitable for these purposes beckon. In this paper we present a linearized effective theory using a Gaussian wavepacket description of a charged relativistic particle coupled to quantum electromagnetic fields to study the interplay between single electrons and quantum fields in free space, at a scale well below the Schwinger limit. The proper values of the regulators in our effective theory are determined from the data of individual experiments, and will be time-dependent in the laboratory frame if the single electrons are accelerated. Using this new theoretical tool, we address the issues of decoherence of flying electrons in free space and the impact of Unruh effect on the electrons. Our result suggests that vacuum fluctuations may be a major source of blurring the interference pattern in electron microscopes. For a single electron accelerated in a uniform electric field, we identify the Unruh effect in the two-point correlators of the deviations from the electron's classical trajectory. From our calculations we also bring out some subtleties, involving the bosonic versus fermionic spectral functions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Degradation in Causal Diamonds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10417v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Entanglement degradation appears to be a generic prediction in relativistic quantum information whenever horizons restrict access to a region of spacetime. This property has been previously explored in connection with the Unruh effect, where a bipartite entangled system composed of an inertial observer (Alice) and a uniformly accelerated observer (Rob) was studied, with entanglement degradation caused by the relative acceleration -- and with equivalent results for the case when Alice is freely falling into a black hole and Rob experiences a constant proper acceleration as a stationary near-horizon observer. In this work, we show that a similar degradation also occurs in the case of an entangled system composed of an inertial observer (Alice) and a "diamond observer" (Dave) with a finite lifetime. The condition of a finite lifetime is equivalent to the restriction of Dave's access within a causal diamond. Specifically, if the system starts in a maximally entangled state, prepared from Alice's perspective, entanglement degradation is enforced by the presence of the diamond's causal horizons.</description>

Abstract: We present a superfluid dark star model consisting of relativistic dark bosons with two-body self-interaction. The obtained masses, radii, and tidal deformability depend in a simple way on the boson mass and interaction strength. We report first results on binary mergers: the distinctive amplitude and frequency of the emitted gravitational waves are well within reach of terrestrial interferometers.</description>

      <title>The Canvas of Holography in (A)dS/CFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The dynamic of holography between anti-de Sitter space holography and de Sitter holography is a very fascinating comparison, which provides many key insights into what we expect from holography in general. In this Essay, we highlight this dynamic with three examples: first, when taking Wheeler-DeWitt states to the asymptotic boundary, the dual interpretation is unclear in de Sitter. Second, what we make of bulk reconstruction and subregion duality in AdS/CFT is not trivially reflected in the dS/CFT scenario. Third, a way of formulating emergence and subregion-subalgebra duality in de Sitter space does not yet exist. With these examples, we provide some musings on this canvas of holography in the settings of (A)dS/CFT.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Curvature Perturbation and Primordial Black Hole Formation in Two-stage Inflation with a break</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02492</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02492v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate a model of $R^2$-gravity with a non-minimally coupled scalar field that gives rise to two-stage inflation with a break, that is, with an intermediate stage where inflation momentarily halts. We find that the power spectrum of the primordial curvature perturbation is significantly enhanced at the break scale, which can account for the primordial black hole (PBH) formation, without affecting the CMB constraint on large scales. The behavior of the curvature perturbation is carefully analyzed and we find a few notable new features in the spectrum. In particular, we find that the $k^3$ growth of the spectrum of toward the end of the first stage of inflation. We argue that this is a universal feature common to all two-stage models where the field dominating the second stage is heavy during the first stage. By appropriately tuning the model parameters, we find that our model can realize the scenario of PBHs as the cold dark matter of the Universe. We also find that we can choose the parameters so that the spectrum of the induced gravitational waves from the enhanced curvature perturbation fits the NANOGrav-15yr data of pulsar timing array observation.</description>

      <title>On the association of GW190425 with its potential electromagnetic counterpart FRB 20190425A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02496v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent work by Moroianu et al. (2022) has suggested that the binary neutron star (BNS) merger GW190425 might have a potential fast radio burst (FRB) counterpart association, FRB 20190425A, at the 2.8$\sigma$ level of confidence with a likely host galaxy association, namely UGC10667. The authors argue that the observations are consistent with a long-lived hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) that formed promptly after the BNS merger and was stable for approximately 2.5 hours before promptly collapsing into a black hole. Recently, Bhardwaj et al. (2023) conclusively associated FRB 20190425A with UGC10667, potentially providing a direct host galaxy candidate for GW190425. In this work, we examine the multi-messenger association based on the space-time localization overlaps between GW190425 and the FRB host galaxy UGC10667 and find that the odds for a coincident association are $\mathcal{O}(5)$. We validate this estimate by using a Gaussian Process (GP) density estimator. Assuming that the association is indeed real, we then perform Bayesian parameter estimation on GW190425 assuming that the BNS event took place in \GAL. We find that the viewing angle of GW190425 excludes an on-axis system at $p(\theta_v&gt;30^o)\approx99.99$\%, highly favouring an off-axis system similar to GRB 170817A. We also find a slightly higher source frame total mass for the binary, namely, $m_{\rm{total}} = 3.42^{+0.34}_{-0.11} M_{\odot}$, leading to an increase on the probability of prompt collapse into a black hole and therefore disfavors the long-lived HMNS formation scenario. Given our findings, we conclude that the association between \GW and \FRB is disfavoured by current state-of-the-art gravitational-wave analyses.</description>

      <title>Revised bounds on local cosmic strings from NANOGrav observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02705v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent paper, the NANOGrav collaboration studied new physics explanations of the observed pulsar timing residuals consistent with a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), including cosmic strings in the Nambu-Goto (NG) approximation. Analysing one of current models for the loop distribution, it was found that the cosmic string model is disfavored compared to other sources, for example, super massive black hole binaries (SMBHBs). When both SMBHB and cosmic string models are included in the analysis, an upper bound on a string tension $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-10}$ was derived. However, the analysis did not accommodate results from cosmic string simulations in an underlying field theory, which indicate that at most a small fraction of string loops survive long enough to emit GW. Following and extending our previous study, we suppose that a fraction $f_{\rm NG}$ of string loops follow NG dynamics and emit only GWs, and study the three different models of the loop distribution discussed in the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) collaboration analyses. We re-analyze the NANOGrav 15yrs data with our signal models by using the NANOGrav $\texttt{ENTERPRISE}$ analysis code via the wrapper $\texttt{PTArcade}$. We find that loop distributions similar to LVK Model B and C yield higher Bayes factor than Model A analyzed in the NANOGrav paper, as they can more easily accommodate a blue-tilted spectrum of the observed amplitude. Furthermore, because of the degeneracy of $G\mu$ and $f_{\rm NG}$ in determining the signal amplitude, our posterior distribution extends to higher values of $G\mu$, and in some cases the uppermost value of credible intervals is close to the Cosmic Microwave Background limit $G\mu \lesssim 10^{-7}$. Hence, in addition to the pulsar timing array data, further information about the fraction of long-lived loops in a cosmic string network is required to constrain the string tension.</description>

      <title>Falsifying Anthropics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02993v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose using fuzzy axion dark matter to test the anthropic principle. A very light axion can be directly detectable, at least by black hole superradiance effects. The idea then is that gravitational and astrophysical observations can discover a light axion in the regime where it must be all of dark matter with abundance which must be set up by the anthropic principle, due to excessive primordial misalignment induced by inflation. Yet it may turn out that dark matter is something else instead of this axion. Since axion misalignment must be induced by Brownian drift in (quasi)de Sitter space, this could invalidate the anthropic prediction of the dark matter abundance.</description>

      <title>On the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.04926v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate that Debye shielding cannot be employed to constrain the cosmological abundance of magnetic monopoles, contrary to what is stated in the previous literature. Current model-independent bounds on the monopole abundance are then revisited for unit Dirac magnetic charge. We find that the Andromeda Parker bound can be employed to set an upper limit on the monopole flux at the level of $F_M\lesssim 5.3\times 10^{-19}\,\text{cm}^{-2}\text{s}^{-1}\text{sr}^{-1}$ for a monopole mass $10^{13}\,\text{GeV}/c^2\lesssim m\lesssim 10^{16}\,\text{GeV}/c^2$, which is more stringent than the MACRO direct search limit by two orders of magnitude. This translates into stringent constraints on the monopole density parameter $\Omega_M$ at the level of $10^{-7}-10^{-4}$ depending on the mass. For larger monopole masses the scenarios in which magnetic monopoles account for all or the majority of dark matter are disfavored.</description>

      <title>New instanton on a warped Kerr spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08346</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08346v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find an exact time-dependent instanton solution on a vacuum Kerr-like warped spacetime in conformal dilaton gravity. Remarkably, the metric solution results from a first-order PDE, allowing the connection with self-duality. The antipodal boundary condition on the hypersurface of a Klein bottle $\sim \mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1$ is applied to describe the Hawking particles. We used the Hopf fibration to get $S^2$ as the black hole horizon, where the centrix is not in a torus but in the Klein bottle. The twist fits very well with the antipodal identification of the point on the horizon. No "cut and past" is necessary, so the Hawing particles remain pure without instantaneous information transport. A local observer passing the horizon will not notice a central singularity in suitable coordinates. The black hole paradoxes are also revisited in our new black hole model. A connection is made with the geomeric quantization of $\mathbb{C}^1\times\mathbb{C}^1\sim S^3$, by considering the symplectic 2-form. The model can be easily extended to the non-vacuum situation by including a scalar field. Both the dilaton and the scalar field can be treated as quantum fields when approaching the Planck area.</description>
