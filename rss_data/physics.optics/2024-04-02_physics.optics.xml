      <title>Shaped-pulse optimisation of coherent soft-x-rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-harmonic generation is one of the most extreme nonlinear-optical processes observed to date. By focusing an intense laser pulse into a gas, the light-atom interaction that occurs during the process of ionising the atoms results in the generation of harmonics of the driving laser frequency, that extend up to order ~300 (corresponding to photon energies from 4 to &gt;500eV). Because this technique is simple to implement and generates coherent, laser-like, soft-x-ray beams, it is currently being developed for applications in science and technology including probing of dynamics in chemical and materials systems and for imaging. In this work we demonstrate that by carefully controlling the shape of intense light pulses of 6-8 optical cycles, we can control the interaction of light with an atom as it is being ionised, in a way that improves the efficiency of x-ray generation by an order of magnitude. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it is possible to control the spectral characteristics of the emitted radiation and to channel the interaction between different- order nonlinear processes. The result is an increased utility of harmonic generation as a light source, as well as the first demonstration of optical pulse-shaping techniques to control high-order nonlinear processes.</description>

      <title>Phase matching of high harmonic generation in the soft and hard X-ray regions of the spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how bright, fully coherent, hard x-ray beams can be generated through nonlinear upconversion of femtosecond laser light. By using longer-wavelength mid-infrared driving lasers of moderate peak intensity, full phase matching of the high harmonic generation process can extend, in theory, into the hard x-ray region of the spectrum. We identify the dominant phase matching mechanism for long wavelength driving lasers, and verify our predictions experimentally by demonstrating phase-matched up-conversion into the soft x-ray region of the spectrum around 330 eV using an extended, high-pressure, gas medium that is weakly ionized by the laser. Scaling of the overall conversion efficiency is surprisingly favorable as the wavelength of the driving laser is increased, making useful, fully coherent, multi-keV x-ray sources feasible. Finally, we show that the rapidly decreasing microscopic single-atom yield at longer driving wavelengths is compensated macroscopically by an increasing optimal pressure for phase matching and a rapidly decreasing reabsorption of the generated light at higher photon energies.</description>

      <title>Near-Visible Topological Edge States in a Silicon Nitride Platform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Demonstrations of topological photonics have so far largely been confined to infrared wavelengths where imaging technology and access to low-dimensional quantum materials are both limited. Here, we designed and fabricated silicon nitride ring-resonator arrays to demonstrate photonic topological edge states at ~780 nm. We observed edge states corresponding to the integer quantum Hall Hamiltonian with topological protection against fabrication disorder. This demonstration extends the concept of topological edge states to the near-visible regime and paves the way for nonlinear and non-Hermitian topological photonics with the rich library of near-visible quantum emitters.</description>

      <title>Information Processing in Hybrid Photonic Electrical Reservoir Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Physical Reservoir Computing (PRC) is a recently developed variant of Neuromorphic Computing, where a pertinent physical system effectively projects information encoded in the input signal into a higher-dimensional space. While various physical hardware has demonstrated promising results for Reservoir Computing (RC), systems allowing tunability of their dynamical regimes have not received much attention regarding how to optimize relevant system parameters. In this work we employ hybrid photonic-electronic (HPE) system offering both parallelism inherent to light propagation, and electronic memory and programmable feedback allowing to induce nonlinear dynamics and tunable encoding of the photonic signal to realize HPE-RC. Specifically, we experimentally and theoretically analyze performance of integrated silicon photonic on-chip Mach-Zehnder interferometer and ring resonators with heaters acting as programmable phase modulators, controlled by detector and the feedback unit capable of realizing complex temporal dynamics of the photonic signal. Furthermore, we present an algorithm capable of predicting optimal parameters for RC by analyzing the corresponding Lyapunov exponent of the output signal and mutual information of reservoir nodes. By implementing the derived optimal parameters, we demonstrate that the corresponding resulting error of RC can be lowered by several orders of magnitude compared to a reservoir operating with randomly chosen set of parameters.</description>

      <title>Broadband Visible Wavelength Microcomb Generation In Silicon Nitride Microrings Through Air-Clad Dispersion Engineering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The development of broadband microresonator frequency combs at visible wavelengths is pivotal for the advancement of compact and fieldable optical atomic clocks and spectroscopy systems. Yet, their realization necessitates resonators with anomalous dispersion, an arduous task due to the prevailing normal dispersion regime of materials within the visible spectrum. In this work, we evince that silicon nitride microring resonators with air cladding on top and sides -- a deviation from the frequently employed silica-embedded resonators -- allows for the direct generation of broadband microcombs in the visible range. We experimentally demonstrate combs pumped at 1060~nm (283~THz) that reach wavelengths as short as 680~nm (440 THz), and combs pumped at 780~nm (384 THz) that reach wavelengths as short as 630 nm (475 THz). We further show through simulations that microcombs extending to wavelengths as low as 461 nm (650 THz) should be accessible in this platform.</description>

      <title>Optical Spectra of Plasmon-Exciton Core-Shell Nanoparticles: An Anisotropic Classical Model Eliminates Discrepancies with Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01718v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The optical properties of the hybrid core--shell nanostructures composed of a metallic core and an organic shell of molecular J-aggregates are determined by the electromagnetic coupling between plasmons localized at the surface of the metallic core and Frenkel excitons in the shell. In cases of strong and ultra-strong plasmon--exciton coupling, the use of the traditional isotropic classical oscillator model to describe the J-aggregate permittivity may lead to drastic discrepancies between theoretical predictions and the available experimental spectra of hybrid nanoparticles. We show that these discrepancies are not caused by limitations of the classical oscillator model itself, but by considering the organic shell as an optically isotropic material. By assuming a tangential orientation of the classical oscillators of the molecular J-aggregates in a shell, we obtain excellent agreement with experimental extinction spectra of TDBC-coated gold nanorods, which cannot be treated with the conventional isotropic shell model. Our results extend the understanding of the physical effects in the optics of metal--organic nanoparticles and suggest an approach for the theoretical description of such hybrid systems.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale mechanical manipulation of ultrathin SiN membranes enabling infrared near-field microscopy of liquid-immersed samples</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01770v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Scattering scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM) is a powerful technique for mid-infrared spectroscopy at nanometer length scales. By investigating objects in aqueous environments through ultrathin membranes, s-SNOM has recently been extended towards label-free nanoscopy of the dynamics of living cells and nanoparticles, assessing both the optical and the mechanical interactions between the tip, the membrane and the liquid suspension underneath. Here, we report that the tapping AFM tip induces a reversible nanometric deformation of the membrane manifested as either an indentation or protrusion. This mechanism depends on the driving force of the tapping cantilever, which we exploit to minimize topographical deformations of the membrane to improve optical measurements. Furthermore, we show that the tapping phase, or phase delay between driving signal and tip oscillation, is a highly sensitive observable for quantifying the mechanics of adhering objects, exhibiting highest contrast for low tapping amplitudes where the membrane remains nearly flat. We correlate mechanical responses with simultaneously recorded spectroscopy data to reveal the thickness of nanometric water pockets between membrane and adhering objects. Besides a general applicability of depth profiling, our technique holds great promise for studying mechano-active biopolymers and living cells, biomaterials that exhibit complex behaviors when under a mechanical load.</description>

      <title>Multiple scattering suppression for in vivo optical coherence tomography measurement using B-scan-wise multi-focus averaging method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a method that reduces the noise caused by multi-scattering (MS) photons in an \invivo optical coherence tomography image. This method combines a specially designed image acquisition (i.e., optical coherence tomography scan) scheme and subsequent complex signal processing. For the acquisition, multiple cross-sectional images (frames) are sequentially acquired while the depth position of the focus is altered for each frame by an electrically tunable lens. In the signal processing, the frames are numerically defocus-corrected, and complex averaged. Because of the inconsistency in the MS-photon trajectories among the different electrically tunable lens-induced defocus, this averaging reduces the MS signal. This method was validated using a scattering phantom and in vivo unanesthetized small fish samples, and was found to reduce MS noise even for unanesthetized in vivo measurement.</description>

      <title>Integrated ultrafast all-optical polariton transistors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The clock speed of electronic circuits has been stagnant at a few gigahertz for almost two decades because of the breakdown of Dennard scaling, which states that by shrinking the size of transistors they can operate faster while maintaining the same power consumption. Optical computing could overcome this roadblock, but the lack of materials with suitably strong nonlinear interactions needed to realize all-optical switches has, so far, precluded the fabrication of scalable architectures. Recently, microcavities in the strong light-matter interaction regime enabled all-optical transistors which, when used with an embedded organic material, can operate even at room temperature with sub-picosecond switching times, down to the single-photon level. However, the vertical cavity geometry prevents complex circuits with on-chip coupled transistors. Here, by leveraging silicon photonics technology, we show exciton-polariton condensation at ambient conditions in micrometer-sized, fully integrated high-index contrast grating microcavities filled with an optically active polymer. By coupling two resonators and exploiting seeded polariton condensation, we demonstrate ultrafast all-optical transistor action and cascadability. Our experimental findings open the way for scalable, compact all-optical integrated logic circuits that could process optical signals two orders of magnitude faster than their electrical counterparts.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mechanical force is an essential feature for many physical and biological processes.1-12 Remote measurement of mechanical signals with high sensitivity and spatial resolution is needed for diverse applications, including robotics,13 biophysics,14-20 energy storage,21-24 and medicine.25-27 Nanoscale luminescent force sensors excel at measuring piconewton forces,28-32 while larger sensors have proven powerful in probing micronewton forces.33,34 However, large gaps remain in the force magnitudes that can be probed remotely from subsurface or interfacial sites, and no individual, non-invasive sensor is capable of measuring over the large dynamic range needed to understand many systems.35,36 Here, we demonstrate Tm3+-doped avalanching nanoparticle37 force sensors that can be addressed remotely by deeply penetrating near-infrared (NIR) light and can detect piconewton to micronewton forces with a dynamic range spanning more than four orders of magnitude. Using atomic force microscopy coupled with single-nanoparticle optical spectroscopy, we characterize the mechanical sensitivity of the photon avalanching process and reveal its exceptional force responsiveness. By manipulating the Tm3+ concentrations and energy transfer within the nanosensors, we demonstrate different optical force-sensing modalities, including mechanobrightening and mechanochromism. The adaptability of these nanoscale optical force sensors, along with their multiscale sensing capability, enable operation in the dynamic and versatile environments present in real-world, complex structures spanning biological organisms to nanoelectromechanical systems (NEMS).</description>

      <title>Atomic magnetometry using a metasurface polarizing beamsplitter in silicon on sapphire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.02102</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.02102v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate atomic magnetometry using a metasurface polarizing beamsplitter fabricated on a silicon-on-sapphire (SOS) platform. The metasurface splits a beam that is near-resonant with the rubidium atoms (795 nm) into orthogonal linear polarizations, enabling measurement of magnetically sensitive circular birefringence in a rubidium vapor through balanced polarimetry. We incorporated the metasurface into an atomic magnetometer based on nonlinear magneto-optical rotation and measured sub-nanotesla sensitivity, which is limited by low-frequency technical noise and transmission loss through the metasurface. To our knowledge, this work represents the first demonstration of SOS nanophotonics for atom-based sensing and paves the way for highly integrated, miniaturized atomic sensors with enhanced sensitivity and portability.</description>

      <title>Emergence of collective spectral features in finite arrays of dielectric rods</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodic optical structures, such as diffraction grating and numerous photonic crystals, are one of the staples of modern nanophotonics for the manipulation of electromagnetic radiation. The array of subwavelength dielectric rods is one of the simplest platforms, which, despite its simplicity exhibits extraordinary wave phenomena, such as diffraction anomalies and narrow reflective resonances. Despite the well-documented properties of infinite periodic systems, the behavior of these diffractive effects in systems incorporating a finite number of elements is studied to a far lesser extent. Here we study theoretically and numerically the evolution of collective spectral features in finite arrays of dielectric rods. We develop an analytical model of light scattering by a finite array of circular rods based on the coupled dipoles approximation and analyze the spectral features of finite arrays within the developed model. Finally, we validate the results of the analytical model using full-wave numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Design of reconfigurable Huygens metasurfaces based on Drude-like scatterers operating in the epsilon-negative regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01315v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the feasibility of designing reconfigurable transmitting metasurfaces through the use of Drude-like scatterers with purely electric response. Theoretical and numerical analyses are provided to demonstrate that the response of spherical Drude-like scatterers can be tailored to achieve complete transmission, satisfying a generalized Kerker's condition at half of their plasma frequency. This phenomenon, which arises from the co-excitation of the electric dipole and the electric quadrupole within the scatterer, also exhibits moderate broadband performance. Subsequently, we present the application of these particles as meta-atoms in the design of reconfigurable multipolar Huygens metasurfaces, outlining the technical prerequisites for achieving effective beam-steering capabilities. Finally, we explore a plausible implementation of these low-loss Drude-like scatterers at microwave frequencies using plasma discharges. Our findings propose an alternative avenue for Huygens metasurface designs, distinct from established approaches relying on dipolar meta-atoms or on core-shell geometries. Unlike these conventional methods, our approach fosters seamless integration of reconfigurability strategies in beam-steering devices.</description>

      <title>Harnessing Data and Physics for Deep Learning Phase Recovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01360</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01360v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase recovery, calculating the phase of a light wave from its intensity measurements, is essential for various applications, such as coherent diffraction imaging, adaptive optics, and biomedical imaging. It enables the reconstruction of an object's refractive index distribution or topography as well as the correction of imaging system aberrations. In recent years, deep learning has been proven to be highly effective in addressing phase recovery problems. Two main deep learning phase recovery strategies are data-driven (DD) with supervised learning mode and physics-driven (PD) with self-supervised learning mode. DD and PD achieve the same goal in different ways and lack the necessary study to reveal similarities and differences. Therefore, in this paper, we comprehensively compare these two deep learning phase recovery strategies in terms of time consumption, accuracy, generalization ability, ill-posedness adaptability, and prior capacity. What's more, we propose a co-driven (CD) strategy of combining datasets and physics for the balance of high- and low-frequency information. The codes for DD, PD, and CD are publicly available at https://github.com/kqwang/DLPR.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01711v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light is characterized by its electric field, yet quantum optics has revealed the importance of monitoring photon-photon correlations at all orders. We here present a comparative study of two experimental setups, composed of cold and warm Rubidium atoms, respectively, which allow us to probe and compare photon correlations up to the fourth order. The former operates in the quantum regime where spontaneous emission dominates, whereas the latter exhibits a temperature-limited coherence time. While both setups present almost-chaotic light statistics, we discuss how the access to different orders of photon correlations allows one to better characterize the mechanisms responsible for deviations from those statistics.</description>

      <title>Robust Free-Space Optical Communication Utilizing Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.07329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.07329v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Free-space optical (FSO) communication can be subject to various types of distortion and loss as the signal propagates through non-uniform media. In experiment and simulation, we demonstrate that the state of polarization and degree of polarization of light passed though underwater bubbles, causing turbulence, is preserved. Our experimental setup serves as an efficient, low cost alternative approach to long distance atmospheric or underwater testing. We compare our experimental results with those of simulations, in which we model underwater bubbles, and separately, atmospheric turbulence. Our findings suggest potential improvements in polarization based FSO communication schemes.</description>

      <title>Parametric All-Optical Modulation on Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10367v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We demonstrate parametric all-optical modulation in a periodically-poled lithium niobate microring resonator on chip. It employs quantum Zeno blockade between two distinct waves, a signal and a pump, through their sum-frequency generation at a large per-photon efficiency of 8.2 MHz. With nanosecond pump pulses at 6 mW peak power, 85.7% modulation extinction is observed, marking over 30~times efficiency improvement across various previous implementations. With only 2 mW pump peak power, 43.0% modulation extinction is observed for a doubly-stronger signal at 4 mW. This demonstrates, for the first time, that optical transistors with cascadability and fan-out are possible with just parametric nonlinear optics. These results, together with inherent advantages in such photonic integrated circuits, open the door to scalable technology for all-optical and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Rotating-modulated Higher-Order Topological States in a Split-ring Photonic Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00229</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00229v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The emerging field of topology has brought device effects to a new level. Higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) go beyond traditional descriptions of bulk-edge correspondence, broadening the understanding of topologically insulating phases. In this paper, a second-order split-ring photonic crystal (SSPC) with zero-dimensional (0D) corner states and one-dimensional (1D) edge states is proposed. Based on the coupling strength determined by the opening direction between the split-rings, the electronic transition strength of the electronic system is imitated, and the topological trivial and non-trivial transformation of the topological two-dimensional (2D) SSH model are realized by using the rotating split-ring lattice. Theory and simulation find that SSPC has non-trivial topological edge states that can be quantified by bulk polarization. As the opening direction of the split-rings gradually changes within one period, there will be transitions between four different topological polarizations of the lowest energy bands, which can be conveniently used to achieve transitions between different topological phases. Our research can be extended to higher dimensions and broaden research paths for higher-order photonic topological insulators and semimetals.</description>

      <title>Chaotic dynamics under the influence of synthetic magnetic field in optomechanical system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.00472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.00472v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The optomechanical systems produce chaotic behaviour due to nonlinear interaction between photons and phonons, and the same systems are used to understand the synthetic fields as well. Here, we report on the study of chaotic behaviour in the presence of a phononic synthetic magnetic field in a closed loop configuration consisting of a single optical mode and two mechanical modes. The modulation phase of the mechanical coupling between the two mechanical modes plays a critical role in determining the mechanical and optical intensity dynamics in the nonlinear regime. Our study shows the dark mode breaking effect in the presence of a synthetic magnetic field, which brings about a complex way of mechanical energy exchange that causes the cavity field to alternate between chaotic and regular behaviour periodically in temporal domain. However in the stronger nonlinear regime the temporal dynamics demonstrate predominantly chaotic behaviour. Besides, with the advent of advanced fabrication technologies, this study holds promises in developing phase tunable integrated low-power chaotic light sources to support efficient optical secure communication systems.</description>

      <title>Out-of-focus holography at the Effelsberg telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.00006</link>
      <description>arXiv:2109.00006v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Out-of-focus (OOF) holography can be used to determine aperture deformations of radio telescopes that lead to errors in the phase of the complex aperture distribution. In contrast to traditional methods, OOF holography can be performed without a reference antenna, which has a number of practical advantages. The aim of this work is to develop a standard procedure for OOF holography at the Effelsberg telescope. This includes performing OOF holography observations and the development of a dedicated software, the pyoof package, to compute aberrations of the telescope's optical system. Based on the OOF holography method developed at the Green Bank telescope, we adapted the approach to the Effelsberg 100-m telescope in order to determine the aberrations of the aperture phase distribution (phase-error maps). The developed OOF holography software is presented as well as the results from observations at Effelsberg. Early results reveal gravitationally-caused residual deformation not contained in the previously existing aperture and pointing model, and hence we propose to make changes to the model to counteract aberrations in the telescope's surface. The OOF holography method (observations and pyoof package) works as expected at the Effelsberg 100-m telescope and is able to validate the good performance of the existing finite element model. Test measurements show that slight improvements of the aperture efficiency and gain elevation dependence are possible but limited in the current configuration.</description>

      <title>Spectral stability of V2 centres in sub-micron 4H-SiC membranes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.12617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Colour centres in silicon carbide emerge as a promising semiconductor quantum technology platform with excellent spin-optical coherences.However, recent efforts towards maximising the photonic efficiency via integration into nanophotonic structures proved to be challenging due to reduced spectral stabilities. Here, we provide a large-scale systematic investigation on silicon vacancy centres in thin silicon carbide membranes with thicknesses down to $0.25\,\rm\mu m$. Our membrane fabrication process involves a combination of chemical mechanical polishing, reactive ion etching, and subsequent annealing. This leads to highly reproducible membranes with roughness values of $3-4\,\rm\r{A}$, as well as negligible surface fluorescence. We find that silicon vacancy centres show close-to lifetime limited optical linewidths with almost no signs of spectral wandering down to membrane thicknesses of $0.7 \,\rm\mu m$. For silicon vacancy centres in thinner membranes down to $0.25\,\rm\mu m$, we observe spectral wandering, however, optical linewidths remain below $200\,\rm MHz$, which is compatible with spin-selective excitation schemes. Our work clearly shows that silicon vacancy centres can be integrated into sub-micron silicon carbide membranes, which opens the avenue towards obtaining the necessary improvements in photon extraction efficiency based on nanophotonic structuring.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.06859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce universal, easy-to-reproduce generative models for the QUBO instances to differentiate the performance of the hardware/solvers effectively. Our benchmark process extends the well-known Hebb's rule of associative memory with the asymmetric pattern weights. We provide a comprehensive overview of calculations conducted across various scales and using different classes of dynamical equations. Our aim is to analyze their results, including factors such as the probability of encountering the ground state, planted state, spurious state, or states falling outside the predetermined energy range. Moreover, the generated problems show additional properties, such as the easy-hard-easy complexity transition and complicated cluster structures of planted solutions. Our method establishes a prospective platform to potentially address other questions related to the fundamental principles behind device physics and algorithms for novel computing machines.</description>

      <title>Passive and Deterministic Controlled-phase Gate for Single-photon Wavepackets Based on Time-reversal Symmetric Photon Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.10719v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the construction of a passive, deterministic and near unity-fidelity controlled-$\pi$-phase gate for single-photon wavepackets with a node comprising a two-level emitter and a small number of cavities. The proposed gate is rooted in the principle of time-reversal symmetric photon transport, which makes the entire photon transport process through the node into a perfect absorption and re-emission process. Consequently, it can circumvent the longstanding issue of wavepacket distortion inherent in photonic phase gates employing nonlinear media. Through such a time-reversal symmetric wavepacket transport process, the two-level emitter induces a nonlinear $\pi$ phase shift for the case of two-photon transport. Notably, for both single-photon and two-photon operations, the gate fidelity can exceed 99\% for a node with only four cavities. Moreover, our proposed gate architecture is compatible with the platforms of integrated photonics.</description>

      <title>Random matrix model of Kolmogorov-Zakharov turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11545v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a random matrix model of Kolmogorov-Zakharov turbulence in a nonlinear purely dynamical finite size system with many degrees of freedom. For the case of a direct cascade the energy and norm pumping takes place at low energy scales with absorption at high energies. For a pumping strength above a certain chaos border a global chaotic attractor appears with a stationary energy flow through a Hamiltonian inertial energy interval. In this regime, the steady-state norm distribution is described by an algebraic decay with an exponent in agreement with the Kolmogorov-Zakharov theory. Below the chaos border the system is located in the quasi-integrable regime similar to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory and the turbulence is suppressed. For the inverse cascade the system rapidly enters a strongly nonlinear regime where the weak turbulence description is invalid. We argue that such a dynamical turbulence is generic showing that it is present in other lattice models with disorder and Anderson localization. We point out that such dynamical models can be realized in multimode optical fibers.</description>

      <title>Optimal probe states for single-mode quantum target detection in arbitrary object reflectivity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05726v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum target detection (QTD) utilizes nonclassical resources to enable radar-like detection for identifying reflecting objects in challenging environments, surpassing classical methods. To fully leverage the quantum advantage in QTD, determining the optimal probe states (OPSs) across various detection parameters and gaining a deeper understanding of their characteristics are crucial. In this study, we identified the single-mode continuous-variable OPSs for arbitrary object reflectivity using optimization algorithms. Our findings suggest that OPSs are non-Gaussian states in most reflectivity scenarios, with exceptions under specific conditions. Furthermore, we provide a comprehensive physical interpretation of the observed phenomena. This study offers a tool for identifying OPSs along with a clear physical interpretation. It also contributes to further advancements towards optimal multi-mode QTD, which has the potential for broad applications in quantum sensing and metrology.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19989v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Communication and sensing technology play a significant role in various aspects of modern society. A seamless combination of the communication and the sensing systems is desired and have attracted great interests in recent years. Here, we propose and demonstrate a network architecture that integrating the downstream quantum access network (DQAN) and vibration sensing in optical fibers. By encoding the key information of eight users simultaneously on the sidemode quantum states of a single laser source and successively separating them by a filter network, we achieve a secure and efficient DQAN with an average key rate of 1.88*10^4 bits per second over an 80 km single-mode fiber. Meanwhile, the vibration location with spatial resolution of 120 m, 24 m, and 8 m at vibration frequencies of 100 Hz, 1 kHz, and 10 kHz, respectively, is implemented with the existing infrastructure of the DQAN system. Our integrated architecture provides a viable and cost-effective solution for building a secure quantum communication sensor network, and open the way for expanding the functionality of quantum communication networks.</description>
