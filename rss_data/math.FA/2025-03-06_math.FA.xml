      <title>$C$-existence families, $C$-semigroups and their associated abstract Cauchy problems in complete random normed modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03096</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03096v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce the notion of a (mild) $C$-existence family in complete random normed modules, then we prove that a (mild) $C$-existence family can guarantee the existence of the (mild) solutions of the associated abstract Cauchy problem in the random setting. Second, we investigate several important properties peculiar to locally almost surely bounded $C$-semigroups in complete random normed modules, which are not involved in the classical theory of $C$-semigroups. Finally, based on the above work, some relations among $C$-existence families, $C$-semigroups and their associated abstract Cauchy problems in complete random normed modules are established, which extend and improve some known results. Besides, an application to a type of stochastic differential equations is also given.</description>

      <title>Khintchine inequalities and $Z_2$ sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we show that the subset of integers that satisfies the Khintchine inequality for $p=1$ with the optimal constant ${\sqrt{2}}$ has to be a $Z_2$ set. We further prove a similar result for a large class of discrete groups. Our arguments rely on previous works by Haagerup/Musat \cite{Haagerup2007}, and Haagerup/Itoh \cite{Haagerup1995}.</description>

      <title>The Hille-Yosida theorem for $C$-semigroups on a complete random normed module</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we first introduce the notion of the Laplace transform for an abstract-valued function on a complete random normed module $\mathcal{S}$. Then, utilizing the countable concatenation property of the $(\varepsilon, \lambda)-$topology on $\mathcal{S}$, we prove the differentiability, Post-Widder inversion formula and uniqueness of such a Laplace transform. Second, based on the above work, we establish the Hille-Yosida theorem for an exponentially bounded $C$-semigroup on $\mathcal{S}$, considering both the dense and nondense cases of the range of $C$, respectively, which extends and improves several important results. Besides, an example constructed in this paper exhibits that the domain of the generator $A$ of an exponentially bounded $C$-semigroup may not be dense on a nontrivial complete random normed module. Finally, we also apply such a Laplace transform to abstract Cauchy problems in the random setting.</description>

      <title>A Local Version of Hardy-type Spaces Associated with Ball Quasi-Banach Spaces and Non-negative Self-adjoint Operators on Spaces of Homogeneous Type and Their Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $(\mathbb{X},\,d,\,\mu)$ be a space of homogeneous type in the sense of Coifman and Weiss, $X$ be a ball quasi-Banach function space on $\mathbb{X}$, $L$ be a non-negative self-adjoint operator on $L^2(\mathbb{X})$, and assume that, for all $t&gt;0$, the semigroup $e^{-tL}$ has an integral representation whose kernel satisfies a Gaussian upper bound condition. In this paper, we first study a local version of Hardy space $h^{X}_L(\mathbb{X})$ associated with ball quasi-Banach space $X$ and non-negative self-adjoint operator $L$, which is an extension of Goldberg's result [Duke Math. J. {\bf46} (1979), no. 1, 27-42; MR0523600]. Even in the case of Euclidean space (that is, $\mathbb{X}=\mathbb{R}^d$), all of these results are still new.</description>

      <title>The Jordan decomposition and Kaplansky's second test problem for Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1954, I. Kaplansky proposed three test problems for deciding the strength of structural understanding of a class of mathematical objects in his treatise "Infinite abelian groups", which can be formulated for very general mathematical systems. In this paper, we focus on Kaplansky's second test problem in a context of complex geometry. Let $H^2_{\beta}$ be a weighted Hardy space. The Cowen-Douglas operator theory tells us that each $h\in\textrm{Hol}(\overline{\mathbb{D}})$ induces a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle on $H^2_{\beta}$, denoted by $E_{h(S_\beta)}(\Omega)$, where $\Omega$ is a domain. We show that the vector bundle $E_{h(S_\beta)}$ is a push-forwards Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle and study the similarity deformation problems. Our main theorem is that if $H^2_{\beta}$ is a weighted Hardy space of polynomial growth, then for any $f\in \textrm{Hol}(\overline{\mathbb{D}})$, there exists a unique positive integer $m$ and an function $h\in\textrm{Hol}(\overline{\mathbb{D}})$ inducing an indecomposable vector bundle $E_{h(S_{\beta})}$, such that $E_{f(S_\beta)}$ is similar to $\bigoplus_1^m E_{h(S_\beta)}$, where $h$ is unique in the sense of analytic automorphism group action. That could be seemed as a Jordan decomposition theorem for the push-forwards Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles. Furthermore, we give the similarity classification of those push-forwards Hermitian holomorphic vector bundles induced by analytic functions, and give an affirmative answer to Kaplansky's second test problem for those objects. We also give an affirmative answer to the geometric version and generalized version of a problem proposed by R. Douglas in 2007, and obtain the $K_0$-group of the commutant algebra of a multiplication operator on a weighted Hardy space of polynomial growth. In addition, we give an example to show the setting of polynomial growth condition is necessary.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new isomorphic quantity for Banach spaces, the index $\Theta_X$, based on finite convex coverings of the unit ball. This index is closely related to the asymptotic moduli of uniform convexity and uniform smoothness, so that it can be calculated for several classical Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>The Borg-Marchenko uniqueness theorem for complex potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.03248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new theoretical concept of $\textit{spectral pair}$ for a Schr\"{o}dinger operator $H$ in $L^2(\mathbb{R}_{+})$ with a bounded $\textit{complex-valued}$ potential. The spectral pair consists of a measure and a complex-valued function, both of which are defined on $\mathbb{R}_{+}$. We show that in many ways, the spectral pair generalises the classical spectral measure to the non-self-adjoint case. First, extending the classical Borg-Marchenko theorem, we prove a uniqueness result: the spectral pair uniquely determines the potential. Second, we derive asymptotic formulas for the spectral pair in the spirit of the classical result of Marchenko. In the case of real-valued potentials, we relate the spectral pair to the spectral measure of $H$. Lastly, we provide formulas for the spectral pair at a~simple eigenvalue of $|H|$.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate heat semigroups on a quantum automorphism group ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$ of a finite dimensional C*-algebra $B$ and its Plancherel trace. We show ultracontractivity, hypercontractivity, and the spectral gap inequality of the heat semigroups on ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$. Furthermore, we obtain the sharpness of the Sobolev embedding property and the Hausdorff-Young inequality of ${\rm Aut}^+(B)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.03678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize bounded multiplication operators in weighted Dirichlet spaces that are power bounded, Ces\`{a}ro bounded and uniformly Kreiss. Moreover, we show the equivalence in such spaces between mean ergodicity and Ces\`{a}ro boundedness for multiplication operators. We perform the same study for adjoints of multiplication operators. As a particular example, we obtain a uniform mean ergodic multiplication operator in Dirichlet spaces that fails to be power bounded.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17373v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite covering by closed convex sets of $B_X$, the unit ball of an infinite-dimensional Banach space, we investigate whether there is a set of the covering that contains balls of radius close to $1$ and (a) arbitrarily high finite dimension or (b) infinite dimension. In case (a) the answer is affirmative, but for the case (b) we just get radius close to $1/2$ and finite codimension under much more restrictive hypotheses.</description>

Abstract: This paper undertakes a thorough investigation of matrix means interpolation and comparison. We expand the parameter $\vartheta$ beyond the closed interval $[0,1]$ to cover the entire positive real line, denoted as $\mathbb{R}^+$. Furthermore, we explore additional outcomes related to Heinz means. We introduce new scalar adaptations of Heinz inequalities, incorporating Kantorovich's constant, and enhance the operator version. Finally, we unveil refined Young's type inequalities designed specifically for traces, determinants, and norms of positive semi-definite matrices.</description>

      <title>On the closability of class totally paranormal operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17260v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article delves into the analysis of various spectral properties pertaining to totally paranormal closed operators, extending beyond the confines of boundedness and encompassing operators defined in a Hilbert space. Within this class, closed symmetric operators are included. Initially, we establish that the spectrum of such an operator is non-empty and provide a characterization of closed-range operators in terms of the spectrum. Building on these findings, we proceed to prove Weyl's theorem, demonstrating that for a densely defined closed totally paranormal operator $T$, the difference between the spectrum $\sigma(T)$ and the Weyl spectrum $\sigma_w(T)$ equals the set of all isolated eigenvalues with finite multiplicities, denoted by $\pi_{00}(T)$. In the final section, we establish the self-adjointness of the Riesz projection $E_{\mu}$ corresponding to any non-zero isolated spectral value $\mu$ of $T$. Furthermore, we show that this Riesz projection satisfies the relationships $\mathrm{ran}(E_{\mu}) = \n(T-\mu I) = \n(T-\mu I)^*$. Additionally, we demonstrate that if $T$ is a closed totally paranormal operator with a Weyl spectrum $\sigma_w(T) = {0}$, then $T$ qualifies as a compact normal operator.</description>

Abstract: The aim of this study is to establish many new inequalities for the operator $A$-norm and $A$-numerical radius of sums of bounded linear operators in Hilbert spaces. In particular, two refinements are made to the generalized triangle inequality for operator norm. Additionally, we examine a number of intriguing uses for two bounded linear operators in the Cartesian decomposition of an operator. These disparities improve and generalize several earlier results in the literature. Some applications of our results are given. We also present some instances to support our results.</description>

      <title>The multilinear fractional sparse operator theory II: refining weighted estimates via multilinear stochastic fractional sparse forms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17300v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Building upon our study of the sparse bounds of generalized commutators of multilinear fractional singular integral operators in \cite{CenSong2412}, this paper seeks to further refine the main results presented in \cite{CenSong2412} in the following key aspects. Firstly, we replace pointwise domination with ($m+1$)-linear stochastic fractional reducing sparse form ${\mathcal B}_{\alpha(\eta) ,\mathcal{S},\tau,\tau',{\vec r},t}^\mathbf{b,k}$, thus providing a new approach to the vector-valued multilinear stochastic fractional sparse domination principle. Additionally, the conditions required for this result are relaxed from multilinear weak type boundedness in \cite{CenSong2412} to multilinear locally weak type boundedness $W_{\vec{p}, q}(X)$, which allows us to extend the main ideas from Lerner \cite{Lerner2019} (2019) and Lorist et al. \cite{Lorist2024} (2024). Secondly, and more importantly, we move away from the original techniques of quantitatively estimating multilinear stochastic fractional sparse operators ${\mathcal A}_{\alpha(\eta),\mathcal{S},\tau,{\vec{r}},t}^\mathbf{b,k,t}$, and instead employ a more powerful multilinear fractional \( \vec{r} \)-type maximal operator $\mathscr{M}_{\alpha(\eta),\vec{r}}$. This necessitates the development of a new class of multilinear fractional weights $ A_{(\vec{p},q),(\vec{r}, s)}(X)$ to quantitatively characterize this maximal operator, followed by revealing the norm equivalence between this maximal operator and the sparse forms introduced earlier, thereby generalizing part of the ideas of Nieraeth \cite{Nier2019} (2019). ......</description>

      <title>On $L_p$ Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities for a general class of functionals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, the $L_p$ version (for $p&gt; 1$) of the dimensional Brunn-Minkowski inequality for the standard Gaussian measure $\gamma_n(\cdot)$ on $\mathbb{R}^n$ is shown. More precisely, we prove that for any $0$-symmetric convex sets with nonempty interior, any $p&gt;1$, and every $\lambda \in (0,1)$, \[ \gamma_n\bigl((1-\lambda)\cdot K+_p \lambda \cdot L\bigr)^{p/n} \geqslant (1-\lambda ) \gamma_n(K)^{p/n} + \lambda \gamma_n(L)^{p/n}, \] with equality, for some $\lambda \in (0,1)$ and $p&gt;1$, if and only if $K=L$. This result, recently established without the equality conditions by Hosle, Kolesnikov and Livshyts, by using a different and functional approach, turns out to be the $L_p$ extension of a celebrated result for the Minkowski sum (that is, for $p=1$) by Eskenazis and Moschidis (2021) on a problem by Gardner and Zvavitch (2010).
  Moreover, an $L_p$ Brunn-Minkowski type inequality is obtained for the classical Wills functional $\mathcal{W}(\cdot)$ of convex bodies.
  These results are derived as a consequence of a more general approach, which provides us with other remarkable examples of functionals satisfying $L_p$ Brunn-Minkowski type inequalities, such as different absolutely continuous measures with radially decreasing densities.</description>
