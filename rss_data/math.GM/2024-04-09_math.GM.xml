      <title>Beta Distribution of Long Memory Sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05736</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05736v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three long memory models, ARFIMA, Timmer and Konig 1995, and a circular convolution model based on Wold's representation theorem are examined. Each model is shown to produce sequences with nonstationary generalized beta marginal distributions. It is demonstrated that the variance divided by the squared range of the sequence is stationary, and is a function of the shape parameter of the resulting symmetric beta distribution. Using the Wold model, a simple matrix distribution transformation is given that maps the normal components of the long memory model onto the beta distribution.</description>

      <title>On Generalized Bihyperbolic Third-order Jacobsthal Polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05738v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, a new generalization of third-order Jacobsthal bihyperbolic polynomials is introduced. Some of the properties of presented polynomials are given. A Vadja formula for the generalized bihyperbolic third-order Jacobsthal polynomials is obtained. This result implies the Catalan, Cassini and d'Ocagne identities. Moreover, generating function and matrix generators for these polynomials are presented.</description>

      <title>The Relativistic Rotation Transformation and the Observer Manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05744</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05744v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that relativistic rotation transformations represent transfer maps between the laboratory system and a local observer on an observer manifold, rather than an event manifold, in the spirit of C-equivalence. Rotation is, therefore, not a parameterised motion on a background space or spacetime, but is determined by a particular sequence of tetrads related by specific special Lorentz transformations or boosts. Because such Lorentz boosts do not form a group, these tetrads represent distinct observers that cannot put together their local descriptions into a manifold in the usual sense. The choice of observer manifold depends on the dynamical situation under consideration, and is not solely determined by the kinematics. Three examples are given: Franklin's rotation transformation for uniform plane rotation, the Thomas precession of a vector attached to an electron, and the motion of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field. In each case, at each point of its trajectory, there is a distinguished tetrad and a special Lorentz transformation that maps Minkowski space to the spacetime of the local observer on the curve.</description>

      <title>On a useful lemma that relates quasi-nonexpansive and demicontractive mappings in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a brief account on a basic result (Lemma \ref{lem2}) which is a very useful tool in proving various convergence theorems in the framework of the iterative approximation of fixed points of demicontractive mappings in Hilbert spaces. This Lemma relates the class of quasi-nonexpansive mappings, by one hand, and the class of $k$-demicontractive mappings (quasi $k$-strict pseudocontractions), on the other hand and essentially states that the class of demicontractive mappings, which strictly includes the class of quasi-nonexpansive mappings, can be embedded in the later by means of an averaged perturbation. From the point of view of the fixed point problem, this means that any convergence result for Krasnoselskij-Mann iterative algorithms in the class of $k$-demicontractive mappings can be derived from its corresponding counterpart from quasi-nonexpansive mappings.</description>

      <title>Existence and approximation of fixed points of enriched contractions in quasi-Banach spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We obtain results on the existence and approximation of fixed points of enriched contractions in quasi-Banach spaces and thus extend the results obtained in the case of contractions defined on Banach spaces [Berinde, V.; P\u{a}curar, M. Approximating fixed points of enriched contractions in Banach spaces. J. Fixed Point Theory Appl. 22 (2020), no. 2, Paper No. 38, 10 pp.]. We illustrate the obtained theoretical results by providing an example of an enriched contraction in a quasi-Banach space which is not a Banach space to show that our new results are effective generalizations of the previous ones in literature.</description>

      <title>Generalizing the Eight Levels Theorem: A Journey to Mersenne Prime Discoveries and New Polynomial Classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.05772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mersenne primes, renowned for their captivating form as $2^p - 1$, have intrigued mathematicians for centuries. In this paper, we embark on a captivating quest to unveil the intricate nature of Mersenne primes, seamlessly integrating methods with the Eight Levels Theorem. Initially, we extend the Eight Levels Theorem and introduce an innovative approach that harmoniously combines arithmetic and differential techniques to compute the coefficients of the polynomial expansions of $x^n + y^n$ in terms of binary quadratic forms. This endeavor leads us to the genesis of novel polynomial sequences as we scrutinize the coefficients within this expansion. Our research unearths previously uncharted connections between Mersenne numbers and the derivatives of specific polynomial sequences. By forging this linkage, we not only enhance our understanding of Mersenne primes but also bridge the divide between well-established sequences in number theory and differential equations. This broadens the applicability of our findings across diverse scientific domains, revealing fresh avenues for exploration in number theory and beyond. These polynomial bridges serve as conduits between these sequences, unveiling exciting prospects for future research. This interdisciplinary exploration opens up exciting possibilities for the broader implications of Mersenne primes, extending their significance beyond the realm of pure mathematics. In our paper, we also delve into the intriguing influence of the Golden Ratio constant, which unveils segments reminiscent of the beauty found in nature, adding an unexpected dimension to the world of arithmetic. In this harmonious journey, the allure of Mersenne primes resonates through the symphony of mathematical discovery.</description>

      <title>Disproof of the Riemann Hypothesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Riemann Hypothesis is a conjecture that all non-trivial zeros of Riemann Zeta function are located on the critical line in the complex plane. Hundreds of propositions in function theory and analytic number theory rely on this hypothesis. However, the problem has been unresolved for over a century. Here we show that at least one set of quadruplet-zeros exists outside the critical line through expanding the infinite product of the Riemann Xi zero function. We found that assuming there are no zeros outside the critical line will result in a contradiction with the known result that the reciprocal sum of all zeros of the xi-function is a constant, thereby refuting the Riemann Hypothesis.</description>
