      <title>Existence of Weak Solutions for a Nonlocal Klausmeier Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish the existence of weak solutions for a nonlocal Klausmeier model within a small time interval $[0, T)$. The Klausmeier model is a coupled, nonlinear system of partial differential equations governing plant biomass and water dynamics in semiarid regions. The original model posits that plants disperse their seed according to classical diffusion. Instead, we opt for a nonlocal diffusive operator in alignment with ecological field data that validates long-range dispersive behaviors of plants and seeds. The equations, defined on a finite interval in $\mathbb{R}$, feature homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions for the water equation and nonlocal Dirichlet volume constraints for the plant biomass equation. The nonlocal operator involves convolution with a symmetric and spatially extended convolution kernel possessing mild integrability and regularity properties. We employ the Galerkin method to establish the existence of weak solutions. The key challenge comes from the nonlocal operator; we define it on a subspace of $L^{2}$ instead of $H^{1}$, precluding the use of Aubin's compactness theorem to prove the weak convergence of nonlinear terms. To overcome this, we modify the model and introduce two new equations for the spatial derivatives of plant biomass and water. This procedure allows us to recover enough regularity to establish compactness and complete the proof.</description>

      <title>Fast-slow chemical reactions: convergence of Hamilton-Jacobi equation and variational representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microscopic behaviors of chemical reactions can be described by a random time-changed Poisson process, whose large-volume limit determines the macroscopic behaviors of species concentrations, including both typical and non-typical trajectories. When the reaction intensities (or fluxes) exhibit a separation of fast-slow scales, the macroscopic typical trajectory is governed by a system of $\varepsilon$-dependent nonlinear reaction rate equations (RRE), while the non-typical trajectories deviating from the typical ones are characterized by an $\varepsilon$-dependent exponentially nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi equation (HJE). In this paper, for general chemical reactions, we study the fast-slow limit as $\varepsilon\to 0$ for the viscosity solutions of the associated HJE with a state-constrained boundary condition. We identify the limiting effective HJE on a slow manifold, along with an effective variational representation for the solution. Through the uniform convergence of the viscosity solutions and the $\Gamma$-convergence of the variational solution representations, we rigorously show that all non-typical (and also typical) trajectories are concentrated on the slow manifold and the effective macroscopic dynamics are described by the coarse-grained RRE and HJE, respectively. This approach for studying the fast-slow limit is applicable to, but not limited to, reversible chemical reactions described by gradient flows.</description>

      <title>Nonexistence of global weak solutions for a wave equation with nonlinear memory and damping terms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the nonexistence of global weak solutions for a wave equation with nonlinear memory and damping terms. We give an answer to an open problem posed in [M. D'Abbicco, A wave equation with structural damping and nonlinear memory, Nonlinear Differ. Equ. Appl. 21 (2014), 751-773]. Moreover, comparing with the existing results, our results do not require any positivity condition of the initial values. The proof of our results is based on the asymptotic properties of solutions for an integral inequality.</description>

      <title>Coupling and Tensorization of Kinetic Theory and Graph Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14512</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14512v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a non-exchangeable multi-agent system and rigorously derive a strong form of the mean-field limit. The convergence of the connection weights and the initial data implies convergence of large-scale dynamics toward a deterministic limit given by the corresponding extended Vlasov PDE, at any later time and any realization of randomness. This is established on what we call a bi-coupling distance defined through a convex optimization problem, which is an interpolation of the optimal transport between measures and the fractional overlay between graphs. The proof relies on a quantitative stability estimate of the so-called observables, which are tensorizations of agent laws and graph homomorphism densities. This reveals a profound relationship between mean-field theory and graph limiting theory, intersecting in the study of non-exchangeable systems.</description>

      <title>Microlocal analysis of double fibration transforms with conjugate points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the structure of normal operators of double fibration transforms with conjugate points. Examples of double fibration transforms include Radon transforms, $d$-plane transforms on the Euclidean space, geodesic X-ray transforms, light-ray transforms, and ray transforms defined by null bicharacteristics associated with real principal type operators. We show that, under certain stable conditions on the distribution of conjugate points, the normal operator splits into an elliptic pseudodifferential operator and several Fourier integral operators, depending on the degree of the conjugate points. These results were first proved for geodesic X-ray transforms by Holman and Uhlmann (Journal of Differential Geometry, {\bf 108} (2018), pp.459--494).</description>

      <title>Uniqueness and nondegeneracy of ground states for 2d-nonlinear scalar field equations with point interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study uniqueness and nondegeneracy of ground states for nonlinear scalar field equations in two dimensions with a point interaction at the origin. It is known that the all ground states are radial, positive, and decreasing functions. In this paper we prove the uniqueness of positive radial solutions by a method of Poho\v{z}aev identities. As a corollary, we obtain the uniqueness of ground states. Moreover, by a variational and ODE technique, we show that the ground state is a nondegenerate critical point of the action in the energy space.</description>

      <title>Local elliptic regularity for solutions to stationary Fokker-Planck equations via Dirichlet forms and resolvents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14636v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we show that, for a solution to the stationary Fokker-Planck equation with general coefficients, defined as a measure with an $L^2$-density, this density not only exhibits $H^{1,2}$-regularity but also H\"{o}lder continuity. To achieve this, we first construct a reference measure $\mu=\rho dx$ by utilizing existence and elliptic regularity results for homogeneous boundary value problems, ensuring that the given divergence-type operator corresponds to a sectorial Dirichlet form. By employing elliptic regularity results for both divergence and non-divergence type equations, we demonstrate that the image of the resolvent operator associated with the sectorial Dirichlet form has $H^{2,2}$-regularity. Furthermore, through calculations based on the Dirichlet form and the $H^{2,2}$-regularity of the resolvent operator, we prove that the density of the solution measure for the stationary Fokker-Planck equation is, indeed, the weak limit of $H^{1,2}$-functions defined via the resolvent operator. Our results highlight the central role of Dirichlet form theory and resolvent approximations in establishing the regularity of solutions to stationary Fokker-Planck equations with general coefficients.</description>

      <title>Geometrical optics for the fractional Helmholtz equation and applications to inverse problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14698</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14698v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we construct a parametrix for the fractional Helmholtz equation $((-\Delta)^s - \tau^{2s} r(x)^{2s} + q(x))u=0$ making use of geometrical optics solutions. We show that the associated eikonal equation is the same as in the classical case, while in the first transport equation the effect of nonlocality is only visible in the zero-th order term, which depends on $s$. Moreover, we show that the approximate geometrical optics solutions present different behaviors in the regimes $s\in(0,\frac 12)$ and $s\in [\frac 12,1)$. While the latter case is quite similar to the classical one, which corresponds to $s=1$, in the former case we find that the potential is a strong perturbation, which changes the propagation of singularities. As an application, we study the inverse problem consisting in recovering the potential $q$ from Cauchy data when the refraction index $r$ is fixed and simple. Using our parametrix based on the construction of approximate geometrical optics solutions, we prove that H\"older stability holds for this problem. This is a substantial improvement over the state of the art for fractional wave equations, for which the usual Runge approximation argument can provide only logarithmic stability. Besides its mathematical novelty, this study is motivated by envisioned applications in nonlocal elasticity models emerging from the geophysical sciences.</description>

      <title>Admissibility theory in abstract Sobolev scales and transfer function growth at high frequencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For strongly continous semigroups on Hilbert spaces, we investigate admissibility properties of control and observation operators shifted along continuous scales of spaces built by means of either interpolation and extrapolation or functional calculus. Our results show equivalence of admissibility in, on the one hand, a fractional domain of the generator and, on the other hand, a (different, in general) quadratic interpolation space of the same "Sobolev order". Furthermore, such properties imply quantified resolvent bounds in the original state space topology. When the semigroup is a group, the resulting frequency-domain estimates are in fact equivalent to the aforementioned time-domain properties. In the case of systems with both control and observation, we are able to translate input-output regularity properties into high-frequency growth rates of operator-valued transfer functions. As an application, based on results by Lasiecka, Triggiani and Tataru on interior and boundary regularity of the wave equation under Neumann control, we derive optimal asymptotics for the Neumann-to-Dirichlet wave transfer function. With that in hand, we establish non-uniform energy decay rates for the wave equation posed in a rectangle and subject to Neumann damping on an arbitrary open subset of the boundary.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14813v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study stationary solutions of McKean-Vlasov equation on a high-dimensional sphere and other compact Riemannian manifolds. We extend the equivalence of the energetic problem formulation to the manifold setting and characterize critical points of the corresponding free energy functional. On a sphere, we employ the properties of spherical convolution to study the bifurcation branches around the uniform state. We also give a sufficient condition for an existence of a discontinuous transition point in terms of the interaction kernel and compare it to the Euclidean setting. We illustrate our results on a range of system, including the particle system arising from the transformer models and the Onsager model of liquid crystals.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.14817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study an inverse boundary value problem in corrosion detection. The model is based on a conductivity equation with nonlinear Robin boundary condition. We prove that the nonlinear Robin term can be identified locally from Cauchy data measurements on a subset of the boundary. A possible strategy for turning a local identification result into a global one is suggested, and a partial result is proved in this direction. The inversion method is an adaptation to this nonlinear Robin problem of a method originally developed for semilinear elliptic equations. The strategy is based on linearization and relies on parametrizing solutions of the nonlinear equation on solutions of the linearized equation.</description>

Abstract: The asymptotic behaviour of the Hartree equation is studied for short-range interaction potentials near translation-invariant steady states satisfying the Penrose stability condition. Phase-mixing estimates in finite regularity are derived, demonstrating density decay and scattering of solutions in weighted quantum Sobolev spaces. These results provide a quantum analogue of Landau damping in classical plasma physics and remain uniform in the semiclassical limit, bridging the quantum and classical regimes.</description>

      <title>Constant rank operators in Korn-Maxwell-Sobolev inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14866v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We focus on Korn-Maxwell-Sobolev inequalities for operators of reduced constant rank. These inequalities take the form \[ \|P - \Pi_{\mathbb{B}} \Pi_{\ker\mathscr{A}} P\|_{\dot{\mathrm{W}}^{k-1, p^*}(\mathbb{R}^n)} \le c \, (\|\mathscr{A}[P]\|_{\dot{\mathrm{W}}^{k-1, p^*}(\mathbb{R}^n)} + \|\mathbb{B} P\|_{\mathrm{L}^p(\mathbb{R}^n)}) \] for all $ P \in \mathrm{C}_c^\infty(\mathbb{R}^n; V) $, where $ V $ is a finite-dimensional vector space, $ \mathscr{A} $ is a linear mapping, and $ \mathbb{B} $ is a constant coefficient homogeneous differential operator of order $ k $. In particular, we can treat the combination $(p,\mathscr{A},\mathbb{B},k)=(1,\operatorname{tr},\operatorname{Curl},1)$. Our results generalize the techniques from Gmeineder et al. (Math.Mod.Met.Appl.Sci,34:03,2024; arXiv:2405.10349), which exclusively dealt with reduced elliptic operators. In contrast to the reduced ellipticity case, however, the reduced constant rank case necessitates to introduce a correction, namely the projection $\Pi_\mathbb{B}$ on the left-hand side of the inequality.</description>

      <title>Dispersive Effective Metasurface Model for Bubbly Media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14895v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive the effective transmission condition for a cluster of acoustic subwavelength resonators, modeled as small-scaled bubbles distributed not necessarily periodically along a smooth, bounded hypersurface, which need not be flat. The transmission condition specifies that the jump in the normal derivative of the acoustic field is proportional to its second time derivative, convoluted in time with a sinusoidal kernel. This kernel has a period determined by the common subwavelength resonance (specifically, the Minnaert resonance in this case). This dispersive transmission condition can also be interpreted as a Dirac-like surface potential that is convoluted in the time domain and spatially supported on the specified hypersurface. We highlight the following features: 1. High resonance regime: When the common resonance is large, the surface behaves as fully transparent, permitting complete transmission of the acoustic field. 2. Moderate resonance regime: For moderate resonance values, the surface acts as a screen with memory effects, capturing the dispersive behavior induced by the resonance. 3. Low resonance regime: When the common resonance is small, the surface functions as a partial reflective (or partial transmissive) screen with no memory effect.</description>

      <title>Singular Choquard elliptic problems involving two nonlocal nonlinearities via the nonlinear Rayleigh quotient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14940v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present work we shall consider the existence and multiplicity of solutions for nonlocal elliptic singular problems where the nonlinearity is driven by two convolutions terms. More specifically, we shall consider the following Choquard type problem: 
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{array}{lll}
  -\Delta u+V(x)u=\lambda(I_{\alpha_1}*a|u|^q)a(x)|u|^{q-2}u+\mu(I_{\alpha_2}*|u|^p)|u|^{p-2}u
  u\in H^1(\mathbb{R}^N)
  \end{array}\right.
  \end{equation*}
  where $\alpha_2&lt;\alpha_1$; $\alpha_1,\alpha_2\in(0,N)$ and $0&lt;q&lt;1$; $p\in\left(2_{\alpha_2},2^*_{\alpha_2} \right)$. Recall also that $2_{\alpha_j}=(N+\alpha_j)/N$ and $2^*_{\alpha_j}=(N+\alpha_j)/(N-2), j=1,2$. Furthermore, for each $q\in(0,1)$, by using the Hardy-Littlewood-Sobolev inequality we can find a sharp parameter $\lambda^*&gt; 0$ such that our main problem has at least two solutions using the Nehari method. Here we also use the Rayleigh quotient for the following scenarios $\lambda \in (0, \lambda^*)$ and $\lambda = \lambda^*$. Moreover, we consider some decay estimates ensuring a non-existence result for the Choquard type problems in the whole space.</description>

      <title>Quasilinear nonlocal elliptic problems with prescribed norm in the $L^p$-subcritical and $L^p$-critical growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is established existence of solution with prescribed $L^p$ norm for the following nonlocal elliptic problem:
  \begin{equation*}
  \left\{\begin{array}{cc}
  \displaystyle (-\Delta)^s_p u\ +\ V (x) |u|^{p-2}u\ = \lambda |u|^{p - 2}u + \beta\left|u\right|^{q-2}u\ \hbox{in}\ \mathbb{R}^N,
  \displaystyle \|u\|_p^p = m^p,\ u \in W^{s, p}(\mathbb{R}^N).
  \end{array}\right.
  \end{equation*}
  where $s \in (0,1), sp &lt; N, \beta &gt; 0 \text{ and } q \in (p, \overline{p}_s]$ where $\overline{p}_s =p+ sp^2/N$.
  The main feature here is to consider $L^p$-subcritical and $L^p$-critical cases. Furthermore, we work with a huge class of potentials $V$ taking into account periodic potentials, asymptotically periodic potentials, and coercive potentials. More precisely, we ensure the existence of a solution of the prescribed norm for the periodic and asymptotically periodic potential $V$ in the $L^p$-subcritical regime. Furthermore, for the $L^p$ critical case, our main problem admits also a solution with a prescribed norm for each $\beta &gt; 0$ small enough.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate regularity properties of minimizers for non-autonomous convex variational integrands $F(x, \mathrm{D} u)$ with linear growth, defined on bounded Lipschitz domains $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n$. Assuming appropriate ellipticity conditions and H\"older continuity of $\mathrm{D}_zF(x,z)$ with respect to the first variable, we establish higher integrability of the gradient of minimizers and provide bounds on the Hausdorff dimension of the singular set of minimizers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study ancient solutions to discrete heat equations on some weighted graphs. On a graph of the form of a product with $\bb Z,$ we show that there are no non-trivial ancient solutions with polynomial growth. This result is parallel to the case of finite graphs, which is also discussed. Along the way, we prove a backward uniqueness result for solutions with appropriate decaying rate based on a monotonicity formula of parabolic frequency.</description>

      <title>Schottky invariant diffusion on the transcendent p-adic upper half plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14292</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14292v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The transcendent part of the Drinfeld p-adic upper half plane is shown to be a Polish space. Using Radon measures associated with regular differential 1-forms invariant under Schottky groups allows to construct self-adjoint diffusion operators as Laplacian integral operators with kernel functions determined by the p-adic absolute value on the complex p-adic numbers. Their spectra are explicitly calculated and the corresponding Cauchy problems for their associated heat equations are found to be uniquely solvable and to determine Markov processes having paths which are cadlag. The heat kernels are shown to have explicitly given distribution functions, as well as boundary value problems associated with the heat equations under Dirchlet and von Neumann conditions are solved.</description>

      <title>Lie Symmetries for the Shallow Water Magnetohydrodynamics Equations in a Rotating Reference Frame</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14578</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14578v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a detailed Lie symmetry analysis for the hyperbolic system of partial differential equations that describe the one-dimensional Shallow Water magnetohydrodynamics equations within a rotating reference frame. We consider a relaxing condition $\mathbf{\mathbf{\nabla }}\left( h\mathbf{B} \right) \neq 0$ for the one-dimensional problem, which has been used to overcome unphysical behaviors. The hyperbolic system of partial differential equations depends on two parameters: the constant gravitational potential $g$ and the Coriolis term $f_{0}$, related to the constant rotation of the reference frame. For four different cases, namely $g=0,~f_{0}=0$; $g\neq 0\,,~f_{0}=0$; $g=0$, $f_{0}\neq 0$; and $g\neq 0$, $f_{0}\neq 0$ the admitted Lie symmetries for the hyperbolic system form different Lie algebras. Specifically the admitted Lie algebras are the $L^{10}=\left\{ A_{3,3}\rtimes A_{2,1}\right\} \otimes _{s}A_{5,34}^{a}$; $% L^{8}=A_{2,1}\rtimes A_{6,22}$; $L^{7}=A_{3,5}\rtimes\left\{ A_{2,1}\rtimes A_{2,1}\right\} $; and $L^{6}=A_{3,5}\rtimes A_{3,3}~$respectively, where we use the Morozov-Mubarakzyanov-Patera classification scheme. For the general case where $f_{0}g\neq 0$, we derive all the invariants for the Adjoint action of the Lie algebra $L^{6}$ and its subalgebras, and we calculate all the elements of the one-dimensional optimal system. These elements are then considered to define similarity transformations and construct analytic solutions for the hyperbolic system.</description>

      <title>Long Time Behavior and Stabilization for Displacement Monotone Mean Field Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14903v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to the study of the long time behavior of Nash equilibria in Mean Field Games within the framework of displacement monotonicity. We first show that any two equilibria defined on the time horizon $[0,T]$ must be close as $T \to \infty$, in a suitable sense, independently of initial/terminal conditions. The way this stability property is made quantitative involves the $L^2$ distance between solutions of the associated Pontryagin system of FBSDEs that characterizes the equilibria. Therefore, this implies in particular the stability in the 2-Wasserstein distance for the two flows of probability measures describing the agent population density and the $L^2$ distance between the co-states of agents, that are related to the optimal feedback controls. We then prove that the value function of a typical agent converges as $T \to \infty$, and we describe this limit via an infinite horizon MFG system, involving an ergodic constant. All of our convergence results hold true in a unified way for deterministic and idiosyncratic noise driven Mean Field Games, in the case of strongly displacement monotone non-separable Hamiltonians. All these are quantitative at exponential rates.</description>

      <title>On microlocalisation and the construction of Feynman Propagators for normally hyperbolic operators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2012.09767v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article gives global microlocalisation constructions for normally hyperbolic operators on a vector bundle over a globally hyperbolic spacetime in geometric terms. As an application, this is used to generalise the Duistermaat-H\"{o}rmander construction of Feynman propagators, therefore incorporating the most important non-scalar geometric operators. It is shown that for normally hyperbolic operators that are selfadjoint with respect to a hermitian bundle metric, the Feynman propagators can be constructed to satisfy a positivity property that reflects the existence of Hadamard states in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes. We also give a more direct construction of the Feynman propagators for Dirac-type operators on a globally hyperbolic spacetime. Even though the natural bundle metric on spinors is not positive-definite, in this case, we can give a direct microlocal construction of a Feynman propagator that satisfies positivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2202.04505v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an abstract result giving a $\langle t \rangle^\varepsilon$ upper bound on the growth of the Sobolev norms of a time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation of the form ${i} \dot \psi = H_0 \psi + V (t)\psi$. Here $H_0$ is assumed to be the Hamiltonian of a steep quantum integrable system and to be a pseudodifferential operator of order ${\tt d} &gt; 1$; $V (t)$ is a time-dependent family of pseudodifferential operators, unbounded, but of order ${\tt b} &lt; {\tt d}$. The abstract theorem is then applied to perturbations of the quantum anharmonic oscillators in dimension 2 and to perturbations of the Laplacian on a manifold with integrable geodesic flow, and in particular Zoll manifolds, rotation invariant surfaces and Lie groups. The proof is based on a quantum version of the proof of the classical Nekhoroshev theorem.</description>

      <title>The gyrokinetic limit for the two dimensional Vlasov-Poisson system with multi-point charges</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.13442v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we investigate the gyrokinetic limit for the two dimensional Vlasov-Poisson system with multi-point charges. We show that the solution converges to a measure-valued solution of the Euler equation with a defect measure, which extends the results of Miot (Nonlinearity 32(2):654-677, 2019) to the case of multi-point charges and removes the smallness condition $\sup_{0&lt;\varepsilon&lt;1}\|f_{\varepsilon}^0\|_{L^1}&lt;1$. The main difficulty arises from the fact that the orbits of point charges will intersect frequently and rapidly as the magnetic field intensity becomes large. To overcome the problem, we adopt the techniques recently developed by Wu and Zhang (Journal of Statistical Physics 190:183, 2023) combined with a new technique introduced here.</description>

Abstract: Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ with $d\geq 2$ be a bounded domain of class $\mathcal{C}^{1,\beta }$ for some $\beta \in (0,1)$. For $p\in (1, \infty )$ and $s\in (0,1)$, let $\Lambda ^s_{p}(\Omega )$ be the first eigenvalue of the mixed local-nonlocal operator $-\Delta _p+(-\Delta _p)^s$ in $\Omega $ with the homogeneous nonlocal Dirichlet boundary condition. We establish a strict Faber-Krahn type inequality for $\Lambda _{p}^s(\cdot )$ under polarization. As an application of this strict inequality, we obtain the strict monotonicity of $\Lambda _{p}^s(\cdot )$ over annular domains and characterize the rigidity property of the balls in the classical Faber-Krahn inequality for $-\Delta _p+(-\Delta _p)^s$.</description>

      <title>Quantitative spectral stability for the Neumann Laplacian in domains with small holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05999v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of the present paper is to investigate the behavior of the spectrum of the Neumann Laplacian in domains with little holes excised from the interior. More precisely, we consider the eigenvalues of the Laplacian with homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on a bounded, Lipschitz domain. Then, we singularly perturb the domain by removing Lipschitz sets which are "small" in a suitable sense and satisfy a uniform extension property. In this context, we provide an asymptotic expansion for all the eigenvalues of the perturbed problem which are converging to simple eigenvalues of the limit one. The eigenvalue variation turns out to depend on a geometric quantity resembling the notion of (boundary) torsional rigidity: understanding this fact is one of the main contributions of the present paper. In the particular case of a hole shrinking to a point, through a fine blow-up analysis, we identify the exact vanishing order of such a quantity and we establish some connections between the location of the hole and the sign of the eigenvalue variation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15921v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this expository article, we give an overview of the concept of potential mean field games of first order. We give a new proof that minimizers of the potential are equilibria by using a Lagrangian formulation. We also provide criteria to determine whether or not a game has a potential. Finally, we discuss in some depth the selection problem in mean field games, which consists in choosing one out of multiple Nash equilibria.</description>

      <title>Examples of non-scattering inhomogeneities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17527v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the scattering of waves by a penetrable inclusion embedded in some reference medium. We exhibit examples of materials and geometries for which non-scattering frequencies exist, i.e., for which at some frequencies there are incident fields which produce null scattered fields outside of the inhomogeneity. We show in particular that certain domains with corners or even cusps can support non-scattering frequencies. We relate the latter, for some inclusions, to resonance frequencies for Dirichlet or Neumann cavities. We also find situations where incident non-scattering fields solve the Helmholtz equation in a neighborhood of the inhomogeneity and not in the whole space. Finally, in relation with invisibility, we give examples of inclusions of anisotropic materials which are non-scattering for all real frequencies. We prove that corresponding material indices must have a special structure on the boundary.</description>

      <title>Existence and regularity of solutions for the elliptic nonlinear transparent media equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19948v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study existence and regularity of solutions to Dirichlet problems as
  $$
  \begin{cases}
  - {\rm div}\left(|u|^m\frac{D u}{|D u|}\right) = f &amp; \text{in}\;\Omega,\\ \newline
  u=0 &amp; \text{on}\;\partial\Omega,
  \end{cases}
  $$
  where $\Omega$ is an open bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\geq 2$) with Lipschitz boundary, $m&gt;0$, and $f$ belongs to the Lorentz space $L^{N,\infty}(\Omega)$. In particular, we explore the regularizing effect given by the degenerate coefficient $|u|^m$ in order to get non-trivial and bounded solutions with no smallness assumptions on the size of the data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.00482v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this survey we provide an overview of nonlinear elliptic homogeneous boundary value problems featuring singular zero-order terms with respect to the unknown variable whose prototype equation is $$ -\Delta u = {u^{-\gamma}} \ \text{in}\ \Omega $$ where $\Omega$ is a bounded subset of $\mathbb{R}^N$ ($N\geq 2$), and $\gamma&gt;0$.
  We start by outlining the basic concepts and the mathematical framework needed for setting the problem. Both old and new key existence and uniqueness results are presented, alongside regularity issues depending on the regularity of the data. The presentation aims to be modern, self-contained and consistent. Some examples and open problems are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.01041v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper examines a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) epidemic reaction-diffusion model with no-flux boundary conditions and constant total population. The infection mechanism in the model is described by a nonlinear term of the form $S^qI^p$ with $0&lt;p\leq1$ and $q&gt;0$. We explore the spatial profiles of the endemic equilibrium with respect to small movement rates of susceptible and/or infected populations. Our results extend and improve existing results in the literature, providing further insights into how transmission mechanisms and population mobility limitations impact the spread of infectious diseases. We reinforce and complement the theoretical results with numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Free boundary regularity for semilinear variational problems with a topological constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01813</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01813v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a class of semilinear free boundary problems in which admissible functions $u$ have a topological constraint, or spanning condition, on their 1-level set. This constraint forces $\{u=1\}$, which is the free boundary, to behave like a surface with some special types of singularities attached to a fixed boundary frame, in the spirit of the Plateau problem of Harrison-Pugh. Two such free boundary problems are the minimization of capacity among surfaces sharing a common boundary and an Allen-Cahn formulation of the Plateau problem. We establish the existence of minimizers and study the regularity of solutions to the Euler-Lagrange equations, obtaining the optimal Lipschitz regularity for solutions and analytic regularity for the free boundaries away from a codimension two singular set. The singularity models for these problems are given by conical critical points of the minimal capacity problem, which are closely related to spectral optimal partition and segregation problems.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic behaviour of solutions and free boundaries of the anisotropic slow diffusion equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12295v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we explore the theory of the anisotropic porous medium equation in the slow diffusion range. After revising the basic theory, we prove the existence of self-similar fundamental solutions (SSFS) of the equation posed in the whole Euclidean space. Each of such solutions is uniquely determined by its mass. This solution has compact support w.r.t. the space variables. We also obtain the sharp asymptotic behaviour of all finite mass solutions in terms of the family of self-similar fundamental solutions. Special attention is paid to the convergence of supports and free boundaries in relative size, i.e., measured in the appropriate anisotropic way. The fast diffusion case has been studied in a previous paper by us, there no free boundaries appear.</description>

      <title>Scattering theory for the defocusing 3d NLS in the exterior of a strictly convex obstacle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.13215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.13215v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the global well-posedness and scattering theory for the defocusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation $iu_t + \Delta_\Omega u = |u|^\alpha u$ in the exterior domain $\Omega$ of a smooth, compact and strictly convex obstacle in $\mathbb{R}^3$.It is conjectured that in Euclidean space, if the solution has a prior bound in the critical Sobolev space, that is, $u \in L_t^\infty(I; \dot{H}_x^{s_c}(\mathbb{R}^3))$ with $s_c := \frac{3}{2} - \frac{2}{\alpha} \in (0, \frac{3}{2})$, then $u$ is global and scatters. In this paper, assuming that this conjecture holds, we prove that if $u$ is a solution to the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation in exterior domain $\Omega$ with Dirichlet boundary condition and satisfies $u \in L_t^\infty(I; \dot{H}^{s_c}_D(\Omega))$ with $s_c \in \left[\frac{1}{2}, \frac{3}{2}\right)$, then $u$ is global and scatters.
  The main ingredients in our proof are the linear profile decompositions in the critical space $\dot{H}_D^{s_c}(\Omega)$ and embed it to the nonlinear equation. Inspired by Killip-Visan-Zhang[Amer. J. Math. {\bf138} (2016)], we overcome the difficulty caused by the breakdown of the scaling and translation invariance. This allows us to utilize the concentration-compactness/rigidity argument of Kenig and Merle [Invent. Math. {\bf 166} (2006)]. To preclude the minimal counterexamples, we established the long-time Stricharrtz estimates and the frequency-localized Morawetz estimates.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2107.14686v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We formulate and solve the existence problem for Ricci flow on a Riemann surface with initial data given by a Radon measure as volume measure. The theory leads us to a large class of new examples of nongradient expanding Ricci solitons, including the first example of a nongradient Kaehler Ricci soliton. It also settles the question of whether a smooth flow for positive time that attains smooth initial data in a distance metric sense must be smooth down to the initial time. We disprove this by giving an example of a complete Ricci flow starting with the Euclidean plane that is not the static solution.</description>

      <title>A decomposition-homogenization method for Robin boundary problems on the nonnegative orthant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2306.08312v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper studies the existence and uniqueness of a classical solution to a type of Robin boundary problems on the nonnegative orthant. We propose a new decomposition-homogenization method for the Robin boundary problem based on probabilistic representations, which leads to two auxiliary Robin boundary problems admitting some simplified probabilistic representations. The auxiliary probabilistic representations allow us to establish the existence of a unique classical solution to the original Robin boundary problem using some stochastic flow analysis.</description>

      <title>Accuracy Controlled Schemes for the Eigenvalue Problem of the Radiative Transfer Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.07780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.07780v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The criticality problem in nuclear engineering asks for the principal eigenpair of a Boltzmann operator describing neutron transport in a reactor core. Being able to reliably design, and control such reactors requires assessing these quantities within quantifiable accuracy tolerances. In this paper we propose a paradigm that deviates from the common practice of approximately solving the corresponding spectral problem with a fixed, presumably sufficiently fine discretization. Instead, the present approach is based on first contriving iterative schemes, formulated in function space, that are shown to converge at a quantitative rate without assuming any a priori excess regularity properties, and that exploit only properties of the optical parameters in the underlying radiative transfer model. We develop the analytical and numerical tools for approximately realizing each iteration step within judiciously chosen accuracy tolerances, verified by a posteriori estimates, so as to still warrant quantifiable convergence to the exact eigenpair. This is carried out in full first for a Newton scheme. Since this is only locally convergent we analyze in addition the convergence of a power iteration in function space to produce sufficiently accurate initial guesses. Here we have to deal with intrinsic difficulties posed by compact but unsymmetric operators preventing standard arguments used in the finite dimensional case. Our main point is that we can avoid any condition on an initial guess to be already in a small neighborhood of the exact solution. We close with a discussion of remaining intrinsic obstructions to a certifiable numerical implementation, mainly related to not knowing the gap between the principal eigenvalue and the next smaller one in modulus.</description>

      <title>Sharp Poincar\'e--Sobolev Inequalities of Choquet--Lorentz Integrals with Respect to Hausdorff Contents on Bounded John Domains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.15224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.15224v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $\Omega$ be a bounded John domain in $\mathbb R^n$ with $n\ge 2$, and let $\mathcal{H}_{\infty }^{\delta}$ denote the Hausdorff content of dimension $\delta\in (0,n]$. In this article, the authors prove the Poincar\'e and the Poincar\'e--Sobolev inequalities, with sharp ranges of indices, on Choquet--Lorentz integrals with respect to $\mathcal{H}_{\infty }^{\delta}$ for all continuously differentiable functions on $\Omega$. These results not only extend the recent Poincar\'e and Poincar\'e--Sobolev inequalities to the Choquet--Lorentz integrals, but also provide some endpoint estimates (weak type) in the critical case. One of the main novelties exists in that, to achieve the goals, the authors develop some new tools associated with Choquet--Lorentz integrals on $\mathcal{H}_{\infty }^{\delta}$, such as the fractional Hardy--Littlewood maximal inequality and the Hedberg-type pointwise estimate on the Riesz potential. As an application, the authors obtain the sharp boundedness of the Riesz potential on Choquet--Lorentz integrals. Moreover, even for classical Lorentz integrals, these Poincar\'e and Poincar\'e--Sobolev inequalities are also new.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05950v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive quantitative estimates for large stochastic systems of interacting particles perturbed by both idiosyncratic and environmental noises, as well as singular kernels. We prove that the (mollified) empirical process converges to the solution of the nonlinear stochastic Fokker-Planck equation. The proof is based on It\^o's formula for $H_{q}^{1}$-valued process, commutator estimates, and some estimations for the regularization of the empirical measure. Moreover, we show that the aforementioned equation admits a unique strong solution in the probabilistic sense. The approach applies to repulsive and attractive kernels.</description>
