      <title>Ruling out nonlinear modifications of quantum theory with contextuality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04298v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nonlinear modifications of quantum theory are considered potential candidates for the theory of quantum gravity, with the intuitive argument that since Einstein field equations are nonlinear, quantum gravity should be nonlinear as well. Contextuality is a property of quantum systems that forbids the explanation of prepare-and-measure experiments in terms of classical hidden variable models with suitable properties. We show that some well-known nonlinear modifications of quantum mechanics, namely the Deutsch's map, the Weinberg's model, and the Schr\"odinger - Newton equation, map a contextual set of states to a non-contextual one. That is, the considered nonlinear modifications of quantum theory allow for the existence of classical hidden variable models for certain experimental setups. This enables us to design experiments that would rule out the considered nonlinear modifications of quantum theory by verifying that the system remains contextual, or, equivalently, our results highlight a mechanism how nonlinear modification of quantum theory may lead to weak wave function collapse and ultimately to the solution of the measurement problem.</description>

      <title>Entanglement suppression and quantum scars in a three-oscillator gravitational analogue</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study quantum correlations in a tripartite system of coupled harmonic oscillators, modeling mediator-induced interactions akin to those in quantum gravity proposals. Surprisingly, despite the system's integrability, we identify regimes where bipartite entanglement between distant oscillators vanishes even with non-zero quantum couplings. In the Heavy Mediator Regime, entanglement is restricted to sharply localized islands in parameter space, surrounded by extended regions of suppression, analogous to quantum scars in non-integrable systems. Fidelity analysis reveal that these low-entanglement states exhibit dynamical stability and spectral signatures reminiscent of quantum scars in non-integrable systems, suggesting a continuous-variable analogue of scarring tied to hidden phase-space symmetries. The Light Mediator Regime, by contrast, displays smooth entanglement generation. These results challenge entanglement-based tests of quantum gravity: the absence of entanglement need not imply classical mediation but may instead reflect a mediator dynamically constrained to a quantum subspace-akin to gravitational memory or decoherence-free subspaces. Our findings emphasize the necessity of probing the mediator's dynamical regime to unambiguously diagnose quantum gravity.</description>

      <title>Superconducting antiqubits achieve optimal phase estimation via unitary inversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A positron is equivalent to an electron traveling backward through time. Casting transmon superconducting qubits as akin to electrons, we simulate a positron with a transmon subject to particular resonant and off-resonant drives. We call positron-like transmons "antiqubits." An antiqubit's effective gyromagnetic ratio equals the negative of a qubit's. This fact enables us to time-invert a unitary implemented on a transmon by its environment. We apply this platform-specific unitary inversion, with qubit--antiqubit entanglement, to achieve a quantum advantage in phase estimation: consider measuring the strength of a field that points in an unknown direction. An entangled qubit--antiqubit sensor offers the greatest possible sensitivity (amount of Fisher information), per qubit, per application of the field. We prove this result theoretically and observe it experimentally. This work shows how antimatter, whether real or simulated, can enable platform-specific unitary inversion and benefit quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Efficient Quantum Gibbs Sampling with Local Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The problem of simulating the thermal behavior of quantum systems remains a central open challenge in quantum computing. Unlike well-established quantum algorithms for unitary dynamics, \emph{provably efficient} algorithms for preparing thermal states -- crucial for probing equilibrium behavior -- became available only recently with breakthrough algorithms based on the simulation of well-designed dissipative processes, a quantum-analogue to Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. We show a way to implement these algorithms avoiding expensive block encoding and relying only on dense local circuits, akin to Hamiltonian simulation. Specifically, our method leverages spatial truncation and Trotterization of exact quasilocal dissipative processes. We rigorously prove that the approximations we use have little effect on rapid mixing at high temperatures and allow convergence to the thermal state with small bounded error. Moreover, we accompany our analytical results with numerical simulations that show that this method, unlike previously thought, is within the reach of current generation of quantum hardware. These results provide the first provably efficient quantum thermalization protocol implementable on near-term quantum devices, offering a concrete path toward practical simulation of equilibrium quantum phenomena.</description>

      <title>Experimental Detection of Dissipative Quantum Chaos</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: More than four decades of research on chaos in isolated quantum systems have led to the identification of universal signatures -- such as level repulsion and eigenstate thermalization -- that serve as cornerstones in our understanding of complex quantum dynamics. The emerging field of dissipative quantum chaos explores how these properties manifest in open quantum systems, where interactions with the environment play an essential role. We report the first experimental detection of dissipative quantum chaos and integrability by measuring the complex spacing ratios (CSRs) of open many-body quantum systems implemented on a high-fidelity superconducting quantum processor. Employing gradient-based tomography, we retrieve a ``donut-shaped'' CSR distribution for chaotic dissipative circuits, a hallmark of level repulsion in open quantum systems. For an integrable circuit, spectral correlations vanish, evidenced by a sharp peak at the origin in the CSR distribution. As we increase the depth of the integrable dissipative circuit, the CSR distribution undergoes an integrability-to-chaos crossover, demonstrating that intrinsic noise in the quantum processor is a dissipative chaotic process. Our results reveal the universal spectral features of dissipative many-body systems and establish present-day quantum computation platforms, which are predominantly used to run unitary simulations, as testbeds to explore dissipative many-body phenomena.</description>

      <title>L\'evy Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the spectral properties of the $4$-fermion Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model with interaction sourced from a L\'evy Stable (fat-tailed) distribution. L\'evy random matrices are known to demonstrate non-ergodic behaviour through the emergence of a mobility edge. We study the eigenvalue distribution, focusing on long- and short-range correlations and extreme statistics. This model demonstrates a crossover from chaotic to integrable behaviour (in the spectral correlations) as the distribution becomes increasingly fat-tailed. We investigate this crossover through a hierarchical analysis of the eigenvalue spectrum, based on the multi-fractal hierarchy of the L\'evy Stable distribution. The crossover is explained in terms of a genuine many-body effect, distinct from the transition (controlled by a mobility edge) in the L\'evy random matrices. We conclude with comments on the model's solvability and discussion of possible models with exact transitions.</description>

      <title>Exponential distillation of dominant eigenproperties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04380v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Estimating observable expectation values in eigenstates of quantum systems has a broad range of applications and is an area where early fault-tolerant quantum computers may provide practical quantum advantage. We develop a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm that enables the estimation of an arbitrary observable expectation value in an eigenstate, given an initial state is supplied that has dominant overlap with the targeted eigenstate -- but may overlap with any other eigenstates. Our approach builds on, and is conceptually similar to purification-based error mitigation techniques; however, it achieves exponential suppression of algorithmic errors using only a single copy of the quantum state. The key innovation is that random time evolution is applied in the quantum computer to create an average mixed quantum state, which is then virtually purified with exponential efficacy. We prove rigorous performance guarantees and conclude that the complexity of our approach depends directly on the energy gap in the problem Hamiltonian, and is thus comparable to state-of-the-art hybrid techniques. We demonstrate in a broad range of numerical simulations the applicability of our framework in near-term and early fault-tolerant settings. Furthermore, we demonstrate in a 100-qubit example that direct classical simulation of our approach enables the prediction of ground and excited state properties of quantum systems using tensor network techniques, which we recognize as a quantum-inspired classical approach.</description>

      <title>Spin-State Selective Excitation in Spin Defects of Hexagonal Boron Nitride</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has emerged as a promising two-dimensional platform for quantum sensing, due to its optically addressable spin defects, such as the negatively charged boron vacancy ($V_{\text{B}}^-$). Despite hBN being transferrable to close proximity to samples, spectral overlap of spin transitions due to large hyperfine interactions has limited its magnetic sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate spin-selective excitation of $V_{\text{B}}^-$ spin defects in hBN driven by circularly polarized microwave. Using a cross-shaped microwave resonance waveguide, we superimpose two orthogonally linearly polarized microwave shifted in phase from a RFSoC FPGA to generate circularly polarized microwaves. This enables selective spin $|0\rangle\rightarrow|-1\rangle$ or $|0\rangle\rightarrow|1\rangle$ excitation of $V_{\text{B}}^-$ defects, as confirmed by optically detected magnetic resonance experimentally and supported computationally. We also investigate the influence of magnetic field on spin-state selectivity. Our technique enhances the potential of hBN platform for quantum sensing through better spin state control and magnetic sensitivity particularly at low fields.</description>

      <title>Faster Probabilistic Error Cancellation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Probabilistic error cancellation (PEC) is a leading quantum error mitigation method that provides an unbiased estimate, although it is known to have a large sampling overhead. In this work, we propose a new method to perform PEC, which results in a lower sampling cost than the standard way. It works by decomposing the inverse channel of each gate or each circuit layer into the identity part and the non-identity part and reorganizing the full circuit as different powers of the inverse generator. The ideal circuit becomes a linear combination of noisy circuits with different weights where shots are deterministically allocated to each circuit based on its weight. This naturally sets the achievable bias given a finite amount of shots. As the number of shots is increased, smaller bias terms can be gradually resolved and become bias-free in the limit of sufficient shots. We show the saving both analytically and numerically over the standard PEC and identify situations where it can outperform heuristic approach, such as zero-noise extrapolation, due to the well-controlled bias. We also demonstrated this method experimentally and found excellent agreement between the mitigated and the ideal values.</description>

      <title>Deep Learning for Absorption-Image Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The quantum state of ultracold atoms is often determined through measurement of the spatial distribution of the atom cloud. Absorption imaging of the cloud is regularly used to extract this spatial information. Accurate determination of the parameters which describe the spatial distribution of the cloud is crucial to the success of many ultracold atom applications. In this work, we present modified deep learning image classification models for image regression. To overcome challenges in data collection, we train the model on simulated absorption images. We compare the performance of the deep learning models to least-squares techniques and show that the deep learning models achieve accuracy similar to least-squares, while consuming significantly less computation time. We compare the performance of models which take a single atom image against models which use an atom image plus other images that contain background information, and find that both models achieved similar accuracy. The use of single image models will enable single-exposure absorption imaging, which simplifies experiment design and eases imaging hardware requirements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04530v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of state communication in finite-level quantum systems through noise-affected channels. Our approach is based on a self-consistent theory of decoding inner products associated with the code and error (or noise) bases defined on corrupting subspaces. This viewpoint yields new necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of quantum error-correcting codes in terms of these inner products. The obtained results extend the foundations of quantum error correction beyond classical analogies, highlighting the structural insights offered by operator theory and the underlying product space.</description>

      <title>A Novel Solver for QUBO Problems: Performance Analysis and Comparative Study with State-of-the-Art Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04596</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04596v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) provides a versatile framework for representing NP-hard combinatorial problems, yet existing solvers often face trade-offs among speed, accuracy, and scalability. In this work, we introduce a quantum-inspired solver (QIS) that unites branch-and-bound pruning, continuous gradient-descent refinement, and quantum-inspired heuristics within a fully adaptive control architecture. We benchmark QIS3 against eight state-of-the-art solvers, including genetic algorithms, coherent Ising machines, simulated bifurcation, parallel tempering, simulated annealing, our prior QIS2 version, D-Wave's simulated-annealing (Neal), and Gurobi on three canonical QUBO problem classes: Max-Cut, NAE-3SAT, and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin glass problems. Under a uniform runtime budget, QIS3 attains the best solution on nearly all instances, achieving optimality in 94% of max-cut instances. These results establish QIS3 as a robust, high-performance solver that bridges classical exact strategies and quantum-inspired heuristics for scalable QUBO optimization.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04607v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this "map" we are going to present the concept of indefinite causal order and make a quick journey through its different flavours. We will start with a broad conceptual motivation for studying indefinite causal order, based on the approach of Lucien Hardy to quantum gravity. Then, we will introduce the quantum switch, which is a particular instance of indefinite causal order, followed by the process matrices framework and the superposition of causal structures. Finally, we will comment on some ongoing debates within the field. This document started as an excerpt of the author's PhD Thesis and is intended as a map of indefinite causal order, which can be used to guide the trip of any explorer in the field.</description>

      <title>A Resource Allocating Compiler for Lattice Surgery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04620v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The emerging field of quantum resource estimation is aimed at providing estimates of the hardware requirements (`quantum resources') needed to execute a useful, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Given that quantum computers are intended to compete with supercomputers, useful quantum computations are likely to involve the use of millions of qubits and error correction clock cycles. The compilation and benchmarking of these circuits depends on placement and routing algorithms, which are infeasible to construct at scale by hand. We offer a compiler that transforms a quantum circuit into a sequence of lattice surgery operations. The compiler manages memory in terms of surface code patches and costs the space-time volume and cycle counts of the input circuits. These compiled lattice surgery objects are then recursively repurposed as gates for larger scale compilations. Our code is available on GitHub under a permissive software license and we welcome community contributions.</description>

      <title>Entanglement cost hierarchies in quantum fragmented mixed states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04637</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04637v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong symmetries enforce non-trivial quantum entanglement patterns on the stationary states of symmetric open quantum dynamics. Specifically, non-commuting conserved quantities lead to long-range quantum entanglement even for infinite temperature mixed states within fixed symmetry sectors. Leveraging the commutant algebra framework, we show that various bipartite entanglement measures for mixed states -- including exact and asymptotically-exact entanglement costs and squashed entanglement, which are generally intractable for a generic many-body mixed state -- can be computed for this class of states. In particular, we focus on strongly symmetric maximally mixed states arising from the Temperley-Lieb model, which features quantum Hilbert space fragmentation with exponentially large (in system size) non-Abelian commutants. We find that while both the logarithmic negativity and the `exact' entanglement cost for equal-size bipartitions scale with the volume of the system, the entanglement of formation, squashed entanglement, entanglement cost, and distillable entanglement exhibit subextensive scaling. We relate this separation in entanglement measures to a parametric difference between the entanglement cost of exact and asymptotically-exact state preparations, and infer this to be a consequence of a particular pattern of quantum Hilbert space fragmentation.</description>

      <title>Accelerated spin-adapted ground state preparation with non-variational quantum algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Various methods have been explored to prepare the spin-adapted ground state, the lowest energy state within the Hilbert space constrained by externally specified values of the total spin magnitude and the spin-$z$ component. In such problem settings, variational and non-variational methods commonly incorporate penalty terms into the original Hamiltonian to enforce the desired constraints. While in variational approaches, only $O(n_{\textrm{spin}}^2)$ measurements are required for the calculation of the penalty terms for the total spin magnitude, non-variational approaches, such as probabilistic imaginary-time evolution or adiabatic time evolution, are expected to be more computationally intensive, requiring $O(n_{\textrm{spin}}^4)$ gates naively. This paper proposes a new procedure based on non-variational quantum algorithms to obtain the spin-adapted ground state. The proposed method consists of two steps: the first step is to prepare a spin-magnitude adapted state and the second step is post-processing for the desired $S_z$. By separating into two steps, the procedure achieves the desired spin-adapted ground state while reducing the number of penalty terms from $O(n_{\textrm{spin}}^4)$ to $O(n_{\textrm{spin}}^2)$. We conducted numerical experiments for spin-1/2 Heisenberg ring models and manganese trimer systems. The results confirmed the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating a significant reduction in gate complexity and validating its practical usefulness.</description>

      <title>Variational toolbox-based separability detection of multiqubit states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04674</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04674v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parametrized quantum circuits (PQCs) are crucial in variational quantum algorithms. While it is commonly believed that the optimal PQC is solely used to reproduce the target state, we here reveal that the optimal PQC can also provide valuable insights into the state's properties. We propose variational toolboxes to identify the $k$-separability of pure states, with or without preparation noise, by checking the structure within the optimal PQCs. Additionally, we introduce adaptive optimization strategies to detect the $k$-separability of mixed states. Compared to fixed PQCs, our approach controls fewer parameters for low-rank states. Finally, we validate our methods through numerical demonstrations for various states.</description>

      <title>Joint Optimization of Electric Vehicle Routes and Charging Locations Learning Charge Constraints Using QUBO Solver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04687</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Optimal routing problems of electric vehicles (EVs) have attracted much attention in recent years, and installation of charging stations is an important issue for EVs. Hence, we focus on the joint optimization of the location of charging stations and the routing of EVs. When routing problems are formulated in the form of quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO), specialized solvers such as quantum annealer are expected to provide optimal solutions with high speed and accuracy. However, battery capacity constraints make it hard to formulate into QUBO form without a large number of auxiliary qubits. Then, we propose a sequential optimization method utilizing the Bayesian inference and QUBO solvers, in which method the battery capacity constraints are automatically learned. This method enables us to optimize the number and location of charging stations and the routing of EVs with a small number of searches. Applying this method to a routing problem of 20 locations, we confirmed that the learning process works well and efficient searches find good solutions. This result enhances the possibility that the QUBO solver could be applied to the constraints contained problems which is difficult to formulate into QUBO form without a large number of ancilla qubits.</description>

      <title>New exact solutions of the 3D Schr\"odinger equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04725v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Previously we found a unique quantum system with a positive gauge-invariant Weyl-Stratonovich quasi-probability density function which can be defined by the so-called {\guillemotleft}quadratic funnel{\guillemotright} potential [Phys. Rev. A 110 02222 (2024)]. In this work we have constructed a class of exact solutions to the 3D Schr\"odinger equation for a two-parameter {\guillemotleft}quadratic funnel{\guillemotright} potential based on the -model of micro and macro systems. Explicit expressions for the energy spectrum and the set of eigenfunctions have been found. Using gauge invariance for scalar and vector potentials, a solution to the electromagnetic Schr\"odinger equation has been obtained, with a magnetic field in the form of a {\guillemotleft}Dirac string{\guillemotright} defined by a singular vortex probability flux field. Superpositions of eigenfunctions leading to various types of vortex and potential probability current fields have been investigated in detail. The analysis of the quantum system's properties has been carried out within the Wigner-Vlasov formalism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Matterwaves made up of ultra-cold quantum-degenerate atoms have enabled the creation of tools having unprecedented sensitivity and precision in measuring gravity, rotation or magnetic fields. Applications range from gravitational wave detection and tests of Einstein's equivalence principle to inertial sensing for navigation and gravitational gradient sensing for oil and mineral exploration. In this letter, we introduce atom-optics as a novel tool of manipulating matterwaves in ring-shaped coherent waveguides. We collimate and focus matterwaves derived from Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs) and ultra-cold thermal atoms in ring-shaped time-averaged adiabatic potentials. We demonstrate `delta-kick cooling' of BECs, reducing their expansion energies by a factor of 34. The atomtronic waveguide ring has a radius of only $485\,\mu m$, compared to other state-of-the-art experiments requiring zero gravity or chambers of ten meter. This level of control with extremely reduced spatial requirements is an important step towards atomtronic quantum sensors.</description>

      <title>Integrated photonics for continuous-variable quantum optics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04771v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum technologies promise profound advances in communication security, sensing and computing. The underpinning hardware must be engineered to generate, manipulate and detect quantum phenomena with exceptional performance, whilst being mass-manufacturable for real-world applications. A leading approach is chip-scale quantum photonics. The continuous-variable regime for quantum optics has been exploited in a number of technologies, including the detection of gravitational waves, by operating below the standard quantum limit of the light's shot noise. The availability of room-temperature, deterministic sources and high efficiency detectors suitable for continuous-variable state generation and measurement is a compelling motivation for this particular paradigm. This review focusses on efforts to integrate sources and detectors of continuous-variable light states into chip-scale photonic integrated circuits.</description>

      <title>Quantum correlations versus spin magnitude: Transition to the classical limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum-classical transitions have long attracted much attention. We study such transitions in quantum spin-($j$,1/2) systems at thermal equilibrium. Unlike previous papers, it is found that the threshold temperature of quantum entanglement decreases with increasing spin $j$ and completely disappears in the limit $j\to\infty$. In the ground state of systems with highly symmetric interactions, the discord-type quantum correlations can exist even for arbitrarily large spin. Such correlations turn out to be unstable and are destroyed by small perturbations that violate the symmetry of the Hamiltonian. The stable quantum correlations gradually degrade as the spin $j$ grows and eventually vanish when the classical limit is reached.</description>

      <title>Thermal avalanches in isolated many-body localized systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04834v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many-body localization is a profound phase of matter affecting the entire spectrum which emerges in the presence of disorder in interacting many-body systems. Recently, the stability of many-body localization has been challenged by the avalanche mechanism, in which a small thermal region can spread, destabilizing localization and leading to global thermalization of the system. A key unresolved question is the critical competition between the thermal region's influence and the disorder strength required to trigger such an avalanche. Here, we numerically investigate many-body localization stability in an isolated Heisenberg spin chain of size $L$ subjected to a disordered magnetic field. By embedding a tunable thermal region of size $P$, we analyze the system's behavior in both static and dynamical regimes using entanglement entropy and the gap ratio. Our study yields two main findings. Firstly, for strong disorder, the avalanche only occurs if the thermal region scales with system size, specifically when $P/L$ exceeds a threshold value. Secondly, at strong disorder, we identify an intermediate phase between many-body localization and ergodic behavior as $P$ increases. This intermediate phase leaves its finger print in both static and dynamic properties of the system and tends to vanish in the thermodynamic limit. Although our simulations are restricted to finite system sizes, the analysis suggests that these results hold in the thermodynamic limit for isolated many-body systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04847v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a quantum dialogue protocol that uses the non-destructive discrimination (NDD) of five qubit cluster states. The proposed protocol is a measurement-based protocol, where ancilla qubits are used to perform measurement on the state without destroying its entanglement, allowing the state to be reused for further communication. We provide a detailed security analysis, demonstrating the protocol's resilience against various attack strategies and discuss the scalability of the scheme to n-qubit cluster states. We have introduced a stabilizer based single qubit error correction mechanism that enhances robustness against noise without requiring additional qubits.</description>

      <title>TQml Simulator: Optimized Simulation of Quantum Machine Learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04891v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hardware-efficient circuits employed in Quantum Machine Learning are typically composed of alternating layers of uniformly applied gates. High-speed numerical simulators for such circuits are crucial for advancing research in this field. In this work, we numerically benchmark universal and gate-specific techniques for simulating the action of layers of gates on quantum state vectors, aiming to accelerate the overall simulation of Quantum Machine Learning algorithms. Our analysis shows that the optimal simulation method for a given layer of gates depends on the number of qubits involved, and that a tailored combination of techniques can yield substantial performance gains in the forward and backward passes for a given circuit. Building on these insights, we developed a numerical simulator, named TQml Simulator, that employs the most efficient simulation method for each layer in a given circuit. We evaluated TQml Simulator on circuits constructed from standard gate sets, such as rotations and CNOTs, as well as on native gates from IonQ and IBM quantum processing units. In most cases, our simulator outperforms equivalent Pennylane's default.qubit simulator by approximately 2- to 100-fold, depending on the circuit, the number of qubits, the batch size of the input data, and the hardware used.</description>

      <title>Quantum simulation of the Hubbard model on a graphene hexagon: Strengths of IQPE and noise constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05031v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing offers transformative potential for simulating real-world materials, providing a powerful platform to investigate complex quantum systems across quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics. In this work, we leverage this capability to simulate the Hubbard model on a six-site graphene hexagon using Qiskit, employing the Iterative Quantum Phase Estimation (IQPE) and adiabatic evolution algorithms to determine its ground-state properties. Noiseless simulations yield accurate ground-state energies (GSEs), charge and spin densities, and correlation functions, all in excellent agreement with exact diagonalization, underscoring the precision and reliability of quantum simulation for strongly correlated electron systems. However, deploying IQPE and adiabatic evolution on today's noisy quantum hardware remains highly challenging. To examine these limitations, we utilize the Qiskit Aer simulator with a custom noise model tailored to the characteristics of IBM's real backend. This model includes realistic depolarizing gate errors, thermal relaxation, and readout noise, allowing us to explore how these factors degrade simulation accuracy. Preliminary hardware runs on IBM devices further expose discrepancies between simulated and real-world noise, emphasizing the gap between ideal and practical implementations. Overall, our results highlight the promise of quantum computing for simulating correlated quantum materials, while also revealing the significant challenges posed by hardware noise in achieving accurate and reliable physical predictions using current quantum devices.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05045v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective behaviour of the components of a quantum system can significantly alter the rates of dynamical processes within the system. A paradigmatic collective effect is superradiance, the enhancement in the rate that radiation is emitted by a group of emitters relative to that emitted by independent emitters. Less studied are collective effects in energy transport, notably supertransfer, the enhancement of the rate of energy transfer from donors to acceptors due to delocalised excitations. Despite its proposed significance in photosynthesis, there has been no direct experimental detection of supertransfer because, in biological or molecular systems, delocalisation cannot be turned on and off to evaluate its effect on energy transfer. Here, we show that supertransfer could be directly observed using a quantum device based on a superconducting circuit. The programmability and control offered by an engineered device would allow controllable delocalisation of quantum states, giving full tunability over supertransfer. Our guidelines for engineering supertransfer could inform the design of future quantum-enhanced light harvesters.</description>

      <title>A Tractable Protocol for Detection-Loophole-Free Bell Tests over Long Distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Certifying genuine nonclassical correlations over long distances is crucial for device-independent (DI) quantum information protocols. However, in photonic platforms this remains technologically challenging due to photon loss, which opens the detection-loophole, rendering violations increasingly difficult for less efficient detectors. A well-known strategy to mitigate this involves using non-maximally entangled states, which Eberhard showed can tolerate lower detection efficiencies. However, existing proposals and demonstrations have been limited to short distances, as their success rates scale linearly with channel transmittance. Here, we propose a protocol to herald a tunable entangled state between distant users that achieves a post-selection-free Bell inequality violation at the Eberhard limit. We identify the loss independence of the vacuum component amplitude of the prepared state as the source of this enhancement. Notably, our scheme requires only quantum interference at a central station, followed by the detection of a single photon, preserving the optimal square-root scaling with channel transmittance. Our approach provides greater loss-tolerance in entanglement distribution, bringing long-distance DI applications closer to practical implementation.</description>

      <title>Enhanced spreading in continuous-time quantum walks using aperiodic temporal modulation of defects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Parrondo's paradox, where the alternation of two losing strategies can produce a winning outcome, has recently been demonstrated in continuous-time quantum walks (CTQWs) through periodic defect modulation. We extend this phenomenon to aperiodic protocols. We show that deterministic, non-repetitive defect switching can enhance quantum spreading in CTQWs compared to the defect-free case. Furthermore, we establish that the degree of this enhancement is strongly influenced by the autocorrelation and persistence characteristics of the applied aperiodic sequence. Our findings indicate that aperiodic defect modulation reliably maintains Parrondo's effect and provides new ways to control wavepacket properties in CTQWs.</description>

      <title>Efficient Characterization of N-Beam Gaussian Fields Through Photon-Number Measurements: Quantum Universal Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05084</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05084v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum universal invariants of general N-beam Gaussian fields are investigated from the point of view of fields' intensity moments. A method that uniquely links these invariants, including the global and marginal fields' purities, to intensity moments is suggested. Determination of these invariants identifies the Gaussian states including their quantum correlations. In particular, the Peres-Horodecki separability criterion is reformulated in terms of quantum universal invariants, and consequently in terms of experimental intensity moments, offering a practical tool for determining the entanglement or separability of these states. The approach is experimentally demonstrated by determining the invariants of noisy symmetric 3-beam Gaussian states using photon-number-resolved measurements. Furthermore, their entanglement properties are analyzed and characterized.</description>

Ultra-cold atomic ensembles have been used both for technological and fundamental science applications. To fully exploit their potential, a precise measurement and control of the atom number in the ensemble is crucial. We report on a precise, minimally-destructive measurement technique that can be used to prepare an atomic ensemble with a desired atom number. The measurement relies on the dispersive light-atom interaction, thus it is expected to have a negligible effect on the ensemble temperature and to induce minimal decoherence in the atomic quantum state. As a result, it can be used to perform quantum-enhanced measurements and prepare the atom-number state at the start of an interferometer sequence.</description>

      <title>Superbunching from coherently driven atoms in a waveguide</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05147v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the scattered field from $N$ identical two-level atoms resonantly driven by a weak coherent field in a one-dimensional waveguide. For atoms separated by the drive wavelength, increasing the number of atoms progressively suppresses transmission while enhancing photon bunching. Transmission becomes a superbunched $(N+1)$-photon scattering process that is predominantly incoherent. Remarkably, we find that this transmission is only possible through a process where all $N$ atoms are excited, enabling heralded multi-photon state generation with applications in long-distance entanglement and quantum metrology.</description>

      <title>Classical and Quantum Query Complexity of Boolean Functions under Indefinite Causal Order</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Computational models typically assume that operations are applied in a fixed sequential order. In recent years several works have looked at relaxing this assumption, considering computations without any fixed causal structure and showing that such ''causally indefinite'' computations can provide advantages in various tasks. Recently, the quantum query complexity of Boolean functions has been used as a tool to probe their computational power in a standard complexity theoretic framework, but no separation in exact query complexity has thus-far been found. In this paper, we investigate this problem starting with the simpler and fully classical notion of deterministic query complexity of Boolean functions, and using classical-deterministic processes -- which may exhibit causal indefiniteness -- as a generalised computational framework. We first show that the standard polynomial and certificate lower bounds of deterministic query complexity also hold in such generalised models. Then, we formulate a Boolean function for which causal indefiniteness permits a reduction in query complexity and show that this advantage can be amplified into a polynomial separation. Finally, with the insights gained in the classical-deterministic setting, we give a Boolean function whose quantum query complexity is reduced by causally indefinite computations.</description>

      <title>How to Train Your Dragon: Quantum Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training of neural networks (NNs) has emerged as a major consumer of both computational and energy resources. We demonstrate that quantum annealing platforms, such as D-Wave, can enable fast and efficient training of classical NNs, which are then deployable on conventional hardware. From a physics perspective, NN training can be viewed as a dynamical phase transition: the system evolves from an initial spin glass state to a highly ordered, trained state. This process involves eliminating numerous undesired minima in its energy landscape--akin to cutting off the ever-regenerating heads of a dragon. The advantage of annealing devices is their ability to rapidly find multiple deep states (dragon heads to be cut). We found that this quantum-assisted training achieves superior performance scaling compared to classical backpropagation methods, with a notably higher scaling exponent (1.01 vs. 0.78). It may be further increased up to a factor of 2 with a fully coherent quantum platform using a variant of the Grover algorithm. Furthermore, we argue that even a modestly sized annealer can be beneficial to train a deep NN by being applied sequentially to a few layers at a time.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mean evolution of an open quantum system in continuous time is described by a time continuous semigroup of quantum channels (completely positive and trace-preserving linear maps). Baumgartner and Narnhofer presented a general decomposition of the underlying Hilbert space into a sum of invariant subspaces, also called enclosures. We propose a new reading of this result, inspired by the work of Carbone and Pautrat. In addition, we apply this decomposition to a class of open quantum random walks and to quantum trajectories, where we study its uniqueness.</description>

      <title>Full characterization of measurement-induced transitions of a superconducting qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05306v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Repeated quantum non-demolition measurement is a cornerstone of quantum error correction protocols. In superconducting qubits, the speed of dispersive state readout can be enhanced by increasing the power of the readout tone. However, such an increase has been found to result in additional qubit state transitions that violate the desired quantum non-demolition character of the measurement. Recently, the readout of a transmon superconducting qubit was improved by using a tone with frequency much larger than the qubit frequency. Here, we experimentally identify the mechanisms of readout-induced transitions in this regime. In the dominant mechanism, the energy of an incoming readout photon is partially absorbed by the transmon and partially returned to the transmission line as a photon with lower frequency. Other mechanisms involve the excitation of unwanted package modes, decay via material defects, and, at higher qubit frequencies, the activation of undesired resonances in the transmon spectrum. Our work provides a comprehensive characterization of superconducting qubit state transitions caused by a strong drive.</description>

      <title>Erasure cost of a quantum process: A thermodynamic meaning of the dynamical min-entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The erasure of information is fundamentally an irreversible logical operation, carrying profound consequences for the energetics of computation and information processing. In this work, we investigate the thermodynamic costs associated with erasing (and preparing) quantum processes. Specifically, we analyze an arbitrary bipartite unitary gate acting on logical and ancillary input-output systems, where the ancillary input is always initialized in the ground state. We focus on the adversarial erasure cost of the reduced dynamics~\textemdash~that is, the minimal thermodynamic work required to erase the logical output of the gate for any logical input, assuming full access to the ancilla but no access to any purifying reference of the logical input state. We determine that this adversarial erasure cost is directly proportional to the negative min-entropy of the reduced dynamics, thereby giving the dynamical min-entropy a clear operational meaning. A key foundation of this result is the quantum process decoupling theorem, which quantitatively relates the decoupling ability of a process with its min-entropy. This insight bridges thermodynamics, information theory, and the fundamental limits of quantum computation.</description>

      <title>The Arm Qubit: A Superconducting Qubit Co-Designed for Coherence and Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a superconducting qubit which consists of two strongly coupled modes: one for data storage and one for coupling, allowing faster, higher-fidelity entangling gates and readout. The use of a dedicated coupling mode allows nonlinear couplings of several hundred MHz between the data mode and other elements, with minimal linear coupling to the data mode. Including decoherence, simulations show that this architecture enables microwave-only CZ gates with an infidelity of $8.6\times10^{-5}$ in 17 ns and always-on ZZ interaction less than 0.4 kHz. Numerical simulations also show readout with state assignment error of $1\times10^{-4}$ in 27 ns (assuming quantum efficiency $\eta=0.5$), Purcell-limited lifetime of 167 ms without a Purcell filter, and a mechanism to suppress shot-noise dephasing ($1/\Gamma_{\phi}=15.8$ ms). Single-qubit gate infidelities are below $1\times10^{-5}$ including decoherence. These beyond experimental state-of-the-art gate and readout fidelities rely only on capacitive coupling between arm qubits, making the arm qubit a promising scalable building block for fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Non-Perturbative Topological Gadgets for Many-Body Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05323v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Continuous-time quantum hardware implementations generally lack the native capability to implement high-order terms that would facilitate efficient compilation of quantum algorithms. This limitation has, in part, motivated the development of perturbative gadgets -- multi-qubit constructions used to effect a desired Hamiltonian using engineered low-energy subspaces of a larger system constructed using simpler, usually two-body, primitives. In this work, we demonstrate how a class of non-perturbative gadgets can produce high-order multi-body interactions by taking advantage of the odd-even properties of topological defect subspaces. The simplest example is based on domain-wall defects forming an effective Ising spin-chain based on three-body coupling with linear connectivity, alongside three-, or five-body driving terms depending on the intended use. Although this will be the main focus of the paper due to conceptual simplicity, there exist systems constructed with only two-body couplings where the boundaries determine whether there are an odd or even number of defects, namely ice-like systems which may yield more complex gadget-like constructions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The intersection of superconductivity and ferroelectricity hosts a wide range of exotic quantum phenomena. Here, we report on the observation of superconductivity in high-quality tin telluride films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. Unintentionally doped tin telluride undergoes a ferroelectric transition at ~100 K. The critical temperature of superconductivity increases monotonically with indium concentration. The critical field of superconductivity, however, does not follow the same behavior as critical temperature with indium concentration and exhibits a carrier-density-dependent violation of the Pauli limit. The electron-phonon coupling, from the McMillan formula, exhibits a systematic enhancement with indium concentration, suggesting a potential violation of BCS weak coupling at high indium concentrations.</description>

      <title>A New $q$-Heisenberg Algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04248v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work introduces a novel $q$-$\hbar$ deformation of the Heisenberg algebra, designed to unify and extend several existing $q$-deformed formulations. Starting from the canonical Heisenberg algebra defined by the commutation relation $[\hat{x}, \hat{p}] = i\hbar$ on a Hilbert space \cite{Zettili2009}, we survey a variety of $q$-deformed structures previously proposed by Wess \cite{Wess2000}, Schm\"udgen \cite{Schmudgen1999}, Wess--Schwenk \cite{Wess-Schwenk1992}, Gaddis \cite{Jasson-Gaddis2016}, and others. These frameworks involve position, momentum, and auxiliary operators that satisfy nontrivial commutation rules and algebraic relations incorporating deformation parameters. Our new $q$-$\hbar$ Heisenberg algebra $\mathcal{H}_q$ is generated by elements $\hat{x}_\alpha$, $\hat{y}_\lambda$, and $\hat{p}_\beta$ with $\alpha, \lambda, \beta \in \{1,2,3\}$, and is defined through generalized commutation relations parameterized by real constants $n, m, l$ and three dynamical functions $\Psi(q)$, $\Phi(q)$, and $\Pi(q)$ depending on the deformation parameter $q$ and the generators. By selecting appropriate values for these parameters and functions, our framework recovers several well-known algebras as special cases, including the classical Heisenberg algebra for $q = 1$ and $\Psi = 1$, $\Phi = \Pi = 0$, and various $q$-deformed algebras for $q \neq 1$. The algebraic consistency of these generalizations is demonstrated through a series of explicit examples, and the resulting structures are shown to align with quantum planes \cite{Yuri-Manin2010} and enveloping algebras associated with Lie algebra homomorphisms \cite{Reyes2014a}. This construction offers a flexible and unified formalism for studying quantum deformations, with potential applications in quantum mechanics, noncommutative geometry, and quantum group theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04259v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The inaugural edition of the MIT Quantum Index Report (QIR). Quantum technologies are evolving from theoretical concepts into tangible technologies with commercial promise. Their rapid progress is capturing global attention and suggests we stand on the cusp of a second quantum revolution. Unlocking the quantum opportunity is not simple. One challenge is that quantum technologies can present a high barrier to understanding for nonexperts because they often rely on complex principles and concepts from a variety of specialist fields. This can lead to confusion and intimidation for business leaders, educators, policymakers and others. The Quantum Index Report aims to reduce the complexity and make it possible for a wider audience to have a deeper understanding of the quantum landscape. The Quantum Index Report provides a comprehensive, data-driven assessment of the state of quantum technologies. For this inaugural edition we have focused on quantum computing and networking. The report tracks, measures, and visualizes trends across research, development, education and public acceptance. It aggregates data from academia, industry and policy sources and aims to provide nonpartisan insights.</description>

      <title>Precision Measurement of Lifetime and Branching Ratios of the $4f^{13}5d6s\,^1[5/2]_{5/2}$ state in Yb$^+$ ions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report spectroscopic and time-resolved experimental observations to characterize the $[{\rm Xe}]4f^{13}(^2F^{o}_{5/2}){5d6s(}{^1\!D}){^{1}[5/2]^{o}_{5/2}}$ state in $^{172}$Yb$^+$ ions. We access this state from the metastable $4f^{14}5d (^2D_{3/2,5/2})$ manifold and observe an unexpectedly long lifetime of $\tau=37.9(9) \,\mu$s that allows visible Rabi oscillations and resolved-sideband spectroscopy. Using a combination of coherent population dynamics, high-fidelity detection and heralded state preparation, and optical pumping methods, we measure the branching ratios to the $^{2}D_{3/2}$, $^2D_{5/2}$, $^2S_{1/2}$ states to be 0.359(2), 0.639(2), 0.0023(16), respectively. The branching ratio to the $4f^{13}6s^{2}({^2F}_{7/2})$ is compatible with zero within our experimental resolution. We also report measurements of its Land\'e g-factor and the branching ratio of the ${^{2}{D}_{5/2}}$ to ${^{2}{S}_{1/2}}$ decay in $^{172}$Yb$^+$ to be 0.188(3), improving its relative uncertainty by an order of magnitude. Our measurements pave the way to a better understanding of the atomic structure of Yb$^+$ ions, which still lacks accurate numerical descriptions, and the use of high-lying excited states for partial detection and qubit manipulation in the omg architecture.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that an effective gravitational field naturally emerges in quantum materials with long-wavelength spin (or pseudospin) textures. When the itinerant electrons' spin strongly couples to the background spin texture, it effectively behaves as a spinless particle in a curved space, with the curvature arising from quantum corrections to the electron's spin orientation. The emergent gravity gives rise to the electron lensing effect, an analog of the gravitational lensing. Our work shows that novel ``gravitational'' phenomena generically appear in quantum systems due to nonadiabaticity, opening new research directions in quantum physics.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04413v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the general failure of the famous concept of tight binding and mode hybridization underlying modern theories of coupled open resonators. In spite of sophisticated examples in the literature, successfully illustrating these theories, the latter fail to describe any planar systems. This includes the simplest possible case of two dielectric slabs placed next to each other or separated by a distance, which is straightforward for verification, due to its analytical solvability. We present a rigorous theory capable of calculating correctly the eigenmodes of arbitrary three-dimensional dispersive coupled resonators in terms of their individual modes, providing insight into the proper mode hybridization and formation of bonding and antibonding supermodes. Planar optical resonators, such as coupled slabs and Bragg-mirror microcavities, are used for illustrative purposes as they allow precise and reliable verification of the theory.</description>

      <title>Free Probability approach to spectral and operator statistics in Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Utilizing the framework of free probability, we analyze the spectral and operator statistics of the Rosenzweig-Porter random matrix ensembles, which exhibit a rich phase structure encompassing ergodic, fractal, and localized regimes. Leveraging subordination formulae, we develop a perturbative scheme that yields semi-analytic expressions for the density of states up to second order in system size, in good agreement with numerical results. We compute higher-point correlation functions in the ergodic regime using both numerical and suitable analytic approximations. Our analysis of operator statistics for various spin operators across these regimes reveals close agreement with free probability predictions in the ergodic phase, in contrast to persistent deviations observed in the fractal and localized phases, even at late times. Notably, the fractal phase exhibits partial features of asymptotic freeness while retaining memory of the initial spectrum, highlighting the importance of non-localized eigenstates for the emergence of free probability behavior. Employing distance measures and statistical tools such as the $\chi^2$ statistic, Kullback-Leibler divergence, and Kolmogorov-Smirnov hypothesis testing, we define a characteristic time scale-the free time-that marks the onset of the validity of free probability predictions for operator spectral statistics in the ergodic phase. Remarkably, our findings demonstrate consistency across these different approaches.</description>

      <title>On the analytical approach to infinite-mode Boson-Gaussian states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04537</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04537v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop an analytical approach to quantum Gaussian states in infinite-mode representation of the Canonical Commutation Relations (CCR's), using Yosida approximations to define integrability of possibly unbounded observables with respect to a state $\rho$ ($\rho$-integrability). It turns out that all elements of the commutative $*$-algebra generated by a possibly unbounded $\rho$-integrable observable $A$, denoted by $\langle A\rangle$, are normal and $\rho \, $-integrable. Besides, $\langle A\rangle$ can be endowed with the well-defined norm $\|\cdot\|_\rho:= {\rm tr}\,(\rho |\cdot| )$. Our approach allows us to rigorously establish fundamental properties and derive key formulae for the mean value vector and the covariance operator. We additionally show that the covariance operator $S$ of any Gaussian state is real, bounded, positive, and invertible, with the property that $S-iJ\geq 0$, being $J$ the multiplication operator by $-i$ on $\ell_2({\mathbb N})$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04550v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Trace-free Einstein gravity, in the absence of matter fields and using the Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) metric, is solvable both classically and quantum mechanically. This is achieved by using the conformal time as the time variable and the negative or positive of the inverse of the scale factor as configuration variable to write the classical equation of motion, which turns out to be the one of a free particle ($k=0$), a harmonic oscillator ($k=1$), and a repulsive oscillator ($k=-1$) in the real half-line. In all cases, the observable identified as the cosmological constant is six times the Hamiltonian. In particular, for a closed Universe ($k=1$), spacetime exhibits a cyclic evolution along which the scalar curvature is constant and finite, thereby avoiding singularities. The quantum theory is reached by using canonical quantization. We calculate the spectrum of the observable corresponding to the cosmological constant. Remarkably, for the closed Universe ($k=1$), the spectrum is discrete and positive while for flat ($k=0$) and open ($k=-1$) universes, the spectra are continuous. Heisenberg's uncertainty principle imposes limitations on the simultaneous measurement of the Hubble expansion (momentum variable) and the configuration variable. We also report the observable identified as the cosmological constant for inflaton, phantom and perfect fluids coupled to trace-free Einstein gravity in the FRW metric.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04631v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Elucidating dielectric losses, structural heterogeneity, and interface imperfections is critical for improving coherence in superconducting qubits. However, most diagnostics rely on destructive electron microscopy or low-throughput millikelvin quantum measurements. Here, we demonstrate noninvasive terahertz (THz) nano-imaging/-spectroscopy of encapsulated niobium transmon qubits, revealing sidewall near-field scattering that correlates with qubit coherence. We further employ a THz hyperspectral line scan to probe dielectric responses and field participation at Al junction interfaces. These findings highlight the promise of THz near-field methods as a high-throughput proxy characterization tool for guiding material selection and optimizing processing protocols to improve qubit and quantum circuit performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have re-analyzed the dynamics of the thermal potential within Schwarzschild spacetime by employing the Fokker-Planck equation. We demonstrate that the Fokker-Planck equation reduces to a simplified form equivalent to a scaled quantum mechanical problem with a harmonic oscillator potential. In this framework, we highlight an interesting correspondence between supersymmetric quantum mechanics (SUSY QM) and the Fokker-Planck dynamics associated with the Schwarzschild metric. Utilizing the isospectral deformation, an intrinsic feature of SUSY QM, we derive a family of one-parameter isospectral potentials. Notably, this new class of potentials exhibits the same energy spectrum as the original harmonic oscillator potential, but with distinct wavefunctions.</description>

      <title>Time Glasses: Symmetry Broken Chaotic Phase with a Finite Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04740v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the time glass, a non-periodic analogue of the discrete time crystal that arises in periodically driven dissipative quantum many-body systems. This phase is defined by two key features: (i) spatial long-range order arising from the spontaneous breaking of an internal symmetry, and (ii) temporally chaotic oscillations of the order parameter, whose lifetime diverges with system size. To characterize the time glass phase, we focus on the spectral gap of the one-cycle (Floquet) Liouvillian, which determines the decay rate of the slowest relaxation mode. Numerical studies of periodically driven dissipative Ising models show that, in the time glass phase, the Liouvillian gap remains finite in the thermodynamic limit, in contrast to time crystals where the gap closes exponentially with system size. We further demonstrate that the Liouvillian gap converges to the decay rate of the order-parameter autocorrelation derived from the classical (mean-field) dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. This result establishes a direct correspondence between microscopic spectral features and emergent macroscopic dynamics in driven dissipative quantum systems. At first glance, the existence of a nonzero Liouvillian gap appears incompatible with the presence of indefinitely persistent chaotic oscillations. We resolve this apparent paradox by showing that the quantum R\'enyi divergence between a localized coherent initial state and the highly delocalized steady state grows unboundedly with system size. This divergence allows long-lived transients to persist even in the presence of a finite Liouvillian gap.</description>

      <title>Kernel $k$-Medoids as General Vector Quantization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04786v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Vector Quantization (VQ) is a widely used technique in machine learning and data compression, valued for its simplicity and interpretability. Among hard VQ methods, $k$-medoids clustering and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) approaches represent two prominent yet seemingly unrelated paradigms -- one distance-based, the other rooted in probability density matching. In this paper, we investigate their connection through the lens of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO). We compare a heuristic QUBO formulation for $k$-medoids, which balances centrality and diversity, with a principled QUBO derived from minimizing Maximum Mean Discrepancy in KDE-based VQ. Surprisingly, we show that the KDE-QUBO is a special case of the $k$-medoids-QUBO under mild assumptions on the kernel's feature map. This reveals a deeper structural relationship between these two approaches and provides new insight into the geometric interpretation of the weighting parameters used in QUBO formulations for VQ.</description>

      <title>Tunable spin-phonon polarons in a chiral molecular qubit framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04885</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.04885v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral structures that produce asymmetric spin-phonon coupling can theoretically generate spin-phonon polarons -- quasiparticles exhibiting non-degenerate spin states with phonon displacements. However, direct experimental evidence has been lacking. Using a chiral molecular qubit framework embedding stable semiquinone-like radicals, we report spin dynamic signatures that clearly indicate the formation of spin-phonon polarons for the first time. Our non-adiabatic model reveals that these quasiparticles introduce an active spin relaxation channel when polaron reorganization energy approaches Zeeman splitting. This new channel manifests as anomalous, temperature-independent spin relaxation, which can be suppressed by high magnetic fields or pore-filling solvents (e.g. CH2Cl2, CS2). Such field- and guest-tunable relaxation is unattainable in conventional spin systems. Harnessing this mechanism could boost repetition rates in spin-based quantum information technologies without compromising coherence.</description>

      <title>Gate-tunable spectrum and charge dispersion mitigation in a graphene superconducting qubit</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Controlling the energy spectrum of quantum-coherent superconducting circuits, i.e. the energies of excited states, the circuit anharmonicity and the states' charge dispersion, is essential for designing performant qubits. This control is usually achieved by adjusting the circuit's geometry. In-situ control is traditionally obtained via an external magnetic field, in the case of tunnel Josephson junctions. More recently, semiconductor-weak-links-based Josephson junctions have emerged as an alternative building block with the advantage of tunability via the electric-field effect. Gate-tunable Josephson junctions have been succesfully integrated in superconducting circuits using for instance semiconducting nanowires or two-dimensional electron gases. In this work we demonstrate, in a graphene superconducting circuit, a large gate-tunability of qubit properties: frequency, anharmonicity and charge dispersion. We rationalize these features using a model considering the transmission of Cooper pairs through Andreev bound states. Noticeably, we show that the high transmission of Cooper pairs in such weak link strongly suppresses the charge dispersion. Our work illustrates the potential for graphene-based qubits as versatile building-blocks in advanced quantum circuits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.04966v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Nanoporous graphene (NPG) has been fabricated by on-surface-self assembly in the form of arrays of apporx. 1 nm-wide graphene nanoribbons connected via molecular bridges in a two-dimensional crystal lattice. It is predicted that NPG may, despite its molecular structure, work as electron waveguides that display e.g. Talbot wave interference. Here, we demonstrate how the electronic wave guidance may be controlled by the use of electrical fields transverse to the ribbons; at low fields, point injected currents display spatially periodic patterns along the ribbons, while high fields localize the injected current to single ribbons. This behavior constitutes an electronic version of optical breathing modes of Bloch oscillations, providing a simple mechanism for controlling the current patterns down to the molecular scale. The robustness of the self-repeating patterns under disorder demonstrate that the breathing modes of single-ribbon injections offer exciting opportunities for applications in nanoelectronics, molecular sensing, and quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Engineering harmonic emission through spatial modulation in a Kitaev chain</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate High-harmonic generation (HHG) in a dimerized Kitaev chain. The dimerization in the model is introduced through a site-dependent modulating potential, determined by a parameter $\lambda \in [-1:1]$. This parameter also determines the strength of the hopping amplitudes and tunes the system's topology. Depending upon the parameter $\lambda$, the HHG emission spectrum can be classified into three segments. The first segment exhibits two plateau structures, with the dominant one resulting from transitions to the chiral partner state, consistent with quasiparticle behavior in the topological superconducting phase. The second segment displays multiple plateaus, where intermediate states enable various transition pathways to higher conduction bands. Finally, the third segment presents broader plateaus, indicative of active interband transitions. In the $\lambda\leq0$ regime, we observe the mid-gap states (MGSs) hybridize with the bulk, suppressing the earlier observed harmonic enhancements. This highlights the key role of the intermediate states, particularly when MGSs are isolated. These results demonstrate that harmonic emission profiles can be selectively controlled through the modulating parameter $\lambda$, offering new prospects for tailoring HHG in topological systems.</description>

Abstract: Deep neural networks can represent very different sorts of functions, including complex quantum many-body states. Tensor networks can also represent these states, have more structure and are easier to optimize. However, they can be prohibitively costly computationally in two or higher dimensions. Here, we propose a generalization of the perceptron - the perceptrain - which borrows features from the two different formalisms. We construct variational many-body ansatz from a simple network of perceptrains. The network can be thought of as a neural network with a few distinct features inherited from tensor networks. These include efficient local optimization akin to the density matrix renormalization algorithm, instead of optimizing of all the parameters at once; the possibility to dynamically increase the number of parameters during the optimization; the possibility to compress the state to avoid overfitting; and a structure that remains quantum-inspired. We showcase the ansatz using a combination of Variational Monte-Carlo (VMC) and Green Function Monte-Carlo (GFMC) on a $10\times 10$ transverse field quantum Ising model with a long range $1/r^6$ antiferromagnetic interaction. The model corresponds to the Rydberg (cold) atoms platform proposed for quantum annealing. We consistently find a very high relative accuracy for the ground state energy, around $10^{-5}$ for VMC and $10^{-6}$ for GFMC in all regimes of parameters, including in the vicinity of the quantum phase transition. We used very small ranks ($\sim 2-5$) of perceptrains, as opposed to multiples of thousand used in matrix product states. The optimization of the energy was robust with respect to the choice of initial conditions and hyper-parameters, in contrast to a common experience when using neural network wave functions.</description>

      <title>A comparative study of focusing with scalar and vector beams in an active Raman gain system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05093v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the focusing characteristics of scalar and vector beams within an atomic medium. An active-Raman-gain configuration is employed to achieve significant Kerr nonlinearity in a four-state atomic system. The probe beams can attain focusing within the medium through careful selection of input beam intensities and the spatial profile of the control field. We analytically derive the linear and third-order nonlinear susceptibilities for both scalar and vector probe beams. Our observations indicate that, in addition to the energy transfer from the control beam to the probe beam, the giant cross-Kerr nonlinearity facilitates the focusing of the scalar probe beam into a significantly smaller spot size. Conversely, the vector probe beams exhibit gain-induced narrowing. Furthermore, we evaluate the state of polarization for the vector beam at the minimum beam waist, observing a polarization rotation and a change in ellipticity during propagation. Through the mechanism of focusing, we achieve a reduced spot size for the probe beam, which may have substantial implications for resolution enhancement in microscopy applications.</description>

      <title>A framework for fluctuating times and counting observables in stochastic excursions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05160</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05160v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many natural systems exhibit dynamics characterized by alternating phases. Describing the fluctuations of such systems over stochastic trajectories is necessary across diverse fields, from biological motors to quantum thermal machines. In an accompanying Letter, we introduced the notion of stochastic excursions -- a framework to analyze far from equilibrium processes via sub-trajectories. Through counting observables, this framework captures finite-time fluctuations and trajectory-level behavior, which provides insights into thermodynamical trade-offs between thermodynamic quantities of interest, such as entropy production and dynamical activity. In this work, we enhance this formalism by providing a suite of technical results on how to efficiently compute excursion-related quantities. Our analytical results provide explicit formulas for general moments of counting variables and excursion duration, as well as their covariance and conditional moments. We show that excursion statistics recover full counting statistics results, and uncover a relation between fluctuations of counting observables at single-excursion level and the steady state diffusion coefficient (noise). We also discuss a fluctuation theorem for individual excursions. In addition, we explore how analyzing excursions and using the results developed here can yield insights into three problems of interest: the three-qubit absorption refrigerator, cellular sensing, and birth-and-death processes.</description>

      <title>Adiabatic dynamics in a V-type quantum system by oppositely chirped counterrotating circularly polarized laser pulses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05177v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shaped free electron vortices (SEVs) have recently been studied using atomic (1+2) resonance-enhanced multiphoton ionization (REMPI) by oppositely chirped counterrotating circularly polarized (OC-CRCP) femtosecond laser pulses. By transitioning from the perturbative to the non-perturbative REMPI regime, we identify an adiabatic excitation mechanism in a resonant V-type three-level system, termed V-RAP due to its similarities to rapid adiabatic passage (RAP). Experimentally, we observe a pronounced change in the shape of the measured three-dimensional photoelectron momentum distribution (3D PMD), which we trace back to this mechanism via analytical calculations and numerical simulations of the bound state and ionization dynamics. In V-RAP, the atom adiabatically follows the OC-CRCP field, with the two excited states driven in anti-phase, leading to an adiabatic cancellation of specific ionization pathways and explaining the observed changes in the PMD. In the experiment, we combine supercontinuum polarization pulse shaping to generate OC-CRCP femtosecond laser pulses with velocity map imaging-based photoelectron tomography to reconstruct the 3D PMD. The reconstructed PMDs are decomposed by 3D Fourier analysis into SEVs of different rotational symmetry, revealing a significant enhancement of the $c_6$-symmetric contribution, which is the signature of the V-RAP.</description>

      <title>The non-Hermitian magnetic moment</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05206v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct a semiclassical theory for electrons in a non-Hermitian periodic system subject to perturbations varying slowly in space and time. We derive the energy of the wavepacket to first order in the gradients of the perturbations. Applying the theory to the specific case of a uniform external magnetic field, we obtain an expression for the orbital magnetization energy. Using the principles of non-Hermitian dynamics, we define a physically meaningful non-Hermitian generalization of the angular momentum operator and show that it is compatible with the real part of the orbital magnetic moment. The imaginary part of the orbital magnetic moment is also discussed and shown to originate from an imaginary counterpart to the angular momentum that gives rise to a non-Hermitian generalization of the Aharonov-Bohm effect.</description>

      <title>A Unified Framework for Provably Efficient Algorithms to Estimate Shapley Values</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Shapley values have emerged as a critical tool for explaining which features impact the decisions made by machine learning models. However, computing exact Shapley values is difficult, generally requiring an exponential (in the feature dimension) number of model evaluations. To address this, many model-agnostic randomized estimators have been developed, the most influential and widely used being the KernelSHAP method (Lundberg &amp; Lee, 2017). While related estimators such as unbiased KernelSHAP (Covert &amp; Lee, 2021) and LeverageSHAP (Musco &amp; Witter, 2025) are known to satisfy theoretical guarantees, bounds for KernelSHAP have remained elusive. We describe a broad and unified framework that encompasses KernelSHAP and related estimators constructed using both with and without replacement sampling strategies. We then prove strong non-asymptotic theoretical guarantees that apply to all estimators from our framework. This provides, to the best of our knowledge, the first theoretical guarantees for KernelSHAP and sheds further light on tradeoffs between existing estimators. Through comprehensive benchmarking on small and medium dimensional datasets for Decision-Tree models, we validate our approach against exact Shapley values, consistently achieving low mean squared error with modest sample sizes. Furthermore, we make specific implementation improvements to enable scalability of our methods to high-dimensional datasets. Our methods, tested on datasets such MNIST and CIFAR10, provide consistently better results compared to the KernelSHAP library.</description>

Abstract: The gold-standard for security in quantum cryptographic protocols is information-theoretic security. Information-theoretic security is surely future-proof, because it makes no assumptions on the hardness of any computational problems and relies only on the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics. Here, we revisit a permutational-key quantum homomorphic encryption protocol with information-theoretic security. We explain how to integrate this protocol with quantum error correction that has the error correction encoding as a homomorphism. This feature enables both client and server to apply the encoding and decoding step for the quantum error correction, without use of the encrypting permutation-key.</description>

      <title>Solving the semidefinite relaxation of QUBOs in matrix multiplication time, and faster with a quantum computer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.04237v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent works on quantum algorithms for solving semidefinite optimization (SDO) problems have leveraged a quantum-mechanical interpretation of positive semidefinite matrices to develop methods that obtain quantum speedups with respect to the dimension $n$ and number of constraints $m$. While their dependence on other parameters suggests no overall speedup over classical methodologies, some quantum SDO solvers provide speedups in the low-precision regime. We exploit this fact to our advantage, and present an iterative refinement scheme for the Hamiltonian Updates algorithm of Brand\~ao et al. (Quantum 6, 625 (2022)) to exponentially improve the dependence of their algorithm on precision. As a result, we obtain a classical algorithm to solve the semidefinite relaxation of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems (QUBOs) in matrix multiplication time. Provided access to a quantum read/classical write random access memory (QRAM), a quantum implementation of our algorithm exhibits a worst case running time of $\mathcal{O} \left(ns + n^{1.5} \cdot \text{polylog} \left(n, \| C \|_F, \frac{1}{\epsilon} \right) \right)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.04245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Correlated errors may devastate quantum error corrections that are necessary for the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computation. Recent experiments with superconducting qubits indicate that they can arise from quasiparticle (QP) bursts induced by cosmic-ray muons and {\gamma}-rays. Here, we use charge-parity jump and bit flip for monitoring QP bursts and two muon detectors in the dilution refrigerator for detecting muon events. We directly observe QP bursts leading to correlated errors that are induced solely by muons and separate the contributions of muons and {\gamma}-rays. We further investigate the dynamical process of QP burst and the impact of QP trapping on correlated errors and particle detection. The proposed method, which monitors multiqubit simultaneous charge-parity jumps, has high sensitivity to QP burst and may find applications for the detection of cosmic-ray particles, low-mass dark matter, and far-infrared photons.</description>

      <title>Low Overhead Qutrit Magic State Distillation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.06228v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that using qutrits rather than qubits leads to a substantial reduction in the overhead cost associated with an approach to fault-tolerant quantum computing known as magic state distillation. We construct a family of $[[9m-k, k, 2]]_3$ triorthogonal qutrit error-correcting codes for any positive integers $m$ and $k$ with $k \leq 3m-2$ that are suitable for magic state distillation. In magic state distillation, the number of ancillae required to produce a magic state with target error rate $\epsilon$ is $O(\log^\gamma \epsilon^{-1})$, where the yield parameter $\gamma$ characterizes the overhead cost. For $k=3m-2$, our codes have $\gamma = \log_2 (2+\frac{6}{3 m-2})$, which tends to $1$ as $m \to \infty$. Moreover, the $[[20,7,2]]_3$ qutrit code that arises from our construction when $m=3$ already has a yield parameter of $1.51$ which outperforms all known qubit triorthogonal codes of size less than a few hundred qubits.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.08124v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The development and improvement of analytical methods for evaluating nonclassical correlations is one of the most important tasks in quantum information science. In this paper, we investigate a mixed spin-$(1/2,S)$ system with an arbitrary spin $S$, where the interactions satisfy the U(1) axial symmetry. Analytical formulas for the local quantum uncertainty (LQU) and local quantum Fisher information (LQFI) are derived directly from the elements and eigenvalues of the density matrix. These results are then used to conduct a comparative analysis of the discord-like quantum correlations, LQU and LQFI, in the system at thermal equilibrium. The high-temperature asymptotics of both quantum correlations are found explicitly. Despite the destructive role of temperature in general, the calculations show that the quantum correlations can increase with temperature in local intervals. Under certain conditions, temperature even generates quantum correlations from uncorrelated ground states. Further, as the system cools, quantum correlations can undergo a series of abrupt transitions with a smooth temperature change. These phenomena are demonstrated for different choices of coupling parameters and spin lengths $S$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08441v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Understanding quantum phase transitions in physical systems is fundamental to characterize their behavior at low temperatures. Achieving this requires both accessing good approximations to the ground state and identifying order parameters to distinguish different phases. Addressing these challenges, our work introduces a hybrid algorithm that combines quantum optimization with classical machine learning. This approach leverages the capability of near-term quantum computers to prepare locally trapped states through finite optimization. Specifically, we apply LASSO for identifying conventional phase transitions and the Transformer model for topological transitions, utilizing these with a sliding window scan of Hamiltonian parameters to learn appropriate order parameters and locate critical points. We validated the method with numerical simulations and real-hardware experiments on Rigetti's Ankaa 9Q-1 quantum computer. This protocol provides a framework for investigating quantum phase transitions with shallow circuits, offering enhanced efficiency and, in some settings, higher precision-thus contributing to the broader effort to integrate near-term quantum computing and machine learning.</description>

Abstract: We construct the vector field associated to the GKLS generator for systems described by Gaussian states. This vector field is defined on the dual space of the algebra of operators, restricted to operators quadratic in position and momentum. It is shown that the GKLS dynamics accepts a decomposition principle, that is, this vector field can be decomposed in three parts, a conservative Hamiltonian component, a gradient-like, and a Choi-Kraus or jump vector field. The two last terms are considered a "perturbation" associated with dissipation. Examples are presented for a harmonic oscillator with different dissipation terms.</description>

Abstract: Building a scalable universal high-performance quantum processor is a formidable challenge. In particular, the problem of realizing fast high-perfomance two-qubit gates of high-fidelity remains needful. Here we propose a building block for a scalable quantum processor consisting of two transmons and a tunable three-mode coupler allowing for a ZZ interaction control. We experimentally demonstrate the native CZ gate with the pulse duration of 60 ns achieving the two-qubit gate fidelity above 98%, limited mostly by qubit coherence time. Numerical simulations show that by optimizing the gate duration the fidelity can be pushed over 99.97%.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.13785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents an enhancement to Grover's search algorithm for instances where the number of items (or the size of the search problem) $N$ is not a power of 2. By employing an efficient algorithm for the preparation of uniform quantum superposition states over a subset of the computational basis states, we demonstrate that a considerable reduction in the number of oracle calls (and Grover's iterations) can be achieved in many cases. For special cases (i.e., when $N$ is of the form such that it is slightly greater than an integer power of 2), the reduction in the number of oracle calls (and Grover's iterations) asymptotically approaches 29.33\%. This improvement is significant compared to the traditional Grover's algorithm, which handles such cases by rounding $N$ up to the nearest power of 2. The key to this improvement is our algorithm for the preparation of uniform quantum superposition states over a subset of the computational basis states, which requires gate complexity and circuit depth of only $ O (\log_2 (N)) $, without using any ancilla qubits.</description>

Abstract: We initiate the study of sample-optimal quantum state tomography with minimal disturbance to the samples. Can we efficiently learn a precise description of a quantum state through sequential measurements of samples while at the same time making sure that the post-measurement state of the samples is only minimally perturbed? Defining regret as the cumulative disturbance of all samples, the challenge is to find a balance between the most informative sequence of measurements on the one hand and measurements incurring minimal regret on the other. Here we answer this question for qubit states by exhibiting a protocol that for pure states achieves maximal precision while incurring a regret that grows only polylogarithmically with the number of samples, a scaling that we show to be optimal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.00903v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity can lead to the emergence of many intriguing phenomena that are absent in Hermitian systems, enabled by exceptional topological defects, among which Weyl exceptional rings (WER) are particularly interesting. The topology of a WER can be characterized by the quantized Berry phase and a nonzero Chern number, both encoded in the eigenvectors of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. So far, WERs have been realized with classical wave systems, whose eigenvectors can be well described by classical physics. We here report the first quantum-mechanical implementation of WERs and investigate the related topology transitions. The experiment system consists of a superconducting qubit and a dissipative resonator, coupled to each other. The high flexibility of the system enables us to characterize its eigenvectors on different manifolds of parameter space, each of which corresponds to a quantum-mechanical entangled state. We extract both the quantized Berry phase and Chern number from these eigenvectors, and demonstrate the topological transition triggered by shrinking the size of the manifold.</description>

      <title>Improved Belief Propagation Decoding Algorithms for Surface Codes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.11523v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum error correction is crucial for universal fault-tolerant quantum computing. Highly accurate and low-time-complexity decoding algorithms play an indispensable role in ensuring quantum error correction works effectively. Among existing decoding algorithms, belief propagation (BP) is notable for its nearly linear time complexity and general applicability to stabilizer codes. However, BP's decoding accuracy without post-processing is unsatisfactory in most situations. This article focuses on improving the decoding accuracy of BP over GF(4) for surface codes. Inspired by machine learning optimization techniques, we first propose Momentum-BP and AdaGrad-BP to reduce oscillations in message updating, breaking the trapping sets of surface codes. We further propose EWAInit-BP, which adaptively updates initial probabilities and provides a 1 to 3 orders of magnitude improvement over traditional BP for planar surface code, toric code, and XZZX surface code without any post-processing method, showing high decoding accuracy even under parallel scheduling. The theoretical $O(1)$ time complexity under parallel implementation and high accuracy of EWAInit-BP make it a promising candidate for high-precision real-time decoders.</description>

      <title>Against (unitary) interpretation (of quantum mechanics): removing the metaphysical load</title>

Abstract: On 6 June 1925 Heisenberg arrived at Helgoland/Heligoland island to escape a fit of hay fever. He returned with a sketch of a strange theory of the micro-world of atoms, which we now call quantum mechanics. This e-print of ours attempts to present a look on that theory which tries to return to the original insight of Heisenberg, on what should be the essence of a theory of atomic realm: it must be a theory of the observable events, in which fundamentally unobservable quantities have no place. No ontological status is given to elements of the mathematical formulation of the theory. The theory is about our description of events in laboratories.</description>

      <title>Quantum Algorithm for Vibronic Dynamics: Case Study on Singlet Fission Solar Cell Design</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.13669v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Vibronic interactions between nuclear motion and electronic states are critical for the accurate modeling of photochemistry. However, accurate simulations of fully quantum non-adiabatic dynamics are often prohibitively expensive for classical methods beyond small systems. In this work, we present a quantum algorithm based on product formulas for simulating time evolution under a general vibronic Hamiltonian in real space, capable of handling an arbitrary number of electronic states and vibrational modes. We develop the first trotterization scheme for vibronic Hamiltonians beyond two electronic states and introduce an array of optimization techniques for the exponentiation of each fragment in the product formula, resulting in a remarkably low cost of implementation. To demonstrate practical relevance, we outline a proof-of-principle integration of our algorithm into a materials discovery pipeline for designing more efficient singlet fission-based organic solar cells. We estimate that $100$ femtoseconds of propagation using a second-order Trotter product formula for a $6$-state, $21$-mode model of exciton transport at an anthracene dimer requires $154$ qubits and $2.76 \times 10^6$ Toffoli gates. While a $4$-state, $246$-mode model describing charge transfer at an anthracene-fullerene interface requires $1053$ qubits and $2.66 \times 10^7$ Toffoli gates.</description>

      <title>Spacetime Markov length: a diagnostic for fault tolerance via mixed-state phases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00193</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00193v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a correspondence between the fault-tolerance of local stabilizer codes experiencing measurement and physical errors and the mixed-state phases of decohered resource states in one higher dimension. Drawing from recent developments in mixed-state phases of matter, this motivates a diagnostic of fault-tolerance, which we refer to as the spacetime Markov length. This is a length scale determined by the decay of the (classical) conditional mutual information of repeated syndrome measurement outcomes in spacetime. The diagnostic is independent of the decoder, and its divergence signals the intrinsic breakdown of fault tolerance. As a byproduct, we find that decoherence may be useful for exposing transitions from higher-form symmetry-protected topological phases driven by both incoherent and coherent perturbations.</description>

      <title>Optomechanical systems with nonlinear interactions: photon blockade, collapse-revival effect and Fano-like resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.00908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Closed-form expressions for the average amplitude of the optical field in optomechanical systems are obtained, in which, in addition to the linear interaction, quadratic and cubic interactions of the vibrational mode of the mechanical resonator with the mode of the optical resonator are considered. In the framework of the non-secular perturbation theory, using the Bogoliubov averaging method, it is shown that the effects of photon blockade, collapse and revival of optical oscillations in such systems can be realized. The main contribution to the formation of revivals is provided by the Kerr self-action of the optical mode and the cross-Kerr interaction of the fourth degree in optical and mechanical amplitudes. The cross-Kerr interactions of the sixth- and eighth-order in amplitudes destroy the regular structure of revivals. The influence of these cross-Kerr nonlinearities disappears with an increase in the decay rate of the optical mode and is also completely suppressed at zero temperature. It is shown that the asymmetry of the spectral line of the optical field intensity in the cavity is most pronounced with an increase in the degree of nonlinearity and is explained by Fano interference.</description>

      <title>Active Learning with Variational Quantum Circuits for Quantum Process Tomography</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum process tomography (QPT) is a fundamental tool for fully characterizing quantum systems. It relies on querying a set of quantum states as input to the quantum process. Previous QPT methods typically employ a straightforward strategy for randomly selecting quantum states, overlooking differences in informativeness among them. In this work, we propose a general active learning (AL) framework that adaptively selects the most informative subset of quantum states for reconstruction. We design and evaluate various AL algorithms and provide practical guidelines for selecting suitable methods in different scenarios. In particular, we introduce a learning framework that leverages the widely-used variational quantum circuits (VQCs) to perform the QPT task and integrate our AL algorithms into the query step. We demonstrate our algorithms by reconstructing the unitary quantum processes resulting from random quantum circuits with up to seven qubits. Numerical results show that our AL algorithms achieve significantly improved reconstruction, and the improvement increases with the size of the underlying quantum system. Our work opens new avenues for further advancing existing QPT methods.</description>

      <title>Optimizing hypergraph product codes with random walks, simulated annealing and reinforcement learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.09622v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hypergraph products are quantum low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes constructed from two classical LDPC codes. Although their dimension and distance depend only on the parameters of the underlying classical codes, optimizing their performance against various noise channels remains challenging. This difficulty partly stems from the complexity of decoding in the quantum setting. The standard, ad hoc approach typically involves selecting classical LDPC codes with large girth. In this work, we focus on optimizing performance against the quantum erasure channel. A key advantage of this channel is the existence of an efficient maximum-likelihood decoder, which enables us to employ optimization techniques based on sampling random codes, such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Simulated Annealing (SA). Our results indicate that these techniques improve performance relative to the state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Realization of maximally-entangling two-qutrit gates using the Cross-Resonance scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework for realizing maximally entangling two-qutrit gates on fixed-frequency transmons that generalize the qubit-centric cross-resonance (CR) interaction beyond the 0-1 subspace, which we call as generalized cross-resonance (GCR) scheme. We use the GCR scheme to design parametric two-qutrit gates, namely, $U_{CR}^{01}$ and $U_{CR}^{12}$, that act on the $0{-}1$ and $1{-}2$ energy transitions of transmons, respectively. Our gates improve upon the existing works in two aspects. First, our gates \emph{directly} allow for entanglement on the $1{-}2$ levels instead of relying on the entangling ability on the $0{-}1$ levels to perform entanglement on the subspace spanned by $|1\rangle $ and $|2\rangle $, as done in previous works. Second, our gates are parametric in nature, enabling us to construct multiple entangling gates of interest, while the prior works that use cross-resonance for qutrits focus on individual gates. Further, we use Qiskit Dynamics to perform a simulation-based demonstration of two-qutrit generalized controlled-$X$ and controlled-$\sqrt{X}$ gates, namely, $U_{CX}^{01}$ and $U_{CSX}^{12}$, which are instances of proposed $U_{CR}$ gates. Numerical simulations in Qiskit Dynamics, calibrated to experimental parameters that mimic the actual backend, demonstrate gate fidelities of $99.73\pm0.01\%$ and $98.10\pm0.01\%$ for $U_{CX}^{01}$ and $U_{CSX}^{12}$ gates, respectively, obtained using Quantum Process Tomography. A two-qutrit Bell state $|\psi\rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}(|00\rangle + |11\rangle + |22\rangle)$ is prepared with fidelity $98.33 \pm 0.01\%$ obtained using Quantum State Tomography with a $\sim 514$ ns pulse sequence. We note that the complete time taken for Bell state preparation in our setup is less than the gate time of cross-Kerr-based entangling gates.</description>

      <title>A Warm-start QAOA based approach using a swap-based mixer for the TSP: theoretical considerations,implementation and experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates quantum heuristics based on Mixer Hamiltonians, which allow the search to be restricted to a specific subspace and enable warm-start strategies for solving the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Approaches involving Mixer Hamiltonians can be integrated into the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), where the Mixer acts as a mapping function that transforms qubit strings into feasible solution sets. We first introduce a swap-based mixer tailored to the TSP, which ensures that only qubit strings representing valid TSP solutions are explored during the QAOA process. Second, we propose a warm-start technique that initializes QAOA with a solution generated by any classical heuristic, thereby promoting faster convergence. These two contributions are combined into a Warm-Start QAOA framework with a Swap-Based Mixer, leveraging both structural and initialization advantages. Experimental results on a custom TSP instance involving five customers demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, providing, for the first time, a viable integration of warm-start and swap-based mixers for the TSP within a quantum optimization framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.20863v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum computing holds immense potential, yet its practical success depends on multiple factors, including advances in quantum circuit design. In this paper, we introduce a generative approach based on denoising diffusion models (DMs) to synthesize parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs). Extending the recent diffusion model pipeline of F\"urrutter et al. [1], our model effectively conditions the synthesis process, enabling the simultaneous generation of circuit architectures and their continuous gate parameters. We demonstrate our approach in synthesizing PQCs optimized for generating high-fidelity Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states and achieving high accuracy in quantum machine learning (QML) classification tasks. Our results indicate a strong generalization across varying gate sets and scaling qubit counts, highlighting the versatility and computational efficiency of diffusion-based methods. This work illustrates the potential of generative models as a powerful tool for accelerating and optimizing the design of PQCs, supporting the development of more practical and scalable quantum applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24502v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We quantify and optimize the predictability of local observables in bipartite quantum systems by employing the Bayes risk and the inference variance, two measures rooted in statistical learning theory. Specifically, we minimized these quantities when the prediction is improved by an additional quantum system, providing analytical expressions for arbitrary two-qubit states, and showcasing a connection with Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering criteria. Then, we embed our Bayes risk minimization into an entanglement-based quantum key distribution protocol, yielding asymptotically higher secure-key rates than standard BB84 under realistic noise. We applied these results to Bell states affected by local amplitude-damping noises, and spin correlation in top-antitop quark pairs from high-energy collisions.</description>

Abstract: Supervised Quantum Machine Learning (QML) represents an intersection of quantum computing and classical machine learning, aiming to use quantum resources to support model training and inference. This paper reviews recent developments in supervised QML, focusing on methods such as variational quantum circuits, quantum neural networks, and quantum kernel methods, along with hybrid quantum-classical workflows. We examine recent experimental studies that show partial indications of quantum advantage and describe current limitations including noise, barren plateaus, scalability issues, and the lack of formal proofs of performance improvement over classical methods. The main contribution is a ten-year outlook (2025-2035) that outlines possible developments in supervised QML, including a roadmap describing conditions under which QML may be used in applied research and enterprise systems over the next decade.</description>

      <title>Quick design of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.01699v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this study, we propose a new method for constrained combinatorial optimization using tensor networks. Combinatorial optimization methods employing quantum gates, such as quantum approximate optimization algorithm, have been intensively investigated. However, their limitations in errors and the number of qubits prevent them from handling large-scale combinatorial optimization problems. Alternatively, attempts have been made to solve larger-scale problems using tensor networks that can approximately simulate quantum states. In recent years, tensor networks have been applied to constrained combinatorial optimization problems for practical applications. By preparing a specific tensor network to sample states that satisfy constraints, feasible solutions can be searched for without the method of penalty functions. Previous studies have been based on profound physics, such as U(1) gauge schemes and high-dimensional lattice models. In this study, we devise to design feasible tensor networks using elementary mathematics without such a specific knowledge. One approach is to construct tensor networks with nilpotent-matrix manipulation. The second is to algebraically determine tensor parameters. For the principle verification of the proposed method, we constructed a feasible tensor network for facility location problem and conducted imaginary time evolution. We found that feasible solutions were obtained during the evolution, ultimately leading to the optimal solution. The proposed method is expected to facilitate the discovery of feasible tensor networks for constrained combinatorial optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Acceleration-induced transport of quantum vortices in joined atomtronic circuits</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23818v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Persistent currents--inviscid quantized flow around an atomic circuit--are a crucial building block of atomtronic devices. We investigate how acceleration influences the transfer of persistent currents between two density-connected, ring-shaped atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, joined by a tunable weak link that controls system topology. We find that the acceleration of this system modifies both the density and phase dynamics between the rings, leading to a bias in the periodic vortex oscillations studied in T. Bland et al., Phys. Rev. Research 4, 043171 (2022). Accounting for dissipation suppressing such vortex oscillations, the acceleration facilitates a unilateral vortex transfer to the leading ring. We analyze how this transfer depends on the weak-link amplitude, the initial persistent current configuration, and the acceleration strength and direction. Characterization of the sensitivity to these parameters paves the way for a new platform for acceleration measurements, for which we outline a proof-of-concept ultracold double-ring accelerometer.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08693v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a quantitative holographic relation between a microscopic measure of randomness and the geometric length of the wormhole in the black hole interior. To this end, we perturb an AdS black hole with Brownian semiclassical sources, implementing the continuous version of a random quantum circuit for the black hole. We use the random circuit to prepare ensembles of states of the black hole whose semiclassical duals contain Einstein-Rosen (ER) caterpillars: long cylindrical wormholes with large numbers of matter inhomogeneities, of linearly growing length with the circuit time. In this setup, we show semiclassically that the ensemble of ER caterpillars of average length $k\ell_{\Delta}$ and matter correlation scale $\ell_{\Delta}$ forms an approximate quantum state $k$-design of the black hole. At exponentially long circuit times, the ensemble of ER caterpillars becomes polynomial-copy indistinguishable from a collection of random states of the black hole. We comment on the implications of these results for holographic circuit complexity and for the holographic description of the black hole interior.</description>

      <title>Spectra of Magnetoroton and Chiral Graviton Modes of Fractional Chern Insulator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.00247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.00247v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge-neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ (bosonic) \updated{ and $1/3$ (fermionic) fractional Chern insulator (FCI)} on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor acquires a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. As the system approaches the FCI-to-CDW transition point, we observe a pronounced sharpening of the roton mode, suggesting that the magnetoroton behaves more like a quasiparticle as it softens. Notably, this occurs while the single-particle gap remains finite. Besides the magnetoroton at finite momentum, we also construct quadrupolar chiral operators in a discrete lattice and resolve the chiral graviton mode around the $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone. Furthermore, we show the different chiralities of the gravitons of FCIs with opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time.</description>

      <title>Unconventional excitonic insulators in two-dimensional topological materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.18694v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Bound electron-hole pairs in semiconductors known as excitons can form a coherent state at low temperatures akin to a BCS condensate. The resulting phase is known as the excitonic insulator and has superfluid properties. Here we theoretically study the excitonic insulator in a pair of recently proposed two-dimensional candidate materials with nontrivial band topology. Contrary to previous works, we include interaction channels that violate the individual electron and hole number conservations. These are on equal footing with the number-conserving processes due to the substantial overlap of Wannier orbitals of different bands, which cannot be exponentially localized due to the nontrivial Chern numbers of the latter. Their inclusion is crucial to determine the symmetry of the electron-hole pairing, and by performing mean-field calculations at nonzero temperatures we find that the order parameter in these systems is a chiral $d$-wave. We discuss the nontrivial topology of this unconventional state and discuss some properties of the associated Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition. In particular, we argue that here it becomes a smooth crossover and estimate the associated temperature to lie between 50 K and 75 K on realistic substrates, over an order of magnitude larger than in the number-conserving approximation where $s$-wave pairing is favored. Our results highlight the interplay between topology at the single-particle level and long-range interactions, motivating further research in systems where both phenomena coexist.</description>

      <title>Einstein's Cat -- A Thought Experiment Against Anti-Relativist Claims</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17248</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17248v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When faced with overwhelming evidence supporting the reality of time dilation, confirmed in particular by the Hafele-Keating experiment, some anti-relativists reluctantly concede that time dilation applies to light clocks. However, they argue that the Theory of Relativity remains flawed, claiming that time dilation applies to light clocks only, not to massive objects. They assert that atomic clocks, which operate based on microwave radiation, merely create the illusion that the Hafele-Keating experiment confirms the theory. To refute this misconception, we introduce a thought experiment inspired by Schrodinger's cat, in which the fate of Einstein's cat depends on a "Sync-or-Die clock", an imaginary device that tests the synchronization between a light clock and a mechanical clock, potentially triggering the release of poison. By analyzing this scenario from both the inertial frame where the device is at rest and another in which it moves at constant velocity, we demonstrate that time dilation must apply to the mechanical clock in exactly the same way as it does to the light clock, highlighting the universality of relativistic time dilation.</description>

      <title>Efficient Formal Verification of Quantum Error Correcting Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correction (QEC) is fundamental for suppressing noise in quantum hardware and enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this paper, we propose an efficient verification framework for QEC programs. We define an assertion logic and a program logic specifically crafted for QEC programs and establish a sound proof system. We then develop an efficient method for handling verification conditions (VCs) of QEC programs: for Pauli errors, the VCs are reduced to classical assertions that can be solved by SMT solvers, and for non-Pauli errors, we provide a heuristic algorithm. We formalize the proposed program logic in Coq proof assistant, making it a verified QEC verifier. Additionally, we implement an automated QEC verifier, Veri-QEC, for verifying various fault-tolerant scenarios. We demonstrate the efficiency and broad functionality of the framework by performing different verification tasks across various scenarios. Finally, we present a benchmark of 14 verified stabilizer codes.</description>

      <title>Absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00126v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code which corresponds to the $U(1)$-symmetry enriched toric code with two distinct star sublattices. One can therefore tune from the limit of isolated stars to the uniform system. The uniform system has been conjectured to possess non-Abelian topological order based on quantum Monte Carlo simulations suggesting a non-trivial ground-state degeneracy depending on the compactification of the finite clusters. Here we show that these non-trivial properties can be naturally explained in the perturbative limit of isolated stars. Indeed, the compactification dependence of the ground-state degeneracy can be traced back to geometric constraints stemming from the plaquette operators. Further, the ground-state degeneracy is fully lifted in fourth-order degenerate perturbation theory giving rise to a non-topological phase with confined fracton excitations. These fractons are confined for small perturbations so that they cannot exist as single low-energy excitation in the thermodynamic limit but only as topologically trivially composite particles. However, the confinement scale is shown to be surprisingly large so that finite-size gaps are extremely small on finite clusters up to the uniform limit which is calculated explicitly by high-order series expansions. Our findings suggest that these gaps were not distinguished from finite-size effects by the recent quantum Monte Carlo simulation in the uniform limit. All our results therefore point towards the absence of topological order in the $U(1)$ checkerboard toric code along the whole parameter axis.</description>

      <title>Resonant Tunneling in Tri-layer 2H-MoTe2 grown by Molecular Beam Epitaxy Coupled with layered WSe2 carrier Reservoir</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00971</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00971v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Here, we report a prominent quantum oscillation in the conductance of 2H-MoTe2 based resonant tunneling structure. In this work, a n-WSe2/HfO2/i-MoTe2/HfO2/Au resonant tunneling device (RTD) with a symmetric and asymmetric double barrier has been fabricated using Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE) grown 2H-MoTe2 and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) grown 2H-WSe2 along with theoretical modeling by adopting non-equilibrium Green function (NEGF) formalism. The impact of MoTe2-quantum well widths equal, and above its excitonic Bohr radius (EBR:0.7 nm) on resonant tunneling current is investigated at cryogenic temperatures. Such peak values increase with downscaling of the well width up to a certain value and then it decreases with further miniaturization. The corresponding maximum peak-to-valley current ratio (PVR) is estimated to be 4 at 4K in the low voltage range for the very first time in MoTe2 based RTD. Therefore, the present work may provide the route for fabrication of WSe2/MoTe2-based high performance resonant tunneling devices integrable with HEMT device for modern Qubit architecture operational at ultra-low temperatures.</description>
