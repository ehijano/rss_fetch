      <title>Small noise limits of Markov chains and the PageRank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05137v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We recall the classical formulation of PageRank as the stationary distribution of a singularly perturbed irreducible Markov chain that is not irreducible when the perturbation parameter goes to zero. Specifically, we use the Markov chain tree theorem to derive explicit expressions for the PageRank. This analysis leads to some surprising results. These results are then extended to a much more general class of perturbations that subsume personalized PageRank. We also give examples where even simpler formulas for PageRank are possible.</description>

      <title>Moment conditions for the asymptotic completeness of iid gap sequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study conditions under which integer sequences with independent, identically distributed gaps are asymptotically $k$-complete, meaning that every sufficiently large integer can be represented as the sum of exactly $k$ distinct elements of the sequence, or equivalently whether $k$-fold sumsets with distinct entries from such sequences generate all sufficiently large integers. Prior results established asymptotic completeness under strong conditions on the gap distribution involving the moment generating function. Leveraging renewal theory our main result shows that asymptotic $2$-completeness holds almost surely under the much weaker assumption of a finite second moment. Furthermore, using Schnirelmann densities and Mann's theorem we show weak asymptotic $k$-completeness under only a finite first moment condition, albeit with an upper bound on the first moment.</description>

      <title>Exit Time Analysis For Kesten's Stochastic Recurrence Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05219v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kesten's stochastic recurrent equation is a classical subject of research in probability theory and its applications. Recently, it has garnered attention as a model for stochastic gradient descent with a quadratic objective function and the emergence of heavy-tailed dynamics in machine learning. This context calls for analysis of its asymptotic behavior under both negative and positive Lyapunov exponents. This paper studies the exit times of the Kesten's stochastic recurrence equation in both cases. Depending on the sign of Lyapunov exponent, the exit time scales either polynomially or logarithmically as the radius of the exit boundary increases.</description>

      <title>Upper tail bounds for irregular graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we consider the upper tail large deviations of subgraph counts for irregular graphs $\mathrm{H}$ in $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$, the sparse Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi graph on $n$ vertices with edge connectivity probability $p \in (0,1)$. For $n^{-1/\Delta} \ll p \ll 1$, where $\Delta$ is the maximum degree of $\mathrm{H}$, we derive the upper tail large deviations for any irregular graph $\mathrm{H}$. On the other hand, we show that for $p$ such that $1 \ll n^{v_\mathrm{H}} p^{e_\mathrm{H}} \ll (\log n)^{\alpha^{*}_{\mathrm{H}}/\left(\alpha^{*}_{\mathrm{H}}-1\right)}$, where $v_\mathrm{H}$ and $e_\mathrm{H}$ denote the number of vertices and edges of $\mathrm{H}$, and $\alpha^*_{\mathrm{H}}$ denotes the fractional independence number, the upper tail large deviations of the number of unlabelled copies of $\mathrm{H}$ in $\mathbb{G}(n,p)$ is given by that of a sequence of Poisson random variables with diverging mean. Restricting to the $r$-armed star graph we further prove a localized behavior in the intermediate range of $p$ (left open by the above two results) and show that the mean-field approximation is asymptotically tight for the logarithm of the upper tail probability.</description>

      <title>Lonely passengers: a short proof</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05363v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A fixed number of passengers independently board one of several buses uniformly at random. The lonely passenger problem is to prove that the probability of at least one passenger being the only one in their bus is increasing in the number of buses. It was solved in a strong form by Imre P\'eter T\'oth, who proved stochastic dominance of the number of such passengers as the number of buses increases, but observed that, surprisingly, no short proof was known ``despite the efforts of several experts''. We give a very short proof of the weaker result. The proof of the strong form, using the same idea, is more involved but still relatively short.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic expansions of solutions to Markov renewal equations and their application to general branching processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the Markov renewal equation $F(t) = f(t) + \boldsymbol{\mu}*F(t)$ for vector-valued functions $f,F: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^{p}$ and a $p \times p$ matrix $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ of locally finite measures $\mu^{i,j}$ on $[0,\infty)$, $i,j=1,\ldots,p$. Sgibnev [Semimultiplicative estimates for the solution of the multidimensional renewal equation. {\em Izv.\ Ross.\ Akad.\ Nauk Ser.\ Mat.}, 66(3):159--174, 2002] derived an asymptotic expansion for the solution $F$ to the above equation. We give a new, more elementary proof of Sgibnev's result, which also covers the reducible case. As a corollary, we infer an asymptotic expansion for the mean of a multi-type general branching process with finite type space counted with random characteristic.
  Finally, some examples are discussed that illustrate phenomena of multi-type branching.</description>

      <title>The largest subcritical component in inhomogeneous random graphs of preferential attachment type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05469</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05469v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We identify the size of the largest connected component in a subcritical inhomogeneous random graph with a kernel of preferential attachment type. The component grows polynomially in the network size with an explicitly given exponent, which is strictly larger than the growth exponent of the largest degree in the network. This is in stark contrast to the behaviour of inhomogeneous random graphs with a kernel of rank one.</description>

      <title>Explosion of Crump-Mode-Jagers processes with critical immediate offspring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the phenomenon of explosion in general (Crump-Mode-Jagers) branching processes, which refers to the event where an infinite number of individuals are born in finite time. In a critical setting where the expected number of immediate offspring per individual is exactly 1, whether or not explosion occurs depends on the fine properties of the reproduction point process. We provide two sufficient criteria for explosion in these CMJ processes. The first criterion uses a coupling with Galton-Watson processes in varying environments, while the second relies on a comparison with Bellman-Harris branching processes. Our main result is an equivalent characterization of explosion, expressed as an integral test, in the case where the reproduction point process is Poissonian. For the derivation, we also study the fixed-point equation associated with a smoothing transformation, which describes the distribution of the explosion time. Specifically, we show that this distribution is the unique solution to the fixed-point equation, modulo an additive shift.</description>

      <title>Sharp $L \log L$ condition for supercritical Galton-Watson processes with countable types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate Kesten-Stigum-like results for multi-type Galton-Watson processes with a countable number of types in a general setting, allowing us in particular to consider processes with an infinite total population at each generation. Specifically, a sharp $L\log L$ condition is found under the only assumption that the mean reproduction matrix is positive recurrent in the sense of Vere-Jones (1967). The type distribution is shown to always converge in probability in the recurrent case, and under conditions covering many cases it is shown to converge almost surely.</description>

      <title>Biasing with an independent increment: Gaussian approximations and proximity of Poisson mixtures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05586v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish three sets of approximation results: (a) bounds on the proximity of Poisson mixtures with infinitely divisible mixing distributions, (b) central limit theorems with explicit error bounds for sums of associated or negatively associated random variables which do not require boundedness of the underlying distributions, and (c) a Gaussian approximation theorem under a vanishing third moment condition. Each of these make use of the observation that size-biasing or zero-biasing an infinitely divisible random variable may be achieved by adding an independent increment, combined with tools from Stein's method for compound Poisson and Gaussian approximations. Applications include a Dickman-type limit theorem and simple random sampling.</description>

      <title>Filtering of partially observed polynomial processes in discrete and continuous time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper is devoted to filtering, smoothing, and prediction of polynomial processes that are partially observed. These problems are known to allow for an explicit solution in the simpler case of linear Gaussian state space models. The key insight underlying the present piece of research is that in filtering applications polynomial processes and their discrete counterpart are indistinguishable from Gaussian processes sharing their first two moments. We describe the construction of these Gaussian equivalents of polynomial processes and explicitly compute optimal linear filters, predictors and smoothers for polynomial processes in discrete and continuous time. The consideration of Gaussian equivalents also opens the door to parameter estimation and linear-quadratic optimal control in the context of polynomial processes.</description>

      <title>A characterization of sample adaptivity in UCB data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04855</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.04855v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We characterize a joint CLT of the number of pulls and the sample mean reward of the arms in a stochastic two-armed bandit environment under UCB algorithms. Several implications of this result are in place: (1) a nonstandard CLT of the number of pulls hence pseudo-regret that smoothly interpolates between a standard form in the large arm gap regime and a slow-concentration form in the small arm gap regime, and (2) a heuristic derivation of the sample bias up to its leading order from the correlation between the number of pulls and sample means. Our analysis framework is based on a novel perturbation analysis, which is of broader interest on its own.</description>

Abstract: In this work, we propose and analyze a new local time-decoupled squared Wasserstein-2 method for reconstructing the distribution of unknown parameters in dynamical systems. Specifically, we show that a stochastic neural network model, which can be effectively trained by minimizing our proposed local time-decoupled squared Wasserstein-2 loss function, is an effective model for approximating the distribution of uncertain model parameters in dynamical systems. Through several numerical examples, we showcase the effectiveness of our proposed method in reconstructing the distribution of parameters in different dynamical systems.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we will show that under certain conditions, associated to any fixed distortion function $g$, the distortion risk measure of a sum of two counter-monotonic risks can be expressed as the sum of two related distortion risk measures of the marginals involved, one associated to the original distortion function $g$ and the other associated to the dual distortion function of $g$. This result extends some of the work in \cite{Chaoubi et al. (2020)} and \cite{HLD} since the class of distortion risk measures includes the risk measure of VaR and TVaR as special cases.</description>

      <title>Graph Alignment via Birkhoff Relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05323</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05323v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the graph alignment problem, wherein the objective is to find a vertex correspondence between two graphs that maximizes the edge overlap. The graph alignment problem is an instance of the quadratic assignment problem (QAP), known to be NP-hard in the worst case even to approximately solve. In this paper, we analyze Birkhoff relaxation, a tight convex relaxation of QAP, and present theoretical guarantees on its performance when the inputs follow the Gaussian Wigner Model. More specifically, the weighted adjacency matrices are correlated Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble with correlation $1/\sqrt{1+\sigma^2}$. Denote the optimal solutions of the QAP and Birkhoff relaxation by $\Pi^\star$ and $X^\star$ respectively. We show that $\|X^\star-\Pi^\star\|_F^2 = o(n)$ when $\sigma = o(n^{-1.25})$ and $\|X^\star-\Pi^\star\|_F^2 = \Omega(n)$ when $\sigma = \Omega(n^{-0.5})$. Thus, the optimal solution $X^\star$ transitions from a small perturbation of $\Pi^\star$ for small $\sigma$ to being well separated from $\Pi^\star$ as $\sigma$ becomes larger than $n^{-0.5}$. This result allows us to guarantee that simple rounding procedures on $X^\star$ align $1-o(1)$ fraction of vertices correctly whenever $\sigma = o(n^{-1.25})$. This condition on $\sigma$ to ensure the success of the Birkhoff relaxation is state-of-the-art.</description>

      <title>Multi-asset optimal trade execution with stochastic cross-effects: An Obizhaeva-Wang-type framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze a continuous-time optimal trade execution problem in multiple assets where the price impact and the resilience can be matrix-valued stochastic processes that incorporate cross-impact effects. In addition, we allow for stochastic terminal and running targets. Initially, we formulate the optimal trade execution task as a stochastic control problem with a finite-variation control process that acts as an integrator both in the state dynamics and in the cost functional. We then extend this problem continuously to a stochastic control problem with progressively measurable controls. By identifying this extended problem as equivalent to a certain linear-quadratic stochastic control problem, we can use established results in linear-quadratic stochastic control to solve the extended problem. This work generalizes [Ackermann, Kruse, Urusov; FinancStoch'24] from the single-asset setting to the multi-asset case. In particular, we reveal cross-hedging effects, showing that it can be optimal to trade in an asset despite having no initial position. Moreover, as a subsetting we discuss a multi-asset variant of the model in [Obizhaeva, Wang; JFinancMark'13].</description>

  For $\{X_j\}$ i.i.d.\ random variables taking values in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and $K$ a kernel with suitable integrability we define random graph Laplacians \begin{equation*} D_{\epsilon,n}f(p)=\frac{1}{n\epsilon^{d+2}}\sum_{j=1}^nK\left(\frac{p-X_j}{\epsilon}\right)(f(X_j)-f(p)) \end{equation*} and study their convergence as $\epsilon=\epsilon_n\to0$ and $n\to\infty$ to a second order elliptic operator of the form \begin{align*} \Delta_K f(p) &amp;= \sum_{i,j=1}^d\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_i}(p)\frac{\partial g}{\partial x_j}(p)\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}K(-t)t_it_jd\lambda(t)\\ &amp;\quad +\frac{g(p)}{2}\sum_{i,j=1}^d\frac{\partial^2f}{\partial x_i\partial x_j}(p)\int_{\mathbb{R}^d}K(-t)t_it_jd\lambda(t). \end{align*}
  Our results provide conditions that guarantee that $D_{\epsilon_n,n}f(p)-\Delta_Kf(p)$ converges to zero in probability as $n\to\infty$ and can be rescaled by $\sqrt{n\epsilon_n^{d+2}}$ to satisfy a central limit theorem. They generalize the work of Gin\'e--Koltchinskii~\cite{gine2006empirical} and Belkin--Niyogi~\cite{belkin2008towards} to allow manifolds with boundary and a wider choice of kernels $K$, and to prove convergence under weaker smoothness assumptions and a correspondingly more precise choice of conditions on the asymptotics of $\epsilon_n$ as $n\to\infty$.</description>

      <title>Epstein curves and holography of the Schwarzian action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by the duality between Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity and Schwarzian field theory, we show identities between the Schwarzian action of a circle diffeomorphism with (1) the hyperbolic area enclosed by the Epstein curve in the hyperbolic disk $\mathbb{D}$, (2) the asymptotic excess in the isoperimetric inequality for the equidistant Epstein foliation, (3) the variation of the Loewner energy along its equipotential foliation, and (4) the asymptotic change in hyperbolic area under a conformal distortion near the circle. From these geometric interpretations, we obtain two new proofs of the non-negativity of the Schwarzian action for circle diffeomorphisms, one from the isoperimetric inequality and the other from the monotonicity of the Loewner energy. Moreover, we show that the horocycle truncation used in Epstein's construction of the Epstein curve also defines a renormalized length of hyperbolic geodesics in $\mathbb{D}$, which coincides with the log of the bi-local observable. From this, we show that the bi-local observables on the edges of any ideal triangulation of $\mathbb{D}$ determine the circle diffeomorphism.</description>

      <title>Discretization of the Ergodic Functional Central Limit Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.05710</link>
      <description>arXiv:1801.05710v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the discretization of the ergodic Functional Central Limit Theorem (CLT) established by Bhattacharya (see \cite{Bhattacharya_1982}) which states the following: Given a stationary and ergodic Markov process $(X_t)_{t \geqslant 0}$ with unique invariant measure $\nu$ and infinitesimal generator $A$, then, for every smooth enough function $f$, $(n^{1/2} \frac{1}{n}\int_0^{nt} Af(X_s)ds)_{t \geqslant 0}$ converges in distribution towards the distribution of the process $(\sqrt{-2 \langle f, Af \rangle_{\nu}} W_{t})_{t \geqslant 0}$ with $(W_{t})_{t \geqslant 0}$ a Wiener process. In particular, we consider the marginal distribution at fixed $t=1$, and we show that when $\int_0^{n} Af(X_s)ds$ is replaced by a well chosen discretization of the time integral with order $q$ ($e.g.$ Riemann discretization in the case $q=1$), then the CLT still holds but with rate $n^{q/(2q+1)}$ instead of $n^{1/2}$. Moreover, our results remain valid when $(X_t)_{t \geqslant 0}$ is replaced by a $q$-weak order approximation (not necessarily stationary). This paper presents both the discretization method of order $q$ for the time integral and the $q$-order ergodic CLT we derive from them. We finally propose applications concerning the first order CLT for the approximation of Markov Brownian diffusion stationary regimes with Euler scheme (where we recover existing results from the literature) and the second order CLT for the approximation of Brownian diffusion stationary regimes using Talay's scheme \cite{Talay_1990} of weak order two.</description>

      <title>Some properties of the principal Dirichlet eigenfunction via simple random walk and Brownian motion couplings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we study a discrete and continuous version of the spectral Dirichlet problem in an open bounded connected set $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^d$, in dimension $d\geq 2$. More precisely, we consider the simple random walk on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ killed upon exiting the (large) bounded domain $\Omega_N = (N\Omega)\cap \mathbb{Z}^d$. We denote by $P_N$ the corresponding transition matrix and we study the properties of its ($L^2$-normalized) principal eigenvector $\phi_N$. With probabilistic arguments (namely gambler's ruin estimates and coupling techniques) and under mild assumptions on the domain, we are able to give regularity estimates on $\phi_N$ (namely on its $k$-th order differences), with a uniform control inside $\Omega_N$. The same holds true for the first eigenfunction $\varphi_1$ of the corresponding continuous spectral Dirichlet problem, this being related to a Brownian motion killed upon exiting $\Omega$. As corollaries, we derive the $L^2$ and uniform convergence of $\phi_N$ to $\varphi_1$ in Lipschitz bounded domains.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Modified Flows for Riemannian Stochastic Gradient Descent</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.03467v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give quantitative estimates for the rate of convergence of Riemannian stochastic gradient descent (RSGD) to Riemannian gradient flow and to a diffusion process, the so-called Riemannian stochastic modified flow (RSMF). Using tools from stochastic differential geometry we show that, in the small learning rate regime, RSGD can be approximated by the solution to the RSMF driven by an infinite-dimensional Wiener process. The RSMF accounts for the random fluctuations of RSGD and, thereby, increases the order of approximation compared to the deterministic Riemannian gradient flow. The RSGD is build using the concept of a retraction map, that is, a cost efficient approximation of the exponential map, and we prove quantitative bounds for the weak error of the diffusion approximation under assumptions on the retraction map, the geometry of the manifold, and the random estimators of the gradient.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17236v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear Dirichlet problem on a bounded domain whose Hamiltonian is given by a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman operator with merely continuous and bounded coefficients. The objective of this paper is to study the existence of viscosity solutions from a stochastic point of view. Using a relaxed control framework, we define a candidate for a viscosity solution. We prove that this stochastic solution satisfies viscosity sub- and supersolution properties and that its upper and lower envelopes are viscosity sub- and supersolutions, respectively. Moreover, we establish a strong Markov selection principle, which shows that the stochastic solution can be realized through a strong Markov family. Building on the selection principle, we investigate regularity properties of the stochastic solution. For certain elliptic cases, we show that the strong Markov selection is a strong Feller selection, which propagates continuity to the stochastic solution. By means of an example, we also discuss the necessity of certain ellipticity assumptions for the continuity of the stochastic solution.</description>

      <title>Partial yet definite emergence of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang class in isotropic spin chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07150v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrable spin chains with a continuous non-Abelian symmetry, such as the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, show superdiffusive transport with little theoretical understanding. Although recent studies reported a surprising connection to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class in that case, this view was most recently questioned by discrepancies in full counting statistics. Here, by combining extensive numerical simulations of classical and quantum integrable isotropic spin chains with a framework developed by exact studies of the KPZ class, we characterize various two-point quantities that remain hitherto unexplored in spin chains, and find full agreement with KPZ scaling laws without adjustable parameters. This establishes the partial emergence of the KPZ class in integrable isotropic spin chains. Moreover, we reveal that the KPZ scaling laws are intact in the presence of an energy current, under the appropriate Galilean boost required by the propagation of spacetime correlation.</description>

      <title>Coarse Set Theory for AI Ethics and Decision-Making: A Mathematical Framework for Granular Evaluations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07347</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07347v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In artificial intelligence (AI) and decision-making systems, structured approximations play a crucial role in balancing model interpretability and predictive accuracy. Coarse Set Theory (CST) introduces a mathematical framework to formalize Coarse Ethics (CE), which models coarse-grained decision-making processes commonly used in human evaluations and AI classification systems. CST defines hierarchical relationships among sets using totally ordered structures and coarse mappings, enabling us to adjust decision granularity dynamically. Furthermore, coarse evaluations inherently involve a trade-off between efficiency and information retention, as they simplify complex data representations at the cost of precision. To quantitatively assess this trade-off, we introduce Kullback-Leibler (KL) Divergence as a measure of information loss in coarse evaluations, demonstrating the impact of coarse partitioning on decision accuracy. This study employs CST in grading systems, automated recommendations, and risk assessments, demonstrating its potential to enhance fairness, reduce bias, and improve transparency in AI-driven decision-making.</description>

      <title>Filtered Markovian Projection: Dimensionality Reduction in Filtering for Stochastic Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07918</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07918v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stochastic reaction networks (SRNs) model stochastic effects for various applications, including intracellular chemical or biological processes and epidemiology. A typical challenge in practical problems modeled by SRNs is that only a few state variables can be dynamically observed. Given the measurement trajectories, one can estimate the conditional probability distribution of unobserved (hidden) state variables by solving a stochastic filtering problem. In this setting, the conditional distribution evolves over time according to an extensive or potentially infinite-dimensional system of coupled ordinary differential equations with jumps, known as the filtering equation. The current numerical filtering techniques, such as the Filtered Finite State Projection (D'Ambrosio et al., 2022), are hindered by the curse of dimensionality, significantly affecting their computational performance. To address these limitations, we propose to use a dimensionality reduction technique based on the Markovian projection (MP), initially introduced for forward problems (Ben Hammouda et al., 2024). In this work, we explore how to adapt the existing MP approach to the filtering problem and introduce a novel version of the MP, the Filtered MP, that guarantees the consistency of the resulting estimator. The novel method employs a reduced-variance particle filter for estimating the jump intensities of the projected model and solves the filtering equations in a low-dimensional space. The analysis and empirical results highlight the superior computational efficiency of projection methods compared to the existing filtered finite state projection in the large dimensional setting.</description>

      <title>Fractional Sobolev paths on Wasserstein spaces and their energy-minimizing particle representations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12068v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a generalization of Kantorovich's optimal transportation problem. Given a prescribed family of time-dependent probability measures $(\mu_t)$, we aim to find, among all path-continuous stochastic processes whose one-dimensional time marginals coincide with $(\mu_t)$ (if there is any), a process that minimizes a given energy. After discussing a sufficient condition for the energy to ensure the existence of a minimizer, we investigate fractional Sobolev energies. Given a deterministic path $(\mu_t)$ on a $p$-Wasserstein space with fractional Sobolev regularity $W^{\alpha,p}$, where $1/p &lt; \alpha &lt; 1$, we provide conditions under which we prove the existence of a process that minimizes the energy and construct a process that realizes the regularity of $(\mu_t)$. While continuous paths of low regularity on Wasserstein spaces naturally appear in stochastic analysis, they can also arise deterministically as solutions to the continuity equation. This paper is devoted to the deterministic setting to gain some understanding of the required conditions.</description>
