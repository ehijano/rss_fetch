      <title>A fast and robust recipe for modeling non-ideal MHD effects in star-formation simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06933</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06933v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-ideal MHD effects are thought to be a crucial component of the star-formation process. Numerically, several complications render the study of non-ideal MHD effects in 3D simulations extremely challenging and hinder our efforts of exploring a large parameter space. We aim to overcome such challenges by proposing a novel, physically-motivated empirical approximation to model non-ideal MHD effects. We perform a number of 2D axisymmetric 3-fluid non-ideal MHD simulations of collapsing prestellar cores and clouds with non-equilibrium chemistry and leverage upon previously-published results. We utilize these simulations to develop a multivariate interpolating function to predict the ionization fraction in each region of the cloud depending on the local physical conditions. We subsequently use analytically-derived, simplified expressions to calculate the resistivities of the cloud in each grid cell. Therefore, in our new approach the resistivities are calculated without the use of a chemical network. We benchmark our method against additional 2D axisymmetric non-ideal MHD simulations with random initial conditions and a 3D non-ideal MHD simulation with non-equilibrium chemistry. We find excellent quantitative and qualitative agreement between our approach and the "full" non-ideal MHD simulations both in terms of the spatial structure of the simulated clouds and regarding their time evolution. We achieve a factor of 100-1000 increase in computational speed. Given that we ignore the contribution of grains, our approximation is valid up to number densities of 10^6 cm^(-3) and is therefore suitable for pc-scale simulations of molecular clouds. The tabulated data required for integrating our method in hydrodynamical codes, along with a fortran implementation of the interpolating function are publicly available at https://github.com/manosagian/Non-Ideal-MHD-Approximate-Code.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Cool Gas Clouds in M82's Starburst-Driven Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06934v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Star formation feedback can drive large-scale, multi-phase galactic outflows. The dynamical and thermodynamical interaction between the hot and cooler phases is a prime focus of both observational and theoretical work. Here, we analyze H$\alpha$-emitting structures in the extraplanar wind of the nearby starburst M82. We use high-resolution, narrow-band, observations from the Hubble Legacy Archive (Mutchler et al. 2007). Our analysis constrains the morphology, number density, and column density of the structures. We highlight conspicuous arc-like structures that differ significantly from the linear cometary clouds that emerge from galactic wind simulations and discuss their possible origins, such as bow shocks or instabilities driven by cosmic rays. The most prominent structures range in size from $\sim24 -110$ pc. Using the H$\alpha$ brightness and assumptions about the depth of the emitting structures, we estimate number densities of $\sim1-23$ cm$^{-3}$, which are lower than previous constraints from spectroscopic nebular line studies. The derived column densities, $\sim10^{20}-10^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$, along the path of the outflow are above theoretical thresholds for cool cloud survival in a hot supersonic background, but small enough that the structures could be accelerated by the hot wind momentum. Using diffuse X-ray emission maps from $\textit{Chandra}$, we also find that even on small ($\sim100$ pc) scales, the H$\alpha$ "leads" the X-rays, a behavior long noted in the literature on kiloparsec scales, and one we observe in the brightness profiles of the structures we analyze. This behavior, along with previous observational studies of ionization in the wind, may signal that shock ionization is responsible for the H$\alpha$ emission we observe.</description>

      <title>A comparison of abundance analyses of first generation stars in multiple populations in 47 Tuc and NGC 3201</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The distinction of the stellar content in globular clusters (GCs) in multiple stellar populations characterized by different amounts of proton-capture elements has been well assessed since a long time. On the other hand, the existence of noticeable variations in metallicity among GC stars is still debated. In particular, recent spectroscopic analyses claimed the presence of a small variation in metallicity, ~0.1 dex, for the first generation (FG) stars in NGC 3201 and NGC 104. However, in both cases the claim is not robust because of the internal error of 0.1 dex associated to the [Fe/H] values. To verify the reality of a metallicity variation we compared the two analyses, performed by the same authors with identical methodology. We found trends of metallicity as a function of the spectroscopically derived effective temperatures. However they are in opposite directions; in NGC 3201 cooler (and brighter) stars have higher [Fe/H] values, whereas in 47 Tuc they show lower metallicities. The trend is not statistically significant in the former case, but it is in the latter. The dependence of metallicity on the luminosity along the red giant branch seems to indicate problems in the abundance analysis for 47 Tuc. Finally, effective temperature do not show a significant variation as a function of the color spread along the HST pseudo-colour map, which we should instead observe were the trends temperature-metallicity a real effects of intrinsic scatter in iron. According to this comparison, we conclude that with these analyses, and the associated spurious trends, the issue of metallicity variations in FG stars is hardly settled.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the star formation rate-halo accretion rate connection and halo quenching mechanism via DECODE, the Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aims: The relative roles of the physical mechanisms involved in quenching galaxy star formation are still unclear. We tackle this fundamental problem with our cosmological semi-empirical model DECODE (Discrete statistical sEmi-empiriCal mODEl), designed to predict galaxy stellar mass assembly histories, from minimal input assumptions.
  Methods: Specifically, in this work the star formation history of each galaxy is calculated along its progenitor dark matter halo by assigning at each redshift a star formation rate extracted from a monotonic star formation rate-halo accretion rate (SFR-HAR) relation derived from abundance matching between the (observed) SFR function and the (numerically predicted) HAR function, a relation that is also predicted by the TNG100 simulation. SFRs are integrated across cosmic time to build up the mass of galaxies, which may halt their star formation following input physical quenching recipes.
  Results: In this work we test the popular halo quenching scenario and we find that: 1) the assumption of a monotonic relation between SFR and HAR allows to reproduce the number densities of the bulk of star-forming galaxies in the local Universe; 2) the halo quenching is sufficient to reproduce the statistics of the quenched galaxies and flat (steep) high-mass end of the SMHM relation (SMF); and 3) to align with the observed steep (flat) low-mass end of the SMHM (SMF) additional quenching processes in the least massive haloes are needed.
  Conclusions: DECODE is an invaluable tool and will pave the way to investigate the origin of newly observed high-redshift objects from the latest ongoing facilities such as JWST and Euclid.</description>

      <title>The satellite galaxies of the Milky Way and Andromeda</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The satellite galaxies of the Local Group provide us with an important probe of galaxy formation, evolution, and cosmology. The two large spirals that dominate this group -- the Milky Way and Andromeda -- are each host to tens of satellites, ranging in stellar mass from $M_*=3\times10^9\,{\rm M_\odot}$ down to as little as $M_*\sim1000\,{\rm M_\odot}$. In this review, we (1) provide an overview of the known satellite population of the Milky Way and Andromeda, including how they are discovered and their observed properties; (2) discuss their importance in understanding the nature of dark matter, star formation in the early Universe, the assembly histories of their massive hosts, and the impact of reionisation on the lowest mass galaxies; and (3) highlight the coming revolution and challenges of this field as new observatories and facilities come online. In the coming decades, the study of Local Group satellites should allow us to place competitive constraints on both dark matter and galaxy evolution.</description>

      <title>On the long-term evolution of razor-thin galactic discs: Balescu-Lenard prediction and perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the last five decades, numerical simulations have provided invaluable insights into the evolution of galactic discs over cosmic times. As a complementary approach, developments in kinetic theory now also offer a theoretical framework to understand statistically their long-term evolution. The current state-of-the-art kinetic theory of isolated stellar systems is the inhomogeneous Balescu-Lenard equation. It can describe the long-term evolution of a self-gravitating razor-thin disc under the effect of resonant interactions between collectively amplified noise-driven fluctuations. In this work, confronting theoretical predictions to numerical simulations, we quantitatively show that kinetic theory indeed captures the average long-term evolution of cold stellar discs. Leveraging the versatility of kinetic methods, we then offer some new perspectives on this problem, namely (i) the crucial impact of collective effects in accelerating the relaxation; (ii) the role of (weakly) damped modes in shaping the disc's orbital heating; (iii) the bias introduced by gravitational softening on long timescales; (iv) the resurgence of strong stochasticity near marginal stability. These elements call for an appropriate choice of softening kernel when simulating the long-term evolution of razor thin discs and for an extension of kinetic theory beyond the average evolution. Notwithstanding, kinetic theory captures quantitatively the ensemble-averaged long-term response of such discs.</description>

      <title>The Extraordinary Maser Flaring Event in the Massive Protostellar System NGC6334I: Multi-epoch milliarcsecond resolution investigation of the 6.7-GHz Methanol Masers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wereportthefirstmulti-epochmilliarcsecondresolutionimagingofthe6.7-GHzclassIImethanolmaseremissionassociated with the high-mass protocluster system NGC6334I. The observations cover 4 epochs over a 10-year period between March 2010 and March 2020. We confirm the emergence of a number of new regions of 6.7-GHz methanol maser emission in the molecular gas surrounding NGC6334-MM1, which lies north of the previously known class II methanol maser sites which are associated with NGC6334-MM3 and -MM2. The new maser emission is located close to the strongest (sub)millimetre source in the NGC6334I cluster MM1B which experienced a sudden increase in intensity in 2015, produced by an episodic accretion event. We are able to compare the location and intensity of the 6.7-GHz methanol maser emission before, during, and after the flare, providing new insights into the relationship between maser flares and periodic accretion events in high-mass stars.</description>

      <title>The Expanding 3-Kiloparsec Arms are neither Expanding nor Spiral Arms, but X1 Orbits driven by the Galactic Bar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Near the center of our Milky Way is a bar-like structure and the so-called Expanding 3-kpc arms. We currently have limited knowledge of this important region, since we are about 8.2 kpc from the center and cannot directly observe it at optical wavelengths, owing to strong extinction from interstellar dust. Here we present extremely precise VLBI measurements of water maser sources from the BeSSeL Survey, where extinction is not a problem, which accurately determine the 3-dimensional locations and motions of three massive young stars. Combined with previous measurements, these stars delineate a trail of orbits outlining the Milky Way's Galactic Bar. We present the first measurements capturing the dynamics of quasi-elliptical (X1) orbits around the Galactic Bar. Our findings provide evidence substantiating the existence of such orbits populated by massive young stars. Our measurements of the position and velocity of a number of massive young stars, previously identified with the Expanding 3-kpc arms, show that they are more likely located in the X1 orbits about the Galactic Bar. Also, some stars previously assigned to the Norma spiral arm appear to be in these orbits, which suggests that this spiral arm does not extend past the end of the bar.</description>

      <title>Spatial and Chemical Complexity in the W75N Star-Forming Region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the analysis of NOEMA interferometric observations of the high-mass star-forming region W75N(B) with a focus on molecular composition and distribution of prebiotic molecules in the source's multiple cores. Over twenty molecules are identified across the region, with many being fit for column density, rotational temperature, spectral line full width half maximum, and v$_{lsr}$. This work includes the first known detection and initial analysis of complex organic molecules in the MM2 and MM3 regions. Furthermore, parameter maps were created from the six molecules that were well fit across multiple regions. The molecular emission was imaged and correlated across different molecules and the continuum to reveal structural features. From the spatial and spectral analysis of the MM1 region, these results concur with those from other studies showing that there is a difference in chemical composition between the MM1a and MM1b regions, with sulfur-bearing molecules tracing MM1a and organic molecules tracing MM1b. The molecular emission imaged toward the MM3 region reveals two peaks, possibly indicating the presence of multiple young stellar objects. These results provide detailed quantitative information about the physical parameters and distributions of molecules in this source. Additionally, these results are part of a follow-up of a single-dish survey of multiple star-forming regions and are discussed in this context.</description>

      <title>Exploring the mysterious high-ionization source powering [Ne V] in high-z analog SBS0335-052 E with JWST/MIRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nearby blue compact dwarf galaxies (BCDs) share similar properties with objects from the Epoch of Reionization revealed by JWST, in terms of low stellar mass, low metallicity and high specific star-formation rate. Thus, they represent ideal local laboratories for detailed multi-wavelength studies to understand their properties and the mechanisms shaping them. We report the first JWST MIRI/MRS observations of the BCD SBS 0335-052 E, analyzing MIR emission lines tracing different levels of ionization (e.g., [NeII], [SIV], [NeIII], [OIV], [NeV]) of the ionized gas. SBS 0335-052 E MIR emission is characterized by a bright point source, located in one of the youngest and most embedded stellar clusters ($t\sim3$ Myr, $A_V\sim20$), and underlying extended high-ionization emission (i.e., [OIV], [NeV]) from the surroundings of the older and less dusty stellar clusters ($t&lt; 20 $ Myr, $A_V\sim8$). From the comparison with state-of-the-art models, we can exclude shocks, X-ray binaries, and old stellar populations as the main sources of the high ionization. Interestingly, a 4-16% contribution of a $\sim10^5$ M$_\odot$ intermediate massive black hole (IMBH) is needed to justify the strong [NeV]/[NeII] and would be consistent with optical/UV line ratios from previous studies. However, even IMBH models cannot explain the strongest [OIV]/[NeIII]. Also, star-forming models (regardless of including X-ray binaries) struggle to reproduce even the lower ionization line ratios (e.g., [SIV]/[NeII]) typically observed in BCDs. Overall, while current models suggest the need to account for an accreting IMBH in this high-$z$ analog, limitations still exist in predicting high-ionization emission lines (I.P. $&gt;54$ eV) when modeling these low-metallicity environments, thus other sources of ionization cannot be fully ruled out.</description>

      <title>Statistical selection of high-redshift, neutral-hydrogen-rich, lensed galaxies with the Square Kilometre Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Deep wide spectral line surveys with the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will expand the cosmic frontiers of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) in galaxies. However, at cosmologically significant redshifts ($z \gtrsim 0.5$), detections will typically be spatially unresolved and limited to the highest mass systems. Gravitational lensing could potentially alleviate these limitations, enabling lower mass systems to be studied at higher redshift and spatially resolved dynamical studies of some HI discs. Additionally, lensed HI systems would select foreground dark matter haloes using a different, more extended baryonic tracer compared to other lens surveys. This may result in a wider selected range of foreground dark matter halo properties, such as the concentration parameter. This paper uses the distortion of the observed HI mass function (HIMF) produced by strong gravitational lensing to find a flux density criterion for selecting lensed HI sources in future SKA-Mid spectral line surveys. This selection approach could yield lensed HI source densities in the range of $\sim 0.1$--$10$ galaxies per square degree out to a redshift of $z \simeq 3$ covered by SKA-MID Band 1. Although the sample sizes are modest, even with the proposed SKA-Mid surveys, the selection approach is straightforward and should have a 50% efficiency without any additional information, such as low-impact-factor or lower-redshift massive galaxies. The efficiency of selecting high-redshift, neutral-hydrogen-rich, lensed galaxies should then be greatly enhanced by using SKA-MID data in concert with the Vera C. Rubin Large Survey of Space and Time.</description>

      <title>In Search of the First Stars: An Ultra-Compact and Very Low Metallicity Lyman-$\alpha$ Emitter Deep Within the Epoch of Reionization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present {\it JWST} observations of a gravitationally-lensed, extremely metal-poor galaxy at redshift $z=8.203\pm 0.001$ from the CANUCS survey. Based on the low oxygen to Balmer line ratios we infer a gas-phase metallicity of $12+{\rm log(O/H)}=6.85$ (1.4\% solar), making CANUCS-A370-z8-LAE the most metal-poor galaxy known at $z&gt;7$. With a high H$\beta$ equivalent width of $225\pm50$\,\AA\ and a half-light radius of only $r_{\rm hl} = 38 ^{+3}_{-19} $\,pc, the galaxy has a high star-formation-rate density of $50 - 100\,M_{\odot}$\,yr$^{-1}$\,kpc$^{-2}$. The galaxy shows high equivalent width Lyman-$\alpha$ emission with an inferred Lyman-$\alpha$ escape fraction of $0.21 \pm 0.05$. The high escape fraction of Lyman-$\alpha$ is likely due to the compact starbursting nature of the galaxy combined with its location in an overdensity traced by at least two other galaxies spectroscopically confirmed to lie within $\delta z = 0.01$ that have helped to reionize the environment. The low metallicity of CANUCS-A370-z8-LAE is best explained by a model where infalling metal-poor gas dilutes the interstellar medium, rather than being a young galaxy forming its first stellar populations.</description>

      <title>Detectability of dark matter subhalo impacts in Milky Way stellar streams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stellar streams are a promising way to probe the gravitational effects of low-mass dark matter (DM) subhalos. In recent years, there has been a remarkable explosion in the number of stellar streams detected in the Milky Way, and hundreds more may be discovered with future surveys such as LSST. Studies of DM subhalo impacts on streams have so far focused on a few of the thinnest and brightest streams, and it is not known how much information can be gained from the others. In this work, we develop a method to quickly estimate the minimum detectable DM subhalo mass of a given stream, where subhalo mass here refers to the total mass of a Plummer sphere. Our work is based on an analytic model for subhalo impacts on circular streams, which allows us to model streams with a wide range of properties including width, length, distance, and stellar density. We consider several observational scenarios, based on current and future surveys including Gaia, DESI, Via, and LSST. We find that at 95% confidence level, a stream like GD-1 has a minimum detectable subhalo mass of $\sim 6\times 10^6~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ in Gaia data and $\sim 8\times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ with LSST 10 year sensitivity. Applying our results to confirmed Milky Way streams, we rank order them by their sensitivity to DM subhalos and identify promising ones for further study.</description>

      <title>The Gaia parallax discrepancy for the cluster Pismis 19, and separating $\delta$ Scutis from Cepheids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pre-Gaia distances for the open cluster Pismis 19 disagree with Gaia parallaxes. A 2MASS $JK_s$ red clump distance was therefore established for Pismis 19 ($2.90\pm0.15$ kpc), which reaffirms that zero-point corrections for Gaia are required (e.g., Lindegren et al.~2021). OGLE GD-CEP-1864 is confirmed as a member of Pismis 19 on the basis of DR3 proper motions, and its 2MASS+VVV color-magnitude position near the tip of the turnoff. That $0^{\rm d}.3$ variable star is likely a $\delta$ Scuti rather than a classical Cepheid. The case revealed a pertinent criterion to segregate those two populations in tandem with the break in the Wesenheit Leavitt Law ($\simeq 0^{\rm d}.5$). Just shortward of that period discontinuity are $\delta$ Scutis, whereas beyond the break lie first overtone classical Cepheids mostly observed beyond the first crossing of the instability strip.</description>

      <title>A decade of sub-arcsecond imaging with the International LOFAR Telescope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The International LOFAR Telescope (ILT) is a pan-European radio interferometer with baselines up to 2,000 km. This provides sub-arcsecond resolution at frequencies of &lt;200 MHz. Since starting science operations in 2012, the ILT has carried out observations for the state-of-the-art LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey, which has 6 arcsec resolution at 144 MHz. Wide-area surveys at low frequencies, while scientifically productive, have to compromise on resolution. Sub-arcsecond imaging with the ILT has become more accessible over the last decade, thanks to efforts to build a publicly available pipeline using LOFAR-specific tools, which has resulted in a dramatic increase in the number of publications. The ILT's combination of resolution, field of view, and low observing frequency make it a unique instrument for a wide range of scientific applications, and it will remain unparalleled even in the era of the Square Kilometre Array Observatory. Here we provide an overview of the technical considerations and calibration methods sub-arcsecond imaging with the ILT. This is followed by a review of the unique capabilities unlocked by sub-arcsecond imaging with the ILT, using examples from the literature for demonstration. Finally we describe ongoing work including: surveying large areas of the sky at high resolution, going deeper in fields with excellent ancillary information, producing images of polarisation, and extending to lower frequencies (&lt;100 MHz).</description>

      <title>Hydrodynamic methods and sub-resolution models for cosmological simulations</title>

Abstract: Cosmological simulations are powerful tools in the context of structure formation. They allow us to explore the assembly and clustering of dark matter halos, to validate or reject possible scenarios of structure formation, and to investigate the physical properties of evolving galaxies across time. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations are especially key to study how the complex interstellar medium of forming galaxies responds to the most energetic processes during galaxy evolution, such as stellar feedback ensuing supernova explosions and feedback from AGN. Given the huge dynamical range of physical scales spanned by the astrophysical processes involved in cosmic structure formation and evolution, cosmological simulations resort to sub-resolution models to capture processes occurring below their resolution limit. The impact of different sub-grid prescriptions accounting for the same process is striking, though often overlooked. Some among the main aforementioned processes include: hot gas cooling, star formation and stellar feedback, stellar evolution and chemical enrichment, black hole growth and feedback. Producing simulations of cosmic structure formation and galaxy evolution in large computational volumes is key to shed light on what drives the formation of the first structures in the Universe, and their subsequent evolution. Not only are predictions from simulations crucial to compare with data from ongoing observational instruments, but they can also guide future observational campaigns. Besides, since we have entered the era of high-performance computing, it is fundamental to have numerical codes which are very efficient from the computational point of view. In this chapter, we review the main hydrodynamic methods used in cosmological simulations and the most common techniques adopted to include the astrophysical processes which drive galaxy formation and evolution (abridged).</description>

      <title>WilloWISPs: A New Dark Growth Channel for Black Holes Suggests a Full-Spectrum Hierarchical MACHO Mass Function for Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06981</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.06981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Evidence of neutron stars with deconfined quark-matter cores suggest a new pathway for the evolution of black holes. New theories about the cores of neutron stars support the idea that quarkonium is likely to grow there as the neutron star ages. Surveys of stellar remnants have shown that there is no major mass gap between neutron stars and black holes. Black holes, specifically primordial ones (PBHs), have been suggested as an explanation for dark matter before. However, the way that very large black holes can form in the lifetime of the visible universe has only recently been explained with the solution to The Final Parsec Problem. If neutron stars can become exotic stars or black holes, then they may persist long enough to quiescently provide enough mass in dense matter regions to allow Intermediate-Mass Black Holes (IMBH) and Supermassive Black Holes (SMBH) to form quickly via coalescence. We find that a hierarchical clustering of Massive and Compact Halo Objects (MACHOs) with axion-dominated mini-halos can help to explain all of the missing dark matter. The model presented here suggests that this type of MACHO is likely equivalent to black holes above an unknown critical mass, which is less than ~5 $M_{\odot}$, and that they ought to form quark stars below this mass. If quark stars are a metastable transition between neutron stars and black holes, then black holes ought to be equivalent to boson stars with event horizons, after all the residual quark material has formed a Bose-Einstein condensate of mesons.</description>

      <title>Observations and Radiative Transfer Simulations of the Carbon-rich AGB star V Oph with VLTI/MATISSE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07092v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Carbon-rich Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars are among the most important contributors of enriched materials to the interstellar medium due to their strong stellar winds. To fully characterize mass loss on the AGB, it is necessary to determine the distributions of dust and gas around the stars, where the dust begins to condense from the gas, and how this extended atmospheric structure evolves over the pulsational period of the star. We present an analysis of L-band (2.8-4.2 $\mu$m) interferometric observations of the carbon-rich AGB star V Oph made with the MATISSE instrument at the VLTI at the maximum and minimum of the star's visual light curve. Using the radiative transfer software RADMC-3D, we model the circumstellar dust shell, and find stellar radii of 395 and 495 $R_{\odot}$ at the two phases, and dust radii of 790 and 742.5 $R_{\odot}$ at the two epochs, respectively. By adding C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN gas to the RADMC-3D models, we are able to fit the visibility spectra well, with some deviations at the 3.11 $\mu$m feature. Reasons for this deviation and interpretation of the best fitting models are discussed in the text, and we discuss motivations for follow-up imaging observations of V Oph.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Transit Candidate Identification in TESS Full-Frame Images via a Transformer-Based Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07542</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07542v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) is surveying a large fraction of the sky, generating a vast database of photometric time series data that requires thorough analysis to identify exoplanetary transit signals. Automated learning approaches have been successfully applied to identify transit signals. However, most existing methods focus on the classification and validation of candidates, while few efforts have explored new techniques for the search of candidates. To search for new exoplanet transit candidates, we propose an approach to identify exoplanet transit signals without the need for phase folding or assuming periodicity in the transit signals, such as those observed in multi-transit light curves. To achieve this, we implement a new neural network inspired by Transformers to directly process Full Frame Image (FFI) light curves to detect exoplanet transits. Transformers, originally developed for natural language processing, have recently demonstrated significant success in capturing long-range dependencies compared to previous approaches focused on sequential data. This ability allows us to employ multi-head self-attention to identify exoplanet transit signals directly from the complete light curves, combined with background and centroid time series, without requiring prior transit parameters. The network is trained to learn characteristics of the transit signal, like the dip shape, which helps distinguish planetary transits from other variability sources. Our model successfully identified 214 new planetary system candidates, including 122 multi-transit light curves, 88 single-transit and 4 multi-planet systems from TESS sectors 1-26 with a radius &gt; 0.27 $R_{\mathrm{Jupiter}}$, demonstrating its ability to detect transits regardless of their periodicity.</description>

      <title>Fundamental MHD scales -- II: the kinematic phase of the supersonic small-scale dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2310.17036v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Many astrophysical small-scale dynamos (SSDs) amplify weak magnetic fields via highly compressible, supersonic turbulence, but established SSD theories have overlooked these compressible effects. To address this, we perform visco-resistive SSD simulations across a range of sonic Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M}$), hydrodynamic Reynolds numbers ($\mathrm{Re}$), and magnetic Prandtl numbers ($\mathrm{Pm}$). We develop robust methods to measure kinetic and magnetic energy dissipation scales ($\ell_\nu$ and $\ell_\eta$) and the scale of strongest magnetic fields ($\ell_\mathrm{p}$) during the kinematic phase. We demonstrate that $\ell_\nu/\ell_\eta \sim \mathrm{Pm}^{1/2}$ is a universal feature for $\mathrm{Pm} \geq 1$ SSDs, regardless of $\mathcal{M}$ or $\mathrm{Re}$. Incompressible SSDs (either $\mathcal{M} \leq 1$ or $\mathrm{Re} &lt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit} \approx 100$) concentrate magnetic energy at $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim \ell_\eta$ with inversely correlated field strength and curvature. However, for compressible SSDs ($\mathcal{M} &gt; 1$ and $\mathrm{Re} &gt; \mathrm{Re}\mathrm{crit}$), shocks concentrate magnetic energy in large structures with $\ell_\mathrm{p} \sim (\ell_\mathrm{turb} / \ell_\mathrm{shock})^{1/3} \ell_\eta \gg \ell_\eta$, where $\ell_\mathrm{shock}$ is the characteristic shock width, and $\ell_\mathrm{turb}$ is the outer scale of the turbulent field. In this regime, magnetic field-line curvature becomes nearly independent of field strength. These results have implications for galaxy mergers and cosmic ray transport models in the interstellar medium.</description>

      <title>EPOCHS IV: SED Modelling Assumptions and their impact on the Stellar Mass Function at 6.5 &lt; z &lt; 13.5 using PEARLS and public JWST observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03908v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We utilize deep JWST NIRCam observations for the first direct constraints on the Galaxy Stellar Mass Function (GSMF) at $z&gt;10$. Our EPOCHS v1 sample includes 1120 galaxy candidates at $6.5&lt;z&lt;13.5$ taken from a consistent reduction and analysis of publicly available deep JWST NIRCam data covering the PEARLS, CEERS, GLASS, JADES GOOD-S, NGDEEP, and SMACS0723 surveys, totalling 187 arcmin$^2$. We investigate the impact of SED fitting methods, assumed star formation histories (SFH), dust laws, and priors on galaxy masses and the resultant GSMF. Whilst our fiducial GSMF agrees with the literature at $z&lt;13.5$, we find that the assumed SFH model has a large impact on the GSMF and stellar mass density (SMD), finding a 0.75~dex increase in the SMD at $z=10.5$ between a flexible non-parametric and standard parametric SFH. Overall, we find a flatter SMD evolution at $z \geq 9$ than some studies predict, suggesting a rapid buildup of stellar mass in the early Universe. We find no incompatibility between our results and those of standard cosmological models, as suggested previously, although the most massive galaxies may require a high star formation efficiency. We find that the "Little Red Dot" galaxies dominate the $z=7$ GSMF at high-masses, necessitating a better understanding of the relative contributions of AGN and stellar emission. We show that assuming a theoretically motivated top-heavy IMF reduces stellar mass by 0.5~dex without affecting fit quality, but our results remain consistent with existing cosmological models with a standard IMF.</description>

      <title>VODKA-JWST: Synchronized growth of two SMBHs in a massive gas disk? A 3.8 kpc separation dual quasar at cosmic noon with NIRSpec IFU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08098v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The search for dual supermassive black holes (SMBHs) is of immense interest in modern astrophysics. Galaxy mergers may fuel and produce SMBH pairs. Actively accreting SMBH pairs are observed as a dual quasar, which are vital probes of SMBH growth. Dual quasars at cosmic noon are not well characterized. Gaia observations have enabled a novel technique to identify dual quasars at kpc scales, based on the small jitters of the light centroid as the two quasars vary stochastically. We present the first detailed study of a z=2.17, 0.46'', 3.8 kpc separation dual quasar, J0749+2255, using JWST/NIRSpec integral field unit spectroscopy. Identified by Gaia, J0749+2255 is one of the most distant, small separation dual quasars known. We detect the faint ionized gas of the host galaxy, traced by the narrow Ha emission. Line ratios indicate ionization from the two quasars and from intense star formation. Spectral analysis of the two quasars suggests that they have similar black hole properties, hinting at the possible synchronized accretion activity or lensed quasar images. Surprisingly, the ionized gas kinematics suggest a rotating disk rather than a disturbed system expected in a major gas-rich galaxy merger. Numerical simulations show that this is a plausible outcome of a major gas-rich galaxy merger several tens of Myr before coalescence. Whether J0749+2255 reflects an interesting phase of dual quasar evolution or is a lensed quasar remains unclear. Thus, this study underscores the challenges in definitively distinguishing between a dual and lensed quasars, with observations supporting either scenario.</description>

Abstract: From a careful visual scrutiny of the radio structures of a well-defined sample of 2428 sources in the LoTSS DR2 survey made at 144 MHz with a 6" beam, we have selected a subset of 25 (i.e., 1%) sources showing highly unusual radio structures, not conforming to the prevalent radio morphological classification. Here we present and briefly discuss the basic properties of these rare morphological outliers and attempt to dissect their morphological peculiarities, based on multi-wavelength radio images and radio-optical overlays. Also, we underscore the need to accord due importance to such anomalous radio sources, considering the challenge they pose to the standard theoretical models and simulations of extragalactic double radio sources.</description>

      <title>The PARADIGM project I: How early merger histories shape the present-day sizes of Milky-Way-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00171v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: How mergers affect galaxy formation depends on both feedback processes, and on the geometry and strength of the mergers themselves. We introduce the PARADIGM project, where we study the response of a simulated Milky-Way-mass galaxy ($M_{\rm 200c} \sim 10^{12}M_{\odot}$ at $z=0$) forming in a cosmological setting to differing merger histories, using genetically modified initial conditions, each simulated with the VINTERGATAN and IllustrisTNG codes. While VINTERGATAN has been developed with an emphasis on resolving the cold interstellar medium, IllustrisTNG uses a subgrid two-phase model and consequently scales to large volume simulations, making them ideal to examine complementary views on how merger histories and feedback interact. Our genetic modifications alter the mass ratio of an important $z \approx 2$ merger while maintaining the halo's $z=0$ mass. Whether simulated with VINTERGATAN or IllustrisTNG, smaller mass ratios for this early merger result in larger galaxies at $z=0$, due to a greater build up of a kinematically cold disc. We conclude that such broad trends are robustly reproducible; however, the normalization of the resulting stellar sizes is substantially different in the two codes (ranging between $0.5-1.7\ \rm{kpc}$ for VINTERGATAN but $1.3-7.0\ \rm{kpc}$ for IllustrisTNG). The VINTERGATAN galaxies systematically form stars earlier, leading to a larger bulge component. Despite the difference in size normalization, both simulation suites lie on the observed size-mass relation for their respective morphological types. In light of these results, we discuss the interplay between internal processes and large scale gravitational interactions and gas accretion, and how the two galaxy models converge on similar emergent trends but along different evolutionary pathways.</description>

      <title>Jetted Subgalactic-Size Radio Sources in Merging Galaxies -- A Jet Redirection Scenario</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02029v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The long-standing question concerning Jetted Sub-Galactic Size (JSS) radio sources is whether they will evolve into large radio galaxies, die before escaping the host galaxy, or remain indefinitely confined to their compact size. Our main goal is to propose a scenario that explains the relative number of JSS radio sources and their general properties. We studied the parsec-scale radio morphology of a complete sample of 21 objects using Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) observations at various frequencies and analyzed the morphological characteristics of their optical hosts. Many of these radio sources exhibit radio morphologies consistent with transverse motions of their bright edges and are located in dynamically disturbed galaxies. VLBI images indicate the possibility of large-angle, short-period precessing jets, and the orbital motion of the radio-loud AGN in a dual or binary system. The majority of JSS radio sources appear to be in systems in different stages of their merging evolution. We propose a scenario where rapid jet redirection, through precession or orbital motion, prevents the jet from penetrating the interstellar medium (ISM) sufficiently to escape the host galaxy. Most JSS radio sources remain compact due to their occurrence in merging galaxies.</description>

      <title>PAMS: The Perseus Arm Molecular Survey -- I. Survey description and first results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.01255v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The external environments surrounding molecular clouds vary widely across galaxies such as the Milky Way, and statistical samples of clouds are required to understand them. We present the Perseus Arm Molecular Survey (PAMS), a James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) survey combining new and archival data of molecular cloud complexes in the outer Perseus spiral arm in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, and C$^{18}$O ($J$=3-2). With a survey area of $\sim$8 deg$^2$, PAMS covers well-known complexes such as W3, W5 and NGC 7538 with two fields at $\ell \approx 110^{\circ}$ and $\ell \approx 135^{\circ}$. PAMS has an effective resolution of 17 arcsec, and rms sensitivity of $T_\mathrm{mb} = 0.7$-1.0 K in 0.3 km s$^{-1}$ channels. Here we present a first look at the data, and compare the PAMS regions in the Outer Galaxy with Inner Galaxy regions from the CO Heterodyne Inner Milky Way Plane Survey (CHIMPS). By comparing the various CO data with maps of H$_2$ column density from Herschel, we calculate representative values for the CO-to-H$_2$ column density $X$-factors, which are $X_{^{12}\mathrm{CO (3-2)}}=4.0\times10^{20}$ and $X_{^{13}\mathrm{CO (3-2)}}=4.0\times10^{21}$cm$^{-2}$ (K km s$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$ with a factor of 1.5 uncertainty. We find that the emission profiles, size-linewidth and mass-radius relationships of $^{13}$CO-traced structures are similar between the Inner and Outer Galaxy. Although PAMS sources are slightly more massive than their Inner Galaxy counterparts for a given size scale, the discrepancy can be accounted for by the Galactic gradient in gas-to-dust mass ratio, uncertainties in the $X$-factors, and selection biases. We have made the PAMS data publicly available, complementing other CO surveys targeting different regions of the Galaxy in different isotopologues and transitions.</description>

      <title>Scylla IV: Intrinsic Stellar Properties and Line-of-Sight Dust Extinction Measurements Towards 1.5 Million Stars in the SMC and LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.19910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By analyzing the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of resolved stars in nearby galaxies, we can constrain their stellar properties and line-of-sight dust extinction. From the Scylla survey, we obtain ultraviolet to near-infrared photometry from Wide Field Camera 3 onboard the {\it Hubble Space Telescope} for more than 1.5 million stars in the SMC and LMC. We use the Bayesian Extinction and Stellar Tool (BEAST) to analyze the multi-band SEDs of these sources and characterize their initial masses, ages, metallicities, distances, and line-of-sight extinction properties (e.g.~$A_V$, $R_V$). We apply quality cuts and perform validation simulations to construct a catalog of over 550,000 stars with high-reliability SED fits, which we use to analyze the stellar content and extinction properties of the SMC and LMC. We detect stars with masses as low as 0.6 $M_{\odot}$. BEAST stellar age distributions show a jump in observed stars around 6 Gyrs ago, which agrees with star-formation histories. Extinctions ($A_V$) in both galaxies follow a log-normal distribution. We compare $A_V$ with ancillary gas and dust tracers like $HI$, $H_\alpha$, and far infrared (FIR) dust emission and find positive correlations on a field-by-field basis. We convert observed $A_V$ to predicted dust surface densities using the Draine et. al. (2014) model and find $A_V$-based dust surface densities are a factor of $\sim$2.5 lower than observed FIR-based dust surface densities, a correction factor similar to other studies.</description>

      <title>Core to Cosmic Edge: SIMBA-C's New Take on Abundance Profiles in the Intragroup Medium at z = 0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04657</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04657v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the SIMBA-C cosmological simulation to study the impact of its upgraded chemical enrichment model (Chem5) on the distribution of metals in the intragroup medium (IGrM). We investigate the projected X-ray emission-weighted abundance profiles of key elements over two decades in halo mass ($10^{13} \leq M_{500}/\mathrm{M_\odot} \leq 10^{15}$). Typically, SIMBA-C generates lower-amplitude abundance profiles than SIMBA with flatter cores, in better agreement with observations. For low-mass groups, both simulations over-enrich the IGrM with Si, S, Ca, and Fe compared to observations, a trend likely related to inadequate modeling of metal dispersal and mixing. We analyze the 3D mass-weighted abundance profiles, concluding that the lower SIMBA-C IGrM abundances are primarily a consequence of fewer metals in the IGrM, driven by reduced metal yields in Chem5, and the removal of the instantaneous recycling of metals approximation employed by SIMBA. Additionally, an increased IGrM mass in low-mass SIMBA-C groups is likely triggered by changes to the AGN and stellar feedback models. Our study suggests that a more realistic chemical enrichment model broadly improves agreement with observations, but physically motivated sub-grid models for other key processes, like AGN and stellar feedback and turbulent diffusion, are required to realistically reproduce observed group environments.</description>

      <title>SPARCL: SPectra Analysis and Retrievable Catalog Lab</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05576v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: SPectra Analysis and Retrievable Catalog Lab (SPARCL) at NOIRLab's Astro Data Lab was created to efficiently serve large optical and infrared spectroscopic datasets. It consists of services, tools, example workflows and currently contains spectra for over 7.5 million stars, galaxies and quasars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) survey. We aim to eventually support the broad range of spectroscopic datasets that will be hosted at NOIRLab and beyond. Major elements of SPARCL include capabilities to discover and query for spectra based on parameters of interest, a fast web service that delivers desired spectra either individually or in bulk as well as documentation and example Jupyter Notebooks to empower users in their research. More information is available on the SPARCL website (https://astrosparcl.datalab.noirlab.edu).</description>

      <title>Anatomy of a Fall: Stationary and super-Keplerian spiral arms generated by accretion streamers in protostellar discs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Late-stage infall onto evolved protoplanetary discs is an important source of material and angular momentum replenishment, and disc substructures. In this paper we used 3D smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations to model streamer-disc interactions for a prograde streamer. The initially parabolic streamer interacts with the disc material to excite disc eccentricity, which can last on the order of $10^5$ years. We found that the spiral arms the streamer excited in the disc can have a variety of pattern speeds, ranging from stationary to super-Keplerian. Spiral arms with various pattern speeds can exist simultaneously, providing a way to diagnose them in observations. Streamer induced spirals appear similar to those generated by a massive outer companion, where the pitch angle of the spiral increases towards the source of the perturbation. Additionally, the spirals arms can show large and sudden pitch angle changes. Streamer induced spirals are long-lived, lasting approximately $3-4\times$ longer than the initial streamer infall timescale ($\sim$$10^4$ years). After the initial interaction with the disc, a long lasting low $m$ azimuthal mode persists in the disc.</description>

      <title>Light curves and spectra for stellar collisions between main-sequence stars in galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: High-velocity stellar collisions in galactic nuclei produce ejecta that generate potentially observable electromagnetic radiation, making them promising nuclear transients. However, the photometric and spectroscopic properties of these collisions, which would more frequently involve main-sequence stars, remain largely unexplored. Here, using 3D hydrodynamics and 1D radiation-transfer simulations, we investigate the properties and observables of the debris produced in high-velocity collisions between terminal-age main-sequence stars, covering a wide range of collision configurations. The ejecta produce bright UV flares with bolometric luminosities typically peaking at $\gtrsim10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$, declining steeply as $t^{-2}-t^{-4}$ to reach $\gtrsim10^{41}-10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ at 0.5 d and leveling off on a plateau at $10^{39}-10^{41.5}$ erg s$^{-1}$ ($M_V$ between $-$10 to $-$15 mag) after a few days. Their spectra evolve considerably during the first few days, morphing from UV- to optical-dominated. The UV range shows numerous resonance transitions from metals like C, N, and O, whereas the optical primarily shows H I Balmer lines. These properties are qualitatively similar to those observed, as well as obtained in models of Type II supernovae. Observables from these events exhibit clear correlations with collision configurations, including impact parameter, relative velocity, and stellar masses. We provide fitting formulae to describe these correlations. Detecting these flares requires sub-day cadence surveys such as ULTRASAT, combined with spectroscopic observations to disentangle degeneracies and infer collision characteristics.</description>
