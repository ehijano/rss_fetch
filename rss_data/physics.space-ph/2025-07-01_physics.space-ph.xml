      <title>A composite of the effects of major sudden stratospheric warming events on carbon dioxide radiative cooling in the mesosphere-lower-thermosphere</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The major sudden stratospheric warming (SSW) events strongly influence the mean structure of the entire atmosphere, from the troposphere to the thermosphere. These events disrupt the compositional and thermal structure of the mesosphere and lower thermosphere (MLT), causing spatiotemporal variations in the concentration of trace species of this region. Currently, the role of dynamical changes during SSW events on radiative cooling in the MLT region is not well understood. An investigation of the SSW-induced changes in CO$_2$ radiative cooling in the MLT region is presented by examining the changes in the dynamics and transport of key species, such as CO$_2$ and atomic oxygen (O). A composite analysis has been performed to understand these changes during the major SSW events that occurred between 2005 and 2020. The variation of trace species is found to be associated with the change in vertical residual circulation. The results also show that CO$_2$ radiative cooling decreases during the mesospheric cooling that occurs during the stratospheric warming over the polar region. During the recovery stage of the SSW event, the CO$_2$ radiative cooling enhances in the mesosphere. These variations in CO$_2$ radiative cooling are mainly caused by temperature perturbations and oxygen transport in the MLT region. The contribution of temperature change and transport have also been investigated in detail.</description>

      <title>The impacts of tropospheric gravity wave-generated MSTIDs on skywaves at middle latitude North American sector observed and modeled using SuperDARN HF radars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23984v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trans-ionospheric high frequency (HF: 3-30 MHz) response to gravity waves (GWs) is studied in the middle-latitude ionosphere in relation to thunderstorm activity. SuperDARN HF radar observations are compared against the model simulations to quantify the impact of GW-generated MSTID (medium-scale traveling ionospheric disturbances) activity on the skywaves traveling through ionospheric F-region heights. The tropospheric thunderstorm-driven convective source is modeled using MAGIC. The outputs are coupled with GEMINI to model ionospheric plasma response, which is then used to model SuperDARN HF radar observations using the PHaRLAP raytracing tool. Semi-concentric GWs were observed at different atmospheric heights, creating MSTIDs at F-region heights. PHaRLAP raytracing through the modeled ionosphere shows great qualitative agreement with SuperDARN daytime ground scatter observations. Modeled rays show possibilities of long ducting Pedersen rays, suggesting MSTID can create a plasma waveguide to duct rays at the F-region height.</description>

      <title>Avalanching together: A model for sympathetic flaring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.23889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Avalanche models running in a self-organized critical regime have proven powerful in reproducing the power-law distributions and scale invariance that characterize the statistical properties of solar flares. They are often interpreted as representing an individual active region of the Sun. As a result, this class of models has rarely been applied to describe sympathetic flares $\unicode{x2014}$ solar eruptions that occur in close spatial and temporal proximity, seemingly driven by their mutual interaction. In this study, we investigate the phenomenon of sympathetic flaring using avalanche models and compare their statistical properties with observations of sympathetic flares on the Sun. We developed a novel avalanche model featuring two connected lattices, each representing a distinct active region. This connectivity allows the transfer of nodal variable between the lattices, simulating the non-local effects expected to occur during sympathetic flares. Our results show that under strong connectivity, the lattices exhibit temporal synchronization, with correlations between their avalanche energies. Furthermore, increasing the connectivity between the lattices results in an excess of avalanches at short waiting times. A quantitative comparison with observational data suggests that only a weak connectivity allows our model to replicate the observed solar waiting time distributions. Consequently, we propose that if magnetic connectivity between distinct active regions drives sympathetic flaring on the Sun, it must remain relatively weak.</description>

      <title>Jupiter's ultraviolet auroral bridge: the influence of the solar wind on polar auroral morphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07222v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jupiters ultraviolet aurora frequently shows a number of arcs between the dusk-side polar region and the main emission, which are denoted as bridges. This work presents a largely automated detection and statistical analysis of bridges over 248 Hubble-Space-Telescope observations, alongside a multi-instrument study of crossings of magnetic field lines connected to bridges by the Juno spacecraft during its first 30 perijoves. Bridges are observed to arise on timescales of around 2 hours, can persist over a full Jupiter rotation, and are conjugate between hemispheres. The appearance of bridges is associated with compression of the magnetosphere, likely by the solar wind. Low-altitude bridge crossings are associated with upward-dominated, broadband electron distributions, consistent with Zone-II aurorae, as well as with plasma-wave emission observed by Juno-Waves, in agreement with existing theoretical models for the generation of polar-region aurorae. Main-emission crossings where no bridges are visible also show characteristics associated with bridges (more upward electron flux, plasma-wave emission), which is not the case for main-emission crossings with visible bridges, as though bridges remain present but spatially indistinguishable from the main emission in the former case. In all, compression of the magnetosphere may work to spatially separate the Zone-I and Zone-II regions of the main emission, in the form of Zone-II bridges.</description>

      <title>CAM-NET: An AI Model for Whole Atmosphere with Thermosphere and Ionosphere Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19340v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present Compressible Atmospheric Model-Network (CAM-NET), an AI model designed to predict neutral atmospheric variables from the Earth's surface to the ionosphere with high accuracy and computational efficiency. Accurate modeling of the entire atmosphere is critical for understanding the upward propagation of gravity waves, which influence upper-atmospheric dynamics and coupling across atmospheric layers. CAM-NET leverages the Spherical Fourier Neural Operator (SFNO) to capture global-scale atmospheric dynamics while preserving the Earth's spherical structure. Trained on a decade of datasets from the Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model with thermosphere and ionosphere eXtension (WACCM-X), CAM-NET demonstrates accuracy comparable to WACCM-X while achieving a speedup of over 1000x in inference time, can provide one year simulation within a few minutes once trained. The model effectively predicts key atmospheric parameters, including zonal and meridional winds, temperature, and time rate of pressure. Inspired by traditional modeling approaches that use external couplers to simulate tracer transport, CAM-NET introduces a modular architecture that explicitly separates tracer prediction from core dynamics. The core backbone of CAM-NET focuses on forecasting primary physical variables (e.g., temperature, wind velocity), while tracer variables are predicted through a lightweight, fine-tuned model. This design allows for efficient adaptation to specific tracer scenarios with minimal computational cost, avoiding the need to retrain the entire model. We have validated this approach on the $O^2$ tracer, demonstrating strong performance and generalization capabilities.</description>

      <title>Probing Solar Polar Regions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The magnetic fields and dynamical processes in the solar polar regions play a crucial role in the solar magnetic cycle and in supplying mass and energy to the fast solar wind, ultimately being vital in controlling solar activities and driving space weather. Despite numerous efforts to explore these regions, to date no imaging observations of the Sun's poles have been achieved from vantage points out of the ecliptic plane, leaving their behavior and evolution poorly understood. This observation gap has left three top-level scientific questions unanswered, 1) How does the solar dynamo work and drive the solar magnetic cycle? 2) What drives the fast solar wind? 3) How do space weather processes globally originate from the Sun and propagate throughout the solar system? The Solar Polar-orbit Observatory (SPO) mission, a solar polar exploration spacecraft, is proposed to address these three unanswered scientific questions by imaging the Sun's poles from high heliolatitudes. In order to achieve its scientific goals, SPO will carry six remote-sensing and four in-situ instruments to measure the vector magnetic fields and Doppler velocity fields in the photosphere, to observed the Sun in the extreme ultraviolet, X-ray, and radio wavelengths, to image the corona and the heliosphere up to 45 $R_\odot$, and to perform in-situ detection of magnetic fields, and low- and high-energy particles in the solar wind.</description>
