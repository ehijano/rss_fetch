      <title>A generic Branch-and-Cut algorithm for bi-objective binary linear programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08722</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08722v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents the first generic bi-objective binary linear branch-and-cut algorithm. Studying the impact of valid inequalities in solution and objective spaces, two cutting frameworks are proposed. The multi-point separation problem is introduced together with a cutting algorithm to efficiently generate valid inequalities violating multiple points simultaneously. The other main idea is to invoke state-of-the-art integer linear programming solver's internal advanced techniques such as cut separators. Aggregation techniques are proposed to use these frameworks with a trade-off among efficient cut separations, tight lower and upper bound sets and advanced branching strategies. Experiments on various types of instances in the literature exhibit the promising efficiency of the algorithm that solves instances with up to 2800 binary variables in less than one hour of CPU time. Our algorithms are easy to extend for more than two objectives and integer variables.</description>

      <title>Block coupling and rapidly mixing k-heights</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A $k$-height on a graph $G=(V, E)$ is an assignment $V\to\{0, \ldots, k\}$ such that the value on ajacent vertices differs by at most $1$. We study the Markov chain on $k$-heights that in each step selects a vertex at random, and, if admissible, increases or decreases the value at this vertex by one. In the cases of $2$-heights and $3$-heights we show that this Markov chain is rapidly mixing on certain families of grid-like graphs and on planar cubic $3$-connected graphs.
  The result is based on a novel technique called block coupling, which is derived from the well-established monotone coupling approach. This technique may also be effective when analyzing other Markov chains that operate on configurations of spin systems that form a distributive lattice. It is therefore of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Subgraph Counting in Subquadratic Time for Bounded Degeneracy Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.08376v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the classic problem of subgraph counting, where we wish to determine the number of occurrences of a fixed pattern graph $H$ in an input graph $G$ of $n$ vertices. Our focus is on \emph{bounded degeneracy} inputs, a rich class of graphs that also characterizes real-world massive networks. Building on the seminal techniques introduced by Chiba-Nishizeki (SICOMP 1985), a recent line of work has built subgraph counting algorithms for bounded degeneracy graphs. Assuming fine-grained complexity conjectures, there is a complete characterization of patterns $H$ for which linear time subgraph counting is possible. For every $r \geq 6$, there exists an $H$ with $r$ vertices that cannot be counted in linear time.
  In this paper, we initiate a study of subquadratic algorithms for subgraph counting on bounded degeneracy graphs. We prove that when $H$ has at most $7$ vertices, then subgraph counting can be done in $O(n^{1.41})$ time. Moreover, if this running time can be beaten, it would imply faster algorithms for triangle counting on arbitrary graphs (a bound that has stood for two decades). We also prove that all cycles of length at most $10$ can be counted in $O(n^{1.63})$ time for bounded degeneracy graphs.
  Previously, no subquadratic (and superlinear) algorithms were known for subgraph counting on bounded degeneracy graphs. Moreover, if the input is an arbitrary (sparse) graph, the best known algorithms for the above problems run in at least cubic time.
  Our main conceptual contribution is a framework that reduces subgraph counting in bounded degeneracy graphs to counting smaller cycles in arbitrary graphs. We believe that our results will help build a general theory of subgraph counting for bounded degeneracy graphs.</description>

      <title>Construction of optimal flag codes by MRD codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.11285</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.11285v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Flag codes have received a lot of attention due to its application in random network coding. In 2021, Alonso-Gonz\'{a}lez et al. constructed optimal $(n,\mathcal{A})$-Optimum distance flag codes(ODFC) for $\mathcal {A}\subseteq \{1,2,\ldots,k,n-k,\ldots,n-1\}$ with $k\in \mathcal A$ and $k\mid n$. In this paper, we introduce a new construction of $(n,\mathcal A)_q$-ODFCs by maximum rank-metric codes, and prove that there is an $(n,\mathcal{A})$-ODFC of size $\frac{q^n-q^{k+r}}{q^k-1}+1$ for any $\mathcal{A}\subseteq\{1,2,\ldots,k,n-k,\ldots,n-1\}$ with $\mathcal A\cap \{k,n-k\}\neq\emptyset$, where $r\equiv n\pmod k$ and $0\leq r&lt;k$. Furthermore, when $k&gt;\frac{q^r-1}{q-1}$, this $(n,\mathcal A)_q$-ODFC is optimal. Specially, when $r=0$, Alonso-Gonz\'{a}lez et al.'s result is also obtained. We also gives a characterization of almost optimum distance flag codes, and construct a family of optimal almost optimum flag distance codes.</description>

      <title>Cops and Robber -- When Capturing is not Surrounding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.10577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.10577v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider "surrounding" versions of the classic Cops and Robber game. The game is played on a connected graph in which two players, one controlling a number of cops and the other controlling a robber, take alternating turns. In a turn, each player may move each of their pieces: The robber always moves between adjacent vertices. Regarding the moves of the cops we distinguish four versions that differ in whether the cops are on the vertices or the edges of the graph and whether the robber may move on/through them. The goal of the cops is to surround the robber, i.e., occupying all neighbors (vertex version) or incident edges (edge version) of the robber's current vertex. In contrast, the robber tries to avoid being surrounded indefinitely. Given a graph, the so-called cop number denotes the minimum number of cops required to eventually surround the robber. We relate the different cop numbers of these versions and prove that none of them is bounded by a function of the classical cop number and the maximum degree of the graph, thereby refuting a conjecture by Crytser, Komarov and Mackey [Graphs and Combinatorics, 2020].</description>

      <title>Recognition of chordal graphs and cographs which are Cover-Incomparability graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13964</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13964v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cover-Incomparability graphs (C-I graphs) are an interesting class of graphs from posets. A C-I graph is a graph from a poset $P=(V,\le)$ with vertex set $V$, and the edge-set is the union of edge sets of the cover graph and the incomparability graph of the poset. The recognition of the C-I graphs is known to be NP-complete (Maxov\'{a} et al., Order 26(3), 229--236(2009)). In this paper, we prove that chordal graphs having at most two independent simplicial vertices are exactly the chordal graphs which are also C-I graphs. A similar result is obtained for cographs as well. Using the structural results of these graphs, we derive linear time recognition algorithms for chordal graphs and cographs which are C-I graphs.</description>
