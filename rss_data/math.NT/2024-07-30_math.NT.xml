      <title>On the algebraic independence of logarithms of Anderson $t$-modules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the present paper, we determine the algebraic relations among the tractable coordinates of logarithms of Anderson $t$-modules constructed by taking the tensor product of Drinfeld modules of rank $r$ defined over the algebraic closure of the rational function field and their $(r-1)$-st exterior powers with the Carlitz tensor powers. Our results, in the case of the tensor powers of the Carlitz module, generalize the work of Chang and Yu on the algebraic independence of polylogarithms.</description>

      <title>The Basic Theory of Clifford-Bianchi Groups for Hyperbolic n-Space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19122v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $K$ be a $\mathbb{Q}$-Clifford algebra associated to an $(n-1)$-ary positive definite quadratic form and let $\mathcal{O}$ be a maximal order in $K$. A Clifford-Bianchi group is a group of the form $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathcal{O})$ with $\mathcal{O}$ as above. The present paper is about the actions of $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathcal{O})$ acting on hyperbolic space $\mathcal{H}^{n+1}$ via M\"{o}bius transformations $x\mapsto (ax+b)(cx+d)^{-1}$.
  We develop the general theory of orders exhibiting explicit orders in low dimensions of interest. These include, for example, higher-dimensional analogs of the Hurwitz order. We develop the abstract and computational theory for determining their fundamental domains and generators and relations (higher-dimensional Bianchi-Humbert Theory). We make connections to the classical literature on symmetric spaces and arithmetic groups and provide a proof that these groups are $\mathbb{Z}$-points of a $\mathbb{Z}$-group scheme and are arithmetic subgroups of $\operatorname{SO}_{1,n+1}(\mathbb{R})^{\circ}$ with their M\"{o}bius action. We report on our findings concerning certain Clifford-Bianchi groups acting on $\mathcal{H}^4$, $\mathcal{H}^5$, and $\mathcal{H}^6$ .</description>

      <title>On a generalization of Watson's trigonometric sum, some of its properties and its relationship to Dowker's sum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19223</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19223v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we study two finite trigonometric sums $\sum a_l\csc\big(\pi l/n\big)\,,$ where $a_l$ are equal either to $\cos(2\pi l \nu/n)$ or to $(-1)^{l+1}$, and where the summation index $l$ and the discrete parameter $\nu$ both run through $1$ to $n-1$ (marginally, cases $a_l=\ln\csc\big(\pi l/n\big)$ and $a_l=\Psi\big(l/n\big)$ also appear in the paper). These sums occur in various problems in mathematics, physics and engineering, and play an important part in some number-theoretic problems. Formally, the first of these sums is also the so-called Dowker sum of order one half. In the paper, we obtain several integral and series representations for the above-mentioned sums, investigate their properties, derive their complete asymptotical expansions and deduce very accurate upper and lower bounds for them (both bounds are asymptotically vanishing). In addition, we obtain a useful approximate formula containing only three terms, which is also very accurate and can be particularly appreciated in applications. Both trigonometric sums appear to be closely related with the digamma function and with the square of the Bernoulli numbers. Finally, we also derive several advanced summation formulae for the gamma and the digamma functions, in which the first on these sums, as well as the product of a sequence of cosecants $\,\prod\big(\csc(\pi l/n)\big)^{\csc(\pi l/n)}$, play an important role.</description>

      <title>Distribution and congruences of $(u,v)$-regular bipartitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $B_{u,v}(n)$ denote the number of $(u,v)$-regular bipartitions of $n$. In this article, we prove that $B_{p,m}(n)$ is always almost divisible by $p,$ where $p\geq 5$ is a prime number and $m=p_1^{\alpha_1} p_2^{\alpha_2}\cdots p_r^{\alpha_r}, $ where $\alpha_i \geq 0$ and $p_i \geq 5$ be distinct primes with $\gcd(p,m)=1$ . Further, we obtain an infinities families of congruences modulo $3$ for $B_{3,7}(n),$ $B_{3,5}(n)$ and $B_{3,2}(n)$ by using Hecke eigenform theory and a result of Newman \cite{Newmann1959}. Furthermore, we get many infinite families of congruences modulo $7$, $11$ and $13$ respectively for $B_{2,7}(n)$, $B_{2,11}(n)$ and $B_{2,13}(n),$ by employing an identity of Newman \cite{Newmann1959}. In addition, we prove infinite families of congruences modulo $2$ for $B_{4,3}(n)$, $B_{8,3}(n)$ and $B_{4,5}(n)$ by applying another result of Newman \cite{Newmann1962}.</description>

      <title>Cusp forms without complex multiplication as $p$-adic limits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2016, Ahlgren and Samart used the theory of holomorphic modular forms to obtain lower bounds on $p$-adic valuations related to the Fourier coefficients of three cusp forms. In particular, their work strengthened a previous result of El-Guindy and Ono which expresses a cusp form as a $p$-adic limit of weakly holomorphic modular forms. Subsequently, Hanson and Jameson extended Ahlgren and Samart's result to all one-dimensional cusp form spaces of trivial character and having a normalized form that has complex multiplication. Here we prove analogous $p$-adic limits for several one-dimensional cusp form spaces of trivial character but whose normalized form does not have complex multiplication.</description>

      <title>Counting rational points on Hirzebruch-Kleinschmidt varieties over number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the asymptotic growth of the number of rational points of bounded height on smooth projective split toric varieties with Picard rank 2 over number fields, with respect to Arakelov height functions associated with big metrized line bundles. We show that these varieties can be naturally decomposed into a finite disjoint union of subvarieties, where explicit asymptotic formulas for the number of rational points of bounded height can be given. Additionally, we present various examples, including the case of Hirzebruch surfaces.</description>

      <title>Relative monodromy of abelian logarithms for finite covers of universal families</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let's fix a complex abelian scheme endowed with a non-torsion section and with a finite surjective modular map onto a universal family of abelian varieties (with some fixed level-$\ell$-structure and without locally constant parts). We show that the relative monodromy group of the abelian logarithm is non-trivial and of full rank. As a consequence we deduce a new proof of Manin's kernel theorem and of the algebraic independence of the coordinates of abelian logarithms with respect to the coordinates of periods.</description>

      <title>Transfer operators and Hankel transforms: horospherical limits and quantization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transfer operators are conjectural "operators of functoriality," which transfer test measures and (relative) characters from one homogeneous space to another. In previous work, I computed transfer operators associated to spherical varieties of rank one, and gave an interpretation of them in terms of geometric quantization. In this paper, I study how these operators vary in the horospherical limits of these varieties, where they have a conceptual interpretation related to scattering theory. I also revisit Jacquet's Hankel transform for the Kuznetsov formula, which is related to the functional equation of the standard L-function of GL(n), and provide an interpretation of it in terms of quantization.</description>

      <title>On the average size of $3$-torsion in class groups of $C_2 \wr H$-extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19554v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet heuristics lead one to conjecture that the average size of the $p$-torsion in class groups of $G$-extensions of a number field is finite. In a 2021 paper, Lemke Oliver, Wang, and Wood proved this conjecture in the case of $p = 3$ for permutation groups $G$ of the form $C_2 \wr H$ for a broad family of permutation groups $H$, including most nilpotent groups. However, their theorem does not apply for some nilpotent groups of interest, such as $H = C_5$. We extend their results to prove that the average size of $3$-torsion in class groups of $C_2 \wr H$-extensions is finite for any nilpotent group $H$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the monodromy of certain $\ell$-adic local systems attached to the generalized Kloosterman sheaves constructed by Yun and calculate their Euler characteristics under standard representations in the cases of symplectic and split/quasi-split orthogonal groups. This provides evidence for the conjectural description of their Swan conductors at $\infty$ which is predicted by Reeder-Yu on the Langlands parameters attached to the epipelagic representations.</description>

Abstract: We study in detail the Ramanujan smooth expansions, for arithmetic functions; we start with the most general ones, for which we supply the "$P-$local expansions", for arguments with all prime-factors $p\le P$ (namely, $P-$smooth arguments), that are also square-free; then, we supply general results for interesting subsets of arithmetic functions, regarding both their $P-$local and (global) Ramanujan smooth expansions.</description>

      <title>Locally analytic vectors and decompletion in mixed characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19791</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In $p$-adic Hodge theory and the $p$-adic Langlands program, Banach spaces with $\mathbb{Q}_p$-coefficients and $p$-adic Lie group actions are central. Studying the subrepresentation of $\Gamma$-locally analytic vectors, $W^{\mathrm{la}}$, is useful because $W^{\mathrm{la}}$ can be analyzed via the Lie algebra $\mathrm{Lie}(\Gamma)$, which simplifies the action of $\Gamma$. Additionally, $W^{\mathrm{la}}$ often behaves as a decompletion of $W$, making it closer to an algebraic or geometric object.
  This article introduces a notion of locally analytic vectors for $W$ in a mixed characteristic setting, specifically for $\mathbb{Z}_p$-Tate algebras. This generalization encompasses the classical definition and also specializes to super-H\"older vectors in characteristic $p$. Using binomial expansions instead of Taylor series, this new definition bridges locally analytic vectors in characteristic $0$ and $p$.
  Our main theorem shows that under certain conditions, the map $W \mapsto W^{\mathrm{la}}$ acts as a descent, and the derived locally analytic vectors $\mathrm{R}_{\mathrm{la}}^i(W)$ vanish for $i \geq 1$. This result extends Theorem C of \cite{Po24}, providing new tools for propagating information about locally analytic vectors from characteristic $0$ to characteristic $p$.
  We provide three applications: a new proof of Berger-Rozensztajn's main result using characteristic $0$ methods, the introduction of an integral multivariable ring $\widetilde{\mathbf{A}}_{\mathrm{LT}}^{\dagger,\mathrm{la}}$ in the Lubin-Tate setting, and a novel interpretation of the classical Cohen ring ${\mathbf{A}}_{\mathbb{Q}_p}$ from the theory of $(\varphi,\Gamma)$-modules in terms of locally analytic vectors.</description>

      <title>Supercongruences involving binomial coefficients and Euler polynomials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $x$ be a $p$-adic integer. In this paper, we establish supercongruences for $$ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{x}{k}\binom{x+k}{k}(-4)^k}{(dk+1)\binom{2k}{k}}\pmod{p^2} $$ and $$ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\frac{\binom{x}{k}\binom{x+k}{k}(-2)^k}{(dk+1)\binom{2k}{k}}\pmod{p^2}, $$ where $d\in\{0,1,2\}$. As consequences, we extend some known results. For example, for $p&gt;3$ we show $$ \sum_{k=0}^{p-1}\binom{3k}{k}\left(\frac{4}{27}\right)^k\equiv\frac19+\frac89p+\frac{4}{27}pE_{p-2}\left(\frac13\right)\pmod{p^2}, $$ where $E_n(x)$ denotes the Euler polynomial of degree $n$. This generalizes a known congruence of Z.-W. Sun.</description>

      <title>Connecting Zeros in Pisano Periods to Prime Factors of $K$-Fibonacci Numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20048v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fibonacci sequence is periodic modulo every positive integer $m&gt;1$, and perhaps more surprisingly, each period has exactly 1, 2, or 4 zeros that are evenly spaced, which also holds true for more general $K$-Fibonacci sequences. This paper proves several conjectures connecting the zeros in the Pisano period to the prime factors of $K$-Fibonacci numbers. The congruence classes of indices for $K$-Fibonacci numbers that are multiples of the prime factors of $m$ completely determine the number of zeroes in the Pisano period modulo $m$.</description>

Abstract: We prove two results on some special generators of finite simple groups and use them to prove that every non-abelian finite simple group $S$ admits a non-congruence presentation (as conjectured in [CLT24]), and that if $S$ has a non-trivial Schur multiplier, then it admits a smooth cover (as conjectured in [CFLZ]).</description>

      <title>Exchangeable arrays and integrable systems for characteristic polynomials of random matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.19233v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The joint moments of the derivatives of the characteristic polynomial of a random unitary matrix, and also a variant of the characteristic polynomial that is real on the unit circle, in the large matrix size limit, have been studied intensively in the past twenty five years, partly in relation to conjectural connections to the Riemann zeta-function and Hardy's function. We completely settle the most general version of the problem of convergence of these joint moments, after they are suitably rescaled, for an arbitrary number of derivatives and with arbitrary positive real exponents. Our approach relies on a hidden, higher-order exchangeable structure, that of an exchangeable array. Using these probabilistic techniques, we then give a combinatorial formula for the leading order coefficient in the asymptotics of the joint moments, when the power on the characteristic polynomial itself is a positive real number and the exponents of the derivatives are integers, in terms of a finite number of finite-dimensional integrals which are explicitly computable. Finally, we develop a method, based on a class of Hankel determinants shifted by partitions, that allows us to give an exact representation of all these joint moments, for finite matrix size, in terms of derivatives of Painlev\'e V transcendents, and then for the leading order coefficient in the large-matrix limit in terms of derivatives of the $\sigma$-Painlev\'e III' equation. This gives an efficient way to compute all these moments and coefficients explicitly. Our methods can be used to obtain analogous results for a number of other models sharing the same features.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19986v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A field $k$ is called geometrically $C_1$ if every smooth projective separably rationally connected $k$-variety has a $k$-rational point. Given a henselian valued field of equal characteristic $0$ with divisible value group, we show that the property of being geometrically $C_1$ lifts from the residue field to the valued field. We also prove that algebraically maximal valued fields with divisible value group and finite residue field are geometrically $C_1$. In particular, any maximal totally ramified extension of a local field is geometrically $C_1$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1905.00792v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For every triple F,K,p where F is a classical elliptic eigenform, K is a quadratic imaginary field and p&gt; 3 is a prime integer which is not split in K, we attach a p-adic L function which interpolates the algebraic parts of the special values of the complex L-functions of F twisted by certain algebraic Hecke characters of K. This construction extends a classical construction of N. Katz, for F an Eisenstein series and of Bertolini-Darmon-Prasana, for F a cuspform, when p is split in K.
  Moreover we prove a Kronecker limit formula, respectively p-adic Gross-Zagier formulae for our newly defined p-adic L-functions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2210.03563v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper provides two characterizations of the primitive roots of unity in quadratic cyclotomic extensions over arbitrary fields. Firstly, we introduce a mapping from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$ crucial for describing these roots, closely tied to their order over the field. Secondly, for any prime $p$, we determine the maximal natural number $n$ such that $\zeta_{p^n}$ defines a quadratic cyclotomic extension over the field $F$. This characterization is uniform across different fields, regardless of their characteristic, and applies to both odd and even primes.</description>

      <title>Growth of torsion groups of elliptic curves upon base change from number fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.16977</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.16977v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a number field $F_0$ that contains no Hilbert class field of any imaginary quadratic field, we show that under GRH there exists an effectively computable constant $B:=B(F_0)\in\mathbb{Z}^+$ for which the following holds: for any finite extension $L/F_0$ whose degree $[L:F_0]$ is coprime to $B$, one has for all elliptic curves $E_{/F_0}$ that the $L$-rational torsion subgroup $E(L)[\textrm{tors}]=E(F_0)[\textrm{tors}]$. This generalizes a previous result of Gonz\'{a}lez-Jim\'{e}nez and Najman over $F_0=\mathbb{Q}$.
  Towards showing this, we also prove a result on relative uniform divisibility of the index of a mod-$\ell$ Galois representation of an elliptic curve over $F_0$. Additionally, we show that the main result's conclusion fails when we allow $F_0$ to have rationally defined CM, due to the existence of $F_0$-rational isogenies of arbitrarily large prime degrees satisfying certain congruency conditions.</description>

Abstract: We present an efficient computational representation of central simple algebras using Brauer factor sets. Using this representation and polynomial quantum algorithms for number theoretical tasks such as factoring and $S$-unit group computation, we give a polynomial quantum algorithm for the explicit isomorphism problem over number field, which relies on a heuristic concerning the irreducibility of the characteristic polynomial of a random matrix with algebraic integer coefficients. We present another version of the algorithm which does not need any heuristic but which is only polynomial if the degree of the input algebra is bounded.</description>

      <title>Automorphic density estimates and optimal Diophantine exponents</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.15875v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to establishing an optimal approximation exponent for the action of an irreducible uniform lattice subgroup of a product group on its proper factors. Previously optimal approximation exponents for lattice actions on homogeneous spaces were established under the assumption that the restriction of the automorphic representation to the stability group is suitably tempered. However, for irreducible lattices in semisimple algebraic groups, either this property does not hold or it amounts to an instance of the Ramanujan-Petersson-Selberg conjecture. Sarnak's Density Hypothesis and its variants bounding the multiplicities of irreducible representations occurring in the decomposition of the automorphic representation can be viewed as a weakening of the temperedness property. A refined form of this hypothesis has recently been established for uniform irreducible arithmetic congruence lattices arising from quaternion algebras. We employ this result in order to establish - unconditionally - an optimal approximation exponent for the actions of these lattices on the associated symmetric spaces. We also give a general spectral criterion for the optimality of the approximation exponent for irreducible uniform lattices in a product of arbitrary Gelfand pairs. Our methods involve utilizing the multiplicity bounds in the pre-trace formula, establishing refined estimates of the spherical transforms, and carrying out an elaborate spectral analysis that bounds the Hilbert-Schmidt norms of carefully balanced geometric convolution operators.</description>

Abstract: A $K$-Fibonacci sequence is a binary recurrence sequence where $F_0=0$, $F_1=1$, and $F_n=K\cdot F_{n-1}+F_{n-2}$. These sequences are known to be periodic modulo every positive integer greater than $1$. If the length of one shortest period of a $K$-Fibonacci sequence modulo a positive integer is equal to the modulus, then that positive integer is called a $\textit{fixed point}$. This paper determines the fixed points of $K$-Fibonacci sequences according to the factorization of $K^2+4$ and concludes that if this process is iterated, then every modulus greater than $3$ eventually terminates at a fixed point.</description>

We show that the action of $D^\times$ on the Drinfeld tower induces an equivalence of categories from finite dimensional smooth representations of $D^\times$ to $G^0$-finite $\text{GL}_n(F)$-equivariant vector bundles with connection on $\Omega$, the $(n-1)$-dimensional Drinfeld symmetric space.</description>

Abstract: Recently, Amdeberhan, Sellers and Singh introduced the notion of a generalized cubic partition function $a_c(n)$ and proved two isolated congruences via modular forms, namely $a_3(7n+4)\equiv 0\pmod{7}$ and $a_5(11n+10)\equiv 0\pmod{11}$. In this paper, we provide another proofs of these congruences using classical $q$-series manipulations. We also give an infinite family of congruences for $a_c(n)$ for primes $p\equiv 5,7\pmod{8}$ and other isolated congruences modulo $19,23$ and $31$ using modular forms.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we improve the error term in the prime geodesic theorem for the Picard manifold $ \mathrm{PSL}_2 (\mathbb{Z} {[i]}) \backslash \mathbb{H}^3 $. Instead of $ \mathrm{PSL}_2 (\mathbb{Z} {[i]}) \backslash \mathbb{H}^3 $, we establish a spectral large sieve inequality for symmetric squares over $\mathrm{PSL}_2 (\mathbb{Z} {[i]}) \backslash \mathrm{PSL}_2 (\mathbb{C}) $. This enables us to improve the bound $ O (T^{3+2/3+\varepsilon}) $ of Balkanova and Frolenkov into $ O (T^{3+1/2+\varepsilon}) $ for the second moment of symmetric square $L$-functions over $ \mathrm{PSL}_2 (\mathbb{Z} {[i]}) \backslash \mathbb{H}^3 $. The basic idea is to enlarge the spherical family $\Pi_c^{0} (T)$ of Maass cusp forms on $ \mathrm{PSL}_2 (\mathbb{Z} {[i]}) \backslash \mathbb{H}^3 $ into the family $ \Pi_c (T, \sqrt{T}) $ of cuspidal representations on $ \mathrm{PSL}_2 (\mathbb{Z} {[i]}) \backslash \mathrm{PSL}_2 (\mathbb{C}) $.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18859v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, I present a Tauberian equivalence of the Riemann hypothesis within the framework of the theory of regular arithmetic functions, a branch of Tauberian theory that extends the theory of functions with good variation introduced in 2016.
  The central element of this study is the function $\Phi(x)=x\left\lfloor \frac{1}{x}\right\rfloor$, which allows for the extension of Ingham's summation method [Ingham] far beyond the prime number theorem by linking it to the Riemann hypothesis. I thus demonstrate the following equivalence $$RH\Longleftrightarrow\alpha\left(\Phi\right)=\frac{1}{2}$$ where $\alpha\left(\Phi\right)$ represents the index of good variation of $\Phi$, an essential characteristic of functions of good variation. This equivalence of the Riemann hypothesis is a potential new contribution absent from recent comprehensive catalogs of equivalent of the Riemann hypothesis in mathematical literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2012.14075v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let ${\mathcal X}$ be a category fibered in groupoids over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, and let $k$ be an algebraically closed field containing $\mathbb{F}_q$. Denote by $\phi_k\colon {\mathcal X}_k\to {\mathcal X}_k$ the arithmetic Frobenius of ${\mathcal X}_k/k$ and suppose that ${\mathcal M}$ is a stack over $\mathbb{F}_q$ (not necessarily in groupoids). Then there is a natural functor $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}\colon{\mathcal M}({\mathcal X})\to{\mathcal M}({\mathbf D_k}({\mathcal X}))$, where ${\mathcal M}({\mathbf D_k}({\mathcal X}))$ is the category of $\phi_k$-invariant maps ${\mathcal X}_k\to {\mathcal M}$. A version of Drinfeld's lemma states that if ${\mathcal X}$ is a projective scheme and ${\mathcal M}$ is the stack of quasi-coherent sheaves of finite presentation, then $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}$ is an equivalence.
  We extend this result in several directions. For proper algebraic stacks or affine gerbes ${\mathcal X}$, we prove Drinfeld's lemma and deduce that $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}$ is an equivalence for very general algebraic stacks ${\mathcal M}$.
  For arbitrary ${\mathcal X}$, we show that $\alpha_{{\mathcal M},{\mathcal X}}$ is an equivalence when ${\mathcal M}$ is the stack of immersions, the stack of quasi-compact separated \'etale morphisms or any quasi-separated Deligne-Mumford stack with separated diagonal.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2209.05560v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Aim of this article is to prove the inequality $n \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_ib_i \leq \sum_{i=1}^{n} a_i \sum_{i=1}^n b_i$ when $a_i$ are $n$ increasing positive real numbers and $b_i$ are $n$ decreasing real numbers. We also prove generalizations of this result.</description>

      <title>Diffraction measures and patterns of the complex dimensions of self-similar fractal strings. I. The lattice case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.09050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a generalization of Lagarias' formula for diffraction by ideal crystals, and we apply it to the lattice case, in preparation for addressing the problem of quasicrystals and complex dimensions posed by Lapidus and van Frankenhuijsen concerning the quasiperiodic properties of the set of complex dimensions of any nonlattice self-similar fractal string. More specifically, in this paper, we consider the case of the complex dimensions of a lattice (rather than of a nonlattice) self-similar string and show that the corresponding diffraction measure exists, is unique, and is given by a suitable $\textit{continuous}$ analogue of a discrete Dirac comb. We also obtain more general results concerning the autocorrelation measures and diffraction measures of generalized idealized fractals associated to possibly degenerate lattices and the corresponding extension of the Poisson Summation Formula.</description>

      <title>The regularity of difference divisors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05239v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a prime number $p&gt;2$, we explain the construction of the difference divisors on the unitary Rapoport-Zink spaces of hyperspecial level and the GSpin Rapoport-Zink spaces of hyperspecial level associated to a minuscule cocharacter $\mu$ and a basic element $b$. We prove the regularity of the difference divisors, find the formally smooth locus of both the special cycles and the difference divisors, by a purely deformation-theoretic approach.</description>

      <title>Explicit sharbly cycles at the virtual cohomological dimension for SL_n(Z)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Denote the virtual cohomological dimension of SL_n(Z) by t=n(n-1)/2. Let St denote the Steinberg module of SL_n(Q) tensored with Q. Let Sh_* denote the sharbly resolution of the Steinberg module St. By Borel-Serre duality, the one-dimensional Q-vector space H^0(SL_n(Z), Q) is isomorphic to H_t(SL_n(Z),St). We find an explicit generator of H_t(SL_n(Z),St) in terms of sharbly cycles and cosharbly cocycles. These methods may extend to other degrees of cohomology of SL_n(Z).</description>

      <title>Hypertangency of plane curves and the algebraic exceptional set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09886v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate plane curves intersecting in at most two unibranched points to study the algebraic exceptional set appearing in standard conjectures of diophantine and hyperbolic geometry. Our first result compares the local geometry of two hypertangent curves, i.e. curves having maximal contact at one unibranched point. This is applied to fully describe the exceptional set and, more generally, the hyper-bitangency set, of a plane curve with three components.</description>

      <title>Generalized Campana points and adelic approximation on toric varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03048</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03048v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a general framework for studying special subsets of rational points on an algebraic variety, termed $\mathcal{M}$-points. The notion of $\mathcal{M}$-points generalizes the concepts of integral points, Campana points and Darmon points. We introduce and study $M$-approximation over number fields and function fields, which is a notion that generalizes weak and strong approximation. We show that this property implies that the set of $\mathcal{M}$-points is not thin. We then give a simple characterisation of when a split toric variety satisfies $M$-approximation, generalizing work of Nakahara and Streeter. Further, we determine when the set of $\mathcal{M}$-points on a split toric variety is thin.</description>

      <title>Integral Regulators on Mirror Curves with Mass Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.18356v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 2015, Codesido-Grassi-Marino laid the foundation of a connection between local CY 3-folds and the spectra of operators attached to their mirror curves in the context of Topological String Theory. In a 2024 paper with C. Doran and M. Kerr, the author previously deduced two consequences of this conjecture; one relating zeroes of higher normal function to the spectra of operators of genus one curves, the other connecting integral regulators of $K_2$-classes on mirror curves to dilogarithm values at algebraic arguments. We now show that the latter continues to hold in the presence of a mass parameter, thus expanding the range of the conjecture.</description>
