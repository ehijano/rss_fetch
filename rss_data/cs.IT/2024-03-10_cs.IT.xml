      <title>Near Field Communications for DMA-NOMA Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A novel near-field transmission framework is proposed for dynamic metasurface antenna (DMA)-enabled non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) networks. The base station (BS) exploits the hybrid beamforming to communicate with multiple near users (NUs) and far users (FUs) using the NOMA principle. Based on this framework, two novel beamforming schemes are proposed. 1) For the case of the grouped users distributed in the same direction, a beam-steering scheme is developed. The metric of beam pattern error (BPE) is introduced for the characterization of the gap between the hybrid beamformers and the desired ideal beamformers, where a two-layer algorithm is proposed to minimize BPE by optimizing hybrid beamformers. Then, the optimal power allocation strategy is obtained to maximize the sum achievable rate of the network. 2) For the case of users randomly distributed, a beam-splitting scheme is proposed, where two sub-beamformers are extracted from the single beamformer to serve different users in the same group. An alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed for hybrid beamformer optimization, and the optimal power allocation is also derived. Numerical results validate that: 1) the proposed beamforming schemes exhibit superior performance compared with the existing imperfect-resolution-based beamforming scheme; 2) the communication rate of the proposed transmission framework is sensitive to the imperfect distance knowledge of NUs but not to that of FUs.</description>

      <title>RIS-empowered Topology Control for Distributed Learning in Urban Air Mobility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05133v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban Air Mobility (UAM) expands vehicles from the ground to the near-ground space, envisioned as a revolution for transportation systems. Comprehensive scene perception is the foundation for autonomous aerial driving. However, UAM encounters the intelligent perception challenge: high perception learning requirements conflict with the limited sensors and computing chips of flying cars. To overcome the challenge, federated learning (FL) and other collaborative learning have been proposed to enable resource-limited devices to conduct onboard deep learning (DL) collaboratively. But traditional collaborative learning like FL relies on a central integrator for DL model aggregation, which is difficult to deploy in dynamic environments. The fully decentralized learning schemes may be the intuitive solution while the convergence of distributed learning cannot be guaranteed. Accordingly, this paper explores reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) empowered distributed learning, taking account of topological attributes to facilitate the learning performance with convergence guarantee. We propose several FL topological criteria for optimizing the transmission delay and convergence rate by exploiting the Laplacian matrix eigenvalues of the communication network. Subsequently, we innovatively leverage the RIS link modification ability to remold the current network according to the proposed topological criteria. This paper rethinks the functions of RIS from the perspective of the network layer. Furthermore, a deep deterministic policy gradient-based RIS phase shift control algorithm is developed to construct or deconstruct the network links simultaneously to reshape the communication network. Simulation experiments are conducted over MobileNet-based multi-view learning to verify the efficiency of the distributed FL framework.</description>

      <title>GAN-based Massive MIMO Channel Model Trained on Measured Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wireless channel models are a commonly used tool for the development of wireless telecommunication systems and standards. The currently prevailing geometry-based stochastic channel models (GSCMs) were manually specified for certain environments in a manual process requiring extensive domain knowledge, on the basis of channel measurement campaigns. By taking into account the stochastic distribution of certain channel properties like Rician k-factor, path loss or delay spread, they model the distribution of channel realizations. Instead of this manual process, a generative machine learning model like a generative adversarial network (GAN) may be used to automatically learn the distribution of channel statistics. Subsequently, the GAN's generator may be viewed as a channel model that can replace conventional stochastic or raytracer-based models. We propose a GAN architecture for a massive MIMO channel model, and train it on measurement data produced by a distributed massive MIMO channel sounder.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Difference-of-Convex Solver for Privacy Funnel</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04778</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04778v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose an efficient solver for the privacy funnel (PF) method, leveraging its difference-of-convex (DC) structure. The proposed DC separation results in a closed-form update equation, which allows straightforward application to both known and unknown distribution settings. For known distribution case, we prove the convergence (local stationary points) of the proposed non-greedy solver, and empirically show that it outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches in characterizing the privacy-utility trade-off. The insights of our DC approach apply to unknown distribution settings where labeled empirical samples are available instead. Leveraging the insights, our alternating minimization solver satisfies the fundamental Markov relation of PF in contrast to previous variational inference-based solvers. Empirically, we evaluate the proposed solver with MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets. Our results show that under a comparable reconstruction quality, an adversary suffers from higher prediction error from clustering our compressed codes than that with the compared methods. Most importantly, our solver is independent to private information in inference phase contrary to the baselines.</description>

      <title>Poly-View Contrastive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.05490v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Contrastive learning typically matches pairs of related views among a number of unrelated negative views. Views can be generated (e.g. by augmentations) or be observed. We investigate matching when there are more than two related views which we call poly-view tasks, and derive new representation learning objectives using information maximization and sufficient statistics. We show that with unlimited computation, one should maximize the number of related views, and with a fixed compute budget, it is beneficial to decrease the number of unique samples whilst increasing the number of views of those samples. In particular, poly-view contrastive models trained for 128 epochs with batch size 256 outperform SimCLR trained for 1024 epochs at batch size 4096 on ImageNet1k, challenging the belief that contrastive models require large batch sizes and many training epochs.</description>

      <title>User Association and Resource Allocation in Large Language Model Based Mobile Edge Computing System over 6G Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17872v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving landscape of large language models (LLMs) and mobile edge computing for 6G, the need for efficient service delivery to mobile users with constrained computational resources has become paramount. Addressing this, our paper delves into a collaborative framework for model training where user data and model adapters are shared with servers to optimize performance. Within this framework, users initially update the first several layers of the adapters while freezing the other layers of them, leveraging their local datasets. Once this step is complete, these partially trained parameters are transmitted to servers. The servers, equipped with more robust computational capabilities, then update the subsequent layers. After this training, they send the enhanced parameters back to the users. This collaborative training approach ensures that mobile users with limited computational capacities can still benefit from advanced LLM services without being burdened by exhaustive computations. Central to our methodology is the DASHF algorithm, which encapsulates the Dinkelbach algorithm, alternating optimization, semidefinite relaxation (SDR), the Hungarian method, and a pioneering fractional programming technique from a recent IEEE JSAC paper [1]. The crux of DASHF is its capability to reformulate an optimization problem as Quadratically Constrained Quadratic Programming (QCQP) via meticulously crafted transformations, making it solvable by SDR and the Hungarian algorithm. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the DASHF algorithm, offering significant insights for the advancement of collaborative LLM service deployments.</description>

      <title>Importance Matching Lemma for Lossy Compression with Side Information</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02609v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose two extensions to existing importance sampling based methods for lossy compression. First, we introduce an importance sampling based compression scheme that is a variant of ordered random coding (Theis and Ahmed, 2022) and is amenable to direct evaluation of the achievable compression rate for a finite number of samples. Our second and major contribution is the importance matching lemma, which is a finite proposal counterpart of the recently introduced Poisson matching lemma (Li and Anantharam, 2021). By integrating with deep learning, we provide a new coding scheme for distributed lossy compression with side information at the decoder. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme through experiments involving synthetic Gaussian sources, distributed image compression with MNIST and vertical federated learning with CIFAR-10.</description>

      <title>Settling the Sample Complexity of Model-Based Offline Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.05275v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper is concerned with offline reinforcement learning (RL), which learns using pre-collected data without further exploration. Effective offline RL would be able to accommodate distribution shift and limited data coverage. However, prior algorithms or analyses either suffer from suboptimal sample complexities or incur high burn-in cost to reach sample optimality, thus posing an impediment to efficient offline RL in sample-starved applications.
  We demonstrate that the model-based (or "plug-in") approach achieves minimax-optimal sample complexity without burn-in cost for tabular Markov decision processes (MDPs). Concretely, consider a finite-horizon (resp. $\gamma$-discounted infinite-horizon) MDP with $S$ states and horizon $H$ (resp. effective horizon $\frac{1}{1-\gamma}$), and suppose the distribution shift of data is reflected by some single-policy clipped concentrability coefficient $C^{\star}_{\text{clipped}}$. We prove that model-based offline RL yields $\varepsilon$-accuracy with a sample complexity of \[ \begin{cases} \frac{H^{4}SC_{\text{clipped}}^{\star}}{\varepsilon^{2}} &amp; (\text{finite-horizon MDPs}) \frac{SC_{\text{clipped}}^{\star}}{(1-\gamma)^{3}\varepsilon^{2}} &amp; (\text{infinite-horizon MDPs}) \end{cases} \] up to log factor, which is minimax optimal for the entire $\varepsilon$-range. The proposed algorithms are "pessimistic" variants of value iteration with Bernstein-style penalties, and do not require sophisticated variance reduction. Our analysis framework is established upon delicate leave-one-out decoupling arguments in conjunction with careful self-bounding techniques tailored to MDPs.</description>

      <title>Likelihood-free hypothesis testing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2211.01126v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Consider the problem of binary hypothesis testing. Given $Z$ coming from either $\mathbb P^{\otimes m}$ or $\mathbb Q^{\otimes m}$, to decide between the two with small probability of error it is sufficient, and in many cases necessary, to have $m\asymp1/\epsilon^2$, where $\epsilon$ measures the separation between $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$ in total variation ($\mathsf{TV}$). Achieving this, however, requires complete knowledge of the distributions and can be done, for example, using the Neyman-Pearson test. In this paper we consider a variation of the problem which we call likelihood-free hypothesis testing, where access to $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$ is given through $n$ i.i.d. observations from each. In the case when $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$ are assumed to belong to a non-parametric family, we demonstrate the existence of a fundamental trade-off between $n$ and $m$ given by $nm\asymp n_\sf{GoF}^2(\epsilon)$, where $n_\sf{GoF}(\epsilon)$ is the minimax sample complexity of testing between the hypotheses $H_0:\, \mathbb P=\mathbb Q$ vs $H_1:\, \mathsf{TV}(\mathbb P,\mathbb Q)\geq\epsilon$. We show this for three families of distributions, in addition to the family of all discrete distributions for which we obtain a more complicated trade-off exhibiting an additional phase-transition. Our results demonstrate the possibility of testing without fully estimating $\mathbb P$ and $\mathbb Q$, provided $m \gg 1/\epsilon^2$.</description>

Abstract: This note considers the unstructured sparse recovery problems in a general form. Examples include rational approximation, spectral function estimation, Fourier inversion, Laplace inversion, and sparse deconvolution. The main challenges are the noise in the sample values and the unstructured nature of the sample locations. This note proposes the eigenmatrix, a data-driven construction with desired approximate eigenvalues and eigenvectors. The eigenmatrix offers a new way for these sparse recovery problems. Numerical results are provided to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.</description>

      <title>Advancing Deep Active Learning &amp; Data Subset Selection: Unifying Principles with Information-Theory Intuitions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.04305v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: At its core, this thesis aims to enhance the practicality of deep learning by improving the label and training efficiency of deep learning models. To this end, we investigate data subset selection techniques, specifically active learning and active sampling, grounded in information-theoretic principles. Active learning improves label efficiency, while active sampling enhances training efficiency. Supervised deep learning models often require extensive training with labeled data. Label acquisition can be expensive and time-consuming, and training large models is resource-intensive, hindering the adoption outside academic research and "big tech." Existing methods for data subset selection in deep learning often rely on heuristics or lack a principled information-theoretic foundation. In contrast, this thesis examines several objectives for data subset selection and their applications within deep learning, striving for a more principled approach inspired by information theory. We begin by disentangling epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty in single forward-pass deep neural networks, which provides helpful intuitions and insights into different forms of uncertainty and their relevance for data subset selection. We then propose and investigate various approaches for active learning and data subset selection in (Bayesian) deep learning. Finally, we relate various existing and proposed approaches to approximations of information quantities in weight or prediction space. Underpinning this work is a principled and practical notation for information-theoretic quantities that includes both random variables and observed outcomes. This thesis demonstrates the benefits of working from a unified perspective and highlights the potential impact of our contributions to the practical application of deep learning.</description>

      <title>Bayes Conditional Distribution Estimation for Knowledge Distillation Based on Conditional Mutual Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It is believed that in knowledge distillation (KD), the role of the teacher is to provide an estimate for the unknown Bayes conditional probability distribution (BCPD) to be used in the student training process. Conventionally, this estimate is obtained by training the teacher using maximum log-likelihood (MLL) method. To improve this estimate for KD, in this paper we introduce the concept of conditional mutual information (CMI) into the estimation of BCPD and propose a novel estimator called the maximum CMI (MCMI) method. Specifically, in MCMI estimation, both the log-likelihood and CMI of the teacher are simultaneously maximized when the teacher is trained. Through Eigen-CAM, it is further shown that maximizing the teacher's CMI value allows the teacher to capture more contextual information in an image cluster. Via conducting a thorough set of experiments, we show that by employing a teacher trained via MCMI estimation rather than one trained via MLL estimation in various state-of-the-art KD frameworks, the student's classification accuracy consistently increases, with the gain of up to 3.32\%. This suggests that the teacher's BCPD estimate provided by MCMI method is more accurate than that provided by MLL method. In addition, we show that such improvements in the student's accuracy are more drastic in zero-shot and few-shot settings. Notably, the student's accuracy increases with the gain of up to 5.72\% when 5\% of the training samples are available to the student (few-shot), and increases from 0\% to as high as 84\% for an omitted class (zero-shot).
