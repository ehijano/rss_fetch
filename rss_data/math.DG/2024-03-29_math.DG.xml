      <title>Type problem, the first eigenvalue and Hardy inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19086</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19086v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the relationship between the type problem and the asymptotic behaviour of the first (Dirichlet) eigenvalues $\lambda_1(B_r)$ of ``balls'' $B_r:=\{\rho&lt;r\}$ on a complete Riemannian manifold $M$ as $r\rightarrow +\infty$, where $\rho$ is a Lipschitz continuous exhaustion function with $|\nabla\rho|\leq1$ a.e. on $M$. We obtain several sharp results. First, if for all $r&gt;r_0$ \[ r^2 \lambda_1(B_r)\ge \gamma&gt;0, \] we obtain a sharp estimate of the volume growth: $|B_r|\ge cr^{\mu(\gamma)}.$ Moreover when $\gamma&gt;j_0^2\approx 5.784$, where $j_0$ denotes the first positive zero of the Bessel function $J_0$, then $M$ is hyperbolic and we have a Hardy type inequality. In the case where $r_0=0$, a sharp Hardy type inequality holds. These spectral conditions are satisfied if one assumes that $\Delta\rho^2\geq2\mu(\gamma)&gt;0$. In particular, when $\inf_M\Delta\rho^2&gt;4$, $M$ is hyperbolic and we get a sharp Hardy type inequality. Related results for finite volume case are also studied.</description>

      <title>Bertrand types of regular curves and Bertrand framed curves in the Euclidean 3-space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A Bertrand (respectively, Mannheim) curve is a space curve whose principal normal line is the same as the principal normal (respectively, bi-normal) line of another curve. By definition, another curve is a parallel curve with respect to the direction of the principal normal vector. In this paper, we consider the other cases, that is, a space curve whose tangent (or, principal normal, bi-normal) line is the same as the tangent (or, principal normal, bi-normal) line of another curve, respectively. We say that a Bertrand type curve if there exists such another curve. We clarify that the existence conditions of Bertrand type curves in all cases. There are times when the Bertrand type curve does not exist. On the other hand, since the another curve may have singular points, we also consider curves with singular points. As smooth curves with singular points, it is useful to use the framed curves in the Euclidean space. Then we define and investigate Bertrand framed curves. We also clarify that the existence conditions of the Bertrand framed curves in all cases.</description>

      <title>Static Manifolds with Boundary and Rigidity of Scalar Curvature and Mean Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On a compact manifold with boundary, the map consisting of the scalar curvature in the interior and the mean curvature on the boundary is a local surjection at generic metrics. Moreover, this result may be localized to compact subdomains in an arbitrary Riemannian manifold with boundary. The non-generic case (also called non-generic domains) corresponds to static manifolds with boundary. We discuss their geometric properties, which also work as the necessary conditions of non-generic metrics. In space forms and the Schwarzschild manifold, we classify simple non-generic domains (with only one boundary component) and show their connection with rigidity theorems and the Schwarzschild photon sphere.</description>

      <title>On potentials whose level sets are orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A level orbit of a mechanical Hamiltonian system is a solution of Newton equation that is contained in a level set of the potential energy. In 2003, Mark Levi asked for a characterization of the smooth potential energy functions on the plane with the property that any point on the plane lies on a level orbit; we call such functions Levi potentials. The basic examples are the radial monotone increasing smooth functions. In this paper we show that any Levi potential that is analytic or has totally path-disconnected critical set must be radial. Nevertheless, we show that every compact convex subset of the plane is the critical set of a Levi potential. A crucial observation for these theorems is that, outside the critical set, the family of level sets of a Levi potential forms a solution of the inverse curvature flow.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19481v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this note we describe basic geometric properties of p-harmonic forms and p-coclosed forms and use them to reprove vanishing theorems of Pansu and new injectivity theorems for the Lp -cohomology of simply connected, pinched negatively curved manifolds. We also provide a partial resolution of a conjecture of Gromov on the vanishing of Lp -cohomology on symmetric spaces.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove the Skoda-Zeriahi type integrability theorem with respect to some measure with $L^1$-density. In addition, we introduce the log-log threshold in order to detect singularities of K\"{a}hler potentials. We prove the positivity of the integrability threshold for such a measure and K\"{a}hler potentials with uniform log-log threshold. As an application, we prove the entropy compactness theorem for a family of potential functions of Poincar\'{e} type K\"{a}hler metrics with uniform log-log threshold. The Ohsawa-Takegoshi $L^2$-extension theorem and Skoda-Zeriahi's integrability theorem play a very important role in this paper.</description>

      <title>Four-dimensional gradient Ricci solitons with (half) nonnegative isotropic curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This is a sequel to our paper [24], in which we investigated the geometry of 4-dimensional gradient shrinking Ricci solitons with half positive (nonnegative) isotropic curvature. In this paper, we mainly focus on 4-dimensional gradient steady Ricci solitons with nonnegative isotropic curvature (WPIC) or half nonnegative isotropic curvature (half WPIC). In particular, for $4$D complete {\it ancient solutions} with WPIC, we are able to prove the nonnegativity of the Ricci curvature $Rc\geq 0$ and bound the curvature tensor $Rm$ by $|Rm| \leq R$. For 4D gradient steady solitons with WPIC, we obtain a classification result. We also give a partial classification of 4D gradient steady Ricci solitons with half WPIC. Moreover, we obtain a preliminary classification result for 4D complete gradient {\it expanding Ricci solitons} with WPIC. Finally, motivated by the recent work [60], we improve our earlier results in [24] on 4D gradient {\it shrinking Ricci solitons} with half PIC or half WPIC, and also provide a characterization of complete gradient K\"ahler-Ricci shrinkers in complex dimension two among 4-dimensional gradient Ricci shrinkers.</description>

      <title>Existence of a global fundamental solution for H\"ormander operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.19619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.19619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for a simply connected manifold $M$ - and a vast class of non-simply connected manifolds - the existence of a fundamental solution for a differential operator $\mathcal L=\sum_{\alpha\in\mathbb N^q} r_\alpha\cdot X^\alpha$ of finite degree over $M$, follows via a saturation method from the existence of a fundamental solution for the associated "lifted" operator over a group $G$. Given some smooth complete vector fields $X_1,\dots, X_q$ on $M$, suppose that they generate a finite dimensional Lie algebra $\mathfrak g$ satisfying the H\"ormander's condition. The simply connected Lie group $G$ is the unique such that $\mbox{Lie}(G)\cong\mathfrak g$. It has the property that a right $G$-action exists over $M$, faithful and transitive, inducing a natural projection $E\colon G\to M$. We generalize an approach developed by Biagi and Bonfiglioli. In particular we represent the group $G$ as a direct product $M\times G^z$ where the model fiber $G^z$ has a group structure. Our approach doesn't need any nilpotency hypothesis on the group $G$, therefore it broadens the spectrum of cases where techniques of the kind "lifting and approximation", as those introduce by the works of Rothschild, Stein, Goodman, can be applied.</description>

      <title>The relative isoperimetric inequality for minimal submanifolds with free boundary in the Euclidean space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.00914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2002.00914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we mainly consider the relative isoperimetric inequalities for minimal submanifolds with free boundary. We first generalize ideas of restricted normal cones introduced by Choe-Ghomi-Ritor\'e in \cite{CGR06} and obtain an optimal area estimate for generalized restricted normal cones. This area estimate, together with the ABP method of Cabr\'e in \cite{Cabre2008}, provides a new proof of the relative isoperimetric inequality obtained by Choe-Ghomi-Ritor\'e in \cite{CGR07}. Furthermore, we use this estimate and the idea of Brendle in his recent work \cite{Brendle2019} to obtain a relative isoperimetric inequality for minimal submanifolds with free boundary on a convex support surface in $\mathbb{R}^{n+m}$, which is optimal and gives an affirmative answer to an open problem proposed by Choe in \cite{Choe2005}, Open Problem 12.6, when the codimension $m\leq 2$.</description>

      <title>Higher Complex Structures and Flat Connections</title>

      <description>arXiv:2005.14445v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2018, Vladimir Fock and the author introduced a geometric structure on surfaces, called higher complex structure, whose moduli space shares several properties with Hitchin's component. In this paper, we establish various links between flat connections and higher complex structures.
  In particular, we study a certain class of connections on a bundle equipped with a line subbundle $L$, which we call $L$-parabolic. The curvature of these connections is of rank 1. A certain family of $L$-parabolic connections is parametrized by the data of a higher complex structure and a cotangent variation. The family of connections being flat implies the compatibility condition of the cotangent variation. Higher diffeomorphisms are realized by the gauge transformation induced by changing $L$. Constructing flat families of connections of this kind is linked to Toda integrable systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17604v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove a uniqueness result for the broken ray transform acting on the sums of functions and $1$-forms on surfaces in the presence of an external force and a reflecting obstacle. We assume that the considered twisted geodesic flows have nonpositive curvature. The broken rays are generated from the twisted geodesic flows by the law of reflection on the boundary of a suitably convex obstacle. Our work generalizes recent results for the broken geodesic ray transform on surfaces to more general families of curves including the magnetic flows and Gaussian thermostats.</description>

We study fundamental geometric properties of curves under this transformation. Moreover, utilizing natural geometric constructions, we employ the approach for intrinsic comparison within several classes of surfaces and augmented curves, which arise in the real world applications such as tubes, ruled surfaces, spherical strips, protein molecules and hurricane tracks.</description>

      <title>On microlocalisation and the construction of Feynman Propagators for normally hyperbolic operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.09767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2012.09767v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article gives global microlocalisation constructions for normally hyperbolic operators on a vector bundle over a globally hyperbolic spacetime in geometric terms. As an application, this is used to generalise the Duistermaat-H\"{o}rmander construction of Feynman propagators, therefore incorporating the most important non-scalar geometric operators. It is shown that for normally hyperbolic operators that are selfadjoint with respect to a hermitian bundle metric, the Feynman propagators can be constructed to satisfy a positivity property that reflects the existence of Hadamard states in quantum field theory on curved spacetimes. We also give a more direct construction of the Feynman propagators for Dirac-type operators on a globally hyperbolic spacetime. Even though the natural bundle metric on spinors is not positive-definite, in this case, we can give a direct microlocal construction of a Feynman propagator that satisfies positivity.</description>

      <title>On $1/2$ estimate for global Newlander-Nirenberg theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.02215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.02215v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a formally integrable almost complex structure $X$ defined on the closure of a bounded domain $D \subset \mathbb C^n$, and provided that $X$ is sufficiently close to the standard complex structure, the global Newlander-Nirenberg problem asks whether there exists a global diffeomorphism defined on $\overline D$ that transforms $X$ into the standard complex structure, under certain geometric and regularity assumptions on $D$. In this paper we prove a quantitative result of this problem. Assuming $D$ is a strictly pseudoconvex domain in $\mathbb C^n$ with $C^2$ boundary, and that the almost structure $X$ is of the H\"older-Zygmund class $\Lambda^r(\overline D)$ for $r&gt;\frac{3}{2}$, we prove the existence of a global diffeomorphism (independent of $r$) in the class $\Lambda^{r+\frac12-\varepsilon}(\overline D)$, for any $\varepsilon&gt;0$.</description>

      <title>The geometric constraints on Filippov algebroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04180v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Filippov n-algebroids are introduced by Grabowski and Marmo as a natural generalization of Lie algebroids. On this note, we characterized Filippov n-algebroid structures by considering certain multi-input connections, which we called Filippov connections, on the underlying vector bundle. Through this approach, we could express the n-ary bracket of any Filippov n-algebroid using a torsion-free type formula. Additionally, we transformed the generalized Jacobi identity of the Filippov n-algebroid into the Bianchi-Filippov identity. Furthermore, in the case of rank n vector bundles, we provided a characterization of linear Nambu-Poisson structures using Filippov connections.</description>
