      <title>The $cd$-index of base polytopes for connected split matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05250v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the $cd$-index $\Psi_{cd}$ of matroid base polytopes $\mathscr{P}(M)$ for a large family of matroids $M$. The $cd$-index is a polynomial in two non-commutative variables that compactly encodes the count of face flags $\mathcal{F} = \{\sigma_1 \subset \dots \subset \sigma_s \}$ with prescribed $\dim \sigma_i = d_i$. This comprises the $f$-vector of $\mathscr{P}(M)$, which recently Ferroni and Schr\"oter treated as an almost-valuative invariant; i.e. a valuative part plus an error term. We initiate a similar program for $\Psi_{cd}(\mathscr{P}(M))$ and show that for an elementary split matroid $M$ the error term in the computation of $\Psi_{cd}(\mathscr{P}(M))$ surprisingly depends only on modular pairs of cyclic flats.
  This allows us to implement computations requiring only the counts $\lambda(r,h)$ and $\mu(\alpha,\beta,a,b)$ of cyclic flats and modular pairs of cyclic flats, respectively, that fulfill some rank and cardinality conditions. We illustrate the methods with sparse paving matroids.</description>

      <title>Eventually constant maps for two sets and nilpotent pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05269</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05269v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a bijective correspondence between the number of nilpotent matrices over a Boolean semiring and the number of directed acyclic graphs on ordered vertices. We then enumerate pairs of maps between two finite sets whose composites are eventually constant by forming a bijection that relates a pair of such maps with a spanning tree in a complete bipartite graph, and an edge of said tree. This generalizes the main principle of A. Joyal's proof of Cayley's formula. Finally, we generalize T. Leinster's work by considering a pair of finite-dimensional vector spaces and show a bijectivity between a nilpotent pair of maps and a balanced vector with the hom spaces between them. This leads us to an elegant formula for the number of nilpotent pairs.</description>

      <title>On Matsushita $\pi_1^2$ discrete fundamental groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05302</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05302v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Matsushita fundamental groups of a graph $X$, denoted $\pi_1^r(X)$, are certain discrete versions of the fundamental group for topological spaces. For $r=2$, these groups have a nice combinatorial description, due to Sankar. In this paper we prove two results about $\pi_1^2$. First, we prove a Seifert-van Kampen-type theorem. Similar results have previously been obtained by Barcelo, et al. (and strengthened by Kapulkin and Mavinkurve) for a different notion of discrete fundamental group. Second, we prove that an arbitrary group $G$ can be realized as $\pi_1^2(X)$ for some graph $X$. Our construction works equally well for the aforementioned alternate discrete fundamental group, and our second result thus generalizes a theorem of Kapulkin and Mavinkurve which applies only to finitely presented groups $G$.</description>

      <title>Indecomposability and beyond via the graph of edge dependencies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05307</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05307v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A polytope is called indecomposable if it cannot be expressed (non-trivially) as a Minkowski sum of other polytopes. Since the concept was introduced by Gale in 1954, several increasingly strong criteria have been developed to characterize indecomposability. Our first contribution is a new indecomposability criterion that unifies and generalizes most of the previous techniques. The key new ingredient of our method is the introduction of the graph of (implicit) edge dependencies, which has broader applications in the study of deformation cones of polytopes, beyond indecomposability. One of our main applications is providing new indecomposable deformed permutahedra that are not matroid polytopes. In 1970, Edmonds posed the problem of characterizing the extreme rays of the submodular cone, that is, indecomposable deformed permutahedra. Matroid polytopes from connected matroids give one such family of polytopes. We provide a new infinite disjoint family by taking certain graphical zonotopes and deeply truncating 1 or 2 specific vertices. In this way, we construct $2 \lfloor\frac{n-1}{2}\rfloor$ new indecomposable deformations of the $n$-permutahedron in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We also showcase other applications of our tools. For example, we use them to refute a conjecture by Smilansky (1987) stating that an indecomposable polytope needs to have few vertices with respect to its number of facets. We provide bounds on the dimension of deformation cones and characterize certain of their rays, we introduce parallelogramic Minkowski sums whose deformation cone can be written as a product of deformation cones, and we construct indecomposable polytopes via truncations and stackings.</description>

      <title>The $k$-core of a graph and its high-order spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The $k$-core of a graph is its largest subgraph with minimum degree at least $k$, a fundamental concept for uncovering hierarchical structures. In this paper, we establish a connection between the $k$-core and the high-order spectra of graphs, a concept originally introduced by Cvetkovi\'{c}, Doob, and Sachs. Specifically, we consider the high-order spectra defined via the $k$-adjacency tensor. Within this framework, we prove that a graph admits a non-empty $k$-core if and only if the spectral radius of the $k$-adjacency tensor is greater than or equal to $1$. Moreover, when the $k$-core exists, vertices corresponding to positive entries in the Perron vector of the $k$-adjacency tensor belong to the $k$-core. We thus define the $k$-order eigenvector centrality via the Perron vector, which provides both membership identification and a measure of relative influence within the $k$-core. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical findings and illustrate the properties of this centrality measure in some real-world networks.</description>

      <title>Universality of asymptotic graph homomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Shannon capacity of graphs, introduced by Shannon in 1956 to model zero-error communication, asks for determining the rate of growth of independent sets in strong powers of graphs. Much is still unknown about this parameter, for instance whether it is computable. Recent work has established a dual characterization of the Shannon capacity in terms of the asymptotic spectrum of graphs. A core step in this duality theory is to shift focus from Shannon capacity itself to studying the asymptotic relations between graphs, that is, the asymptotic cohomomorphisms. Towards understanding the structure of Shannon capacity, we study the "combinatorial complexity" of asymptotic cohomomorphism. As our main result, we prove that the asymptotic cohomomorphism order is universal for all countable preorders. That is, we prove that any countable preorder can be order-embedded into the asymptotic cohomomorphism order (i.e. appears as a suborder). Previously this was only known for (non-asymptotic) cohomomorphism. Our proof is based on techniques from asymptotic spectrum duality and convex structure of the asymptotic spectrum of graphs. Our approach in fact leads to a new proof of the universality of (non-asymptotic) cohomomorphism.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given positive integers $k$ and $n$, we present methods to construct all groups of order at most $n$ that contain a Cayley set of size $k$, and to enumerate the Cayley sets of order $k$ in a given group, up to the action of the automorphism group. We use these methods to generate complete lists of pairwise nonisomorphic 3-valent Cayley graphs with at most 5000 vertices and 4-valent Cayley graphs with at most 1025 vertices.</description>

      <title>On the Word-Representability of 5-Regular Circulant Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph $G = (V, E)$ is word-representable if there exists a word $w$ over the alphabet $V$ such that, for any two distinct vertices $x, y \in V$, $xy \in E$ if and only if $x$ and $y$ alternate in $w$. Two letters $x$ and $y$ are said to alternate in $w$ if, after removing all other letters from $w$, the resulting word is of the form $xyxy\dots$ or $yxyx\dots$ (of even or odd length). For a given set $R = \{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_k\}$ of jump elements, an undirected circulant graph $C_n(R)$ on $n$ vertices has vertex set $\{0, 1, \dots, n-1\}$ and edge set $ E = \left\{ \{i,j\} \;\middle|\; |i - j| \bmod n \in \{r_1, r_2, \dots, r_k\} \right\}, $ where $0 &lt; r_1 &lt; r_2 &lt; \dots &lt; r_k &lt; \frac{n}{2}$. Recently, Kitaev and Pyatkin proved that every 4-regular circulant graph is word-representable. Srinivasan and Hariharasubramanian further investigated circulant graphs and obtained bounds on the representation number for $k$-regular circulant graphs with $2 \le k \le 4$. In addition to these positive results, their work also presents examples of non-word-representable circulant graphs. In this work, we study word-representability and the representation number of 5-regular circulant graphs via techniques from elementary number theory and group theory, as well as graph coloring, graph factorization and morphisms.</description>

      <title>On $\overrightarrow{C_{n}}$-irregular oriented graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $F$ and $G$ be simple finite oriented graphs (without symmetric arcs). A graph $G$ is called $F$-irregular if any two distinct vertices in $G$ belong to a different number of subgraphs of $G$ isomorphic to $F$. In this paper, we investigate the problem of the existence of $\overrightarrow{C_n}$-irregular graphs, where $\overrightarrow{C_n}$ is an oriented circle of order $n$ (a strongly connected oriented graph that is formed from a simple undirected cycle $C_n$ on $n$ vertices by orienting each of its edges).
  For every integer $n \ge 3$, we prove that there exists an infinite family of $\overrightarrow{C_n}$-irregular graphs. In addition, we show that the order of a non-trivial $\overrightarrow{C_3}$-irregular graph can be any integer not less than $10$ and nothing else. We also construct $\overrightarrow{C_4}$-irregular graphs of any order starting from $7$ and prove that there is no non-trivial $\overrightarrow{C_4}$-irregular graph of order less than $7$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05577v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a complete classification of edge-to-edge tilings of the sphere by regular polygons under a unified framework. Without assuming convexity of the tiles or polyhedrality of the underlying graph, our proof is independent of the Johnson-Zalgaller classification of solids with regular faces (1967), which took over 200 pages. We apply a blend of trigonometric, algebraic and combinatorial tools of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Seaweed algebras with restricted part sizes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Seaweed algebras are a class of Lie algebras that are naturally characterized by a pair of compositions, which in turn are represented visually as planar graphs called meanders. These meanders provide a straightforward method for computing the index of the associated algebra. The goal of this paper is to enumerate those seaweed algebras with a fixed index and whose associated compositions have restricted part sizes. In particular, we enumerate those with composition part sizes from so-called acyclic sets. We also establish a bijection between sets of indecomposable seaweed algebras with meanders with certain restricted part sizes and sets of permutations with restricted displacements. In certain cases, the index of the algebra can be determined by a simple statistic on the permutation.</description>

      <title>A poset representation for stable contracts in a two-sided market generated by integer choice functions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing a variety of earlier problems on stable contracts in two-sided markets, Alkan and Gale introduced in 2003 a general stability model on a bipartite graph $G=(V,E)$ in which the vertices are interpreted as ``agents'', and the edges as possible ``contract'' between pairs of ``agents''. The edges are endowed with nonnegative capacities $b$ giving upper bounds on ``contract intensities'', and the preferencies of each ``agent'' $v\in V$ depend on a \emph{choice function} (CFs) that acts on the set of ``contracts'' involving $v$, obeying three well motivated axioms of \it{consistence}, \it{substitutability} and \it{cardinal monotonicity}. In their model, the capacities and choice functions can take reals or discrete values and, extending well-known earlier results on particular cases, they proved that systems of \it{stable} contracts always exist and, moreover, their set $\cal S$ constitutes a distributive lattice under a natural comparison relation $\prec$.
  In this paper, we study Alkan--Gale's model when all capacities and choice functions take integer values. We characterize the set of rotations -- augmenting cycles linking neighboring stable assignments in the lattice $(\cal S,\prec)$, and construct a weighted poset in which the lattice the closed functions is isomorphic to $(\cal S,\prec)$, thus obtaining an explicit representation for the latter. We show that in general the size of the poset is at most $b^{\rm max}|E|$, where $b^{\rm max}$ is the maximal capacity, and the poset can be constructed in pseudo polynomial time. Then we explain that by imposing an additional condition on CFs, the size of the poset becomes polynomial in $|V|$, and the total time reduces to a polynomial in $|V|,\log b^{\rm max}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05376v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $t$-connected ideal of a graph $G$ is generated by all connected induced subgraphs of $G$ with $t$ vertices. When $t = 2$, this coincides with the usual edge ideal of the graph. Following the work of Faridi et al., we give a classification of the graphs whose $t$-connected ideals are minimally resolved by their Scarf complex. We also consider the $t$-path ideal of a graph $G$ which is the ideal generated by all paths of length $t$ in $G$. In this case, we are able to give a classification of the same type for paths of length $t = 4$.</description>

Abstract: The celebrated theorem of Kechris, Pestov and Todor\v{c}evi\'c connecting structural Ramsey theory with topological dynamics has as a consequence that the Fra\"{\i}ss\'e limit of a Ramsey class of non-trivial finite relational structures has a reduct which is a total order; this implies an earlier result of Ne\v{s}et\v{r}il, according to which the structures in such a class are rigid (have trivial automorphism groups). In this paper, we give an alternative proof of this fact. If $\mathcal{C}$ is a Fra\"{\i}ss\'e class of rigid structures over a finite relational language, then either the Fra\"{\i}ss\'e limit of $\mathcal{C}$ has a reduct which is a total order, or there is an explicit failure of the Ramsey property involving a pair $(A,B)$ of structures in $\mathcal{C}$ with $|A|=2$.</description>

Abstract: We study monotone paths in Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs on numbered vertices. Benjamini &amp; Tzalik established a phase transition at $p = \frac{\log n}{n}$ for this model. We refine the critical value to $p = \frac{\log n - \log \log n }{n}$ and identify the critical window of order $\Theta(1/n)$.</description>

      <title>Critical behaviour of the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on planar triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05867v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on planar triangulations. This model is also bijectively equivalent to the Fortuin--Kasteleyn model of planar maps with parameter $q\in (0,4)$ at its self-dual point. These have been traditionally studied using either techniques from analytic combinatorics (based in particular on the gasket decomposition of Borot, Bouttier and Guitter arXiv:1106.0153) or probabilistic arguments (based on Sheffield's hamburger-cheeseburger bijection arXiv:1108.2241). In this paper we establish a dictionary relating quantities of interest in both approaches. This has several consequences. First, we derive an exact expression for the partition function of the fully packed loop-$O(n)$ model on triangulations, as a function of the outer boundary length. This confirms predictions by Gaudin and Kostov. In particular, this model exhibits critical behaviour, in the sense that the partition function exhibits a power-law decay characteristic of the critical regime at this self-dual point. This can be thought of as the planar map analogue of Nienhuis' predictions for the critical point of the loop-$O(n)$ model on the hexagonal lattice. Finally, we derive precise asymptotics for geometric features of the FK model of planar maps when $0 &lt; q &lt;4$, such as the exact tail behaviour of the perimeters of clusters and loops. This sharpens previous results of arXiv:1502.00450 and arXiv:1502.00546. A key step is to use the above dictionary and the probabilistic results to justify rigorously an ansatz commonly assumed in the analytic combinatorics literature.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.05891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The boundary of the Milnor fiber associated with a complex line arrangement is a three dimensional plumbed manifold, and it is a combinatorial invariant. We prove the reverse implication, which was conjectured N\'emethi and Szil\'ard. That is, this boundary of the Milnor fiber determines the combinatorics of the arrangement. Furthermore, we give an explicit method which constructs the poset associated with the arrangement, given a plumbing graph in normal form for the boundary.</description>

      <title>Slit-slide-sew bijections for constellations and quasiconstellations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.12141v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend so-called slit-slide-sew bijections to constellations and quasiconstellations. We present an involution on the set of hypermaps given with an orientation, one distinguished corner, and one distinguished edge leading away from the corner while oriented in the given orientation. This involution reverts the orientation, exchanges the distinguished corner with the distinguished edge in some sense, slightly modifying the degrees of the incident faces in passing, while keeping all the other faces intact.
  The construction consists in building a canonical path from the distinguished elements, slitting the map along it, and sewing back after sliding by one unit along the path. The involution specializes into a bijection interpreting combinatorial identities linking the numbers of constellations or quasiconstellations with a given face degree distribution, where the degree distributions differ by one $+1$ and one $-1$. In particular, this allows to recover the counting formula for constellations or quasiconstellations with a given face degree distribution.
  Our bijections furthermore provide an algorithm for sampling a hypermap uniformly distributed among constellations or quasiconstellations with prescribed face degrees.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.06027v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kempe equivalence is a classical and important notion on vertex coloring in graph theory. In the present paper, we introduce several ideals associated with graphs and provide a method to determine whether two $k$-colorings are Kempe equivalent via commutative algebra. Moreover, we give a way to compute all $k$-colorings of a graph up to Kempe equivalence by virtue of the algebraic technique on Gr\"{o}bner bases. As a consequence, the number of $k$-Kempe classes can be computed by using Hilbert functions. Finally, we introduce several algebraic algorithms related to Kempe equivalence.</description>

Abstract: For an $n$-tuple $s$ of non-negative integers, the $s$-weak order is a lattice structure on $s$-trees, generalizing the weak order on permutations. We first describe the join irreducible elements, the canonical join representations, and the forcing order of the $s$-weak order in terms of combinatorial objects, generalizing the arcs, the non-crossing arc diagrams, and the subarc order for the weak order. We then extend the theory of shards and shard polytopes to construct geometric realizations of the $s$-weak order and all its lattice quotients as polyhedral complexes, generalizing the quotient fans and quotientopes of the weak order.</description>

Abstract: Graph polytopes arising from vertex-weighted graphs were first introduced by B\'ona, Ju, and Yoshida. We prove a conjecture stating that for any simple connected graph, the numerator polynomial of the Ehrhart series of its graph polytope is palindromic, using Stanley's reciprocity theorem. Furthermore, we introduce hypergraph polytopes and establish that every simple, connected, unimodular hypergraph polytope is an integer polytope. Additionally, for simple connected uniform hypergraph polytopes, we demonstrate that the numerator polynomial of their Ehrhart series is palindromic.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.09832v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For a hypergraph $\mathbb{H}$ on $[n]$, the hypergraphic poset $P_\mathbb{H}$ is the transitive closure of the oriented skeleton of the hypergraphic polytope $\triangle_\mathbb{H}$ (the Minkowski sum of the standard simplices $\triangle_H$ for all $H \in \mathbb{H}$). Hypergraphic posets include the weak order for the permutahedron (when $\mathbb{H}$ is the complete graph on $[n]$) and the Tamari lattice for the associahedron (when $\mathbb{H}$ is the set of all intervals of $[n]$), which motivates the study of lattice properties of hypergraphic posets. In this paper, we focus on interval hypergraphs, where all hyperedges are intervals of $[n]$. We characterize the interval hypergraphs $\mathbb{I}$ for which $P_\mathbb{I}$ is a lattice, a distributive lattice, a semidistributive lattice, and a lattice quotient of the weak order.</description>

Abstract: 2-quasi best match graphs (2-qBMGs) are directed graphs that capture a
  notion of close relatedness in phylogenetics. Here, we investigate the
  undirected underlying graph of a 2-qBMG (un-2qBMG) and show that they
  contain neither a path $P_l$ nor a cycle $C_l$ of length $l\geq 6$ as an
  induced subgraph. This property guarantees the existence of specific
  vertex decompositions with dominating bicliques that provide further
  insights into their structure.</description>

      <title>Edge isoperimetry of lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09591v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present two results related to an edge-isoperimetric question for Cayley graphs on the integer lattice asked by Ben Barber and Joshua Erde [Isoperimetry of Integer Lattices, Discrete Analysis 7 (2018)]. For any (undirected) graph $G$, the edge boundary of a subset of vertices $S$ is the number of edges between $S$ and its complement in $G$. Barber and Erde asked whether for any Cayley graph on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, there is always an ordering of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ such that for each $n$, the first $n$ terms minimize the edge boundary among all subsets of size $n$.
  First, we present an example of a Cayley graph $G_d$ on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ (for all $d\geq 2$) for which there is no such ordering. Furthermore, we show that for all $n$ and any optimal $n$-vertex subset $S_n$ of $G_d$, there is no infinite sequence $S_n\subset S_{n+1}\subset S_{n+2}\subset\cdots$ of optimal sets $S_i$, where $|S_i|=i$ for $i\geq n$. This is to be contrasted with the positive result in $\mathbb{Z}^1$ shown by Joseph Briggs and Chris Wells [arXiv:2402.14087].
  Our second result is a positive example for the unit-length triangular lattice (which is isomorphic to $\mathbb{Z}^2$) where two vertices are connected by an edge if their distance is $1$ or $\sqrt{3}$. We show that this graph has such an ordering. This is the most complicated example known to us of a two-dimensional Cayley graph for which an ordering exists.</description>

      <title>On Supports for graphs of bounded genus</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21287v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $(X,\mathcal{E})$ be a hypergraph. A support is a graph $Q$ on $X$ such that for each $E\in\mathcal{E}$, the subgraph of $Q$ induced on the elements in $E$ is connected. We consider the problem of constructing a support for hypergraphs defined by connected subgraphs of a host graph. For a graph $G=(V,E)$, let $\mathcal{H}$ be a set of connected subgraphs of $G$. Let the vertices of $G$ be partitioned into two sets the \emph{terminals} $\mathbf{b}(V)$ and the \emph{non-terminals} $\mathbf{r}(V)$. We define a hypergraph on $\mathbf{b}(V)$, where each $H\in\mathcal{H}$ defines a hyperedge consisting of the vertices of $\mathbf{b}(V)$ in $H$.
  We also consider the problem of constructing a support for the \emph{dual hypergraph} - a hypergraph on $\mathcal{H}$ where each $v\in \mathbf{b}(V)$ defines a hyperedge consisting of the subgraphs in $\mathcal{H}$ containing $v$. In fact, we construct supports for a common generalization of the primal and dual settings called the \emph{intersection hypergraph}.
  As our main result, we show that if the host graph $G$ has bounded genus and the subgraphs in $\mathcal{H}$ satisfy a condition of being \emph{cross-free}, then there exists a support that also has bounded genus. Our results are a generalization of the results of Raman and Ray (Rajiv Raman, Saurabh Ray: Constructing Planar Support for Non-Piercing Regions. Discret. Comput. Geom. 64(3): 1098-1122 (2020)).
  Our techniques imply a unified analysis for packing and covering problems for hypergraphs defined on surfaces of bounded genus. We also describe applications of our results for hypergraph colorings.</description>

      <title>Social Networks: Enumerating Maximal Community Patterns in $c$-Closed Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.11437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Jacob Fox, C. Seshadhri, Tim Roughgarden, Fan Wei, and Nicole Wein introduced the model of $c$-closed graphs--a distribution-free model motivated by triadic closure, one of the most pervasive structural signatures of social networks. While enumerating maximal cliques in general graphs can take exponential time, it is known that in $c$-closed graphs, maximal cliques and maximal complete bipartite subgraphs can always be enumerated in polynomial time. These structures correspond to blow-ups of simple patterns: a single vertex or a single edge, with some vertices required to form cliques. In this work, we explore a natural extension: we study maximal blow-ups of arbitrary finite graphs $H$ in $c$-closed graphs. We prove that for any fixed graph $H$, the number of maximal blow-ups of $H$ in an $n$-vertex $c$-closed graph is always bounded by a polynomial in $n$. We further investigate the case of induced blow-ups and provide a precise characterization of the graphs $H$ for which the number of maximal induced blow-ups is also polynomially bounded in $n$. Finally, we study the analogue questions when $H$ ranges over an infinite family of graphs.</description>

      <title>On Modular Edge Colourings of Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04254</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04254v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$ and an integer $k\geq 2$, let $\chi'_k(G)$ denote the minimum number of colours required to colour the edges of $G$ such that, in each colour class, the subgraph induced by the edges of that colour has all non-zero degrees congruent to $1$ modulo $k$. In 1992, Pyber proved that $\chi'_2(G) \leq 4$ for every graph $G$, and posed the question of whether $\chi'_k(G)$ can be bounded solely in terms of $k$ for every $k\geq 3$. This question was answered in 1997 by Scott, who showed that $\chi'_k(G)\leq5k^2\log k$, and further asked whether $\chi'_k(G) = O(k)$. Recently, Botler, Colucci, and Kohayakawa (2023) answered Scott's question affirmatively proving that $\chi'_k(G) \leq 198k - 101$, and conjectured that the multiplicative constant could be reduced to $1$. A step towards this latter conjecture was made in 2024 by Nweit and Yang, who improved the bound to $\chi'_k(G) \leq 177k - 93$. In this paper, we further improve the multiplicative constant to $9$. More specifically, we prove that there is a function $f\in o(k)$ for which $\chi'_k(G) \leq 7k + f(k)$ if $k$ is odd, and $\chi'_k(G) \leq 9k + f(k)$ if $k$ is even. In doing so, we prove that $\chi'_k(G) \leq k + O(d)$ for every $d$-degenerate graph $G$, which plays a central role in our proof.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a simple graph on $n$ vertices with chromatic number $\chi$, and let $\lambda_n$ denote the least adjacency eigenvalue. Solving a conjecture of Fan, Yu and Wang~[Electron. J. Combin., 2012], we prove that when $3\le \chi\le n-1$, the chromatic number satisfies the following upper bound: $$ \chi \le \left(\frac{n}{2}+1+\lambda_n\right) + \sqrt{\left(\frac{n}{2}+1+\lambda_n\right)^{2}-4(\lambda_n+1)\left(\lambda_n+\frac{n}{2}\right)}, $$ with equality if and only if $G \cong \left(K_{\frac{\chi}{2}}\cup\tfrac{n-\chi}{2}K_1\right) \vee \left(K_{\frac{\chi}{2}}\cup\tfrac{n-\chi}{2}K_1\right)$, where both $n$ and $\chi$ are even. This extends the validity of the Fan--Yu--Wang bound from the range $3\le \chi\le \frac{n}{2}$ to the full range $3\le \chi\le n-1$.
  We also compare this bound with the well known bound due to Wilf that $\chi \le 1 + \lambda_1$, where $\lambda_1$ denotes the largest eigenvalue. In particular we show that while Wilf's bound is an upper bound for some parameters larger than $\chi$, this bound using $\lambda_n$ is not an upper bound for these parameters.</description>

      <title>A Proof of Talagrand's Creating Large Sets Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.17336v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Talagrand conjectured that if a family of sets $\mathcal{F}$ over $X = \{ 1,2,\cdots, N \}$ is of large measure, then constant times of unions of sets in $\mathcal{F}$ will cover a large portion of the power set of $X$. This conjecture is a central open problem at the intersection of combinatorics and probability theory, and was described by Talagrand as a personal favorite. This paper provides a proof confirming this conjecture.</description>

      <title>A formula for the Euler characteristic of a poset through the determinant of the order-complement matrix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.00217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a finite poset $P$, its zeta matrix $\mathbf Z$ encode fundamental incidence-theoretic information about the order structure. In this paper we introduce and study the \emph{order-complement matrix} $\overline{\mathbf Z} = \mathbf J - \mathbf Z$, where $\mathbf J$ is the all-ones matrix. We prove a closed formula for its characteristic polynomial and for its determinant, showing that $\det(\overline{\mathbf Z}) = (-1)^n \tilde{\chi}(P)$, where $n = |P|$ and $\tilde{\chi}(P)$ is the reduced Euler characteristic of $P$. This provides a new, unexpectedly simple linear-algebraic expression for the Euler characteristic of a poset, complementing existing determinant formulas for matrices derived from incidence relations.</description>

      <title>Regular polygons, line operators, and elliptic modular surfaces as realization spaces of matroids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.03470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.03470v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For an integer $n\geq 7$, we investigate the matroid realization space of a specific deformation of the regular $n$-gon along with its lines of symmetry. It turns out that this particular realization space is birational to the elliptic modular surface $\Xi_{1}(n)$ over the modular curve $X_{1}(n)$.
  In this way, we obtain a model of $\Xi_{1}(n)$ defined over the rational numbers. Furthermore, a natural geometric operator acts on these matroid realizations. On the elliptic modular surface, this operator corresponds to the multiplication by $-2$ on the elliptic curves. This provides a new geometric approach to computing multiplication by $-2$ on elliptic curves.</description>

      <title>On the numerical Terao's conjecture and Ziegler pairs for line arrangements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07070v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we present a smallest possible counterexample to the Numerical Terao's Conjecture in the class of line arrangements in the complex projective plane. Our example consists of a pair of two arrangements with $13$ lines. Moreover, we use the newly discovered singular matroid realization spaces to construct new examples of pairs of line arrangements having the same underlying matroid but different free resolutions of the Milnor algebras. Such rare arrangements are called Ziegler pairs in the literature.</description>

      <title>Universal diameter bounds for random graphs with given degrees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.10759v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a graph $G$, let $\mathrm{diam}(G)$ be the greatest distance between any two vertices of $G$ which lie in the same connected component, and let $\mathrm{diam}^+(G)$ be the greatest distance between any two vertices of $G$; so $\mathrm{diam}^+(G)=\infty$ if $G$ is not connected.
  Fix a sequence $(d_1,\ldots,d_n)$ of positive integers, and let $\mathbf{G}$ be a uniformly random connected simple graph with $V(\mathbf{G})=[n]:=\{1,\ldots,n\}$ such that $\mathrm{deg}_{\mathbf{G}}(v)=d_v$ for all $v \in [n]$. We show that, unless a $1-o(1)$ proportion of vertices have degree $2$, then $\mathbb{E}[\mathrm{diam}(\mathbf{G})]=O(\sqrt{n})$. It is not hard to see that this bound is best possible for general degree sequences (and in particular in the case of trees, in which $\sum_{v=1}^n d_v = 2(n-1)$). We also prove that this bound holds without the connectivity constraint. As a key input to the proofs, we show that graphs with minimum degree $3$ are with high probability connected and have logarithmic diameter: if $\min(d_1,\ldots,d_n) \ge 3$ and $\mathbf{G}$ is a uniformly random simple graph with $V(\mathbf{G})=[n]$ such that $\mathrm{deg}_{\mathbf{G}}(v)=d_v$ for all $v \in [n]$, then $\mathrm{diam}^+(\mathbf{G})=$ $O_{\mathbb{P}}(\log n)$; this bound is also best possible.</description>

      <title>Cocycle stability in permutations of random simplicial complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.21566v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Finding a non-sofic hyperbolic group will resolve two major problems in geometric group theory: Are there non sofic groups? Are there non residually finite hyperbolic groups?
  In this paper, we propose a new probabilistic approach to this problem, based on the cocycle stability in permutations of random 2-dimensional Linial-Meshulam complexes. Specifically, we study their cocycle stability rate, which measures how far cochains with small coboundaries are from being cocycles.
  Our main contribution is the following: If, in a middle triangle density range, these random complexes typically have a linear cocycle stability rate, then there exists a non-sofic hyperbolic group. Our proof method is inspired by a well known fact about the non local testability of Sipser-Spielman expander codes.</description>

      <title>On hyperbolic links associated to Eulerian cycles on ideal right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.03017v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider Eulerian cycles without transversal selfintersections in $4$-valent planar graphs. We prove that any cycle of this type in the graph of an ideal right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope corresponds to a hyperbolic link such that its complement consists of $4$-copies of this polytope glued according to its checkerboard coloring. Moreover, this link consists of trivially embedded circles bijectively corresponding to the vertices of the polytope. For such cycles we prove that the $3$-antiprism $A(3)$ (octahedron) has exactly $2$ combinatorially different cycles, the $4$-antiprism $A(4)$ has exactly $7$ combinatorially different cycles, and these cycles correspond to $7$ cycles (perhaps combinatorially equivalent) on any polytope different from antiprisms, and any antiprism $A(k)$ has at least $2$ combinatorially different cycles. The $2$-fold branched covering space corresponding to our link is a small cover over some simple $3$-polytope. This small cover is defined by a Hamiltonian cycle on it. We show that any Hamiltonian cycle on a compact right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope arises in this way, while for a Hamiltonian cycle on a right-angled hyperbolic $3$-polytope of finite volume the necessary and sufficient condition is that at each ideal vertex it does not go straight. We introduce a transformation of a Eulerian cycle along conjugated vertices allowing to build new cycles from a given one.</description>
