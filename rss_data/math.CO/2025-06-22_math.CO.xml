      <title>Pr\"{u}fer codes on vertex-colored rooted trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15796</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15796v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Pr\"{u}fer codes provide an encoding scheme for representing a vertex-labeled tree on $n$ vertices with a string of length $n-2$. Indeed, two labeled trees are isomorphic if and only if their Pr\"{u}fer codes are identical, and this supplies a proof of Cayley's Theorem. Motivated by a graph decomposition of freight networks into a corpus of vertex-colored rooted trees, we extend the notion of Pr\"{u}fer codes to that setting, i.e., trees without a unique labeling, by defining a canonical label for a vertex-colored rooted tree and incorporating vertex colors into our variation of the Pr\"{u}fer code. Given a pair of trees, we prove properties of the vertex-colored Pr\"{u}fer code (abbreviated VCPC) equivalent to (1) isomorphism between a pair of vertex-colored rooted trees, (2) the subtree relationship between vertex-colored rooted trees, and (3) when one vertex-colored rooted tree is isomorphic to a minor of another vertex-colored rooted tree.</description>

      <title>Odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers via pattern-avoiding permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15800</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15800v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider several combinatorial problems whose enumeration leads to the odd-indexed Fibonacci numbers, including certain types of Dyck paths, block fountains, directed column-convex polyominoes, and set partitions with no crossings and no nestings. Our goal is to provide bijective maps to pattern-avoiding permutations and derive generating functions that track certain positional statistics at the permutation level.</description>

      <title>Oriented diameter of graphs with given domination number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15997v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a connected bridgeless graph with domination number $\gamma$. The oriented diameter (strong diameter) of $G$ is the smallest integer $d$ for which $G$ admits a strong orientation with diameter (strong diameter) $d$. Kurz and L\"atsch (2012) conjectured the oriented diameter of $G$ is at most $\lceil \frac{7\gamma+1}{2}\rceil$ and the bound is sharp. In this paper, we confirm the conjecture by induction on $\gamma$ through contracting an unavoidable alternative subgraph, which holds potential for future applications. Moreover, we show the oriented strong diameter of $G$ is at most $7\gamma-1$ by using the same recursive structure, and the bound is best possible.</description>

      <title>Bounds for Geometric rank in Terms of Subrank</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For tensors of fixed order, we establish three types of upper bounds for the geometric rank in terms of the subrank. Firstly, we prove that, under a mild condition on the characteristic of the base field, the geometric rank of a tensor is bounded by a function in its subrank in some field extension of bounded degree. Secondly, we show that, over any algebraically closed field, the geometric rank of a tensor is bounded by a function in its subrank. Lastly, we prove that, for any order three tensor over an arbitrary field, its geometric rank is bounded by a quadratic polynomial in its subrank. Our results have several immediate but interesting implications: (1) We answer an open question posed by Kopparty, Moshkovitz and Zuiddam concerning the relation between the subrank and the geometric rank; (2) For order three tensors, we generalize the Biaggi-Chang- Draisma-Rupniewski (resp. Derksen-Makam-Zuiddam) theorem on the growth rate of the border subrank (resp. subrank), in an optimal way; (3) For order three tensors, we generalize the Biaggi- Draisma-Eggleston theorem on the stability of the subrank, from the real field to an arbitrary field; (4) We confirm the open problem raised by Derksen, Makam and Zuiddam on the maximality of the gap between the subrank of the direct sum and the sum of subranks; (5) We derive, for the first time, a de-bordering result for the border subrank and upper bounds for the partition rank and analytic rank in terms of the subrank; (6) We reprove a gap result for the subrank.</description>

      <title>On Tur\'{a}n problems for Berge forests</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For a graph $F$, an $r$-uniform hypergraph $H$ is a Berge-$F$ if there is a bijection $\phi:E(F)\rightarrow E(H)$ such that $e\subseteq \phi(e)$ for each $e\in E(F)$. Given a family $\mathcal{F}$ of $r$-uniform hypergraphs, an $r$-uniform hypergraph is $\mathcal{F}$-free if it does not contain any member in $\mathcal{F}$ as a subhypergraph. The Tur\'an number of $\mathcal{F}$ is the maximum number of hyperedges in an $\mathcal{F}$-free $r$-uniform hypergraph on $n$ vertices. In this paper, some exact and general results on the Tur\'{a}n numbers for several types of Berge forests are obtained.</description>

      <title>On line-parallelisms of PG(3, q)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16271</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16271v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{PG}(3, q)$ denote the three-dimensional projective space over the finite field with $q$ elements. A line-spread of $\mathrm{PG}(3, q)$ is a collection $\mathcal{S}$ of mutually skew lines such that every point of $\mathrm{PG}(3, q)$ lies on exactly one line of $\mathcal{S}$. A parallelism of $\mathrm{PG}(3, q)$ is a set $\Pi$ of mutually skew line-spreads of $\mathrm{PG}(3, q)$ such that every line of $\mathrm{PG}(3, q)$ is contained in precisely one line-spread of $\Pi$. For a Desarguesian spread $\mathcal{D}$ and an elementary abelian group $E$ of order $q^2$ that stabilizes $\mathcal{D}$ and one of its lines, let $\mathcal{T}$ be the class of parallelisms of $\mathrm{PG}(3, q)$ admitting $E$, and comprising $\mathcal{D}$ and $q^2+q$ Hall spreads, each of which is obtained by switching one of the $q^2+q$ reguli of $\mathcal{D}$ through its $E$-fixed line. In this paper, the parallelisms in $\mathcal{T}$ are characterized geometrically and enumerated. Moreover, it is shown that $\mathcal{T}$ contains at least $\Theta(q^{q-1} q!)$ mutually inequivalent parallelisms for $q$ even, and at least $\Theta(q^{2q-3})$ mutually inequivalent parallelisms when $q$ is odd.</description>

      <title>On the Existence and Uniqueness of Symmetric Structures Generating Complete Ordered Pairs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work introduces a new class of symmetric matrix structures, called harmonic structures, which enable the generation of all possible directed transitions $(x_i, x_{i+1})$ over a set of $n$ symbols, without internal repetitions. Unlike other combinatorial constructions, these structures are defined solely by the relative positions of the elements, not their concrete values. Two structures are considered equivalent if one can be obtained from the other through row permutation and/or global relabeling. Under this notion, it is shown that for $n=4$ there exists a single non-trivial structure, and for $n=6$ there are exactly two non-equivalent ones. Harmonic matrices are constructed using specially designed permutators whose properties guarantee symmetry and complete coverage. Their internal hierarchy, extensibility, and rarity within the space of permutations are analyzed. Furthermore, it is demonstrated how these matrices can be used to generate valid Sudoku boards deterministically, without random methods or post-validation. These properties open new perspectives in combinatorics, algorithm design, and systems based on positional encoding. Notably, these permutators enable the construction of harmonic matrices for arbitrary even values of $n$, ensuring the universal scalability of the method.</description>

      <title>Eulerian-type polynomials over Stirling permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is well known that ascents, descents and plateaux are equidistributed over the set of classical Stirling permutations. Their common enumerative polynomials are the second-order Eulerian polynomials. In this paper, we first provide a convolution formula for the second-order Eulerian polynomials, which gives a variant of a result of Gessel (arXiv:2005.04133). As an application, a determinantal expression for the second-order Eulerian polynomials is obtained. Secondly, we investigate the convolution formula for the trivariate second-order Eulerian polynomials. Among other things, we find a connection between a class of restricted Stirling permutations and a generalized Lotka-Volterra system. Notably, by introducing three new definitions on Stirling permutations: proper ascent-plateau, improper ascent-plateau and trace, we then discover that a six-variable Eulerian-type polynomial over this class of restricted Stirling permutations equals a six-variable Eulerian-type polynomial of signed permutations. By special parametrizations, we make use of Stirling permutations to give a unified interpretations of the (p,q)-Eulerian polynomials and derangement polynomials of types A and B.</description>

      <title>Maximal transitivity of the cactus group on standard Young tableaux</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The action of the cactus group $C_n$ on Young tableaux of a given shape $\lambda$ goes back to Berenstein and Kirillov and arises naturally in the study of crystal bases and quantum integrable systems. We show that this action is $2$-transitive on standard Young tableaux of the shape $\lambda$ if and only if $\lambda$ is not self-transpose and not a single hook. Moreover, we show that in these cases, the image of the cactus group in the permutation group of standard Young tableaux is either the whole permutation group or the alternating group. As an application, this implies that the Galois group of solutions to the Bethe ansatz in the Gaudin model attached to the Lie group $GL_d$ is, in many cases, at least the alternating group. This also extends the results of Sottile and White on the multiple transitivity of the Galois group of Schubert calculus problems in Grassmannians to many new cases.</description>

      <title>Polynomiality of the Bigraded Subdimension of Diagonal Harmonics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16566v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A sequence of representations \(V_n\) of the symmetric group \(S_n\) is called representation (multiplicity) stable if, after some \(n\), the irreducible decomposition of \(V_n\) stabilizes. In particular, Church and Farb (2013) showed that for fixed \(a\) and \(b\), the space of diagonal harmonics \(DH_n^{a,b}\) exhibits this behavior, with its dimension eventually stabilizing to a polynomial in \(n\). Building on this result, we use the Schedules Formula by Haglund and Loehr (2005) to obtain an explicit combinatorial polynomial for the dimension of the bigraded spaces \(DH_n^{a,b}\). This derivation not only yields the dimension formula but also produces a new sharp stability bound of \(a + b\), and determines the exact degree of the dimension polynomial, which is also \(a + b\).</description>

      <title>Multitriangulations on the half-cylinder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the simplicial complex $\Delta _{\mathcal{C}_n,2}$ is pure and a weak pseudomanifold of dimension $2(n-1)$, where $\Delta _{\mathcal{C}_n,2}$ is the simplicial complex associated with $2$-triangulations on the half-cylinder with $n$ marked points. This result generalizes the work of V. Pilaud and F. Santos for polygons and extends a result of M. Lepoutre. To achieve this, we show that $2$-triangulations on the half-cylinder decompose as complexes of star polygons, and that $2$-triangulations on the half-cylinder are in bijection with $2$-triangulations on the $4n$-gon invariant under rotation by $\pi/2$ radians. Building on work by C. Stump, we also introduce chevron pipe dreams, a new combinatorial model that more naturally captures the symmetries of $k$-triangulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16711v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the role that Liu's transformation formula can play in discovering Rogers-Ramanujan type identities. Specifically, we combine Liu's transformation formula with other $q$-series summations to derive a series of parameterized identities. Thereafter, through careful selection of these parameters, we obtain $75$ Rogers-Ramanujan type identities from Slater's list, and uncover several new Rogers-Ramanujan type identities.</description>

      <title>A Generic Construction of $q$-ary Near-MDS Codes Supporting 2-Designs with Lengths Beyond $q+1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A linear code with parameters $[n, k, n - k + 1]$ is called maximum distance separable (MDS), and one with parameters $[n, k, n - k]$ is called almost MDS (AMDS). A code is near-MDS (NMDS) if both it and its dual are AMDS. NMDS codes supporting combinatorial $t$-designs have attracted growing interest, yet constructing such codes remains highly challenging. In 2020, Ding and Tang initiated the study of NMDS codes supporting 2-designs by constructing the first infinite family, followed by several other constructions for $t &gt; 2$, all with length at most $q + 1$. Although NMDS codes can, in principle, exceed this length, known examples supporting 2-designs and having length greater than $q + 1$ are extremely rare and limited to a few sporadic binary and ternary cases. In this paper, we present the first \emph{generic construction} of $q$-ary NMDS codes supporting 2-designs with lengths \emph{exceeding $q + 1$}. Our method leverages new connections between elliptic curve codes, finite abelian groups, subset sums, and combinatorial designs, resulting in an infinite family of such codes along with their weight distributions.</description>

      <title>The Laplacian matrix of weighted threshold graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Threshold graphs are generated from one node by repeatedly adding a node that links to all existing nodes or adding a node without links. In the weighted threshold graph, we add a new node in step $i$, which is linked to all existing nodes by a link of weight $w_i$. In this work, we consider the set ${\cal A}_N$ that contains all Laplacian matrices of weighted threshold graphs of order $N$. We show that ${\cal A}_N$ forms a commutative algebra. Using this, we find a common basis of eigenvectors for the matrices in ${\cal A}_N$. It follows that the eigenvalues of each matrix in ${\cal A}_N$ can be represented as a linear transformation of the link weights. In addition, we prove that, if there are just three or fewer different weights, two weighted threshold graphs with the same Laplacian spectrum must be isomorphic.</description>

      <title>Cycle lengths in the percolated hypercube</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16858v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $Q^d_p$ be the random subgraph of the $d$-dimensional binary hypercube obtained after edge-percolation with probability $p$. It was shown recently by the authors that, for every $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, there is some $c = c(\varepsilon)&gt;0$ such that, if $pd\ge c$, then typically $Q^d_p$ contains a cycle of length at least $(1-\varepsilon)2^d$. We strengthen this result to show that, under the same assumptions, typically $Q^d_p$ contains cycles of all even lengths between $4$ and $(1-\varepsilon)2^d$.</description>

      <title>Regularity and separation for Sierpi\'nski products of graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16864</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16864v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Sierpi\'nski product of graphs generalises the vast and relevant class of Sierpi\'nski-type graphs, and is also related to the classic lexicographic product of graphs. Our first main results are necessary and sufficient conditions for the higher connectivity of Sierpi\'nski products. Among other applications, we characterise the polyhedral ($3$-connected and planar) Sierpi\'nski products of polyhedra. Our other main result is the complete classification of the regular polyhedral Sierpi\'nski products, and more generally of the regular, connected, planar Sierpi\'nski products. To prove this classification, we introduce and study the intriguing class of planar graphs where each vertex may be assigned a colour in such a way that each vertex has neighbours of the same set of colours and in the same cyclic order around the vertex. We also completely classify the planar lexicographic products.</description>

      <title>Counter-example to Conjectures on Complemented Zero-Divisor Graphs of Semigroups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we are motivated by two conjectures proposed by C. Bender et al.\ in 2024, which have remained open questions. The first conjecture states that if the complemented zero-divisor graph \( G(S) \) of a commutative semigroup \( S \) with a zero element has the clique number three or greater, then the reduced graph \( G_r(S) \) is isomorphic to the graph \( G(\mathcal{P}(n)) \). The second conjecture asserts that if \( G(S) \) is a complemented zero-divisor graph with the clique number three or greater, then \( G(S) \) is uniquely complemented.
  In this work, we construct a commutative semigroup \( S \) with a zero element that serves as a counter-example to both conjectures.</description>

      <title>Dimensions of compositions modulo a prime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16953</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16953v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (ordinary) representation theory of the symmetric group is fascinating and has rich connections to combinatorics, including the Frobenius correspondence to the self-dual graded Hopf algebra of symmetric functions. The $0$-Hecke algebra (of type $A$) is a deformation of the group algebra of the symmetric group, and its representation theory has an analogous correspondence to the dual graded Hopf algebras of quasisymmetric functions and noncommutative symmetric functions. Macdonald used the hook length formula for the number of standard Young tableaux of a fixed shape to determine how many irreducible representations of the symmetric group have dimensions indivisible by a prime $p$. In this paper, we study the dimensions of the projective indecomposable modules of the $0$-Hecke algebra modulo $p$; such a module is indexed by a composition and its dimension is given by a ribbon number, i.e., the cardinality of a descent class. Applying a result of Dickson on the congruence of multinomial coefficients, we count how many ribbon numbers belong to each congruence class modulo $p$. We also extend the result to other finite Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>Matroids, intersecting bases, and Borsuk property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17082</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17082v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of $\mathbb R^d$ has the Borsuk property if it can be decomposed into at most $d+1$ parts of diameter smaller than $S$. This is an important geometric property, inspired by a conjecture of Borsuk from the 1930s, which has attracted considerable attention over the years. In this paper, we define and investigate the Borsuk property for matroids, providing a purely combinatorial approach to the Borsuk property for matroid polytopes, a well-studied family of $(0,1)$-polytopes associated with matroids. We show that a sufficient condition for a matroid -- and thus its matroid polytope -- to have the Borsuk property is that the matroid or its dual has two disjoint bases. However, we show that this condition is not necessary by exhibiting infinite families of matroids having the Borsuk property and yet being such that every two bases intersect and every two cobases intersect. Kneser graphs, which form an important object from topological combinatorics, play a crucial role in most proofs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A classical result in combinatorial number theory states that the largest subset of $[n]$ avoiding a solution to the equation $x+y=z$ is of size $\lceil n/2 \rceil$. For all integers $k&gt;m$, we prove multicolored extensions of this result where we maximize the sum and product of the sizes of sets $A_1,A_2,\dots,A_k \subseteq [n]$ avoiding a rainbow solution to the Schur equation $x_1+x_2+\dots+x_m=x_{m+1}$. Moreover, we determine all the extremal families.</description>

      <title>Advancing Stochastic 3-SAT Solvers by Dissipating Oversatisfied Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce and benchmark a stochastic local search heuristic for the NP-complete satisfiability problem 3-SAT that drastically outperforms existing solvers in the notoriously difficult realm of critically hard instances. Our construction is based on the crucial observation that well established previous approaches such as WalkSAT are prone to get stuck in local minima that are distinguished from true solutions by a larger number of oversatisfied combinatorial constraints. To address this issue, the proposed algorithm, coined DOCSAT, dissipates oversatisfied constraints (DOC), i.e. reduces their unfavorable abundance so as to render them critical. We analyze and benchmark our algorithm on a randomly generated sample of hard but satisfiable 3-SAT instances with varying problem sizes up to N=15000. Quite remarkably, we find that DOCSAT outperforms both WalkSAT and other well known algorithms including the complete solver Kissat, even when comparing its ability to solve the hardest quintile of the sample to the average performance of its competitors. The essence of DOCSAT may be seen as a way of harnessing statistical structure beyond the primary cost function of a combinatorial problem to avoid or escape local minima traps in stochastic local search, which opens avenues for generalization to other optimization problems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16267v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, Amdeberhan and Merca proved some arithmetic properties of the difference $C(n)$ between the number of partitions of $n$ with even cranks and those with odd cranks and the sequence $a(n)$ whose generating function is the reciprocal of that of $C(n)$. In this note, we give new elementary proofs of some of their main results and extend them. In particular, we establish Ramanujan-type congruences modulo $5$ and $25$ for certain finite sums involving $C(n)$ and $a(n)$. Our proofs employ the results of Cooper, Hirschhorn, and Lewis, and certain identities involving the Rogers-Ramanujan continued fraction $R(q)$ due to Chern and Tang.</description>

Abstract: We compare tropical linear series as defined by Farkas, Jensen, and Payne with combinatorial limit linear series as defined by Amini and Gierczak. We show that tropical linear series of rank $r$ are combinatorial limit linear series of rank $r$, provide a counterexample of the converse, and provide a slight simplification for the definition of a combinatorial limit linear series. We also discuss realizability of permutation arrays as local arrays of linear series on tropical curves.</description>

      <title>Covariance Decomposition for Distance Based Species Tree Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In phylogenomics, species-tree methods must contend with two major sources of noise; stochastic gene-tree variation under the multispecies coalescent model (MSC) and finite-sequence substitutional noise. Fast agglomerative methods such as GLASS, STEAC, and METAL combine multi-locus information via distance-based clustering. We derive the exact covariance matrix of these pairwise distance estimates under a joint MSC-plus-substitution model and leverage it for reliable confidence estimation, and we algebraically decompose it into components attributable to coalescent variation versus sequence-level stochasticity. Our theory identifies parameter regimes where one source of variance greatly exceeds the other. For both very low and very high mutation rates, substitutional noise dominates, while coalescent variance is the primary contributor at intermediate mutation rates. Moreover, the interval over which coalescent variance dominates becomes narrower as the species-tree height increases. These results imply that in some settings one may legitimately ignore the weaker noise source when designing methods or collecting data. In particular, when gene-tree variance is dominant, adding more loci is most beneficial, while when substitution noise dominates, longer sequences or imputation are needed. Finally, leveraging the derived covariance matrix, we implement a Gaussian-sampling procedure to generate split support values for METAL trees and demonstrate empirically that this approach yields more reliable confidence estimates than traditional bootstrapping.</description>

      <title>An nth-cousin mating model and the n-anacci numbers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In seeking to understand the size of inbred pedigrees, J. Lachance (J. Theor. Biol. 261, 238-247, 2009) studied a population model in which, for a fixed value of $n$, each mating occurs between $n$th cousins. We explain a connection between the second-cousin case of the model ($n=2$) and the Fibonacci sequence, and more generally, between the $n$th-cousin case and the $n$-anacci sequence $(n \geq 2)$. For a model with $n$th-cousin mating $(n \geq 1)$, we obtain the generating function describing the size of the pedigree $t$ generations back from the present, and we use it to evaluate the asymptotic growth of the pedigree size. In particular, we show that the growth of the pedigree asymptotically follows the growth rate of the $n$-anacci sequence -- the golden ratio $\phi = (1 + \sqrt{5})/2 \approx 1.6180$ in the second-cousin case $n=2$ -- and approaches 2 as $n$ increases. The computations explain the appearance of familiar numerical sequences and constants in a pedigree model. They also recall similar appearances of such sequences and constants in studies of population biology more generally.</description>

      <title>Correspondence among congruence families for generalized Frobenius partitions via modular permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16823v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In 2024, Garvan, Sellers and Smoot discovered a remarkable symmetry in the families of congruences for generalized Frobenius partitions $c\psi_{2,0}$ and $c\psi_{2,1}$. They also emphasized that the considerations for the general case of $c\psi_{k,\beta}$ are important for future work. In this paper, for each $k$ we construct a vector-valued modular form for the generating functions of $c\psi_{k,\beta}$, and determine an equivalence relation among all $\beta$. Within each equivalence class, we can identify modular transformations relating the congruences of one $c\psi_{k,\beta}$ to that of another $c\psi_{k,\beta'}$. Furthermore, correspondences between different equivalence classes can also be obtained through linear combinations of modular transformations. As an example, with the aid of these correspondences, we prove a family of congruences of $c\phi_{3}$, the Andrews' $3$-colored Frobenius partition.</description>

Abstract: We establish a bijection between the set of finite topological $T_0$-spaces (or partially ordered sets) and classes of square matrices. The absolute value of the determinant or the rank of these matrices are simple homotopy invariants for the corresponding topological spaces, and consequently, for finite simplicial complexes. We calculate these invariants for various families of topological spaces and explore other relationships and problems posed for finite posets within the context of these matrices.</description>

      <title>Maximal Achievable Service Rates of Codes and Connections to Combinatorial Designs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16983</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.16983v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the service-rate region (SRR) of distributed storage systems that employ linear codes. We focus on systems where each server stores one code symbol, and a user recovers a data symbol by accessing any of its recovery groups, subject to per-server capacity limits. The SRR--the convex polytope of simultaneously achievable request rates--captures system throughput and scalability. We first derive upper and lower bounds on the maximum request rate of each data object. These bounds hold for all linear codes and depend only on the number of parity checks orthogonal to a particular set of codeword coordinates associated with that object, i.e., the equations used in majority-logic decoding, and on code parameters. We then check the bound saturation for 1) all non-systematic codes whose SRRs are already known and 2) systematic codes. For the former, we prove the bounds are tight. For systematic codes, we show that the upper bound is achieved whenever the supports of minimum-weight dual codewords form a 2-design. As an application, we determine the exact per-object demand limits for binary Hamming codes. Our framework provides a new lens to address the SRR problem through combinatorial design theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.16992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that Schur classes of ample vector bundles on smooth projective varieties satisfy Hodge--Riemann relations on $H^{p,q}$ under the assumption that $H^{p-2,q-2}$ vanishes. More generally, we study Hodge--Riemann polynomials, which are partially symmetric polynomials that produce cohomology classes satisfying the Hodge--Riemann property when evaluated at Chern roots of ample vector bundles. In the case of line bundles and in bidegree $(1,1)$, these are precisely the nonzero dually Lorentzian polynomials. We prove various properties of Hodge--Riemann polynomials, confirming predictions and answering questions of Ross and Toma. As an application, we show that the derivative sequence of a product of Schur polynomials is Schur log-concave, confirming conjectures of Ross and Wu.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17152v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An $\mathcal{A}$-semigroup is a numerical semigroup without consecutive small elements. This work generalizes this concept to finite-complement submonoids of an affine cone $\mathcal{C}$. We develop algorithmic procedures to compute all $\mathcal{A}$-semigroups with a given Frobenius element (denoted by $\mathcal{A}(f)$), and with fixed Frobenius element and multiplicity. Moreover, we analyze the $\mathcal{A}(f)$-systems of generators. Furthermore, we study $\mathcal{A}$-numerical semigroups with maximal embedding dimension, fixed Frobenius number and multiplicity, providing an algorithm for their computation and a graphical classification.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2305.07567v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we describe properties of the characteristic polynomial of a weighted lattice and show that it has a recursive description, which we use to obtain results on the critical exponent of $q$-polymatroids. We give a Critical Theorem for representable $q$-polymatroids and we provide a lower bound on the critical exponent. We show that $q$-polymatroids arising from certain families of rank-metric codes attain this lower bound.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.12873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p}^r,F)$ denote the maximum number of edges in an $F$-free subgraph of the random $r$-uniform hypergraph $G_{n,p}^r$, and let $s(F):=\sup\{s: \exists H,\ t_F(H)=t_{K_r^r}(H)^{s+e(F)}&gt;0\}$. Following recent work of Conlon, Lee, and Sidorenko, we prove non-trivial lower bounds on $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p}^r,F)$ whenever $s(F)&gt;0$, i.e. $F$ is not Sidorenko. This connection between Sidorenko's conjecture and random Tur\'an problems gives new lower bounds on $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p}^r,F)$ whenever $s(F)&gt;0$, and further allows us to establish upper bounds for $s(F)$ whenever upper bounds for $\mathrm{ex}(G_{n,p}^r,F)$ are known. As a consequence, we prove that $s(\mathrm{E}^r(K_{k+1}^k))=\frac{1}{r-k}$ where $\mathrm{E}^r(K_{k+1}^k)$ is the $r$-expansion of $K_{k+1}^k$.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Pseudoforest Strong Nine Dragon Tree Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.00931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.00931v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The pseudoforest version of the Strong Nine Dragon Tree Conjecture states that if a graph $G$ has maximum average degree $\text{mad}(G) = 2 \max_{H \subseteq G} \frac{e(G)}{v(G)}$ at most $2(k + \frac{d}{k+d+1})$, then it has a decomposition into $k+1$ pseudoforests where in one pseudoforest $F$ the components of $F$ have at most $d$ edges. This was proven in 2020. We strengthen this theorem by showing that we can find such a decomposition where additionally $F$ is acyclic, the diameter of the components of $F$ is at most $2\ell + 2$, where $\ell = \lfloor\frac{d-1}{k+1} \rfloor$, and at most $2\ell + 1$ if $d \equiv 1 \bmod k+1$. Furthermore, for any component $K$ of $F$ and any $z \in \mathbb N$, we have $diam(K) \leq 2z$ if $e(K) \geq d - z(k-1) + 1$. We also show that both diameter bounds are best possible as an extension for both the Strong Nine Dragon Tree Conjecture for pseudoforests and its original conjecture for forests. In fact, they are still optimal even if we only enforce $F$ to have any constant maximum degree, instead of enforcing every component of $F$ to have at most $d$ edges.</description>

      <title>Non-self-touching paths in plane graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11059v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A path in a graph $G$ is called non-self-touching if two vertices are neighbours in the path if and only if they are neighbours in the graph. We investigate the existence of doubly infinite non-self-touching paths in infinite plane graphs.
  The matching graph $G_*$ of an infinite plane graph $G$ is obtained by adding all diagonals to all faces, and it plays an important role in the theory of site percolation on $G$. The main result of this paper is a necessary and sufficient condition on $G$ for the existence of a doubly infinite non-self-touching path in $G_*$ that traverses some diagonal. This is a key step in proving, for quasi-transitive $G$, that the critical points of site percolation on $G$ and $G_*$ satisfy the strict inequality $p_c(G_*) &lt; p_c(G)$, and it complements the earlier result of Grimmett and Li (Random Struct. Alg. 65 (2024) 832--856), proved by different methods, concerning the case of transitive graphs. Furthermore it implies, for quasi-transitive graphs, that $p_u(G) + p_c(G) \ge 1$, with equality if and only if the graph $G_\Delta$, obtained from $G$ by emptying all separating triangles, is a triangulation. Here, $p_u$ is the critical probability for the existence of a unique infinite open cluster.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.15808v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A graph $H$ is common if its Ramsey multiplicity, i.e., the minimum number of monochromatic copies of $H$ contained in any $2$-edge-coloring of $K_n$, is asymptotically the same as the number of monochromatic copies in the random $2$-edge-coloring of $K_n$. Erd\H{o}s conjectured that every complete graph is common, which was disproved by Thomason in the 1980s. Till today, a classification of common graphs remains a widely open challenging problem. Grzesik, Lee, Lidick\'y and Volec [Combin. Prob. Comput. 31 (2022), 907--923] conjectured that every $k$-apex of any connected Sidorenko graph is common. We prove for $k\le 5$ that the $k$-apex of any tree is common.</description>

Abstract: A real matrix is said to be positive if its every entry is positive, and a real square matrix A is algebraically positive if there exists a real polynomial f such that f(A) is a positive matrix. A sign pattern matrix A is said to require a property if all matrices having sign pattern as A have that property. In this paper, we characterize all sign pattern matrices associated with cycle graphs that require algebraic positivity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new Littlewood-Richardson rule for the Schubert structure coefficients of isotropic Grassmannians, equivalently for the multiplication of $P$-Schur functions. Serrano (2010) previously gave a formula in terms of classes in his shifted plactic monoid. However, this formula is challenging to use because of the difficulty of characterizing shifted plactic classes. We give the first algebraic proof of this formula. We then use it to obtain a new rule that is easy to implement. Our rule is based on identifying a subtle analogue of Yamanouchi tableaux, which we characterize. We show that for some families of structure coefficients, our rule leads to an algorithm with exponentially better time complexity than the original rule of Stembridge (1989).</description>

      <title>Real state transfer on edge perturbed graphs with generalized clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07982v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the existence of real state transfer in edge-perturbed graphs containing generalized clusters, where the Hamiltonian is taken to be either the adjacency matrix, the Laplacian matrix, or the signless Laplacian matrix of an associated weighted graph. This framework provides a unified approach for constructing new graphs that exhibit perfect real state transfer, building on known examples with this property. A central observation is that the evolution of certain quantum states depends solely on the local structure of the underlying graph. In particular, we construct an infinite family of graphs with maximum valency five that exhibit perfect pair state transfer-under each of the aforementioned matrices-between the same pair of states at the same time, despite being non-regular. Additionally, we identify instances of perfect pair state transfer in edge-perturbed graphs, including complete graphs, complete bipartite graphs, blow-up graphs, and related structures. We also examine various graph operations-such as the sequential join, complement, Cartesian product, lexicographic product, and corona product-that generate new families of graphs exhibiting perfect real state transfer with respect to all three choices of the Hamiltonian.</description>

In this paper, we study the exponents of multiarrangements of three lines for the case of positive characteristic. We provide an effective algorithm for computing the exponents.

We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for the occurrence of perfect state transfer on graphs belonging to an association scheme. Our focus includes specific association schemes, namely the Hamming and Johnson schemes. We characterize all graphs on the classes of Hamming and Johnson schemes that exhibit perfect state transfer. Furthermore, we study perfect state transfer on distance-regular graphs. We provide complete characterizations for exhibiting perfect state transfer on distance-regular graphs of diameter $2$ and diameter $3$, as well as integral distance-regular graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14312v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A finite nonempty set $F$ is said to be Schreier (maximal Schreier, respectively) if $\min F\ge |F|$ ($\min F = |F|$, respectively). For $k,n\in\mathbb{N}$, let $$s_{k,n}\ :=\ |\{F\subset\{k, 2k,\ldots, nk\}\,:\, F\mbox{ is Schreier and }nk\in F\}|.$$ We show that $(s_{k,n})_{n=1}^\infty$ is a subsequence with terms taken periodically from the Padovan-like sequence $(a_{k,n})_{n=0}^\infty$ defined as: $a_{k,0} = a_{k,1} = 1, a_{k, 2} = \cdots = a_{k, k} = 2$, and $$a_{k, n}\ =\ a_{k,n-k} + a_{k,n-k-1},\mbox{ for } n\ge k+1.$$ As an application, we obtain an alternative proof of the linear recurrence of $(s_{k,n})_{n=1}^\infty$ discovered by Beanland et al. Furthermore, a similar result holds for the sequence $(s^{(m)}_{k,n})_{n=1}^\infty$ that counts maximal Schreier sets. Finally, we prove that $$s^{(m)}_{k,n}\ =\ 2s_{k,n}-s_{k,n+1}, \mbox{ for all }n\ge 1.$$</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.14942v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Folkman's theorem asserts the existence of graphs $G$ which are $K_4$-free, but which have the property that every two-coloring of $E(G)$ contains a monochromatic triangle. The quantitative aspects of $f(2,3,4)$, the least $n$ such that there exists an $n$-vertex graph with both properties above, are notoriously difficult; a series of improvements over the span of two decades witnessed the solution to two \$100 Erd\H{o}s problems, and the current record due to Lange, Radziszowski, and Xu now stands at $f(2,3,4) \leq 786$, the proof of which is computer-assisted.
  In this paper, we study Folkman-like properties of a sequence $H_q$ of finite geometric graphs constructed using Hermitian unitals in projective planes which were instrumental in the recent Mattheus-Verstra\"ete breakthrough on off-diagonal Ramsey numbers. We show that for all prime powers $q \geq 4$, there exists a subset $\mathscr{T}_q$ of triangles in $H_q$ such that no four span a $K_4$ in $H_q$, but every two-coloring of $E(H_q)$ induces a monochromatic triangle in $\mathscr{T}_q$. For $q=4$, this gives a graph on $208$ vertices with this "quasi-Folkman" property. Moreover, we show that a certain random alteration of $H_q$ which destroys all of its $K_4$'s will, for large $q$, maintain the Ramsey property with high probability.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14710v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper we give unified formulas for the numbers of representations of positive integers as sums of four generalized $m$-gonal numbers, and as restricted sums of four squares under a linear condition, respectively. These formulas are given as $\mathbb{Z}$-linear combinations of Hurwitz class numbers. As applications, we prove several Zhi-Wei Sun's conjectures. As by-products, we obtain formulas for expressing the Fourier coefficients of $\vartheta(\tau,z)^4$, $\eta(\tau)^{12}$, $\eta(\tau)^4$ and $\eta(\tau)^8\eta(2\tau)^8$ in terms of Hurwitz class numbers, respectively. The proof is based on the theory of Jacobi forms.</description>

Abstract: For a sequence of Boolean functions $f_n : \{-1, 1\}^{V_n} \longrightarrow \{-1, 1\}$, with random input given by some probability measure $\mathbb{P}_n$, we say that there is sparse reconstruction for $f_n$ if there is a sequence of subsets $U_n \subseteq V_n$ of coordinates satisfying $|U_n| = o(|V_n|)$ such that knowing the spins in $U_n$ gives us a non-vanishing amount of information about the value of $f_n$.
  In the first part of this work, we showed that if the $\mathbb{P}_n$s are product measures, then no sparse reconstruction is possible for any sequence of transitive functions. In this sequel, we consider spin systems that are relatives of IID measures in one way or another, with our main focus being on the Ising model on finite transitive graphs or exhaustions of lattices. We prove that no sparse reconstruction is possible for the entire high temperature regime on Euclidean boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, while sparse reconstruction for the majority function of the spins is possible in the critical and low temperature regimes. We give quantitative bounds for two-dimensional boxes and the Curie-Weiss model, sharp in the latter case.
  The proofs employ several different methods, including factor of IID and FK random cluster representations, strong spatial mixing, a generalization of discrete Fourier analysis to Divide-and-Color models, and entropy inequalities.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we show some expressions of certain $q$-multiple zeta-star values at roots of unity. These explicit formulas are expressed by using the determinants or Bell polynomials. Explicit formulas for other types of values can be found from recurrence relations obtained using generating functions.</description>
