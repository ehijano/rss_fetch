      <title>Industry Insights into Quantum Knowledge Needed for the Quantum Information Science and Engineering Workforce</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15039v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Information Science and Engineering (QISE) education and workforce development are top priorities at the national level in the US. This has included a push for academia to support the development of programs that will prepare students to enter the QISE workforce. As the field of QISE has grown rapidly in academia and industry, there is a need to better understand what quantum knowledge is needed for students to be ready for the workforce. We present preliminary findings on the level of quantum expertise and the specific quantum knowledge utilized across different roles, and in the execution of specific tasks in the QISE industry. Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with industry professionals elucidates these aspects of the vital work functions related to the ongoing development of quantum technologies in industry. This work will provide insights into QISE curriculum development and changes needed to better support students transitioning into this growing industry.</description>

      <title>Industry Perspectives on Projected Quantum Workforce Needs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15055</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15055v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As more physics educators are developing courses and programs to prepare students for careers in quantum information science, understanding the quantum industry's future workforce needs has become increasingly important. As part of ongoing efforts to understand the knowledge and skills needed for various job roles, we interviewed quantum industry professionals in managerial positions about workforce needs. Through thematic analysis, we identify two broad themes about projected needs. First, managers anticipate a need for a range of educational levels from bachelors to PhDs in physics, engineering, and computer science to fill the needs of roles spanning manufacturing to innovation. Second, managers anticipate an increased need for individuals who can apply quantum information science knowledge across fields. These results provide insights for physics educators about course and program development: continued investment in quantum information science education at all levels is valuable, and greater emphasis should be placed on applications of quantum science.</description>

      <title>Development of soft and hard skills of high-school students via Young Physicists' Tournament</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.15324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Young Physicists' Tournament (YPT) inspires high-school students to immerse themselves into an inquiry process closely resembling the real physics research. Using questionnaires' replies from the students and their teachers engaged in YPT, we investigated the perception of teachers and students on how the preparation for YPT contributes to the development of hard skills (physics content knowledge, mathematics, modelling...) and soft skills (communication, team work, organization...) of the students, and how it compares to regular classes and other activities. This comparison shows a positive role of YPT among students, and even a more positive perception among teachers. The significant development of a wide range of advanced skills justifies the substantial effort, resources and dedication of both teachers and students required for the participation in YPT.</description>
