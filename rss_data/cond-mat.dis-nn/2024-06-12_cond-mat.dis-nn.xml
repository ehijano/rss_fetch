      <title>Investigating the Interplay Between Aging and Rejuvenation in Spin Glasses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Aging in a single crystal spin glass ($\mathrm{Cu}_{0.92}\mathrm{Mn}_{0.08}$) has been measured using ac susceptibility techniques over a temperature range of $0.3 - 0.8 \, T_g$. In these studies, traditional aging experiments (or ``quench'' aging protocols) are compared to aging curves constructed from finite-cooling-rate curves. By comparing the growth rates of spin glass order between the two types of aging curves, it is determined that quantitative comparisons between protocols which are taken by quenching and protocols using a finite cooling rate are not possible without a deeper understanding of the interplay between aging and rejuvenation. We then demonstrate that the data presented indicate that rejuvenation, rather than cumulative aging, is the cause for the discrepancies between the two growth rates.</description>

      <title>Invariant multiscale neural networks for data-scarce scientific applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Success of machine learning (ML) in the modern world is largely determined by abundance of data. However at many industrial and scientific problems, amount of data is limited. Application of ML methods to data-scarce scientific problems can be made more effective via several routes, one of them is equivariant neural networks possessing knowledge of symmetries. Here we suggest that combination of symmetry-aware invariant architectures and stacks of dilated convolutions is a very effective and easy to implement receipt allowing sizable improvements in accuracy over standard approaches. We apply it to representative physical problems from different realms: prediction of bandgaps of photonic crystals, and network approximations of magnetic ground states. The suggested invariant multiscale architectures increase expressibility of networks, which allow them to perform better in all considered cases.</description>

      <title>Tailoring Bound State Geometry in High-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07626v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is generally believed that the non-Hermitian effect (NHSE), due to its non-reciprocal nature, creates barriers for the appearance of impurity bound states. In this paper, we find that in two and higher dimensions, the presence of geometry-dependent skin effect eliminates this barrier such that even an infinitesimal impurity potential can confine bound states in this type of non-Hermitian systems. By examining bound states around Bloch saddle points, we find that non-Hermiticity can disrupt the isotropy of bound states, resulting in concave dumbbell-shaped bound states. Our work reveals a geometry transition of bound state between concavity and convexity in high-dimensional non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Scaling properties of (2+1) directed polymers in the low temperature limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.07998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.07998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In terms of the replica method we consider the low temperature limit of (2+1) directed polymers in a random potential. The proposed approach allows to compute the scaling exponent $\theta$ of the free energy fluctuations as well as the left tail of its probability distribution function. It is argued that $\theta = 1/4$ which is slightly different from the zero-temperature numerical value which is close to $0.241$.</description>

      <title>Scaling behavior of the localization length for TE waves at critical incidence on short-range correlated stratified random media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08156v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the scaling behavior of the localization length for $s$-polarized electromagnetic waves incident at a critical angle on stratified random media with short-range correlated disorder. By employing the invariant embedding method, extended to waves in correlated random media, and utilizing the Shapiro-Loginov formula of differentiation, we accurately compute the localization length $\xi$ of $s$ waves incident obliquely on stratified random media that exhibit short-range correlated dichotomous randomness in the dielectric permittivity. The random component of the permittivity is characterized by the disorder strength parameter $\sigma^2$ and the disorder correlation length $l_c$. Away from the critical angle, $\xi$ depends on these parameters independently. However, precisely at the critical angle, we discover that for waves with wavenumber $k$, $k\xi$ depends on the single parameter $kl_c\sigma^2$, satisfying a universal equation $k\xi\approx 1.3717\left(kl_c\sigma^2\right)^{-1/3}$ across the entire range of parameter values. Additionally, we find that $\xi$ scales as ${\lambda}^{4/3}$ for the entire range of the wavelength $\lambda$, regardless of the values of $\sigma^2$ and $l_c$. We demonstrate that under sufficiently strong disorder, the scaling behavior of the localization length for all other incident angles converges to that for the critical incidence.</description>

      <title>Impact of environmental interaction on bias induced circular current in a ring nanojunction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08219</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08219v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The specific role of environmental interaction on bias driven circular current in a ring nanojunction is explored, for the first time to the best of our concern, within a tight-binding framework based on wave-guide theory. The environmental interaction is implemented through disorder in backbone sites where these sites are directly coupled to parent lattice sites of the ring via single bonds. In absence of backbone disorder circular current becomes zero for a lengthwise symmetric nanojunction, while it increases with disorder which is quite unusual, and after reaching a maximum it eventually drops to zero in the limit of high disorder. The effects of ring-electrode interface configuration, ring-backbone coupling, different types of backbone disorder and system temperature are critically investigated to make the present analysis comprehensive. All the studied results are valid for a broad range of physical parameters, giving us confidence that the outcomes of this theoretical work can be verified in a laboratory.</description>

      <title>High order momentum topological insulator in 2D semi-Dirac materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08365v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Semi-Dirac materials in 2D present an anisotropic dispersion relation, linear along one direction and quadratic along the perpendicular one. This study explores the topological properties and the influence of disorder in a 2D semi-Dirac Hamiltonian. Anisotropic edge states appear only in one direction. Their topological protection can be rigorously founded on the Zak phase of the one-dimensional reduction of the semi-Dirac Hamiltonian, parametrically depending on one of the momenta. In general, only a single value of the momentum is topologically protected so these systems can be considered as high order momentum topological insulators. We explore the dependence on the disorder of the edge states and the robustness of the topological protection in these materials. We also explore the consequences of the high order topological protection in momentum space for the transport properties in a two-terminal configuration.</description>

      <title>Dynamical control in a prethermalized molecular ultracold plasma: Local dissipation drives global relaxation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.08433v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Prethermalization occurs as an important phase in the dynamics of many-body systems when strong coupling drives a quasi-equilibrium in a subspace separated from the thermodynamic equilibrium by the restriction of a gap in energy or other conserved quantity. Here, we report the signature of an enduring prethermal regime of arrested relaxation in the molecular ultracold plasma that forms following the avalanche of a state-selected Rydberg gas of nitric oxide. Electron collisions mix orbital angular momentum, scattering Rydberg molecules to states of very high-$\ell$. Spontaneous predissociation purifies this non-penetrating character, creating an extraordinary gap between the plasma states of $n \approx \ell$, with measured $n&gt;200$ and penetrating states of $\ell = 0, ~1$ and 2. Evolution to a statistically equilibrated state of N and O atoms cannot occur without Rydberg electron penetration, and this gap blocks relaxation for a millisecond or more. Evolving through the critical phase, electrons that balance the NO$^+$ charge behave as though localized in the prethermal phase and play an ineffective role in bridging this gap. However, the application of a weak radiofrequency (RF) field promotes a dramatic degree of relaxation owing to electron collisions. On an entirely different scale, exciting a quantum-state transition in an exceedingly small fraction of the molecules in the prethermalized ensemble acts with even greater effect to drive the entire system toward equilibrium. We ascribe this to dissipative character added to a small fraction of the states in the prethermally localized ensemble. Using the Lindblad master equation, we illustrate qualitatively similar dynamics for a toy model of an open quantum system that consists of a localized set of spins on which dissipation acts locally at a single site.</description>

      <title>Fitting an ellipsoid to random points: predictions using the replica method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.01169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.01169v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of fitting a centered ellipsoid to $n$ standard Gaussian random vectors in $\mathbb{R}^d$, as $n, d \to \infty$ with $n/d^2 \to \alpha &gt; 0$. It has been conjectured that this problem is, with high probability, satisfiable (SAT; that is, there exists an ellipsoid passing through all $n$ points) for $\alpha &lt; 1/4$, and unsatisfiable (UNSAT) for $\alpha &gt; 1/4$. In this work we give a precise analytical argument, based on the non-rigorous replica method of statistical physics, that indeed predicts a SAT/UNSAT transition at $\alpha = 1/4$, as well as the shape of a typical fitting ellipsoid in the SAT phase (i.e., the lengths of its principal axes). Besides the replica method, our main tool is the dilute limit of extensive-rank "HCIZ integrals" of random matrix theory. We further study different explicit algorithmic constructions of the matrix characterizing the ellipsoid. In particular, we show that a procedure based on minimizing its nuclear norm yields a solution in the whole SAT phase. Finally, we characterize the SAT/UNSAT transition for ellipsoid fitting of a large class of rotationally-invariant random vectors. Our work suggests mathematically rigorous ways to analyze fitting ellipsoids to random vectors, which is the topic of a companion work.</description>

      <title>Manipulating the Relaxation Time of Boundary-Dissipative Systems through Bond Dissipation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04183v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relaxation time plays a crucial role in describing the relaxation processes of quantum systems. We study the effect of a type of bond dissipation on the relaxation time of boundary dissipative systems and find that it can change the scaling of the relaxation time $T_c\sim L^{z}$ from $z=3$ to a value significantly less than $3$. We further reveal that the reason such bond dissipation can significantly reduce the relaxation time is that it can selectively target specific states. For Anderson localized systems, the scaling behavior of the relaxation time changes from an exponential form to a power-law form as the system size varies. This is because the bond dissipation we consider can not only select specific states but also disrupt the localization properties. Our work reveals that in open systems, one type of dissipation can be used to regulate the effects produced by another type of dissipation.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Noise-Driven Generative Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.12013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.12013v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Generative models realized with machine learning techniques are powerful tools to infer complex and unknown data distributions from a finite number of training samples in order to produce new synthetic data. Diffusion models are an emerging framework that have recently overcome the performance of the generative adversarial networks in creating synthetic text and high-quality images. Here, we propose and discuss the quantum generalization of diffusion models, i.e., three quantum-noise-driven generative diffusion models that could be experimentally tested on real quantum systems. The idea is to harness unique quantum features, in particular the non-trivial interplay among coherence, entanglement and noise that the currently available noisy quantum processors do unavoidably suffer from, in order to overcome the main computational burdens of classical diffusion models during inference. Hence, we suggest to exploit quantum noise not as an issue to be detected and solved but instead as a very remarkably beneficial key ingredient to generate much more complex probability distributions that would be difficult or even impossible to express classically, and from which a quantum processor might sample more efficiently than a classical one. An example of numerical simulations for an hybrid classical-quantum generative diffusion model is also included. Therefore, our results are expected to pave the way for new quantum-inspired or quantum-based generative diffusion algorithms addressing more powerfully classical tasks as data generation/prediction with widespread real-world applications ranging from climate forecasting to neuroscience, from traffic flow analysis to financial forecasting.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.16265v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: These are exciting times for quantum physics as new quantum technologies are expected to soon transform computing at an unprecedented level. Simultaneously network science is flourishing proving an ideal mathematical and computational framework to capture the complexity of large interacting systems. Here we provide a comprehensive and timely review of the rising field of complex quantum networks. On one side, this subject is key to harness the potential of complex networks in order to provide design principles to boost and enhance quantum algorithms and quantum technologies. On the other side this subject can provide a new generation of quantum algorithms to infer significant complex network properties. The field features fundamental research questions as diverse as designing networks to shape Hamiltonians and their corresponding phase diagram, taming the complexity of many-body quantum systems with network theory, revealing how quantum physics and quantum algorithms can predict novel network properties and phase transitions, and studying the interplay between architecture, topology and performance in quantum communication networks. Our review covers all of these multifaceted aspects in a self-contained presentation aimed both at network-curious quantum physicists and at quantum-curious network theorists. We provide a framework that unifies the field of quantum complex networks along four main research lines: network-generalized, quantum-applied, quantum-generalized and quantum-enhanced. Finally we draw attention to the connections between these research lines, which can lead to new opportunities and new discoveries at the interface between quantum physics and network science.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.18579v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum speed limit (QSL) is the lower bound on the time required for a state to evolve to a desired final state under a given Hamiltonian evolution. Three well-known QSLs exist Mandelstam-Tamm (MT), Margolus-Levitin (ML), and dual ML (ML$^*$) bounds. We consider one-dimensional systems that undergoes delocalization-localization transition in the presence of quasiperiodic and linear potential. By performing sudden quenches across the phase boundary, we find that the exact dynamics get captured very well by QSLs. We show that the MT bound is always tighter in the short time limit for any arbitrary state, while the optimal bound for the time of orthogonalization (time required to reach the orthogonal state) depends on the choice of the initial state. Further, for extreme quenches, we prove that the MT bound remains tighter for the time of orthogonalization, and it can qualitatively describe the non-analyticity in free energy for dynamical quantum phase transition (DQPT). Finally, we also demonstrate that the localization-delocalization transition point can be exactly identified from QSLs, whose computation cost is much less compared to many other diagnostic tools.</description>

      <title>Why Do Animals Need Shaping? A Theory of Task Composition and Curriculum Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Diverse studies in systems neuroscience begin with extended periods of curriculum training known as `shaping' procedures. These involve progressively studying component parts of more complex tasks, and can make the difference between learning a task quickly, slowly or not at all. Despite the importance of shaping to the acquisition of complex tasks, there is as yet no theory that can help guide the design of shaping procedures, or more fundamentally, provide insight into its key role in learning. Modern deep reinforcement learning systems might implicitly learn compositional primitives within their multilayer policy networks. Inspired by these models, we propose and analyse a model of deep policy gradient learning of simple compositional reinforcement learning tasks. Using the tools of statistical physics, we solve for exact learning dynamics and characterise different learning strategies including primitives pre-training, in which task primitives are studied individually before learning compositional tasks. We find a complex interplay between task complexity and the efficacy of shaping strategies. Overall, our theory provides an analytical understanding of the benefits of shaping in a class of compositional tasks and a quantitative account of how training protocols can disclose useful task primitives, ultimately yielding faster and more robust learning.</description>
