      <title>Complex totopapa: predicting the successor to pope Francis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01553</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01553v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following the death of Pope Francis, the College of Cardinals will convene in conclave to elect the new Pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church.
  In this report, we present a computational framework for analyzing the ideological landscape of the cardinal electors and estimating the likely outcomes of the upcoming papal election. We collected public textual data describing each cardinal's positions on a range of topics currently relevant to the Church, including sexuality, migration, poverty, governance and interreligious dialogue. These texts were embedded using a transformer-based language model to construct a semantic similarity matrix among cardinals. We then simulated conclave voting dynamics using this matrix as a proxy for ideological proximity. The model produced both topic-conditioned and aggregate probabilistic forecasts of election outcomes. We report the predicted leading candidates under various scenarios and discuss the structure of factional clustering revealed by the embeddings.
  The results highlight a polarized field with a small number of structurally central candidates, among whom Pietro Parolin, the former secretary of state, consistently emerges as the most broadly electable across thematic scenarios, followed by both high-profile and outsider names such as card. Brislin and Tagle.</description>

      <title>Uncovering complementary information sharing in spider monkey collective foraging using higher-order spatial networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01167v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collectives are often able to process information in a distributed fashion, surpassing each individual member's processing capacity. In fission-fusion dynamics, where group members come together and split from others often, sharing complementary information about uniquely known foraging areas could allow a group to track a heterogenous foraging environment better than any group member on its own. We analyse the partial overlaps between individual core ranges, which we assume represent the knowledge of an individual during a given season. We identify sets of individuals whose overlap shows a balance between redundantly and uniquely known portions and we use simplicial complexes to represent these higher-order interactions. The structure of the simplicial complexes shows holes in various dimensions, revealing complementarity in the foraging information that is being shared. We propose that the complex spatial networks arising from fission-fusion dynamics allow for adaptive, collective processing of foraging information in dynamic environments.</description>

      <title>Retrospective of the ARPA-E BETHE-GAMOW-Era Fusion Programs and Project Cohorts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01784</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01784v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper provides a retrospective of the BETHE (Breakthroughs Enabling THermonuclear-fusion Energy) and GAMOW (Galvanizing Advances in Market-aligned fusion for an Overabundance of Watts) fusion programs of the Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy (ARPA-E), as well as fusion project cohorts (associated with other ARPA-E programs) initiated during the same time period (2018-2022). BETHE (announced in 2019) aimed to increase the number of higher-maturity, lower-cost fusion approaches. GAMOW (announced in 2020) aimed to expand and translate research-and-development efforts in materials, fuel-cycle, and enabling technologies needed for commercial fusion energy. Both programs had a vision of enabling timely commercial fusion energy while laying the foundation for greater public-private collaborations to accelerate fusion-energy development. Finally, this paper describes ARPA-E's fusion Technology-to-Market (T2M) activities during this era, which included supporting ARPA-E fusion performers' commercialization pathways, improving fusion costing models, exploring cost targets for potential early markets for fusion energy, engaging with the broader fusion ecosystem (especially investors and nongovernmental organizations), and highlighting the importance of social license for timely fusion commercialization.</description>

      <title>You Don't Have to Live Next to Me: Towards Demobilizing Individualistic Bias in Computational Approaches to Urban Segregation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The global surge in social inequalities is one of the most pressing issues of our times. The spatial expression of social inequalities at city scale gives rise to urban segregation, a common phenomenon across different local and cultural contexts. The increasing popularity of Big Data and computational models has inspired a growing number of computational social science studies that analyze, evaluate, and issue policy recommendations for urban segregation. Today's wealth in information and computational power could inform urban planning for equity. However, as we show here, segregation research is epistemologically interdependent with prevalent economic theories which overfocus on individual responsibility while neglecting systemic processes. This individualistic bias is also engrained in computational models of urban segregation. Through several contemporary examples of how Big Data -- and the assumptions underlying its usage -- influence (de)segregation patterns and policies, our essay tells a cautionary tale. We highlight how a lack of consideration for data ethics can lead to the creation of computational models that have a real-life, further marginalizing impact on disadvantaged groups. With this essay, our aim is to develop a better discernment of the pitfalls and potentials of computational approaches to urban segregation, thereby fostering a conscious focus on systemic thinking about urban inequalities. We suggest setting an agenda for research and collective action that is directed at demobilizing individualistic bias, informing our thinking about urban segregation, but also more broadly our efforts to create sustainable cities and communities.</description>

      <title>Inter-city infections and the role of size heterogeneity in containment strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.03100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.03100v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study examines the effectiveness of regional lockdown strategies in mitigating pathogen spread across regional units, termed cities hereinafter. We develop simplified models to analyze infection spread across cities within a country during an epidemic wave. Isolation of a city is initiated when infection numbers within the city surpass defined thresholds. We compare two strategies: strategy (P) consists in prescribing thresholds proportionally to city sizes, while the same threshold is used for all cities under strategy (U). Given the heavy-tailed distribution of city sizes, strategy (P) may result in more secondary infections from larger cities than strategy (U).
  Random graph models are constructed to represent infection spread as a percolation process. In particular, we consider a model in which mobility between cities only depends on city sizes. We assess the relative efficiency of the two strategies by comparing the ratios of the number of individuals under isolation to the total number of infections by the end of the epidemic wave under strategy (P) and (U). Additionally, we derive analytical formulas for disease prevalence and basic reproduction numbers.
  Our models are calibrated using mobility data from France, Poland and Japan, validated through simulation. The findings indicate that mobility between cities in France and Poland is mainly determined by city sizes. However, a poor fit was observed with Japanese data, highlighting the importance to include other factors like e.g. geography for some countries in modeling. Our analysis suggest similar effectiveness for both strategies in France and Japan, while strategy (U) demonstrates distinct merits in Poland.</description>

      <title>Projections of Earth's technosphere: Scenario modeling, worldbuilding, and overview of remotely detectable technosignatures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.00067</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.00067v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study uses methods from futures studies to develop a set of ten self-consistent scenarios for Earth's 1000-year future, which can serve as examples for defining technosignature search strategies. We apply a novel worldbuilding pipeline that evaluates the dimensions of human needs in each scenario as a basis for defining the observable properties of the technosphere. Our scenarios include three with zero-growth stability, two that have collapsed into a stable state, one that oscillates between growth and collapse, and four that continue to grow. Only one scenario includes rapid growth that could lead to interstellar expansion. We examine absorption spectral features for a few scenarios to illustrate that nitrogen dioxide can serve as a technosignature to distinguish between present-day Earth, pre-agricultural Earth, and an industrial 1000-year future Earth. Three of our scenarios are spectrally indistinguishable from pre-agricultural Earth, even though these scenarios include expansive technospheres. Up to nine of these scenarios could represent steady-state examples that could persist for much longer timescales, and it remains possible that short-duration technospheres could be the most abundant. Our scenario set provides the basis for further systematic thinking about technosignature detection as well as for imagining a broad range of possibilities for Earth's future.</description>

      <title>Building floorspace and stock measurement: A review of global efforts, knowledge gaps, and research priorities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05824v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite a substantial body of research-evidenced by our analysis of 2,628 peer-reviewed papers-global building floorspace data remain fragmented, inconsistent, and methodologically diverse. The lack of high-quality and openly accessible datasets poses major challenges to accurately assessing building carbon neutrality. This review focuses on global building floorspace, especially its nexus with energy and emissions. The key research areas include energy modeling, emissions analysis, building retrofits, and life cycle assessments. Each measurement approach-top-down, bottom-up, and hybrid-has its own limitations: top-down methods provide broad estimates but low accuracy, whereas bottom-up approaches are more precise but data intensive. Our simulations reveal a surge in floorspace growth across emerging economies-most notably in India, Indonesia, and Africa-with India's per capita floorspace projected to triple by 2070. We emphasize the need for a high-resolution global floorspace imagery database to compare energy efficiency, track decarbonization progress, and assess renovation impacts while promoting building sufficiency and accelerating the transition to net-zero building systems.</description>

      <title>A Graph Theoretic Approach for Exploring the Relationship between EV Adoption and Charging Infrastructure Growth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13902v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The increasing global demand for conventional energy has led to significant challenges, particularly due to rising CO2 emissions and the depletion of natural resources. In the U.S., light-duty vehicles contribute significantly to transportation sector emissions, prompting a global shift toward electrified vehicles (EVs). Among the challenges that thwart the widespread adoption of EVs is the insufficient charging infrastructure (CI). This study focuses on exploring the complex relationship between EV adoption and CI growth. Employing a graph theoretic approach, we propose a graph model to analyze correlations between EV adoption and CI growth across 137 counties in six states. We examine how different time granularities impact these correlations in two distinct scenarios: Early Adoption and Late Adoption. Further, we conduct causality tests to assess the directional relationship between EV adoption and CI growth in both scenarios. Our main findings reveal that analysis using lower levels of time granularity result in more homogeneous clusters, with notable differences between clusters in EV adoption and those in CI growth. Additionally, we identify causal relationships between EV adoption and CI growth in 137 counties, and show that causality is observed more frequently in Early Adoption scenarios than in Late Adoption ones. However, the causal effects in Early Adoption are slower than those in Late Adoption.</description>

      <title>Operatorial formulation of crimo-taxis phenomena in a street</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, the ladder operators and a quantum-like approach are used to construct an operatorial version of a model dubbed crimo-taxis. In a classical framework, the crimo-taxis model is represented by reaction-diffusion partial differential equations describing a population divided into three interacting subgroups (ordinary citizens, drug users/dealers, and law enforcement personnel). In this new framework, the agents of the subgroups are modeled using annihilation, creation, and number fermionic operators, and their time evolution is assumed to be ruled by a Hermitian time-independent Hamiltonian operator suitable to capture the interactions among the subgroups. Furthermore, a recent extension of the standard Heisenberg view, namely $(\mathcal{H},\rho)$--induced dynamics, is also taken into account. Two scenarios, characterized by different initial spatial distributions of the subgroups, are considered. The results of some numerical simulations in a one--dimensional setting are presented and discussed.</description>

      <title>Easy-access online social media metrics can foster the identification of misinformation sharing users</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Misinformation poses a significant challenge studied extensively by researchers, yet acquiring data to identify primary sharers is time-consuming and challenging. To address this, we propose a low-barrier approach to differentiate social media users who are more likely to share misinformation from those who are less likely. Leveraging insights from previous studies, we demonstrate that easy-access online social network metrics -- average daily tweet count, and account age -- can be leveraged to help identify potential low factuality content spreaders on X (previously known as Twitter). We find that higher tweet frequency is positively associated with low factuality in shared content, while account age is negatively associated with it. We also find that some of the effects, namely the effect of the number of accounts followed and the number of tweets produced, differ depending on the number of followers a user has. Our findings show that relying on these easy-access social network metrics could serve as a low-barrier approach for initial identification of users who are more likely to spread misinformation, and therefore contribute to combating misinformation effectively on social media platforms.</description>

      <title>A meta-analysis of impact factors of astrophysics journals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.03342v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We calculate the 2024 impact factors for the 38 most widely used journals in Astrophysics, using the citations collated by NASA/ADS (Astrophysics Data System) and compare them to the official impact factors. This includes journals which publish papers outside of astrophysics such as PRD, EPJC, Nature, etc. We also propose a new metric to gauge the impact factor based on the median number of citations in a journal and calculate the same for all the journals. We find that the ADS-based impact factors are mostly in agreement, albeit higher than the official impact factors for most journals. The journals with the maximum fractional difference in median-based and old impact factors are JHEAP and PTEP. We find the maximum difference between the ADS and official impact factor for Nature.</description>
