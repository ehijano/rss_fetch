      <title>A Workbench for Autograding Retrieve/Generate Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13177</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13177v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This resource paper addresses the challenge of evaluating Information Retrieval (IR) systems in the era of autoregressive Large Language Models (LLMs). Traditional methods relying on passage-level judgments are no longer effective due to the diversity of responses generated by LLM-based systems. We provide a workbench to explore several alternative evaluation approaches to judge the relevance of a system's response that incorporate LLMs: 1. Asking an LLM whether the response is relevant; 2. Asking the LLM which set of nuggets (i.e., relevant key facts) is covered in the response; 3. Asking the LLM to answer a set of exam questions with the response.
  This workbench aims to facilitate the development of new, reusable test collections. Researchers can manually refine sets of nuggets and exam questions, observing their impact on system evaluation and leaderboard rankings.

      <title>Enhancing User Interest based on Stream Clustering and Memory Networks in Large-Scale Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender Systems (RSs) provide personalized recommendation service based on user interest, which are widely used in various platforms. However, there are lots of users with sparse interest due to lacking consumption behaviors, which leads to poor recommendation results for them. This problem is widespread in large-scale RSs and is particularly difficult to address. To solve this problem, we propose a novel solution named User Interest Enhancement (UIE) which enhances user interest including user profile and user history behavior sequences using the enhancement vectors and personalized enhancement vector generated based on stream clustering and memory networks from different perspectives. UIE not only remarkably improves model performance on the users with sparse interest but also significantly enhance model performance on other users. UIE is an end-to-end solution which is easy to be implemented based on ranking model. Moreover, we expand our solution and apply similar methods to long-tail items, which also achieves excellent improvement. Furthermore, we conduct extensive offline and online experiments in a large-scale industrial RS. The results demonstrate that our model outperforms other models remarkably, especially for the users with sparse interest. Until now, UIE has been fully deployed in multiple large-scale RSs and achieved remarkable improvements.</description>

      <title>Lusifer: LLM-based User SImulated Feedback Environment for online Recommender systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Training reinforcement learning-based recommender systems are often hindered by the lack of dynamic and realistic user interactions. Lusifer, a novel environment leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs), addresses this limitation by generating simulated user feedback. It synthesizes user profiles and interaction histories to simulate responses and behaviors toward recommended items. In addition, user profiles are updated after each rating to reflect evolving user characteristics. Using the MovieLens100K dataset as proof of concept, Lusifer demonstrates accurate emulation of user behavior and preferences. This paper presents Lusifer's operational pipeline, including prompt generation and iterative user profile updates. While validating Lusifer's ability to produce realistic dynamic feedback, future research could utilize this environment to train reinforcement learning systems, offering a scalable and adjustable framework for user simulation in online recommender systems.</description>

      <title>Using k-medoids for distributed approximate similarity search with arbitrary distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13795</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13795v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents GMASK, a general algorithm for distributed approximate similarity search that accepts any arbitrary distance function. GMASK requires a clustering algorithm that induces Voronoi regions in a dataset and returns a representative element for each region. Then, it creates a multilevel indexing structure suitable for large datasets with high dimensionality and sparsity, usually stored in distributed systems. Many similarity search algorithms rely on $k$-means, typically associated with the Euclidean distance, which is inappropriate for specific problems. Instead, in this work we implement GMASK using $k$-medoids to make it compatible with any distance and a wider range of problems. Experimental results verify the applicability of this method with real datasets, improving the performance of alternative algorithms for approximate similarity search. In addition, results confirm existing intuitions regarding the advantages of using certain instances of the Minkowski distance in high-dimensional datasets.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-Based Cloud-Edge-Device Collaborative Learning for Next POI Recommendations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13811</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13811v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rapid expansion of Location-Based Social Networks (LBSNs) has highlighted the importance of effective next Point-of-Interest (POI) recommendations, which leverage historical check-in data to predict users' next POIs to visit. Traditional centralized deep neural networks (DNNs) offer impressive POI recommendation performance but face challenges due to privacy concerns and limited timeliness. In response, on-device POI recommendations have been introduced, utilizing federated learning (FL) and decentralized approaches to ensure privacy and recommendation timeliness. However, these methods often suffer from computational strain on devices and struggle to adapt to new users and regions. This paper introduces a novel collaborative learning framework, Diffusion-Based Cloud-Edge-Device Collaborative Learning for Next POI Recommendations (DCPR), leveraging the diffusion model known for its success across various domains. DCPR operates with a cloud-edge-device architecture to offer region-specific and highly personalized POI recommendations while reducing on-device computational burdens. DCPR minimizes on-device computational demands through a unique blend of global and local learning processes. Our evaluation with two real-world datasets demonstrates DCPR's superior performance in recommendation accuracy, efficiency, and adaptability to new users and regions, marking a significant step forward in on-device POI recommendation technology.</description>

      <title>Generative AI Search Engines as Arbiters of Public Knowledge: An Audit of Bias and Authority</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper reports on an audit study of generative AI systems (ChatGPT, Bing Chat, and Perplexity) which investigates how these new search engines construct responses and establish authority for topics of public importance. We collected system responses using a set of 48 authentic queries for 4 topics over a 7-day period and analyzed the data using sentiment analysis, inductive coding and source classification. Results provide an overview of the nature of system responses across these systems and provide evidence of sentiment bias based on the queries and topics, and commercial and geographic bias in sources. The quality of sources used to support claims is uneven, relying heavily on News and Media, Business and Digital Media websites. Implications for system users emphasize the need to critically examine Generative AI system outputs when making decisions related to public interest and personal well-being.</description>

      <title>Identifying Breakdowns in Conversational Recommender Systems using User Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14249</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14249v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a methodology to systematically test conversational recommender systems with regards to conversational breakdowns. It involves examining conversations generated between the system and simulated users for a set of pre-defined breakdown types, extracting responsible conversational paths, and characterizing them in terms of the underlying dialogue intents. User simulation offers the advantages of simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and time efficiency for obtaining conversations where potential breakdowns can be identified. The proposed methodology can be used as diagnostic tool as well as a development tool to improve conversational recommendation systems. We apply our methodology in a case study with an existing conversational recommender system and user simulator, demonstrating that with just a few iterations, we can make the system more robust to conversational breakdowns.</description>

      <title>ASI++: Towards Distributionally Balanced End-to-End Generative Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generative retrieval, a promising new paradigm in information retrieval, employs a seq2seq model to encode document features into parameters and decode relevant document identifiers (IDs) based on search queries. Existing generative retrieval solutions typically rely on a preprocessing stage to pre-define document IDs, which can suffer from a semantic gap between these IDs and the retrieval task. However, end-to-end training for both ID assignments and retrieval tasks is challenging due to the long-tailed distribution characteristics of real-world data, resulting in inefficient and unbalanced ID space utilization. To address these issues, we propose ASI++, a novel fully end-to-end generative retrieval method that aims to simultaneously learn balanced ID assignments and improve retrieval performance. ASI++ builds on the fully end-to-end training framework of vanilla ASI and introduces several key innovations. First, a distributionally balanced criterion addresses the imbalance in ID assignments, promoting more efficient utilization of the ID space. Next, a representation bottleneck criterion enhances dense representations to alleviate bottlenecks in learning ID assignments. Finally, an information consistency criterion integrates these processes into a joint optimization framework grounded in information theory. We further explore various module structures for learning ID assignments, including neural quantization, differentiable product quantization, and residual quantization. Extensive experiments on both public and industrial datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of ASI++ in improving retrieval performance and achieving balanced ID assignments.</description>

      <title>Look into the Future: Deep Contextualized Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequential recommendation focuses on mining useful patterns from the user behavior history to better estimate his preference on the candidate items. Previous solutions adopt recurrent networks or retrieval methods to obtain the user's profile representation so as to perform the preference estimation. In this paper, we propose a novel framework of sequential recommendation called Look into the Future (LIFT), which builds and leverages the contexts of sequential recommendation. The context in LIFT refers to a user's current profile that can be represented based on both past and future behaviors. As such, the learned context will be more effective in predicting the user's behaviors in sequential recommendation. Apparently, it is impossible to use real future information to predict the current behavior, we thus propose a novel retrieval-based framework to use the most similar interaction's future information as the future context of the target interaction without data leakage. Furthermore, in order to exploit the intrinsic information embedded within the context itself, we introduce an innovative pretraining methodology incorporating behavior masking. This approach is designed to facilitate the efficient acquisition of context representations. We demonstrate that finding relevant contexts from the global user pool via retrieval methods will greatly improve preference estimation performance. In our extensive experiments over real-world datasets, LIFT demonstrates significant performance improvement on click-through rate prediction tasks in sequential recommendation over strong baselines.</description>

      <title>Top-Down Partitioning for Efficient List-Wise Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14589</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14589v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly impacted many facets of natural language processing and information retrieval. Unlike previous encoder-based approaches, the enlarged context window of these generative models allows for ranking multiple documents at once, commonly called list-wise ranking. However, there are still limits to the number of documents that can be ranked in a single inference of the model, leading to the broad adoption of a sliding window approach to identify the k most relevant items in a ranked list. We argue that the sliding window approach is not well-suited for list-wise re-ranking because it (1) cannot be parallelized in its current form, (2) leads to redundant computational steps repeatedly re-scoring the best set of documents as it works its way up the initial ranking, and (3) prioritizes the lowest-ranked documents for scoring rather than the highest-ranked documents by taking a bottom-up approach. Motivated by these shortcomings and an initial study that shows list-wise rankers are biased towards relevant documents at the start of their context window, we propose a novel algorithm that partitions a ranking to depth k and processes documents top-down. Unlike sliding window approaches, our algorithm is inherently parallelizable due to the use of a pivot element, which can be compared to documents down to an arbitrary depth concurrently. In doing so, we reduce the number of expected inference calls by around 33% when ranking at depth 100 while matching the performance of prior approaches across multiple strong re-rankers.</description>

Abstract: This paper demonstrates RAGE, an interactive tool for explaining Large Language Models (LLMs) augmented with retrieval capabilities; i.e., able to query external sources and pull relevant information into their input context. Our explanations are counterfactual in the sense that they identify parts of the input context that, when removed, change the answer to the question posed to the LLM. RAGE includes pruning methods to navigate the vast space of possible explanations, allowing users to view the provenance of the produced answers.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Recent Advances in Conversational Data Generation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13003v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in conversational systems have significantly enhanced human-machine interactions across various domains. However, training these systems is challenging due to the scarcity of specialized dialogue data. Traditionally, conversational datasets were created through crowdsourcing, but this method has proven costly, limited in scale, and labor-intensive. As a solution, the development of synthetic dialogue data has emerged, utilizing techniques to augment existing datasets or convert textual resources into conversational formats, providing a more efficient and scalable approach to dataset creation. In this survey, we offer a systematic and comprehensive review of multi-turn conversational data generation, focusing on three types of dialogue systems: open domain, task-oriented, and information-seeking. We categorize the existing research based on key components like seed data creation, utterance generation, and quality filtering methods, and introduce a general framework that outlines the main principles of conversation data generation systems. Additionally, we examine the evaluation metrics and methods for assessing synthetic conversational data, address current challenges in the field, and explore potential directions for future research. Our goal is to accelerate progress for researchers and practitioners by presenting an overview of state-of-the-art methods and highlighting opportunities to further research in this area.</description>

      <title>IM-RAG: Multi-Round Retrieval-Augmented Generation Through Learning Inner Monologues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Although the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) paradigms can use external knowledge to enhance and ground the outputs of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mitigate generative hallucinations and static knowledge base problems, they still suffer from limited flexibility in adopting Information Retrieval (IR) systems with varying capabilities, constrained interpretability during the multi-round retrieval process, and a lack of end-to-end optimization. To address these challenges, we propose a novel LLM-centric approach, IM-RAG, that integrates IR systems with LLMs to support multi-round RAG through learning Inner Monologues (IM, i.e., the human inner voice that narrates one's thoughts). During the IM process, the LLM serves as the core reasoning model (i.e., Reasoner) to either propose queries to collect more information via the Retriever or to provide a final answer based on the conversational context. We also introduce a Refiner that improves the outputs from the Retriever, effectively bridging the gap between the Reasoner and IR modules with varying capabilities and fostering multi-round communications. The entire IM process is optimized via Reinforcement Learning (RL) where a Progress Tracker is incorporated to provide mid-step rewards, and the answer prediction is further separately optimized via Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT). We conduct extensive experiments with the HotPotQA dataset, a popular benchmark for retrieval-based, multi-step question-answering. The results show that our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance while providing high flexibility in integrating IR modules as well as strong interpretability exhibited in the learned inner monologues.</description>

      <title>Case-Based Reasoning Approach for Solving Financial Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13044v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring a machine's understanding of human language often involves assessing its reasoning skills, i.e. logical process of deriving answers to questions. While recent language models have shown remarkable proficiency in text based tasks, their efficacy in complex reasoning problems involving heterogeneous information such as text, tables, and numbers remain uncertain. Addressing this gap, FinQA introduced a numerical reasoning dataset for financial documents and simultaneously proposed a program generation approach . Our investigation reveals that half of the errors (48%) stem from incorrect operations being generated. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach to tackle numerical reasoning problems using case based reasoning (CBR), an artificial intelligence paradigm that provides problem solving guidance by offering similar cases (i.e. similar questions and corresponding logical programs). Our model retrieves relevant cases to address a given question, and then generates an answer based on the retrieved cases and contextual information. Through experiments on the FinQA dataset, we demonstrate competitive performance of our approach and additionally show that by expanding case repository, we can help solving complex multi step programs which FinQA showed weakness of.</description>

      <title>DEGAP: Dual Event-Guided Adaptive Prefixes for Templated-Based Event Argument Extraction Model with Slot Querying</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in event argument extraction (EAE) involve incorporating beneficial auxiliary information into models during training and inference, such as retrieved instances and event templates. Additionally, some studies introduce learnable prefix vectors to models. These methods face three challenges: (1) insufficient utilization of relevant event instances due to deficiencies in retrieval; (2) neglect of important information provided by relevant event templates; (3) the advantages of prefixes are constrained due to their inability to meet the specific informational needs of EAE. In this work, we propose DEGAP, which addresses the above challenges through two simple yet effective components: (1) dual prefixes, where the instance-oriented prefix and template-oriented prefix are trained to learn information from different event instances and templates, respectively, and then provide relevant information as cues to EAE model without retrieval; (2) event-guided adaptive gating mechanism, which guides the prefixes based on the target event to fully leverage their advantages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves new state-of-the-art performance on four datasets (ACE05, RAMS, WIKIEVENTS, and MLEE). Further analysis verifies the importance of the proposed design and the effectiveness of the main components.</description>

      <title>Knowledge-Driven Cross-Document Relation Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13546v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Relation extraction (RE) is a well-known NLP application often treated as a sentence- or document-level task. However, a handful of recent efforts explore it across documents or in the cross-document setting (CrossDocRE). This is distinct from the single document case because different documents often focus on disparate themes, while text within a document tends to have a single goal. Linking findings from disparate documents to identify new relationships is at the core of the popular literature-based knowledge discovery paradigm in biomedicine and other domains. Current CrossDocRE efforts do not consider domain knowledge, which are often assumed to be known to the reader when documents are authored. Here, we propose a novel approach, KXDocRE, that embed domain knowledge of entities with input text for cross-document RE. Our proposed framework has three main benefits over baselines: 1) it incorporates domain knowledge of entities along with documents' text; 2) it offers interpretability by producing explanatory text for predicted relations between entities 3) it improves performance over the prior methods.</description>

      <title>FlashRAG: A Modular Toolkit for Efficient Retrieval-Augmented Generation Research</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13576v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: With the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), the potential of Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques have garnered considerable research attention. Numerous novel algorithms and models have been introduced to enhance various aspects of RAG systems. However, the absence of a standardized framework for implementation, coupled with the inherently intricate RAG process, makes it challenging and time-consuming for researchers to compare and evaluate these approaches in a consistent environment. Existing RAG toolkits like LangChain and LlamaIndex, while available, are often heavy and unwieldy, failing to meet the personalized needs of researchers. In response to this challenge, we propose FlashRAG, an efficient and modular open-source toolkit designed to assist researchers in reproducing existing RAG methods and in developing their own RAG algorithms within a unified framework. Our toolkit implements 12 advanced RAG methods and has gathered and organized 32 benchmark datasets. Our toolkit has various features, including customizable modular framework, rich collection of pre-implemented RAG works, comprehensive datasets, efficient auxiliary pre-processing scripts, and extensive and standard evaluation metrics. Our toolkit and resources are available at https://github.com/RUC-NLPIR/FlashRAG.</description>

      <title>From the evolution of public data ecosystems to the evolving horizons of the forward-looking intelligent public data ecosystem empowered by emerging technologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Public data ecosystems (PDEs) represent complex socio-technical systems crucial for optimizing data use in the public sector and outside it. Recognizing their multifaceted nature, previous research pro-posed a six-generation Evolutionary Model of Public Data Ecosystems (EMPDE). Designed as a result of a systematic literature review on the topic spanning three decade, this model, while theoretically robust, necessitates empirical validation to enhance its practical applicability. This study addresses this gap by validating the theoretical model through a real-life examination in five European countries - Latvia, Serbia, Czech Republic, Spain, and Poland. This empirical validation provides insights into PDEs dynamics and variations of implementations across contexts, particularly focusing on the 6th generation of forward-looking PDE generation named "Intelligent Public Data Generation" that represents a paradigm shift driven by emerging technologies such as cloud computing, Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing tools, Generative AI, and Large Language Models (LLM) with potential to contribute to both automation and augmentation of business processes within these ecosystems. By transcending their traditional status as a mere component, evolving into both an actor and a stakeholder simultaneously, these technologies catalyze innovation and progress, enhancing PDE management strategies to align with societal, regulatory, and technical imperatives in the digital era.</description>

      <title>Automated Evaluation of Retrieval-Augmented Language Models with Task-Specific Exam Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new method to measure the task-specific accuracy of Retrieval-Augmented Large Language Models (RAG). Evaluation is performed by scoring the RAG on an automatically-generated synthetic exam composed of multiple choice questions based on the corpus of documents associated with the task. Our method is an automated, cost-efficient, interpretable, and robust strategy to select the optimal components for a RAG system. We leverage Item Response Theory (IRT) to estimate the quality of an exam and its informativeness on task-specific accuracy. IRT also provides a natural way to iteratively improve the exam by eliminating the exam questions that are not sufficiently informative about a model's ability. We demonstrate our approach on four new open-ended Question-Answering tasks based on Arxiv abstracts, StackExchange questions, AWS DevOps troubleshooting guides, and SEC filings. In addition, our experiments reveal more general insights into factors impacting RAG performance like size, retrieval mechanism, prompting and fine-tuning. Most notably, our findings show that choosing the right retrieval algorithms often leads to bigger performance gains than simply using a larger language model.</description>

      <title>xRAG: Extreme Context Compression for Retrieval-augmented Generation with One Token</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13792</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13792v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces xRAG, an innovative context compression method tailored for retrieval-augmented generation. xRAG reinterprets document embeddings in dense retrieval--traditionally used solely for retrieval--as features from the retrieval modality. By employing a modality fusion methodology, xRAG seamlessly integrates these embeddings into the language model representation space, effectively eliminating the need for their textual counterparts and achieving an extreme compression rate. In xRAG, the only trainable component is the modality bridge, while both the retriever and the language model remain frozen. This design choice allows for the reuse of offline-constructed document embeddings and preserves the plug-and-play nature of retrieval augmentation. Experimental results demonstrate that xRAG achieves an average improvement of over 10% across six knowledge-intensive tasks, adaptable to various language model backbones, ranging from a dense 7B model to an 8x7B Mixture of Experts configuration. xRAG not only significantly outperforms previous context compression methods but also matches the performance of uncompressed models on several datasets, while reducing overall FLOPs by a factor of 3.53. Our work pioneers new directions in retrieval-augmented generation from the perspective of multimodality fusion, and we hope it lays the foundation for future efficient and scalable retrieval-augmented systems</description>

      <title>AutoLCZ: Towards Automatized Local Climate Zone Mapping from Rule-Based Remote Sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13993v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Local climate zones (LCZs) established a standard classification system to categorize the landscape universe for improved urban climate studies. Existing LCZ mapping is guided by human interaction with geographic information systems (GIS) or modelled from remote sensing (RS) data. GIS-based methods do not scale to large areas. However, RS-based methods leverage machine learning techniques to automatize LCZ classification from RS. Yet, RS-based methods require huge amounts of manual labels for training.
  We propose a novel LCZ mapping framework, termed AutoLCZ, to extract the LCZ classification features from high-resolution RS modalities. We study the definition of numerical rules designed to mimic the LCZ definitions. Those rules model geometric and surface cover properties from LiDAR data. Correspondingly, we enable LCZ classification from RS data in a GIS-based scheme. The proposed AutoLCZ method has potential to reduce the human labor to acquire accurate metadata. At the same time, AutoLCZ sheds light on the physical interpretability of RS-based methods. In a proof-of-concept for New York City (NYC) we leverage airborne LiDAR surveys to model 4 LCZ features to distinguish 10 LCZ types. The results indicate the potential of AutoLCZ as promising avenue for large-scale LCZ mapping from RS data.</description>

      <title>RaFe: Ranking Feedback Improves Query Rewriting for RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: As Large Language Models (LLMs) and Retrieval Augmentation Generation (RAG) techniques have evolved, query rewriting has been widely incorporated into the RAG system for downstream tasks like open-domain QA. Many works have attempted to utilize small models with reinforcement learning rather than costly LLMs to improve query rewriting. However, current methods require annotations (e.g., labeled relevant documents or downstream answers) or predesigned rewards for feedback, which lack generalization, and fail to utilize signals tailored for query rewriting. In this paper, we propose ours, a framework for training query rewriting models free of annotations. By leveraging a publicly available reranker, ours~provides feedback aligned well with the rewriting objectives. Experimental results demonstrate that ours~can obtain better performance than baselines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14594v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present data augmentation techniques for process extraction tasks in scientific publications. We cast the process extraction task as a sequence labeling task where we identify all the entities in a sentence and label them according to their process-specific roles. The proposed method attempts to create meaningful augmented sentences by utilizing (1) process-specific information from the original sentence, (2) role label similarity, and (3) sentence similarity. We demonstrate that the proposed methods substantially improve the performance of the process extraction model trained on chemistry domain datasets, up to 12.3 points improvement in performance accuracy (F-score). The proposed methods could potentially reduce overfitting as well, especially when training on small datasets or in a low-resource setting such as in chemistry and other scientific domains.</description>

      <title>Push and Pull: A Framework for Measuring Attentional Agency</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.14614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a framework for measuring attentional agency - the ability to allocate one's attention according to personal desires, goals, and intentions - on digital platforms. Platforms extend people's limited powers of attention by extrapolating their preferences to large collections of previously unconsidered informational objects. However, platforms typically also allow people to influence one another's attention. We introduce a formal framework for measuring how much a given platform empowers people to both pull information into their own attentional field and push information into the attentional fields of others. We also use these definitions to shed light on the implications of generative foundation models, which enable users to bypass the implicit "attentional bargain" that underlies embedded advertising and other methods for capturing economic value from informational goods. We conclude with a set of policy strategies that can be used to understand and reshape the distribution of attentional agency online.</description>

      <title>WISE: Rethinking the Knowledge Memory for Lifelong Model Editing of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14768</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14768v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) need knowledge updates to meet the ever-growing world facts and correct the hallucinated responses, facilitating the methods of lifelong model editing. Where the updated knowledge resides in memories is a fundamental question for model editing. In this paper, we find that editing either long-term memory (direct model parameters) or working memory (non-parametric knowledge of neural network activations/representations by retrieval) will result in an impossible triangle -- reliability, generalization, and locality can not be realized together in the lifelong editing settings. For long-term memory, directly editing the parameters will cause conflicts with irrelevant pretrained knowledge or previous edits (poor reliability and locality). For working memory, retrieval-based activations can hardly make the model understand the edits and generalize (poor generalization). Therefore, we propose WISE to bridge the gap between memories. In WISE, we design a dual parametric memory scheme, which consists of the main memory for the pretrained knowledge and a side memory for the edited knowledge. We only edit the knowledge in the side memory and train a router to decide which memory to go through when given a query. For continual editing, we devise a knowledge-sharding mechanism where different sets of edits reside in distinct subspaces of parameters, and are subsequently merged into a shared memory without conflicts. Extensive experiments show that WISE can outperform previous model editing methods and overcome the impossible triangle under lifelong model editing of question answering, hallucination, and out-of-distribution settings across trending LLM architectures, e.g., GPT, LLaMA, and Mistral.

Abstract: Accurate modeling of the diverse and dynamic interests of users remains a significant challenge in the design of personalized recommender systems. Existing user modeling methods, like single-point and multi-point representations, have limitations w.r.t.\ accuracy, diversity, and adaptability. To overcome these deficiencies, we introduce density-based user representations (DURs), a novel method that leverages Gaussian process regression (GPR) for effective multi-interest recommendation and retrieval. Our approach, GPR4DUR, exploits DURs to capture user interest variability without manual tuning, incorporates uncertainty-awareness, and scales well to large numbers of users. Experiments using real-world offline datasets confirm the adaptability and efficiency of GPR4DUR, while online experiments with simulated users demonstrate its ability to address the exploration-exploitation trade-off by effectively utilizing model uncertainty.</description>

Abstract: Recent advances in large language models have enabled the development of viable generative retrieval systems. Instead of a traditional document ranking, generative retrieval systems often directly return a grounded generated text as a response to a query. Quantifying the utility of the textual responses is essential for appropriately evaluating such generative ad hoc retrieval. Yet, the established evaluation methodology for ranking-based ad hoc retrieval is not suited for the reliable and reproducible evaluation of generated responses. To lay a foundation for developing new evaluation methods for generative retrieval systems, we survey the relevant literature from the fields of information retrieval and natural language processing, identify search tasks and system architectures in generative retrieval, develop a new user model, and study its operationalization.</description>

      <title>ID Embedding as Subtle Features of Content and Structure for Multimodal Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05956v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multimodal recommendation aims to model user and item representations comprehensively with the involvement of multimedia content for effective recommendations. Existing research has shown that it is beneficial for recommendation performance to combine (user- and item-) ID embeddings with multimodal salient features, indicating the value of IDs. However, there is a lack of a thorough analysis of the ID embeddings in terms of feature semantics in the literature. In this paper, we revisit the value of ID embeddings for multimodal recommendation and conduct a thorough study regarding its semantics, which we recognize as subtle features of \emph{content} and \emph{structure}. Based on our findings, we propose a novel recommendation model by incorporating ID embeddings to enhance the salient features of both content and structure. Specifically, we put forward a hierarchical attention mechanism to incorporate ID embeddings in modality fusing, coupled with contrastive learning, to enhance content representations. Meanwhile, we propose a lightweight graph convolution network for each modality to amalgamate neighborhood and ID embeddings for improving structural representations. Finally, the content and structure representations are combined to form the ultimate item embedding for recommendation. Extensive experiments on three real-world datasets (Baby, Sports, and Clothing) demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art multimodal recommendation methods and the effectiveness of fine-grained ID embeddings. Our code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/IDSF-code/.</description>

      <title>Scaling User Modeling: Large-scale Online User Representations for Ads Personalization in Meta</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Effective user representations are pivotal in personalized advertising. However, stringent constraints on training throughput, serving latency, and memory, often limit the complexity and input feature set of online ads ranking models. This challenge is magnified in extensive systems like Meta's, which encompass hundreds of models with diverse specifications, rendering the tailoring of user representation learning for each model impractical. To address these challenges, we present Scaling User Modeling (SUM), a framework widely deployed in Meta's ads ranking system, designed to facilitate efficient and scalable sharing of online user representation across hundreds of ads models. SUM leverages a few designated upstream user models to synthesize user embeddings from massive amounts of user features with advanced modeling techniques. These embeddings then serve as inputs to downstream online ads ranking models, promoting efficient representation sharing. To adapt to the dynamic nature of user features and ensure embedding freshness, we designed SUM Online Asynchronous Platform (SOAP), a latency free online serving system complemented with model freshness and embedding stabilization, which enables frequent user model updates and online inference of user embeddings upon each user request. We share our hands-on deployment experiences for the SUM framework and validate its superiority through comprehensive experiments. To date, SUM has been launched to hundreds of ads ranking models in Meta, processing hundreds of billions of user requests daily, yielding significant online metric gains and improved infrastructure efficiency.</description>

      <title>Adversarial Item Promotion on Visually-Aware Recommender Systems by Guided Diffusion</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.15826v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Visually-aware recommender systems have found widespread application in domains where visual elements significantly contribute to the inference of users' potential preferences. While the incorporation of visual information holds the promise of enhancing recommendation accuracy and alleviating the cold-start problem, it is essential to point out that the inclusion of item images may introduce substantial security challenges. Some existing works have shown that the item provider can manipulate item exposure rates to its advantage by constructing adversarial images. However, these works cannot reveal the real vulnerability of visually-aware recommender systems because (1) The generated adversarial images are markedly distorted, rendering them easily detectable by human observers; (2) The effectiveness of the attacks is inconsistent and even ineffective in some scenarios. To shed light on the real vulnerabilities of visually-aware recommender systems when confronted with adversarial images, this paper introduces a novel attack method, IPDGI (Item Promotion by Diffusion Generated Image). Specifically, IPDGI employs a guided diffusion model to generate adversarial samples designed to deceive visually-aware recommender systems. Taking advantage of accurately modeling benign images' distribution by diffusion models, the generated adversarial images have high fidelity with original images, ensuring the stealth of our IPDGI. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, we conduct extensive experiments on two commonly used e-commerce recommendation datasets (Amazon Beauty and Amazon Baby) with several typical visually-aware recommender systems. The experimental results show that our attack method has a significant improvement in both the performance of promoting the long-tailed (i.e., unpopular) items and the quality of generated adversarial images.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.09034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has gained traction for enhancing user long-term experiences in recommender systems by effectively exploring users' interests. However, modern recommender systems exhibit distinct user behavioral patterns among tens of millions of items, which increases the difficulty of exploration. For example, user behaviors with different activity levels require varying intensity of exploration, while previous studies often overlook this aspect and apply a uniform exploration strategy to all users, which ultimately hurts user experiences in the long run. To address these challenges, we propose User-Oriented Exploration Policy (UOEP), a novel approach facilitating fine-grained exploration among user groups. We first construct a distributional critic which allows policy optimization under varying quantile levels of cumulative reward feedbacks from users, representing user groups with varying activity levels. Guided by this critic, we devise a population of distinct actors aimed at effective and fine-grained exploration within its respective user group. To simultaneously enhance diversity and stability during the exploration process, we further introduce a population-level diversity regularization term and a supervision module. Experimental results on public recommendation datasets demonstrate that our approach outperforms all other baselines in terms of long-term performance, validating its user-oriented exploration effectiveness. Meanwhile, further analyses reveal our approach's benefits of improved performance for low-activity users as well as increased fairness among users.</description>

Abstract: Recommender systems (RSs) have become an essential tool for mitigating information overload in a range of real-world applications. Recent trends in RSs have revealed a major paradigm shift, moving the spotlight from model-centric innovations to data-centric efforts (e.g., improving data quality and quantity). This evolution has given rise to the concept of data-centric recommender systems (Data-Centric RSs), marking a significant development in the field. This survey provides the first systematic overview of Data-Centric RSs, covering 1) the foundational concepts of recommendation data and Data-Centric RSs; 2) three primary issues of recommendation data; 3) recent research developed to address these issues; and 4) several potential future directions of Data-Centric RSs.</description>

      <title>Leveraging LLMs for Unsupervised Dense Retriever Ranking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04853</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04853v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we present Large Language Model Assisted Retrieval Model Ranking (LARMOR), an effective unsupervised approach that leverages LLMs for selecting which dense retriever to use on a test corpus (target). Dense retriever selection is crucial for many IR applications that rely on using dense retrievers trained on public corpora to encode or search a new, private target corpus. This is because when confronted with domain shift, where the downstream corpora, domains, or tasks of the target corpus differ from the domain/task the dense retriever was trained on, its performance often drops. Furthermore, when the target corpus is unlabeled, e.g., in a zero-shot scenario, the direct evaluation of the model on the target corpus becomes unfeasible. Unsupervised selection of the most effective pre-trained dense retriever becomes then a crucial challenge. Current methods for dense retriever selection are insufficient in handling scenarios with domain shift. Our proposed solution leverages LLMs to generate pseudo-relevant queries, labels and reference lists based on a set of documents sampled from the target corpus. Dense retrievers are then ranked based on their effectiveness on these generated pseudo-relevant signals. Notably, our method is the first approach that relies solely on the target corpus, eliminating the need for both training corpora and test labels. To evaluate the effectiveness of our method, we construct a large pool of state-of-the-art dense retrievers. The proposed approach outperforms existing baselines with respect to both dense retriever selection and ranking. We make our code and results publicly available at https://github.com/ielab/larmor/.</description>

      <title>SPAR: Personalized Content-Based Recommendation via Long Engagement Attention</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10555</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10555v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Leveraging users' long engagement histories is essential for personalized content recommendations. The success of pretrained language models (PLMs) in NLP has led to their use in encoding user histories and candidate items, framing content recommendations as textual semantic matching tasks. However, existing works still struggle with processing very long user historical text and insufficient user-item interaction. In this paper, we introduce a content-based recommendation framework, SPAR, which effectively tackles the challenges of holistic user interest extraction from the long user engagement history. It achieves so by leveraging PLM, poly-attention layers and attention sparsity mechanisms to encode user's history in a session-based manner. The user and item side features are sufficiently fused for engagement prediction while maintaining standalone representations for both sides, which is efficient for practical model deployment. Moreover, we enhance user profiling by exploiting large language model (LLM) to extract global interests from user engagement history. Extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing state-of-the-art (SoTA) methods.</description>

      <title>Diffusion-based Contrastive Learning for Sequential Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09369v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-supervised contrastive learning, which directly extracts inherent data correlations from unlabeled data, has been widely utilized to mitigate the data sparsity issue in sequential recommendation. The majority of existing methods create different augmented views of the same user sequence via random augmentation, and subsequently minimize their distance in the embedding space to enhance the quality of user representations. However, random augmentation often disrupts the semantic information and interest evolution pattern inherent in the user sequence, leading to the generation of semantically distinct augmented views. Promoting similarity of these semantically diverse augmented sequences can render the learned user representations insensitive to variations in user preferences and interest evolution, contradicting the core learning objectives of sequential recommendation. To address this issue, we leverage the inherent characteristics of sequential recommendation and propose the use of context information to generate more reasonable augmented positive samples. Specifically, we introduce a context-aware diffusion-based contrastive learning method for sequential recommendation. Given a user sequence, our method selects certain positions and employs a context-aware diffusion model to generate alternative items for these positions with the guidance of context information. These generated items then replace the corresponding original items, creating a semantically consistent augmented view of the original sequence. Additionally, to maintain representation cohesion, item embeddings are shared between the diffusion model and the recommendation model, and the entire framework is trained in an end-to-end manner. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>Modeling User Fatigue for Sequential Recommendation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.11764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recommender systems filter out information that meets user interests. However, users may be tired of the recommendations that are too similar to the content they have been exposed to in a short historical period, which is the so-called user fatigue. Despite the significance for a better user experience, user fatigue is seldom explored by existing recommenders. In fact, there are three main challenges to be addressed for modeling user fatigue, including what features support it, how it influences user interests, and how its explicit signals are obtained. In this paper, we propose to model user Fatigue in interest learning for sequential Recommendations (FRec). To address the first challenge, based on a multi-interest framework, we connect the target item with historical items and construct an interest-aware similarity matrix as features to support fatigue modeling. Regarding the second challenge, built upon feature cross, we propose a fatigue-enhanced multi-interest fusion to capture long-term interest. In addition, we develop a fatigue-gated recurrent unit for short-term interest learning, with temporal fatigue representations as important inputs for constructing update and reset gates. For the last challenge, we propose a novel sequence augmentation to obtain explicit fatigue signals for contrastive learning. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, including two public datasets and one large-scale industrial dataset. Experimental results show that FRec can improve AUC and GAUC up to 0.026 and 0.019 compared with state-of-the-art models, respectively. Moreover, large-scale online experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FRec for fatigue reduction. Our codes are released at https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/SIGIR24-FRec.</description>

      <title>Synthetic Query Generation for Privacy-Preserving Deep Retrieval Systems using Differentially Private Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.05973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.05973v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We address the challenge of ensuring differential privacy (DP) guarantees in training deep retrieval systems. Training these systems often involves the use of contrastive-style losses, which are typically non-per-example decomposable, making them difficult to directly DP-train with since common techniques require per-example gradients. To address this issue, we propose an approach that prioritizes ensuring query privacy prior to training a deep retrieval system. Our method employs DP language models (LMs) to generate private synthetic queries representative of the original data. These synthetic queries can be used in downstream retrieval system training without compromising privacy. Our approach demonstrates a significant enhancement in retrieval quality compared to direct DP-training, all while maintaining query-level privacy guarantees. This work highlights the potential of harnessing LMs to overcome limitations in standard DP-training methods.</description>

      <title>Model Editing at Scale leads to Gradual and Catastrophic Forgetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.07453</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.07453v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Editing knowledge in large language models is an attractive capability to have which allows us to correct incorrectly learnt facts during pre-training, as well as update the model with an ever-growing list of new facts. While existing model editing techniques have shown promise, they are usually evaluated using metrics for reliability, specificity and generalization over one or few edits. We argue that for model editing to have practical utility, we must be able to make multiple edits to the same model. With this in mind, we evaluate the current model editing methods at scale, focusing on two state of the art methods: ROME and MEMIT. We find that as the model is edited sequentially with multiple facts, it continually forgets previously edited facts and the ability to perform downstream tasks. This forgetting happens in two phases -- an initial gradual but progressive forgetting phase followed by abrupt or catastrophic forgetting phase. Both gradual and catastrophic forgetting limit the usefulness of model editing methods at scale -- the former making model editing less effective as multiple edits are made to the model while the latter caps the scalability of such model editing methods. Our analysis also highlights other key limitations of ROME and MEMIT at scale. With our work, we push for the development and evaluation of model editing methods keeping scalability in mind.</description>

      <title>ChatQA: Surpassing GPT-4 on Conversational QA and RAG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10225</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10225v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce ChatQA, a suite of models that outperform GPT-4 on retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and conversational question answering (QA). To enhance generation, we propose a two-stage instruction tuning method that significantly boosts the performance of RAG. For effective retrieval, we introduce a dense retriever optimized for conversational QA, which yields results comparable to the alternative state-of-the-art query rewriting models, while substantially reducing deployment costs. We also present the ChatRAG Bench, which encompasses ten datasets covering comprehensive evaluations on RAG, table-related QA, arithmetic calculations, and scenarios involving unanswerable questions. Our ChatQA-1.0-70B (score: 54.14), built on Llama2, a weaker foundation model than GPT-4, can slightly outperform GPT-4-0613 (score: 53.90) and GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09 (score: 54.03) on the ChatRAG Bench, without relying on any synthetic data from OpenAI GPT models. Notably, the Llama3-ChatQA-1.5-70B model surpasses the accuracy of GPT-4-Turbo-2024-04-09, achieving a 4.4% improvement. To advance research in this field, we open-sourced the model weights, instruction tuning data, ChatRAG Bench, and retriever for the community: https://chatqa-project.github.io/.</description>

      <title>Learning Social Graph for Inactive User Recommendation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05288</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05288v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Social relations have been widely incorporated into recommender systems to alleviate data sparsity problem. However, raw social relations don't always benefit recommendation due to their inferior quality and insufficient quantity, especially for inactive users, whose interacted items are limited. In this paper, we propose a novel social recommendation method called LSIR (\textbf{L}earning \textbf{S}ocial Graph for \textbf{I}nactive User \textbf{R}ecommendation) that learns an optimal social graph structure for social recommendation, especially for inactive users. LSIR recursively aggregates user and item embeddings to collaboratively encode item and user features. Then, graph structure learning (GSL) is employed to refine the raw user-user social graph, by removing noisy edges and adding new edges based on the enhanced embeddings. Meanwhile, mimic learning is implemented to guide active users in mimicking inactive users during model training, which improves the construction of new edges for inactive users. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate that LSIR achieves significant improvements of up to 129.58\% on NDCG in inactive user recommendation.
