      <title>Tool-Assisted Conformance Checking to Reference Process Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00738</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00738v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reference models convey best practices and standards. The reference frameworks necessitate conformance checks to ensure adherence to established guidelines and principles, which is crucial for maintaining quality and consistency in various processes. This paper explores automated conformance checks for concrete process models against reference models using causal dependency analysis of tasks and events. Existing notions of conformance checking for process models focus on verifying process execution traces and lack the expressiveness and automation needed for semantic model comparison, leaving this question unresolved. We integrate our approach into a broader semantic framework for defining reference model conformance. We outline an algorithm for reference process model conformance checking, evaluate it through a case study, and discuss its strengths and limitations. Our research provides a tool-assisted solution enhancing accuracy and flexibility in process model conformance verification.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Symbolic Execution for Semantic Difference Analysis of Component and Connector Architectures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the context of model-driven development, ensuring the correctness and consistency of evolving models is paramount. This paper investigates the application of Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) for semantic difference analysis of component-and-connector architectures, specifically utilizing MontiArc models. We have enhanced the existing MontiArc-to-Java generator to gather both symbolic and concrete execution data at runtime, encompassing transition conditions, visited states, and internal variables of automata. This data facilitates the identification of significant execution traces that provide critical insights into system behavior. We evaluate various execution strategies based on the criteria of runtime efficiency, minimality, and completeness, establishing a framework for assessing the applicability of DSE in semantic difference analysis. Our findings indicate that while DSE shows promise for analyzing component and connector architectures, scalability remains a primary limitation, suggesting further research is needed to enhance its practical utility in larger systems.</description>

      <title>Risk-Aware Autonomous Driving with Linear Temporal Logic Specifications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09769v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human drivers naturally balance the risks of different concerns while driving, including traffic rule violations, minor accidents, and fatalities. However, achieving the same behavior in autonomous driving systems remains an open problem. This paper extends a risk metric that has been verified in human-like driving studies to encompass more complex driving scenarios specified by linear temporal logic (LTL) that go beyond just collision risks. This extension incorporates the timing and severity of events into LTL specifications, thereby reflecting a human-like risk awareness. Without sacrificing expressivity for traffic rules, we adopt LTL specifications composed of safety and co-safety formulas, allowing the control synthesis problem to be reformulated as a reachability problem. By leveraging occupation measures, we further formulate a linear programming (LP) problem for this LTL-based risk metric. Consequently, the synthesized policy balances different types of driving risks, including both collision risks and traffic rule violations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by three typical traffic scenarios in Carla simulator.</description>
