      <title>Ray geodesics and wave propagation on the Beltrami surface: Optics of an optical wormhole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10518v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates ray geodesics and wave propagation on the Beltrami surface, with a particular emphasis on the effective potentials governing photon dynamics. We derive the geodesic equations and analyze the Helmholtz equation within this curved geometry, revealing that the resulting potentials are purely repulsive. For ray trajectories, the potential is determined by wormhole parameters such as the throat radius ($\ell$), radial optical distance ($u$), scale parameter ($R$), and the angular momentum of the test field. Near the wormhole throat, the potential remains constant, preventing inward motion below a critical energy threshold, whereas at larger radial distances, it decays exponentially, allowing free propagation. In the context of wave propagation, the potential exhibits a centrifugal barrier along with a constant repulsive term at large $u$. The Beltrami surface, characterized by constant negative Gaussian curvature, serves as a model for graphene sheets and optical wormholes in condensed matter systems. These results allow us to determine the space- and frequency-dependent refractive index of the medium, providing a coherent framework for understanding photon behavior in such systems, with promising implications for material applications.</description>

      <title>A Physically Consistent Formulation of Macroscopic Electrodynamics in Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical electrodynamics in material media, while essential, faces century-old inconsistencies regarding energy, momentum, and force. This work re-examines the theory from first principles to establish a rigorous description. Applying the force-energy consistency requirement, derived from the unambiguous Maxwell-Lorentz theory for free charges, reveals profound physical inconsistencies in conventional energy balances (using $\mathbf{D}, \mathbf{H}$) and major historical energy-momentum tensors (Minkowski, Abraham, Einstein-Laub). Their critical failure lies in accounting for energy dissipation, especially in stationary matter. This analysis justifies a unique formulation where the field's energy/momentum uses the vacuum tensor $T_{EM}(\mathbf{E},\mathbf{B})$, and interaction is solely the total Lorentz force $f_{Lorentz}$ acting on the total current $J_{total}$ (incorporating material polarization $\mathbf{P}$ and magnetization $\mathbf{M}$). This framework correctly treats $\mathbf{j}_{total} \cdot \mathbf{E}$ as the universal energy exchange gateway, handling storage and dissipation consistently, and clarifies $\mathbf{D}, \mathbf{H}$ as mathematical aids, not fundamental energy carriers. Addressing force density controversies, we demonstrate via spatial averaging analysis that microscopic force distributions are inherently indeterminable in any macroscopic theory. This justifies focusing on consistent energy/momentum accounting and provides a unified, physically sound, relativistically consistent foundation for electrodynamics in matter.</description>

      <title>Electromagnetism as Space-Time Pseudo-Curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12628v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a novel framework that interprets the electromagnetic field as a manifestation of spacetime pseudo-curvature, bridging electromagnetism with the geometric principles of general relativity. By introducing modified field equations, we recover classical electromagnetic results, including Coulomb's Law, the magnetic field of a rotating sphere, and the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Additionally, this framework predicts unique phenomena, such as test-charge-dependent time dilation and length contraction, which lie outside the scope of Maxwell's electromagnetism and Quantum Electrodynamics. These results suggest new avenues for exploring the interplay between geometry and field theories in fundamental physics.</description>

      <title>Duality Symmetry in Causality Constraints for Enhanced Acoustic Absorption</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18740v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive a generalized causality constraint for acoustic reflection and transmission for a flat slab with finite thickness, via the duality transformation. It is known that achieving the upper limit of the causality constraint necessitates a critical coupling condition to optimize absorption bandwidth within a specified material thickness. However, the importance of duality symmetry has been overlooked in this context. Our analytical model demonstrates that optimal absorption in a 2-port setup not only relies on the well-established critical coupling but also requires duality symmetry, defined as the invariance under duality transformation. To verify our theoretical prediction, we have experimentally realized customized metamaterials that exhibit quasi-duality symmetry. This was achieved by inducing global degeneracy between the first-order monopole and dipole resonances, consequently realizing an exceptionally large sound absorption capacity as permitted by the proposed causality constraint. Our findings elucidate the intrinsic connection between duality symmetry and scattering causality, and they facilitate the exploitation of the untapped potential in existing passive absorbers for wave transport control.</description>
