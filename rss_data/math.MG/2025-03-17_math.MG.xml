      <title>Scalar Function Topology Divergence: Comparing Topology of 3D Objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.08364v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a new topological tool for computer vision - Scalar Function Topology Divergence (SFTD), which measures the dissimilarity of multi-scale topology between sublevel sets of two functions having a common domain. Functions can be defined on an undirected graph or Euclidean space of any dimensionality. Most of the existing methods for comparing topology are based on Wasserstein distance between persistence barcodes and they don't take into account the localization of topological features. The minimization of SFTD ensures that the corresponding topological features of scalar functions are located in the same places. The proposed tool provides useful visualizations depicting areas where functions have topological dissimilarities. We provide applications of the proposed method to 3D computer vision. In particular, experiments demonstrate that SFTD as an additional loss improves the reconstruction of cellular 3D shapes from 2D fluorescence microscopy images, and helps to identify topological errors in 3D segmentation. Additionally, we show that SFTD outperforms Betti matching loss in 2D segmentation problems.</description>

      <title>Planar tropical caustics: trivalency and convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11137v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tropical caustic of a convex domain on the plane is a canonically associated tropical analytic curve inside the domain. In this note we give a graphical proof for the classification of its intermediate vertices, implying in particular that they are always trivalent. Apart from that we explain how various known examples of tropical caustics are constructed and discuss the possibility of relaxing the convexity condition for the domain.</description>

      <title>Three quantitative versions of the P\'al inequality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.18294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.18294v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The P\'al inequality is a classical result which asserts that among all planar convex sets of given width the equilateral triangle is the one of minimal area. In this paper we prove three quantitative versions of this inequality, by quantifying how the closeness of the area of a convex set, of certain width, to the minimal value implies its closeness to the equilateral triangle. As a by-product, we also present a novel result concerning a quantitative inequality for the inradius of a set, under minimal width constraint.</description>

      <title>Norm rigidity for arithmetic and profinite groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.04125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.04125v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $A$ be a commutative ring, and assume every non-trivial ideal of $A$ has finite-index. We show that if ${\rm{SL}}_n(A)$ has bounded elementary generation then every conjugation-invariant norm on it is either discrete or precompact. If $G$ is any group satisfying this dichotomy we say that $G$ has the \emph{dichotomy property}. We relate the dichotomy property, as well as some natural variants of it, to other rigidity results in the theory of arithmetic and profinite groups such as the celebrated normal subgroup theorem of Margulis and the seminal work of Nikolov and Segal. As a consequence we derive constraints to the possible approximations of certain non residually finite central extensions of arithmetic groups, which we hope might have further applications in the study of sofic groups. In the last section we provide several open problems for further research.</description>

      <title>Maximal sections of the unit ball of $l^n_p(\mathbb{C})$ for $p &gt; 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12552v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Eskenazis, Nayar and Tkocz have shown recently some resilience of Ball's celebrated cube slicing theorem, namely its analogue in $l^n_p$ for large $p$. We show that the complex analogue, i.e. resilience of the polydisc slicing theorem proven by Oleszkiewicz and Pelczy\'nski, holds for large $p$ and small $n$, but does not hold for any $p &gt; 2$ and large $n$.</description>

      <title>Warped products and synthetic lower curvature bounds: an overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.05521v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This is a survey about the contruction of warped products between (semi-)Riemannian manifolds and metric (measure) spaces. The resulting spaces will be semi-Riemannian manifolds, metric (measure) spaces or Lorentzian metric and metric measure spaces. We present details of the contruction in each case and we will highlight important properties like fiber independence and the energy equation. Warped products behave nicely in relation with curvature lower bounds. Here we will focus on sectional and Ricci curvature lower bounds and their Lorentzian counterparts. Throughout the article we provide many examples and formulate questions and conjectures.</description>
