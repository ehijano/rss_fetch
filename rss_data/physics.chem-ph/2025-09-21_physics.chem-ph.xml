      <title>A new family of seniority-restricted coupled cluster methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a novel class of coupled cluster (CC) methods that leverage the seniority concept to enhance efficiency and accuracy in electronic structure calculations. While existing approaches, such as the pair coupled cluster doubles (pCCD) method, are limited to seniority-zero ({\Omega} = 0) wavefunctions,1 we propose a more flexible framework: seniority-restricted coupled cluster (sr-CC). This new methodology selectively constrains the seniority sectors accessible through excitation operators in the cluster expansion, enabling a more systematic exploration of electron correlation effects. By balancing computational cost and accuracy, sr-CC provides a promising pathway for advancing electronic structure theory, particularly in strongly correlated systems.</description>

      <title>DeepMech: A Machine Learning Framework for Chemical Reaction Mechanism Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Prediction of complete step-by-step chemical reaction mechanisms (CRMs) remains a major challenge. Whereas the traditional approaches in CRM tasks rely on expert-driven experiments or costly quantum chemical computations, contemporary deep learning (DL) alternatives ignore key intermediates and mechanistic steps and often suffer from hallucinations. We present DeepMech, an interpretable graph-based DL framework employing atom- and bond-level attention, guided by generalized templates of mechanistic operations (TMOps), to generate CRMs. Trained on our curated ReactMech dataset (~30K CRMs with 100K atom-mapped and mass-balanced elementary steps), DeepMech achieves 98.98+/-0.12% accuracy in predicting elementary steps and 95.94+/-0.21% in complete CRM tasks, besides maintaining high fidelity even in out-of-distribution scenarios as well as in predicting side and/or byproducts. Extension to multistep CRMs relevant to prebiotic chemistry, demonstrates the ability of DeepMech in effectively reconstructing pathways from simple primordial substrates to complex biomolecules such as serine and aldopentose. Attention analysis identifies reactive atoms/bonds in line with chemical intuition, rendering our model interpretable and suitable for reaction design.</description>

      <title>Incorporating Coulomb interactions with fixed charges in Moment Tensor Potentials and Equivariant Tensor Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we incorporate long-range electrostatic interactions in the form of the Coulomb model with fixed charges into the functional form of short-range machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), particularly in the Moment Tensor Potential and Equivariant Tensor Network potential. We show that explicit incorporation of the Coulomb interactions with fixed charges leads to a significant reduction of energy fitting errors, namely, more than four times, of short-range MLIPs trained on organic dimers of charged molecules. Furthermore, with our long-range models we demonstrate a significant improvement in the prediction of the binding curves of the organic dimers of charged molecules. Finally, we show that the results calculated with MLIPs are in good correspondence with those obtained with density functional theory for organic dimers of charged molecules.</description>

      <title>On the Hamiltonian used in Polaritonic Chemistry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15919</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Experiments have shown that strong coupling between molecular excitations and a mode of a Fabry--P\'erot cavity can significantly alter molecular properties, such as reaction rates and equilibrium constants. However, in spite of the large body of theoretical work, the mechanism behind this change is still not well understood. In order to make progress, we first take a step back and question the appropriateness of the Hamiltonian that most recent studies are based on. In particular, we investigate the dipole self-energy cross terms, which have received attention as they seem to mediate distance-independent interactions between all molecules in the cavity. However, it is often overlooked that these terms are known to cancel exactly with the intermolecular Coulombic interactions -- which on the other hand are usually neglected. In this work, we revisit how this cancellation comes about in free space and in a perfect cavity, and we discuss how the situation changes for a more realistic cavity in the framework of macroscopic QED. Finally, we discuss the implications of this cancellation for the single-mode Hamiltonian.</description>

      <title>A State-Specific Iterative Decoupling Scheme Based on Perturbation Theory for Low-Energy Electronic States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a selective and scalable extension of the multi-step Rayleigh-Schrodinger and Brillouin-Wigner perturbative scheme (see arXiv:2408.16505), designed to efficiently access the low-energy spectrum of molecular systems. The method proceeds by combining successive effective Hamiltonian diagonalizations inspired by second-order Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation theory, with a Brillouin-Wigner correction applied to individually optimized states using an updated partitioning of the Hamiltonian. At each step, a zeroth-order state is identified and progressively decoupled from the remaining higher-lying states, thereby enabling a well-conditioned Brillouin-Wigner expansion for the energy correction. In contrast to previous approaches, the method selectively targets a small number of low-lying states, significantly reducing the numerical overhead while maintaining spectroscopic accuracy. The robustness of the method is demonstrated on the LiH and H4 molecules, where accurate excitation energies are obtained for the lowest singlet states using compact model spaces, confirming its potential for realistic applications.</description>

      <title>Conformational Dynamics of 8-Oxoguanine Mispairing Reveal a Mechanism of Polymerase {\lambda} Misincorporation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15520v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Experimental evidence has shown the stability of oxygen-stress-damaged guanine, known as 8-oxoguanine. This common oxygen-damaged nucleobase is often found in the presence of reactive oxygen species and can result in the mispairing between adenine and 8-oxoguanine in a Hoogsteen pair. We have computationally investigated the role of 8-oxoguanine to support experimental results and focus the investigation towards the polymerase structure, identifying how 8-oxoguanine interacts in the polymerase environment. Quantum mechanical investigations show the Hoogsteen pairing of adenine and 8-oxoguanine is the most energetically favourable state compared to a Watson-Crick state, supporting experimental evidence. Molecular Dynamical calculation of 8-oxoguanine located in B-DNA provide an average C1' backbone spacing of 1.1 nm compared to adenine-thymine spacing of 1.05 nm but remains within the error margin, however when in the polymerase environment, 8-oxoguanine and the canonical adenine - thymine spacing match at 1.11-1.12nm spacing while 8-oxoguanine is located on the template strand, but is disrupted by tyrosine 251 while situated on the triphosphate strand. We observe that 8-oxoguanine, when paired with adenine in polymerase {\lambda}, can mimic the adenine-thymine structure, as predicted in experimental results, and thus would be misincorporated, but is strongly dependent on its conformation.</description>

      <title>Effect of correlation on the elastic scattering of slow positrons from molecules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15670</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15670v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many-body correlation plays a crucial role in the low-energy positron-molecule scattering dynamics. In the present work, we have integrated a recent model correlation potential, developed by Swann and Gribakin, with the single-center expansion method and verified its efficacy in reproducing the best of ab initio and experimental results, for both non-polar and polar molecules. Starting with the already tested molecules-hydrogen, ethylene, and acetylene with the model correlation, we extended our calculations to oxygen-containing molecules: oxygen, water, and formic acid. In order to provide a comparative study, we have also performed calculations employing the model correlation of Perdew and Zunger. Integral, differential, and momentum transfer cross sections are reported for the target molecules. Positron virtual/bound state formation is also predicted using both of the model correlations. Overall, an improved agreement of our results with the literature for the recent model suggests the approach can be employed for larger systems, where the ab initio techniques are difficult to implement.</description>

      <title>Scalable CVD Graphene Field-Effect Transistor Platform for Viral Detection: Application to COVID-19</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid and global spread of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), underscored the urgent need for fast, reliable, and adaptable diagnostic tools capable of responding to current and future viral threats. Early diagnosis is key to limiting transmission, and biosensors based on nanomaterials offer promising solutions for accurate and rapid bioanalyte detection. In this work, we present a scalable matrix of graphene-based field-effect transistors (GFETs) for the direct and rapid detection of the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. High-quality graphene is functionalized in a single step with ACE2-His, enabling detection of the spike protein with a limit of detection as low as 1 fg/mL in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). A robust statistical analysis, based on measurements from approximately 70 devices per analyte concentration, demonstrates the reproducibility and reliability of the platform. This label-free, scalable, and reproducible COVID-19 antigen sensor can be readily adapted to detect emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants or other viral pathogens, offering a flexible approach for future diagnostic applications.</description>

      <title>Mechanistic Insights into Complete Methane Oxidation on Single-Atom Pd Supported by SSZ-13 Zeolite: A First-Principles Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.15875v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Complete catalytic oxidation of methane is an effective strategy for greenhouse gas mitigation and clean energy conversion; yet, ensuring both high catalytic activity and stability with palladium-based catalysts remains a challenge. In the present work, we employed a theoretical investigation of methane oxidation over single-atom Pd supported on SSZ-13 zeolite using density functional theory calculations, combined with climbing-image nudged elastic band calculations to determine activation barriers. A systematic assessment of various Al distributions and Pd placements was carried out to identify the most stable configurations for Pd incorporation within the zeolite framework.Further, two mechanistic routes for methane activation were evaluated: (i) direct dehydrogenation under dry conditions, and (ii) O$_2$-assisted oxidative dehydrogenation. Our results demonstrate that the direct (dry) pathway is energetically demanding and overall endothermic, whereas the O$_2$ assisted route facilitates the exothermic energy profile, particularly in the C-H bond cleavage. The formation of stable hydroxyl and CO/CO$_2$ intermediates were also studied. The results emphasize the role of oxygen-rich environments in enabling the complete methane oxidation with improved thermodynamic feasibility. Moreover, we propose an alternate low-energy pathway based on O-assisted and multi-site mechanisms that reduce the overall reaction enthalpy. These insights provide the design principles for highly active and moisture-resistant Pd-zeolite catalysts for sustainable methane utilization.</description>

      <title>Near-infrared high resolution overtone spectroscopy of the hydronium ion H$_3$O$^+$: the $2\nu_3^{2+}$ and $2\nu_3^{2-}$ bands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.16009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents the rovibrational spectra of the two strongest first overtone bands of the asymmetric stretching mode $\nu_3$ ($2\nu_3^{2+}$ and $2\nu_3^{2-}$) of the hydronium ion, H$_3$O$^+$. The measurements were performed in a temperature-variable cryogenic 22 pole ion trap using leak-out spectroscopy (LOS), covering an energy range of $6750-6950$ cm$^{-1}$.
  The spectra were fit with a standard oblate symmetric top Hamiltonian and additional off-diagonal matrix elements accounting for $l$-doubling to obtain the spectroscopic constants and the band origins, which were determined to be $6845.610(14)$ cm$^{-1}$ for $2\nu_3^{2+}$ and $6878.393(13)$ cm$^{-1}$ for $2\nu_3^{2-}$.</description>

      <title>Non-hermitian Green's function theory with $N$-body interactions: the coupled-cluster similarity transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06586</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06586v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the diagrammatic theory of the irreducible self-energy and Bethe-Salpeter kernel that naturally arises within the Green's function formalism for a general $N$-body non-hermitian interaction. In this work, we focus specifically on the coupled-cluster self-energy generated by the similarity transformation of the electronic structure Hamiltonian. We develop the biorthogonal quantum theory to construct dynamical correlation functions where the time-dependence of operators is governed by a non-hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the Gell-Mann and Low theorem to include non-hermitian interactions and to generate perturbative expansions of many-body Green's functions. We introduce the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function and derive the perturbative diagrammatic expansion for the non-hermitian coupled-cluster self-energy in terms of the `non-interacting' reference Green's function, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. From the equation-of-motion of the single-particle coupled-cluster Green's function, we derive the self-consistent renormalized coupled-cluster self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[\tilde{G}]$, and demonstrate its relationship to the perturbative expansion of the self-energy, $\tilde{\Sigma}[G_0]$. Subsequently, we show that the usual electronic self-energy can be recovered from the coupled-cluster self-energy by neglecting the effects of the similarity transformation. We show how the coupled-cluster ground state energy is related to the coupled-cluster self-energy and provide an overview of the relationship between approximations for the coupled-cluster self-energy, IP/EA-EOM-CCSD and the $G_0W_0$ approximation. As a result, we introduce the CC-$G_0W_0$ self-energy by leveraging the connections between Green's function and coupled-cluster theory. Finally, we derive the diagrammatic expansion of the coupled-cluster Bethe-Salpeter kernel.</description>
