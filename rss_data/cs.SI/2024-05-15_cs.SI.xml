      <title>Influence Maximization in Hypergraphs Using A Genetic Algorithm with New Initialization and Evaluation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09185v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence maximization (IM) is a crucial optimization task related to analyzing complex networks in the real world, such as social networks, disease propagation networks, and marketing networks. Publications to date about the IM problem focus mainly on graphs, which fail to capture high-order interaction relationships from the real world. Therefore, the use of hypergraphs for addressing the IM problem has been receiving increasing attention. However, identifying the most influential nodes in hypergraphs remains challenging, mainly because nodes and hyperedges are often strongly coupled and correlated. In this paper, to effectively identify the most influential nodes, we first propose a novel hypergraph-independent cascade model that integrates the influences of both node and hyperedge failures. Afterward, we introduce genetic algorithms (GA) to identify the most influential nodes that leverage hypergraph collective influences. In the GA-based method, the hypergraph collective influence is effectively used to initialize the population, thereby enhancing the quality of initial candidate solutions. The designed fitness function considers the joint influences of both nodes and hyperedges. This ensures the optimal set of nodes with the best influence on both nodes and hyperedges to be evaluated accurately. Moreover, a new mutation operator is designed by introducing factors, i.e., the collective influence and overlapping effects of nodes in hypergraphs, to breed high-quality offspring. In the experiments, several simulations on both synthetic and real hypergraphs have been conducted, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the compared methods.</description>

      <title>A universal optimization framework based on cycle ranking for influence maximization in complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09357v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Influence maximization aims to identify a set of influential individuals, referred to as influencers, as information sources to maximize the spread of information within networks, constituting a vital combinatorial optimization problem with extensive practical applications and sustained interdisciplinary interest. Diverse approaches have been devised to efficiently address this issue, one of which involves selecting the influencers from a given centrality ranking. In this paper, we propose a novel optimization framework based on ranking basic cycles in networks, capable of selecting the influencers from diverse centrality measures. The experimental results demonstrate that, compared to directly selecting the top-k nodes from centrality sequences and other state-of-the-art optimization approaches, the new framework can expand the dissemination range by 1.5 to 3 times. Counterintuitively, it exhibits minimal hub property, with the average distance between influencers being only one-third of alternative approaches, regardless of the centrality metrics or network types. Our study not only paves the way for novel strategies in influence maximization but also underscores the unique potential of underappreciated cycle structures.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Supply Chain Resilience During Pandemic Using Agent-based Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08830</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08830v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent pandemics have highlighted vulnerabilities in our global economic systems, especially supply chains. Possible future pandemic raises a dilemma for businesses owners between short-term profitability and long-term supply chain resilience planning. In this study, we propose a novel agent-based simulation model integrating extended Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemiological model and supply and demand economic model to evaluate supply chain resilience strategies during pandemics. Using this model, we explore a range of supply chain resilience strategies under pandemic scenarios using in silico experiments. We find that a balanced approach to supply chain resilience performs better in both pandemic and non-pandemic times compared to extreme strategies, highlighting the importance of preparedness in the form of a better supply chain resilience. However, our analysis shows that the exact supply chain resilience strategy is hard to obtain for each firm and is relatively sensitive to the exact profile of the pandemic and economic state at the beginning of the pandemic. As such, we used a machine learning model that uses the agent-based simulation to estimate a near-optimal supply chain resilience strategy for a firm. The proposed model offers insights for policymakers and businesses to enhance supply chain resilience in the face of future pandemics, contributing to understanding the trade-offs between short-term gains and long-term sustainability in supply chain management before and during pandemics.</description>

      <title>Artificial Intelligence for the Internal Democracy of Political Parties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.09529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.09529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The article argues that AI can enhance the measurement and implementation of democratic processes within political parties, known as Intra-Party Democracy (IPD). It identifies the limitations of traditional methods for measuring IPD, which often rely on formal parameters, self-reported data, and tools like surveys. Such limitations lead to the collection of partial data, rare updates, and significant demands on resources. To address these issues, the article suggests that specific data management and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, such as natural language processing and sentiment analysis, can improve the measurement (ML about) and practice (ML for) of IPD. The article concludes by considering some of the principal risks of ML for IPD, including concerns over data privacy, the potential for manipulation, and the dangers of overreliance on technology.</description>

      <title>Rumor Forwarding Prediction Model Based on Uncertain Time Series</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.08493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.08493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rapid spread of rumors in social media is mainly caused by individual retweets. This paper applies uncertainty time series analysis (UTSA) to analyze a rumor retweeting behavior on Weibo. First, the rumor forwarding is modeled using uncertain time series, including order selection, parameter estimation, residual analysis, uncertainty hypothesis testing and forecast, and the validity of using uncertain time series analysis is further supported by analyzing the characteristics of the residual plot. The experimental results show that the uncertain time series can better predict the next stage of rumor forwarding. The results of the study have important practical significance for rumor management and the management of social media information dissemination.</description>
