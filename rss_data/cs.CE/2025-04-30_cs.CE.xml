      <title>Redundancy Analysis and Mitigation for Machine Learning-Based Process Monitoring of Additive Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21317v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The deployment of machine learning (ML)-based process monitoring systems has significantly advanced additive manufacturing (AM) by enabling real-time defect detection, quality assessment, and process optimization. However, redundancy is a critical yet often overlooked challenge in the deployment and operation of ML-based AM process monitoring systems. Excessive redundancy leads to increased equipment costs, compromised model performance, and high computational requirements, posing barriers to industrial adoption. However, existing research lacks a unified definition of redundancy and a systematic framework for its evaluation and mitigation. This paper defines redundancy in ML-based AM process monitoring and categorizes it into sample-level, feature-level, and model-level redundancy. A comprehensive multi-level redundancy mitigation (MLRM) framework is proposed, incorporating advanced methods such as data registration, downscaling, cross-modality knowledge transfer, and model pruning to systematically reduce redundancy while improving model performance. The framework is validated through an ML-based in-situ defect detection case study for directed energy deposition (DED), demonstrating a 91% reduction in latency, a 47% decrease in error rate, and a 99.4% reduction in storage requirements. Additionally, the proposed approach lowers sensor costs and energy consumption, enabling a lightweight, cost-effective, and scalable monitoring system. By defining redundancy and introducing a structured mitigation framework, this study establishes redundancy analysis and mitigation as a key enabler of efficient ML-based process monitoring in production environments.</description>

      <title>Security Analysis and Implementation of Cryptocurrency Systems on Blockchain 2.0</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Blockchain technology has set off a wave of decentralization in the world since its birth. The trust system constructed by blockchain technology based on cryptography algorithm and computing power provides a practical and powerful solution to solve the trust problem in human society. In order to make more convenient use of the characteristics of blockchain and build applications on it, smart contracts appear. By defining some trigger automatic execution contracts, the application space of blockchain is expanded and the foundation for the rapid development of blockchain is laid. This is blockchain 2.0. However, the programmability of smart contracts also introduces vulnerabilities. In order to cope with the insufficient security guarantee of high-value application networks running on blockchain 2.0 and smart contracts, this article will be represented by Ethereum to introduce the technical details of understanding blockchain 2.0 and the operation principle of contract virtual machines, and explain how cryptocurrencies based on blockchain 2.0 are constructed and operated. The common security problems and solutions are also discussed. Based on relevant research and on-chain practice, this paper provides a complete and comprehensive perspective to understanding cryptocurrency technology based on blockchain 2.0 and provides a reference for building more secure cryptocurrency contracts.</description>

      <title>Multi-level datasets training method in Physics-Informed Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21328v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks have emerged as a promising methodology for solving PDEs, gaining significant attention in computer science and various physics-related fields. Despite being demonstrated the ability to incorporate the physics of laws for versatile applications, PINNs still struggle with the challenging problems which are stiff to be solved and/or have high-frequency components in the solutions, resulting in accuracy and convergence issues. It may not only increase computational costs, but also lead to accuracy loss or solution divergence. In this study, an alternative approach is proposed to mitigate the above-mentioned problems. Inspired by the multi-grid method in CFD community, the underlying idea of the current approach is to efficiently remove different frequency errors via training with different levels of training samples, resulting in a simpler way to improve the training accuracy without spending time in fine-tuning of neural network structures, loss weights as well as hyperparameters. To demonstrate the efficacy of current approach, we first investigate canonical 1D ODE with high-frequency component and 2D convection-diffusion equation with V-cycle training strategy. Finally, the current method is employed for the classical benchmark problem of steady Lid-driven cavity flows at different Reynolds numbers, to investigate the applicability and efficacy for the problem involved multiple modes of high and low frequency. By virtue of various training sequence modes, improvement through predictions lead to 30% to 60% accuracy improvement. We also investigate the synergies between current method and transfer learning techniques for more challenging problems (i.e., higher Re). From the present results, it also revealed that the current framework can produce good predictions even for the case of Re=5000, demonstrating the ability to solve complex high-frequency PDEs.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.21574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is rapidly reshaping the global financial landscape, offering unprecedented opportunities to enhance customer engagement, automate complex workflows, and extract actionable insights from vast financial data. This survey provides an overview of GenAI adoption across the financial ecosystem, examining how banks, insurers, asset managers, and fintech startups worldwide are integrating large language models and other generative tools into their operations. From AI-powered virtual assistants and personalized financial advisory to fraud detection and compliance automation, GenAI is driving innovation across functions. However, this transformation comes with significant cybersecurity and ethical risks. We discuss emerging threats such as AI-generated phishing, deepfake-enabled fraud, and adversarial attacks on AI systems, as well as concerns around bias, opacity, and data misuse. The evolving global regulatory landscape is explored in depth, including initiatives by major financial regulators and international efforts to develop risk-based AI governance. Finally, we propose best practices for secure and responsible adoption - including explainability techniques, adversarial testing, auditability, and human oversight. Drawing from academic literature, industry case studies, and policy frameworks, this chapter offers a perspective on how the financial sector can harness GenAI's transformative potential while navigating the complex risks it introduces.</description>

      <title>A Review of HPC-Accelerated CFD in National Security and Defense</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07837v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using High-Performance Computing (HPC), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) now serves as an essential component in defense-related national security applications including missile interception and hypersonic propulsion as well as naval stealth optimization and urban hazard dispersion. This review combines two decades of open-source and public-domain research on HPC-accelerated CFD in defense, addressing three key questions: Which security-sensitive simulations have utilized open-source CFD frameworks such as OpenFOAM, SU2 and ADflow? Which HPC techniques, such as MPI domain decomposition and GPU acceleration together with hybrid parallelism best enhance open-source frameworks to manage large defense CFD simulations? Which technological advancements and research voids currently drive the directional development of the field? Examining several research studies sourced from NASA, DoD HPC centers, and academic institutions, scientific contributions have been classified into air, maritime, and space domains. Modular frameworks like NavyFOAM and SU2 and ADflow's adjoint-based solvers show how custom open-source solutions support workflows with rapid completion of multi-million cell simulations. The conclusion highlights new trends that combine exascale readiness with machine learning surrogate models for real-time CFD applications and interdisciplinary HPC-driven multi-physics integration to deliver practical insights for improving CFD use in defense research and development.</description>

      <title>4DGS-CC: A Contextual Coding Framework for 4D Gaussian Splatting Data Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18925v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Storage is a significant challenge in reconstructing dynamic scenes with 4D Gaussian Splatting (4DGS) data. In this work, we introduce 4DGS-CC, a contextual coding framework that compresses 4DGS data to meet specific storage constraints. Building upon the established deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method, our approach decomposes 4DGS data into 4D neural voxels and a canonical 3DGS component, which are then compressed using Neural Voxel Contextual Coding (NVCC) and Vector Quantization Contextual Coding (VQCC), respectively. Specifically, we first decompose the 4D neural voxels into distinct quantized features by separating the temporal and spatial dimensions. To losslessly compress each quantized feature, we leverage the previously compressed features from the temporal and spatial dimensions as priors and apply NVCC to generate the spatiotemporal context for contextual coding. Next, we employ a codebook to store spherical harmonics information from canonical 3DGS as quantized vectors, which are then losslessly compressed by using VQCC with the auxiliary learned hyperpriors for contextual coding, thereby reducing redundancy within the codebook. By integrating NVCC and VQCC, our contextual coding framework, 4DGS-CC, enables multi-rate 4DGS data compression tailored to specific storage requirements. Extensive experiments on three 4DGS data compression benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves an average storage reduction of approximately 12 times while maintaining rendering fidelity compared to our baseline 4DGS approach.</description>

      <title>Agentic AI Systems Applied to tasks in Financial Services: Modeling and model risk management crews</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.05439v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of large language models has ushered in a new era of agentic systems, where artificial intelligence programs exhibit remarkable autonomous decision-making capabilities across diverse domains. This paper explores agentic system workflows in the financial services industry. In particular, we build agentic crews with human-in-the-loop module that can effectively collaborate to perform complex modeling and model risk management (MRM) tasks. The modeling crew consists of a judge agent and multiple agents who perform specific tasks such as exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model selection/hyperparameter tuning, model training, model evaluation, and writing documentation. The MRM crew consists of a judge agent along with specialized agents who perform tasks such as checking compliance of modeling documentation, model replication, conceptual soundness, analysis of outcomes, and writing documentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of modeling and MRM crews by presenting a series of numerical examples applied to credit card fraud detection, credit card approval, and portfolio credit risk modeling datasets.</description>
