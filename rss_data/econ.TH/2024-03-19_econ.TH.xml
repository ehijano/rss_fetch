      <title>Learning Macroeconomic Policies based on Microfoundations: A Stackelberg Mean Field Game Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12093</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12093v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Effective macroeconomic policies play a crucial role in promoting economic growth and social stability. This paper models the optimal macroeconomic policy problem based on the \textit{Stackelberg Mean Field Game} (SMFG), where the government acts as the leader in policy-making, and large-scale households dynamically respond as followers. This modeling method captures the asymmetric dynamic game between the government and large-scale households, and interpretably evaluates the effects of macroeconomic policies based on microfoundations, which is difficult for existing methods to achieve. We also propose a solution for SMFGs, incorporating pre-training on real data and a model-free \textit{Stackelberg mean-field reinforcement learning }(SMFRL) algorithm, which operates independently of prior environmental knowledge and transitions. Our experimental results showcase the superiority of the SMFG method over other economic policies in terms of performance, efficiency-equity tradeoff, and SMFG assumption analysis. This paper significantly contributes to the domain of AI for economics by providing a powerful tool for modeling and solving optimal macroeconomic policies.</description>

      <title>Fragile Stable Matchings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show how fragile stable matchings are in a decentralized one-to-one matching setting. The classical work of Roth and Vande Vate (1990) suggests simple decentralized dynamics in which randomly-chosen blocking pairs match successively. Such decentralized interactions guarantee convergence to a stable matching. Our first theorem shows that, under mild conditions, any unstable matching -- including a small perturbation of a stable matching -- can culminate in any stable matching through these dynamics. Our second theorem highlights another aspect of fragility: stabilization may take a long time. Even in markets with a unique stable matching, where the dynamics always converge to the same matching, decentralized interactions can require an exponentially long duration to converge. A small perturbation of a stable matching may lead the market away from stability and involve a sizable proportion of mismatched participants for extended periods. Our results hold for a broad class of dynamics.</description>

      <title>When is Trust Robust?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine an economy in which interactions are more productive if agents can trust others to refrain from cheating. Some agents are scoundrels, who always cheat, while others cheat only if the cost of cheating, a decreasing function of the proportion of cheaters, is sufficiently low. The economy exhibits multiple equilibria. As the proportion of scoundrels in the economy declines, the high-trust equilibrium can be disrupted by arbitrarily small perturbations or infusions of low-trust agents, while the low-trust equilibrium becomes impervious to perturbations and infusions of high-trust agents. The resilience of trust may thus hinge upon the prevalence of scoundrels.</description>

      <title>The Best of Many Robustness Criteria in Decision Making: Formulation and Application to Robust Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12260v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In robust decision-making under non-Bayesian uncertainty, different robust optimization criteria, such as maximin performance, minimax regret, and maximin ratio, have been proposed. In many problems, all three criteria are well-motivated and well-grounded from a decision-theoretic perspective, yet different criteria give different prescriptions. This paper initiates a systematic study of overfitting to robustness criteria. How good is a prescription derived from one criterion when evaluated against another criterion? Does there exist a prescription that performs well against all criteria of interest? We formalize and study these questions through the prototypical problem of robust pricing under various information structures, including support, moments, and percentiles of the distribution of values. We provide a unified analysis of three focal robust criteria across various information structures and evaluate the relative performance of mechanisms optimized for each criterion against the others. We find that mechanisms optimized for one criterion often perform poorly against other criteria, highlighting the risk of overfitting to a particular robustness criterion. Remarkably, we show it is possible to design mechanisms that achieve good performance across all three criteria simultaneously, suggesting that decision-makers need not compromise among criteria.</description>

      <title>Attention Capture</title>

Abstract: A decision maker (DM) learns about an uncertain state via a dynamic information structure chosen by a designer and, at each history, optimally chooses between learning more and stopping to act. Thus, dynamic information structures induce joint distributions over outcomes (actions, states, and stopping times). We show there is no commitment gap: for arbitrary preferences over outcomes, designer-optimal structures can always be modified to be sequentially optimal. These modifications exploit the irreversibility of information to discipline the designer's future self. We then show all feasible distributions over outcomes are implementable with dynamic information structures for which stopping beliefs are extremal and continuation beliefs follow a deterministic path. We use these results to solve the problem of a designer with (i) nonlinear preferences over DM's stopping times: optimal structures have a block structure such that DM's indifference times coincide with the support of her stopping time; and (ii) preferences over actions and stopping times when they are additive or supermodular. Our results speak directly to the attention economy.</description>

      <title>Learning Source Biases: Multi-sourced Misspecifications and Consequences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.08740</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.08740v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study how a decision maker (DM) learns about the biases of unfamiliar information sources. Absent any friction, a rational DM uses familiar sources as yardsticks to discern the true bias of a source. If the DM has misspecified beliefs, this process fails. We derive long-run beliefs, behavior, welfare, and corresponding comparative statics when the DM holds dogmatic, incorrect beliefs about the biases of several familiar sources. The distortion due to misspecified learning aggregates misspecifications associated with familiar sources independently of sources the DM learns about. This has implications for labor market discrimination, media bias, and project finance and oversight.</description>
