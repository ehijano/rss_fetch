      <title>Inverse stochastic resonance in adaptive small-world neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03151v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Inverse stochastic resonance (ISR) is a phenomenon where noise reduces rather than increases the firing rate of a neuron, sometimes leading to complete quiescence. ISR was first experimentally verified with cerebellar Purkinje neurons. These experiments showed that ISR enables optimal information transfer between the input and output spike train of neurons. Subsequent studies demonstrated the efficiency of information processing and transfer in neural networks with small-world topology. We conducted a numerical investigation into the impact of adaptivity on ISR in a small-world network of noisy FitzHugh-Nagumo (FHN) neurons, operating in a bistable regime with a stable fixed point and a limit cycle -- a prerequisite for ISR. Our results show that the degree of ISR is highly dependent on the FHN model's timescale separation parameter $\epsilon$. The network structure undergoes dynamic adaptation via mechanisms of either spike-time-dependent plasticity (STDP) with potentiation-/depression-domination parameter $P$, or homeostatic structural plasticity (HSP) with rewiring frequency $F$. We demonstrate that both STDP and HSP amplify ISR when $\epsilon$ lies within the bistability region of FHN neurons. Specifically, at larger values of $\epsilon$ within the bistability regime, higher rewiring frequencies $F$ enhance ISR at intermediate (weak) synaptic noise intensities, while values of $P$ consistent with depression-domination (potentiation-domination) enhance (deteriorate) ISR. Moreover, although STDP and HSP parameters may jointly enhance ISR, $P$ has a greater impact on ISR compared to $F$. Our findings inform future ISR enhancement strategies in noisy artificial neural circuits, aiming to optimize information transfer between input and output spike trains in neuromorphic systems, and prompt venues for experiments in neural networks.</description>

      <title>Birth, Death, and Horizontal Flight: Malthusian flocks with an easy plane in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: I formulate the theory of three dimensional "Malthusian flocks" -- i.e., coherently moving collections of self-propelled entities (such as living creatures) which are being "born" and "dying" during their motion -- whose constituents all have a preference for having their velocity vectors lie parallel to the same two-dimensional plane. I determine the universal scaling exponents characterizing such systems exactly, finding that the dynamical exponent $z=3/2$, the "anisotropy" exponent $\zeta=3/4$, and the "roughness" exponent $\chi=-1/2$. I also give the scaling laws implied by these exponents.</description>

      <title>Dynamics of An Information Theoretic Analog of Two Masses on a Spring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this letter we investigate an information theoretic analogue of the classic two masses on spring system, arising from a physical interpretation of Friston's free energy principle in the theory of learning in a system of agents. Using methods from classical mechanics on manifolds, we define a kinetic energy term using the Fisher metric on distributions and a potential energy function defined in terms of stress on the agents' beliefs. The resulting Lagrangian (Hamiltonian) produces a variation of the classic DeGroot dynamics. In the two agent case, the potential function is defined using the Jeffrey's divergence and the resulting dynamics are characterized by a non-linear spring. These dynamics produce trajectories that resemble flows on tori but are shown numerically to produce chaos near the boundary of the space. We then investigate persuasion as an information theoretic control problem where analysis indicates that manipulating peer pressure with a fixed target is a more stable approach to altering an agent's belief than providing a slowly changing belief state that approaches the target.</description>

      <title>Predictability of viral load kinetics in the early phases of SARS-CoV-2 through a model-based approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03158</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.03158v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A pipeline to evaluate the evolution of viral dynamics based on a new model-driven approach has been developed in the present study. The proposed methods exploit real data and the multiscale structure of the infection dynamics to provide robust predictions of the epidemic dynamics. We focus on viral load kinetics whose dynamical features are typically available in the symptomatic stage of the infection. Hence, the epidemiological evolution is obtained by relying on a compartmental approach characterized by a varying infection rate to estimate early-stage viral load dynamics, of which few data are available. We test the proposed approach with real data of SARS-CoV-2 viral load kinetics collected from patients living in an Italian province. The considered database refers to early-phase infections, whose viral load kinetics are not affected by mass vaccination policies in Italy. Our contribution is devoted to provide an effective computational pipeline to evaluate in real time the evolution of infectivity. Comprehending the factors influencing the in-host viral dynamics represents a fundamental tool to provide robust public health strategies. This pilot study could be implemented in further investigations involving other respiratory viruses, to better clarify the process of viral dynamics as a preparatory action for future pandemics.</description>

      <title>A framework to identify supercritical and subcritical Turing bifurcations: Case study of a system sustaining cubic and quadratic autocatalysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17386v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we focus on an autocatalytic reaction-diffusion model and carry out multiple scale weakly nonlinear analysis. A cubic and a quadratic autocatalytic reaction system is analysed. We develop a framework to identify the critical surfaces in parameter space across which the nature of the Turing bifurcation changes from supercritical to subcritical. These are verified by direct numerical simulations of the system. Using weakly nonlinear analysis, we derive equations up to the fifth order that governs the amplitude of the spatial patterns. The limit point of the bifurcating solution is captured accurately by extending the analysis to the fifth order for the case of subcritical bifurcation. The numerical solutions are in good agreement with the predictions of the weakly nonlinear analysis for supercritical bifurcations. We show that when multiple steady states arise Turing patterns can coexist with another spatially uniform steady states. Furthermore, we show that our framework can be extended to get different patterns like squares and hexagons in a two-dimensional domain. We show that the shape of Turing patterns is influenced by the domain size. This shows that the geometry can influence the kind of patterns formed in natural systems. This study will aid the experimentalist identify operating conditions where Turing patterns can be obtained.</description>
