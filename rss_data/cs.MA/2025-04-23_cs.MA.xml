      <title>A biologically Inspired Trust Model for Open Multi-Agent Systems that is Resilient to Rapid Performance Fluctuations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Trust management provides an alternative solution for securing open, dynamic, and distributed multi-agent systems, where conventional cryptographic methods prove to be impractical. However, existing trust models face challenges related to agent mobility, changing behaviors, and the cold start problem. To address these issues we introduced a biologically inspired trust model in which trustees assess their own capabilities and store trust data locally. This design improves mobility support, reduces communication overhead, resists disinformation, and preserves privacy. Despite these advantages, prior evaluations revealed limitations of our model in adapting to provider population changes and continuous performance fluctuations. This study proposes a novel algorithm, incorporating a self-classification mechanism for providers to detect performance drops potentially harmful for the service consumers. Simulation results demonstrate that the new algorithm outperforms its original version and FIRE, a well-known trust and reputation model, particularly in handling dynamic trustee behavior. While FIRE remains competitive under extreme environmental changes, the proposed algorithm demonstrates greater adaptability across various conditions. In contrast to existing trust modeling research, this study conducts a comprehensive evaluation of our model using widely recognized trust model criteria, assessing its resilience against common trust-related attacks while identifying strengths, weaknesses, and potential countermeasures. Finally, several key directions for future research are proposed.</description>

      <title>Trustworthy Decentralized Autonomous Machines: A New Paradigm in Automation Economy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Decentralized Autonomous Machines (DAMs) represent a transformative paradigm in automation economy, integrating artificial intelligence (AI), blockchain technology, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices to create self-governing economic agents participating in Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks (DePIN). Capable of managing both digital and physical assets and unlike traditional Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), DAMs extend autonomy into the physical world, enabling trustless systems for Real and Digital World Assets (RDWAs). In this paper, we explore the technological foundations, and challenges of DAMs and argue that DAMs are pivotal in transitioning from trust-based to trustless economic models, offering scalable, transparent, and equitable solutions for asset management. The integration of AI-driven decision-making, IoT-enabled operational autonomy, and blockchain-based governance allows DAMs to decentralize ownership, optimize resource allocation, and democratize access to economic opportunities. Therefore, in this research, we highlight the potential of DAMs to address inefficiencies in centralized systems, reduce wealth disparities, and foster a post-labor economy.</description>

      <title>The Formation of Production Networks: How Supply Chains Arise from Simple Learning with Minimal Information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16010v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a model where firms determine the price at which they sell their differentiable goods, the volume that they produce, and the inputs (types and amounts) that they purchase from other firms. A steady-state production network emerges endogenously without resorting to assumptions such as equilibrium or perfect knowledge about production technologies. Through a simple version of reinforcement learning, firms with heterogeneous technologies cope with uncertainty and maximize profits. Due to this learning process, firms can adapt to shocks such as demand shifts, suppliers/clients closure, productivity changes, and production technology modifications; effectively reshaping the production network. To demonstrate the potential of this model, we analyze the upstream and downstream impact of demand and productivity shocks.</description>

      <title>Collaborative Learning of On-Device Small Model and Cloud-Based Large Model: Advances and Future Directions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The conventional cloud-based large model learning framework is increasingly constrained by latency, cost, personalization, and privacy concerns. In this survey, we explore an emerging paradigm: collaborative learning between on-device small model and cloud-based large model, which promises low-latency, cost-efficient, and personalized intelligent services while preserving user privacy. We provide a comprehensive review across hardware, system, algorithm, and application layers. At each layer, we summarize key problems and recent advances from both academia and industry. In particular, we categorize collaboration algorithms into data-based, feature-based, and parameter-based frameworks. We also review publicly available datasets and evaluation metrics with user-level or device-level consideration tailored to collaborative learning settings. We further highlight real-world deployments, ranging from recommender systems and mobile livestreaming to personal intelligent assistants. We finally point out open research directions to guide future development in this rapidly evolving field.</description>

      <title>Solving Multi-Agent Safe Optimal Control with Distributed Epigraph Form MARL</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15425v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tasks for multi-robot systems often require the robots to collaborate and complete a team goal while maintaining safety. This problem is usually formalized as a constrained Markov decision process (CMDP), which targets minimizing a global cost and bringing the mean of constraint violation below a user-defined threshold. Inspired by real-world robotic applications, we define safety as zero constraint violation. While many safe multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms have been proposed to solve CMDPs, these algorithms suffer from unstable training in this setting. To tackle this, we use the epigraph form for constrained optimization to improve training stability and prove that the centralized epigraph form problem can be solved in a distributed fashion by each agent. This results in a novel centralized training distributed execution MARL algorithm named Def-MARL. Simulation experiments on 8 different tasks across 2 different simulators show that Def-MARL achieves the best overall performance, satisfies safety constraints, and maintains stable training. Real-world hardware experiments on Crazyflie quadcopters demonstrate the ability of Def-MARL to safely coordinate agents to complete complex collaborative tasks compared to other methods.</description>

      <title>Recent Advances and Future Directions in Extended Reality (XR): Exploring AI-Powered Spatial Intelligence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.15970v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extended Reality (XR), encompassing Augmented Reality (AR), Virtual Reality (VR) and Mixed Reality (MR), is a transformative technology bridging the physical and virtual world and it has diverse potential which will be ubiquitous in the future. This review examines XR's evolution through foundational framework - hardware ranging from monitors to sensors and software ranging from visual tasks to user interface; highlights state of the art (SOTA) XR products with the comparison and analysis of performance based on their foundational framework; discusses how commercial XR devices can support the demand of high-quality performance focusing on spatial intelligence. For future directions, attention should be given to the integration of multi-modal AI and IoT-driven digital twins to enable adaptive XR systems. With the concept of spatial intelligence, future XR should establish a new digital space with realistic experience that benefits humanity. This review underscores the pivotal role of AI in unlocking XR as the next frontier in human-computer interaction.</description>

      <title>Hessian Riemannian Flow For Multi-Population Wardrop Equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16028v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we address the problem of optimizing flows on generalized graphs that feature multiple entry points and multiple populations, each with varying cost structures. We tackle this problem by considering the multi-population Wardrop equilibrium, defined through variational inequalities. We rigorously analyze the existence and uniqueness of the Wardrop equilibrium. Furthermore, we introduce an efficient numerical method to find the solution. In particular, we reformulate the equilibrium problem as a distributed optimization problem over subgraphs and introduce a novel Hessian Riemannian flow method, a Riemannian-manifold-projected Hessian flow, to efficiently compute a solution. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through examples in urban traffic management, including routing for diverse vehicle types and strategies for minimizing emissions in congested environments.</description>

      <title>LOKA Protocol: A Decentralized Framework for Trustworthy and Ethical AI Agent Ecosystems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.10915v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The rise of autonomous AI agents, capable of perceiving, reasoning, and acting independently, signals a profound shift in how digital ecosystems operate, govern, and evolve. As these agents proliferate beyond centralized infrastructures, they expose foundational gaps in identity, accountability, and ethical alignment. Three critical questions emerge: Identity: Who or what is the agent? Accountability: Can its actions be verified, audited, and trusted? Ethical Consensus: Can autonomous systems reliably align with human values and prevent harmful emergent behaviors? We present the novel LOKA Protocol (Layered Orchestration for Knowledgeful Agents), a unified, systems-level architecture for building ethically governed, interoperable AI agent ecosystems. LOKA introduces a proposed Universal Agent Identity Layer (UAIL) for decentralized, verifiable identity; intent-centric communication protocols for semantic coordination across diverse agents; and a Decentralized Ethical Consensus Protocol (DECP) that could enable agents to make context-aware decisions grounded in shared ethical baselines. Anchored in emerging standards such as Decentralized Identifiers (DIDs), Verifiable Credentials (VCs), and post-quantum cryptography, LOKA proposes a scalable, future-resilient blueprint for multi-agent AI governance. By embedding identity, trust, and ethics into the protocol layer itself, LOKA proposes the foundation for a new era of responsible, transparent, and autonomous AI ecosystems operating across digital and physical domains.</description>

      <title>On-Device Federated Continual Learning on RISC-V-based Ultra-Low-Power SoC for Intelligent Nano-Drone Swarms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17436v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: RISC-V-based architectures are paving the way for efficient On-Device Learning (ODL) in smart edge devices. When applied across multiple nodes, ODL enables the creation of intelligent sensor networks that preserve data privacy. However, developing ODL-capable, battery-operated embedded platforms presents significant challenges due to constrained computational resources and limited device lifetime, besides intrinsic learning issues such as catastrophic forgetting. We face these challenges by proposing a regularization-based On-Device Federated Continual Learning algorithm tailored for multiple nano-drones performing face recognition tasks. We demonstrate our approach on a RISC-V-based 10-core ultra-low-power SoC, optimizing the ODL computational requirements. We improve the classification accuracy by 24% over naive fine-tuning, requiring 178 ms per local epoch and 10.5 s per global epoch, demonstrating the effectiveness of the architecture for this task.</description>

      <title>How competitive are pay-as-bid auction games?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13920v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the pay-as-bid auction game, a supply function model with discriminatory pricing and asymmetric firms. In this game, strategies are non-decreasing supply functions relating pric to quantity and the exact choice of the strategy space turns out to be a crucial issue: when it includes all non-decreasing continuous functions, pure-strategy Nash equilibria often fail to exist. To overcome this, we restrict the strategy space to the set of Lipschitz-continuous functions and we prove that Nash equilibria always exist (under standard concavity assumptions) and consist of functions that are affine on their own support and have slope equal to the maximum allowed Lipschitz constant. We further show that the Nash equilibrium is unique up to the market-clearing price when the demand is affine and the asymmetric marginal production costs are homogeneous in zero. For quadratic production costs, we derive a closed-form expression and we compute the limit as the allowed Lipschitz constant grows to infinity. Our results show that in the limit the pay-as-bid auction game achieves perfect competition with efficient allocation and induces a lower market-clearing price compared to supply function models based on uniform price auctions.</description>
