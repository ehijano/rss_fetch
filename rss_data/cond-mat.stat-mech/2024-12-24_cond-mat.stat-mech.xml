      <title>Stochastic Resetting and Large Deviations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16374v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stochastic resetting has been a subject of considerable interest within statistical physics, both as means of improving completion times of complex processes such as searches and as a paradigm for generating nonequilibrium stationary states. In these lecture notes we give a self-contained introduction to the toy model of diffusion with stochastic resetting. We also discuss large deviation properties of additive functionals of the process such as the cost of resetting. Finally, we consider the generalisation from Poissonian resetting, where the resetting process occurs with a constant rate, to non-Poissonian resetting.</description>

      <title>Conformal invariance constraints in the $O(N)$ models: a first study within the nonperturbative renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16388v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The behavior of many critical phenomena at large distances is expected to be invariant under the full conformal group, rather than only isometries and scale transformations. When studying critical phenomena, approximations are often required, and the framework of the nonperturbative, or functional renormalization group is no exception. The derivative expansion is one of the most popular approximation schemes within this framework, due to its great performance on multiple systems, as evidenced in the last decades. Nevertheless, it has the downside of breaking conformal symmetry at a finite order. This breaking is not observed at the leading order of the expansion, denoted LPA approximation, and only appears once one considers, at least, the next-to-leading order of the derivative expansion ($\mathcal{O}(\partial^2)$) when including composite operators. In this work, we study the constraints arising from conformal symmetry for the $O(N)$ models using the derivative expansion at order $\mathcal{O}(\partial^2)$. We explore various values of $N$ and minimize the breaking of conformal symmetry to fix the non-physical parameters of the approximation procedure. We compare our prediction for the critical exponents with those coming from a more usual procedure, known as the principle of minimal sensitivity.</description>

      <title>Trade-off between coherence and dissipation for excitable phase oscillators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) bounds coherence in stochastic oscillatory systems. In this paper, we show that both dynamical and thermodynamic bounds play important roles for the excitable oscillators, e.g. neurons. Firstly, we investigate the trade-off between coherence and dissipation both in the sub and super-threshold regions for a single excitable unit, where both the TUR and the SNIC bounds constrain the fluctuation of inter-spike intervals. Secondly, we show that the widely studied phenomenon called coherence resonance, where there exists a noise strength to make the oscillatory responses of the system most coherent, is also bounded by the TUR in the one-dimensional excitable phase model. Finally, we study the coherence-dissipation relation in ensembles of strongly coupled excitable oscillators.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16613v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an improvement of the Gillespie Exact Stochastic Simulation Algorithm, which leverages a bitwise representation of variables to perform independent simulations in parallel. We show that the subsequent gain in computational yield is significant, and it may allow to perform simulations of non-well mixed chemical systems. We illustrate this idea with simulations of Frank model, originally introduced to explain the emergence of homochirality in prebiotic systems.</description>

      <title>Local integrability breaking and exponential localization of leading Lyapunov vectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16887v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study integrability breaking and transport in a discrete space-time lattice with a local integrability breaking perturbation. We find a singular distribution of the Lyapunov spectrum where the majority of Lyapunov exponents vanish in the thermodynamic limit. The sub-extensive sequence of nonzero exponents, converging in the thermodynamic limit, correspond to Lyapunov vectors that are exponentially localized with localization lengths proportional to inverse Lyapunov exponents. Moreover, we investigate the transport behavior of the system by considering the spin-spin and current-current spatio-temporal correlation functions. Our results indicate that the overall transport behavior, similarly as in the purely integrable case, conforms to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang scaling in the thermodynamic limit and at vanishing magnetization. The same dynamical exponent $z=3/2$ governs the effect of local perturbation spreading in the bulk.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamic computing out of equilibrium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17183v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the design for a thermodynamic computer that can perform arbitrary nonlinear calculations in or out of equilibrium. Simple thermodynamic circuits, fluctuating degrees of freedom in contact with a thermal bath and confined by a quartic potential, display an activity that is a nonlinear function of their input. Such circuits can therefore be regarded as thermodynamic neurons, and can serve as the building blocks of networked structures that act as thermodynamic neural networks, universal function approximators whose operation is powered by thermal fluctuations. We simulate a digital model of a thermodynamic neural network, and show that its parameters can be adjusted by genetic algorithm to perform nonlinear calculations at specified observation times, regardless of whether the system has attained thermal equilibrium. This work expands the field of thermodynamic computing beyond the regime of thermal equilibrium, enabling fully nonlinear computations, analogous to those performed by classical neural networks, at specified observation times.</description>

      <title>Local symmetries and extensive ground-state degeneracy of a 1D supersymmetric fermionic chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a $1$D supersymmetric (SUSY) hard-core fermion model first proposed by Fendley, Schoutens, and de Boer [Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 120402 (2003)]. We focus on the full Hilbert space instead of a restricted subspace. Exact diagonalization shows the degeneracy of zero-energy states scales exponentially with size of the system, with a recurrence relation between different system sizes. We solve the degeneracy problem by showing the ground states can be systematically constructed by inserting immobile walls of fermions into the chain. Mapping the counting problem to a combinatorial one and obtaining the exact generating function, we prove the recurrence relation on both open and periodic chains. We also provide an explicit mapping between ground states, giving a combinatorial explanation of the recurrence relation.</description>

      <title>Critical, compensation and hysteresis behaviors studies in the ferrimagnetic Blume-Capel model with mixed half-integer spin-(3/2, 7/2): Exact recursion relations calculations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17627v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The exact recursion relations are used to study the mixed half-integer spin-(3/2, 7/2) Blume-Capel Ising ferrimagnetic system on the Bethe lattice. Ground-state phase diagrams are computed in the $({D_{A}}/{q|J|}, {D_{B}}/{q|J|})$ plane to reveal different possible ground states of the model. Using the thermal changes of the order-parameters, interesting temperature dependent phase diagrams are constructed in the ($D_{A}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$), ($D_{B}/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) planes as well as in the ($D/|J|$, $kT/|J|$) plane where $D=D_A=D_B$. It is revealed that the system exhibits first- and second-order phase transitions and compensation temperatures for specific model parameter values. Under the constraint of an external magnetic field, the model also produces multi-hysteresis behaviors as single, double and triple hysteresis cycles. Particularly, the impacts of the ferrimagnetic coupling $J$ on the remanent magnetization and the coercitive fields for selected values of the other physical parameters of the system are pointed out. Our numerical results are qualitatively consistent with those reported in the literature.</description>

      <title>Ising model in the R\'{e}nyi statistics: the finite size effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The R\'{e}nyi statistics is applied for a description of finite size effects in the 1D Ising model. We calculate the internal energy of the spin chain and the system temperature using the R\'{e}nyi distribution and postulate them to be equal to their counterparts, obtained in the microcanonical ensemble. It allows us to self-consistently derive the R\'{e}nyi $q$-index and the Lagrange parameter $T$ to relate them to the physically observed system temperature $T_{\rm ph}$, and to show that the entropic phase transitions are possible in a broad temperature domain. We have also studied the temperature dependence of the internal energy $U(T_{\rm ph})$ at constant $q$ and an influence of the size related effects on the system thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a non-Hermitian phase transition in a bulk condensed-matter system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Phase transitions are fundamental in nature. A small parameter change near a critical point leads to a qualitative change in system properties. Across a regular phase transition, the system remains in thermal equilibrium and, therefore, experiences a change of static properties, like the emergence of a magnetisation upon cooling a ferromagnet below the Curie temperature. When driving a system far from equilibrium, novel, otherwise inaccessible quantum states of matter may arise. Such states are typically non-Hermitian, that is, their dynamics break time-reversal symmetry, a basic law of equilibrium physics. Phase transitions in non-Hermitian systems are of fundamentally new nature in that the dynamical behaviour rather than static properties may undergo a qualitative change at a critical, here called exceptional point. Here we experimentally realize a non-Hermitian phase transition in a bulk condensed-matter system. Optical excitation creates charge carriers in the ferromagnetic semiconductor EuO. In a temperature-dependent interplay with the Hermitian transition to ferromagnetic order, a non-Hermitian change of the relaxation dynamics occurs, manifesting in our time-resolved reflection data as a transition from bi-exponential real to single-exponential complex decay. Our theory models this behavior and predicts non-Hermitian phase transitions for a large class of condensed-matter systems, where they may be exploited to sensitively control bulk-dynamic properties.</description>

      <title>Weak ergodicity breaking from supersymmetry in a fermionic kinetically constrained model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16287v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supersymmetry provides a natural playground for the construction of kinetically constrained lattice fermion models showing weak ergodicity breaking. The supersymmetric algebra naturally induces non-ergodic dynamics, as we illustrate here by introducing a fermionic equivalent of the PXP model with an adjustable chemical potential. This model is closely related to the $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric $M_1$ model. Supersymmetry directly implies that the dynamics exhibit periodic revivals for specific initial states, including the $\mathbb{Z}_2$-ordered (every second site occupied) product state. These dynamics are reminiscent to those of the PXP model, a paradigmatic toy model in the field of quantum many-body scars. We draw a further parallel by uncovering quantum many-body scar-like eigenstates obeying sub-thermal entanglement scaling at energies given by (plus or minus) square roots of integers and relate these to special eigenstates of the $M_1$ model.</description>

      <title>Selection rules for RG flows of minimal models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimal d=2 CFTs are usually classified through modular invariant partition functions. There is a finer classification of ``non complete'' models when S-duality is not imposed. We approach this classification by starting with the local chiral algebra and adding primaries sequentially. At each step, we only impose locality (T-duality) and closure of the operator algebra. For each chiral algebra, this produces a tree-like graph. Each tree node corresponds to a local d=2 CFT, with an intrinsic Jones index measuring the size of Haag duality violation. This index can be computed with the partition function and is related to the total quantum dimension of the category of superselection sectors of the node, and to the relative size between the node and a modular invariant completion. In this way, we find in a very explicit manner a classification of local minimal (c&lt;1) d=2 CFTs. When appropriate, this matches Kawahigashi-Longo's previous results. We use this finer classification to constrain RG flows. For a relevant perturbation, the flow can be restricted to the subalgebra associated with it, typically corresponding to a non-modular invariant node in the tree. The structure of the graph above such node needs to be preserved by the RG flow. In particular, the superselection sector category for the node must be preserved. This gives selection rules that recover in a unified fashion several known facts while unraveling new ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16598v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Monte Carlo methods are widely used importance sampling techniques for studying complex physical systems. Integrating these methods with deep learning has significantly improved efficiency and accuracy in high-dimensional problems and complex system simulations. However, these neural network-enhanced Monte Carlo methods still face challenges such as slow sampling speeds, statistical bias, and inaccuracies in the ground state. To address these issues, we propose a variational evolutionary network, which utilizes neural networks for variational free energy and combines evolutionary algorithms for sampling. During the sampling process, we construct generation and selection operators to filter samples based on importance, thereby achieving efficient importance sampling. We demonstrate that this sampling method provides an upper bound on the ground-state energy, enhancing both sampling efficiency and ground-state accuracy. Moreover, we numerically examine our method in two-dimensional Ising model and Sherrington-Kirkpatrick Model for spin glass. Thus, our algorithm could offer improved accuracy in handling complex energy landscapes and significantly enhance computational efficiency.</description>

      <title>Correlated Growth of Causal Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.16647v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The study of causal structure in complex systems has gained increasing attention, with many recent studies exploring causal networks that capture cause-effect relationships across diverse fields. Despite increasing empirical evidence linking causal structures to network topological correlations, the mechanisms underlying the emergence of these correlations in causal networks remain poorly understood. In this Letter, we propose a general growth framework for causal networks, incorporating two key types of correlations: causal and dynamic. We analytically solve our model for degree correlation and validate the theoretical predictions against empirical data from four large-scale innovation networks. Our theory not only sheds light on the origins of topological correlations but also provides a general framework for understanding correlated growth across causal systems.</description>

      <title>Fundamental thresholds for computational and erasure errors via the coherent information</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum error correcting (QEC) codes protect quantum information against environmental noise. Computational errors caused by the environment change the quantum state within the qubit subspace, whereas quantum erasures correspond to the loss of qubits at known positions. Correcting either type of error involves different correction mechanisms, which makes studying the interplay between erasure and computational errors particularly challenging. In this work, we propose a framework based on the coherent information (CI) of the mixed-state density operator associated to noisy QEC codes, for treating both types of errors together. We show how to rigorously derive different families of statistical mechanics mappings for generic stabilizer QEC codes in the presence of both types of errors. We observe that the erasure errors enter as a classical average over fully depolarizing channels. Further, we show that computing the CI for erasure errors only can be done efficiently upon sampling over erasure configurations. We then test our approach on the 2D toric and color codes and compute optimal thresholds for erasure errors only, finding a $50\%$ threshold for both codes. This strengthens the notion that both codes share the same optimal thresholds. When considering both computational and erasure errors, the CI of small-size codes yields thresholds in very accurate agreement with established results that have been obtained in the thermodynamic limit. We thereby further establish the CI as a practical tool for studying optimal thresholds under realistic noise and as a means for uncovering new relations between QEC codes and statistical physics models.</description>

      <title>Trees that can be grown in "too many" ways: A review of Bouch's construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We review the construction by Bouch [1] of trees on the square lattice that can be grown from its root in $L!/C^L$ distinct ways, where $L$ is the number of bonds constituting the tree, and $C&gt;1$ is a constant. As discussed, e.g., in Appendix A.3 of [2], this result has an implication on the operator growth in quantum spin systems in two or higher dimensions.</description>

      <title>Fluctuations and optimal control in a Floquet Quantum Thermal Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16920</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16920v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We use Full Counting Statistics to study fluctuations and optimal control in a three-terminal Floquet quantum thermal transistor. We model the setup using three qubits (termed as the emitter, collector and base) coupled to three thermal baths. As shown in Phys. Rev. E 106, 024110 (2022), one can achieve significant change in the emitter and collector currents through a small change in the base current, thereby achieving a thermal transistor operation. Using sinusoidal and pi-flip modulations of the base qubit frequency, we show that the variance of the base current is much less compared to those of the emitter and collector currents, while the opposite is true in case of the Fano factor. We then apply optimal control through the Chopped Random Basis optimization protocol, in order to significantly enhance the amplification obtained in the transistor. In contrast, a reduction in the Fano factor of the setup through optimal control is associated with a large base current, thereby suggesting a trade-off between precision and base current. We expect our results will be relevant for developing heat modulation devices in near-term quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Understanding Dynamics in Coarse-Grained Models: V. Extension of Coarse-Grained Dynamics Theory to Non-Hard Sphere Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17186v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coarse-grained (CG) modeling has gained significant attention in recent years due to its wide applicability in enhancing the spatiotemporal scales of molecular simulations. While CG simulations, often performed with Hamiltonian mechanics, faithfully recapitulate structural correlations at equilibrium, they lead to ambiguously accelerated dynamics. In the first paper of this series [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034103 (2023)], we proposed the excess entropy scaling relationship to understand the CG dynamics. Then, in the following companion paper [J. Chem. Phys. 158, 034104 (2023)], we developed a theory to map the CG system into a dynamically-consistent hard sphere system to analytically derive an expression for fast CG dynamics. However, many chemical and physical systems do not exhibit hard sphere-like behavior, limiting the extensibility of the developed theory. In this paper, we aim to generalize the theory to the non-hard sphere system based on the Weeks-Chandler-Andersen perturbation theory. Since non-hard sphere-like CG interactions affect the excess entropy term as it deviates from the hard sphere description, we explicitly account for the extra entropy to correct the non-hard sphere nature of the system. This approach is demonstrated for two different types of interactions seen in liquids, and we further provide a generalized description for any CG models using the generalized Gaussian CG models using Gaussian basis sets. Altogether, this work allows for extending the range and applicability of the hard sphere CG dynamics theory to a myriad of CG liquids.</description>

      <title>DL_POLY Quantum 2.1 software: A suite of real-time path integral methods for the simulation of dynamical properties and vibrational spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17216v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DL_POLY Quantum 2.1 is introduced here as a highly modular, sustainable, and scalable general-purpose molecular dynamics (MD) simulation software for large-scale long-time MD simulations of condensed phase and interfacial systems with the essential nuclear quantum effects (NQEs) included. The new release improves upon version 2.0 through the introduction of several emerging real-time path integral (PI) methods, including fast centroid molecular dynamics (f-CMD) and fast quasi-CMD (f-QCMD) methods, as well as our recently introduced hybrid CMD (h-CMD) method for the accurate and efficient simulation of vibrational infrared spectra. Several test cases, including liquid bulk water at 300 K and ice Ih at 150 K, are used to showcase the performance of different implemented PI methods in simulating the infrared spectra at both ambient conditions and low temperatures where NQEs become more apparent. Additionally, using different salt-in-water (i.e., dilute) and water-in-salt (i.e., concentrated) lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) aqueous electrolyte solutions, we demonstrate the applicability of our recently introduced h-CMD method implemented in DL_POLY Quantum 2.1 for the large scale simulation of IR spectra of complex heterogeneous systems. We show that h-CMD can overcome the curvature problem of CMD and the artificial broadening of T-RPMD for the accurate simulation of the vibrational spectra of complex, heterogeneous systems with NQEs included.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the work statistics of an open quantum system using a quantum computer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report on the experimental measurement of the work statistics of a genuinely open quantum system using a quantum computer. Such measurement has remained elusive thus far due to the inherent difficulty in measuring the total energy change of a system-bath compound (which is the work) in the open quantum system scenario. We overcome this difficulty by extending the interferometric scheme, originally conceived for closed systems, to the open system case and implement it on a superconducting quantum computer, taking advantage of the relatively high levels of noise on current quantum hardware to realize an open quantum system. We demonstrate that the method can be used as a diagnostic tool to probe physical properties of the system-bath compound, such as its temperature and specific transitions frequencies in its spectrum. Our experiments corroborate that the interferometric scheme is a promising tool to achieve the long-sought experimental validation of the Jarzynski equality for arbitrary open quantum systems.</description>

      <title>Shape and Performance of Fastest Paths over Networks with Interacting Selfish Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17665v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of the fastest paths in transportation networks under increasing congestion, modeled as a linear decrease in edge travel speed with density due to interactions among selfish agents. Moving from the common edge-based to a path-based analysis, we examine the fastest directed routes connecting random origin-destination pairs as traffic grows, characterizing their shape through effective length, maximum detour, and area under the curve, and their performance through a novel metric measuring how fast and how far an agent travels toward its destination. The entire network is characterized by analyzing the performance metric's distribution across uniformly distributed paths. The study covers both random planar networks with controlled characteristics and real urban networks of major cities. The low-density network regime, in which an initial smooth performance degradation is observed up to a critical traffic volume, is followed by the emergence of complex patterns of spatially heterogeneous slowdowns as traffic increases, rapidly leading to disjoint subnetworks. The failure of a few edges leads to a catastrophic decrease in the network performance. The fastest paths for all cities show a peak for detour and inness (and their variance) in the proximity of the critical traffic level, defined as the flex of the rejected path ratio curve. Inness generally shows a slight attraction by city centers on paths for light traffic, but this reverses to strong repulsion during congestion. We exploit path performance to uncover an asymmetric behavior of different regions of the networks when acting as origins or destinations. Finally, the Gini coefficient is used to study the unequal effects of path performance degradation with traffic.</description>

      <title>Scaling Description of the Relaxation Dynamics and Dynamical Heterogeneity of an Active Glass-forming Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17666v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Active glasses refer to a class of driven non-equilibrium systems that share remarkably similar dynamical behavior as conventional glass-formers in equilibrium. Glass-like dynamical characteristics have been observed in various biological systems from micro to macro length scales. As activity induces additional fluctuations in the system, studying how they couple with density fluctuations is an interesting question to address. Via extensive molecular dynamics simulations, We show that activity enhances density fluctuations more strongly than its passive counterpart. Increasing activity beyond a limit results in the sub-Arrhenieus-type relaxation behavior in active glasses. We also propose a unified scaling theory that can rationalize the relaxation spectrum over a broad parameter range using the concept of an effective temperature. In particular, we show that our scaling theory can capture the dynamical crossover from super to sub-Arrhenius relaxation behavior by changing activity from small to large values. Furthermore, We present non-trivial system size dependencies of the relaxation time at large activity limits that have not been found in any passive systems or even in active systems at small activities.</description>

      <title>Thermal Quench Dynamics of Visons in Gapless Kitaev Spin Liquid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17774v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relaxation dynamics of the Kitaev honeycomb model under a thermal quench is dominated by the quasi-stochastic diffusion and pair annihilation of visions, which are gapped flux excitations of an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field of the Kitaev spin liquid. Both the diffusion energy barrier as well as the effective interactions between visons are mediated by the Majorana fermions which are fractionalized quasiparticles of the spin liquid. Through extensive kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, we show that the interplay between the thermal diffusion and nonlocal multi-vision interactions leads to a variety of temperature-dependent dynamical behaviors ranging from diffusion-limited and terminal-velocity-limited annihilation to dynamical arresting and freezing. Notably, we show that the freezing phenomenon is intimately related to the formation of metastable $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ vison crystals and a hidden coarsening of super-clusters associated with a broken $\mathbb{Z}_3$ symmetry.</description>

      <title>Corrections to scaling in the 2D phi^4 model: Monte Carlo results and some related problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monte Carlo (MC) simulations have been performed to refine the estimation of the correction-to-scaling exponent $\omega$ in the 2D $\varphi^4$ model, which belongs to one of the most fundamental universality classes. If corrections have the form $\propto L^{-\omega}$, then we find $\omega=1.546(30)$ and $\omega=1.509(14)$ as the best estimates. These are obtained from the finite-size scaling of the susceptibility data in the range of linear lattice sizes $L \in [128,2048]$ at the critical value of the Binder cumulant and from the scaling of the corresponding pseudocritical couplings within $L \in [64,2048]$. These values agree with several other MC estimates at the assumption of the power-law corrections and are comparable with the known results of the $\epsilon$-expansion. In addition, we have tested the consistency with the scaling corrections of the form $\propto L^{-4/3}$, $\propto L^{-4/3} \ln L$ and $\propto L^{-4/3} /\ln L$, which might be expected from some considerations of the renormalization group and Coulomb gas model. The latter option is consistent with our MC data. Our MC results served as a basis for a critical reconsideration of some earlier theoretical conjectures and scaling assumptions. In particular, we have corrected and refined our previous analysis by grouping Feynman diagrams. The renewed analysis gives $\omega \approx 4-d-2 \eta$ as some approximation for spatial dimensions $d&lt;4$, or $\omega \approx 1.5$ in two dimensions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.16436v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the overdamped dynamics of a `passive' particle driven by nonreciprocal interaction with a `driver' Brownian particle. When the interaction between them is short-ranged, the long-time behavior of the driven particle is remarkably universal -- the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and the typical position of the driven particle exhibits the same qualitative behaviors independent of the specific form of the potential. In particular, the MSD grows as $t^{1/2}$ in one dimension and $\log t$ in two spatial dimensions. We compute the exact scaling functions for the position distribution in $d=1$ and $d=2$. These functions are universal when the interaction is short-ranged. For long-ranged interactions, the MSD of the driven particle grows as $t^{\phi}$ with exponent $\phi$ depending on the tail of the potential.</description>

Abstract: Symmetry imposes constraints on open quantum systems, affecting the dissipative properties in nonequilibrium processes. Superradiance is a typical example in which the decay rate of the system is enhanced via a collective system-bath coupling that respects permutation symmetry. Such model has also been applied to heat engines. However, a generic framework that addresses the impact of symmetry in finite-time thermodynamics is not well established. Here, we show a symmetry-based framework that describes the fundamental limit of collective enhancement in finite-time thermodynamics. Specifically, we derive a general upper bound on the average jump rate, which quantifies the fundamental speed set by thermodynamic speed limits and trade-off relations. We identify the symmetry condition which achieves the obtained bound, and explicitly construct an open quantum system model that goes beyond the enhancement realized by the conventional superradiance model.</description>

Abstract: Topologically protected edge states exactly at topological phase boundaries challenge the conventional belief that topological states must be associated with a bulk energy gap. Because periodically driven (Floquet) systems host unusually intricate topological phase boundaries, topological edge states can be prolific at such Floquet quantum criticality. Working on a class of chiral-symmetric, Floquet-driven Majorana fermion chains, we analytically and computationally show that the precise boundaries between different Floquet topological gapped phases can accommodate topological edge modes, including the so-called Majorana $\pi$ modes. We also identify a general bulk-edge correspondence formula to predict and understand the emergence of topological edge modes at Floquet quantum criticality. Of direct interest to quantum simulation experiments, our results break new grounds for studies of nonequilibrium topological phases of matter undergoing topological phase transitions.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that a discontinuous shear thickening (DST) can take place even in a moderately dense inertial suspension consisting of frictionless soft particles. This DST can be regarded as an ignited-quenched transition in the inertial suspension. An approximate kinetic theory well recovers the results of the Langevin simulation in the wide range of the volume fraction without any fitting parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13699v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superpositions by energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show that the terms of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:2008.08663 (2020)] restricting the wavefunctions in space satisfies such relations. I generalize the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer. An experimental estimate to test the proposal of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] is described at the end.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Quantization: numerical results for the Feynman propagator on a 1+1 lattice and the theoretical relation with Quantum Field Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.17149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present here the first lattice simulation of symplectic quantization, a new functional approach to quantum field theory which allows to define an algorithm to numerically sample the quantum fluctuations of fields directly in Minkowski space-time, at variance with all other present approaches. Symplectic quantization is characterized by a Hamiltonian deterministic dynamics evolving with respect to an additional time parameter $\tau$ analogous to the fictious time of Parisi-Wu stochastic quantization. In this work we present the numerical study of a real scalar field theory on a $d$=1+1 space-time lattice with a $\lambda \phi^4$ interaction. We find that for $\lambda \ll 1$ the two-point correlation function obtained numerically reproduces qualitatively well the shape of the free Feynman propagator. Within symplectic quantization the expectation values over quantum fluctuations are computed as dynamical averages along the dynamics in $\tau$, in force of a natural ergodic hypothesis connecting Hamiltonian dynamics with a generalized microcanonical ensemble. Analytically, we prove that this "microcanonical" ensemble, in the continuum limit, is equivalent to a "canonical-like" one where the probability density of field configurations is $P[\phi] \propto \exp(zS[\phi]/\hbar)$. The results from our simulations correspond to the value $z=1$ of the parameter in the canonical weight, which in this case is a well-defined probability density for field configurations in causal space-time, provided that a lower bounded interaction potential is considered. The form proposed for $P[\phi]$ suggests that our theory can be connected to ordinary quantum field theory by analytic continuation in the complex-$z$ plane.</description>

      <title>Reassessing quantum-thermodynamic enhancements in continuous thermal machines</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.19280v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Quantum coherence has been shown to impact the operational capabilities of quantum systems performing thermodynamic tasks in a significant way, and yet the possibility and conditions for genuine coherence-enhanced thermodynamic operation remain unclear. We show that for steady-state quantum thermal machines -- both autonomous and externally driven -- that interact weakly with thermal reservoirs and work sources, the presence of coherence induced by perturbations in the machine Hamiltonian guarantees a genuine thermodynamic advantage. Such advantage applies both for the cases in which the induced coherence is between levels with different energies or between degenerate levels. On the other hand, we show that engines subjected to noise-induced coherence, can be outperformed by classical stochastic engines using exactly the same set of (incoherent) resources. We illustrate our results with three prototypical models of heat engines and refrigerators and employ multi-objective optimization techniques to characterize quantum-enhanced regimes in connection with the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and beyond it.</description>

      <title>Thermalization slowing down of weakly nonintegrable quantum spin dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.00786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.00786v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study thermalization slowing down of a quantum many-body spin system upon approach to two distinct integrability limits. Motivated by previous studies of classical systems, we identify two thermalization time scales: one quantum Lyapunov time scale is extracted by quantifying operator growth in time on an appropriately defined basis, while another ergodization time scale is related to the statistics of fluctuations of the time-evolved operator around its mean value based on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis.Using a paradigmatic Quantum Ising chain we find that both timescales diverge upon approach to integrability.We investigate the relative strength of the divergence in the two limits and find that despite significant qualitative differences in the mechanism of integrability breaking, the timescales diverge in a similar fashion.This allows us to establish a universality of integrability breaking in quantum spin dynamics.</description>

      <title>Interaction-induced topological phase transition at finite temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04779</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04779v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.</description>

      <title>Zero-temperature Monte Carlo simulations of two-dimensional quantum spin glasses guided by neural network states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05978v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A continuous-time projection quantum Monte Carlo algorithm is employed to simulate the ground state of a short-range quantum spin-glass model, namely, the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Hamiltonian with transverse field, featuring Gaussian nearest-neighbor couplings. We numerically demonstrate that guiding wave functions based on self-learned neural networks suppress the population control bias below modest statistical uncertainties, at least up to a hundred spins. By projecting a two-fold replicated Hamiltonian, the spin overlap is determined. A finite-size scaling analysis is performed to estimate the critical transverse field where the spin-glass transition occurs, as well as the critical exponents of the correlation length and the spin-glass susceptibility. For the latter two, good agreement is found with recent estimates from the literature for different random couplings. We also address the spin-overlap distribution within the spin-glass phase, finding that, for the workable system sizes, it displays a non-trivial double-peak shape with large weight at zero overlap.</description>

Abstract: Using the recently proposed covariant framework of general relativistic stochastic mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics, we proved the detailed and integral fluctuation theorems in curved spacetime. The time-reversal transformation is described as a transformation from the perspective of future-directed observer to that of the corresponding past-directed observer, which enables us to maintain general covariance throughout the construction.</description>

      <title>Accelerating Molecular Dynamics through Informed Resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a procedure for enhanced sampling of molecular dynamics simulations through informed stochastic resetting. Many phenomena, such as protein folding and crystal nucleation, occur over time scales that are inaccessible in standard simulations. We recently showed that stochastic resetting can accelerate molecular simulations that exhibit broad transition time distributions. However, standard stochastic resetting does not exploit any information about the reaction progress. For a model system and chignolin in explicit water, we demonstrate that an informed resetting protocol leads to greater accelerations than standard stochastic resetting in molecular dynamics and Metadynamics simulations. This is achieved by resetting only when a certain condition is met, e.g., when the distance from the target along the reaction coordinate is larger than some threshold. We use these accelerated simulations to infer important kinetic observables such as the unbiased mean first-passage time and direct transit time. For the latter, Metadynamics with informed resetting leads to speedups of 2-3 orders of magnitude over unbiased simulations with relative errors of only ~35-70%. Our work significantly extends the applicability of stochastic resetting for enhanced sampling of molecular simulations.</description>

      <title>The molecular nature of superfluidity: Viscosity of helium from quantum stochastic molecular dynamics simulations over real trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19036v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Using quantum equations of motion for interacting bosons, stochastic molecular dynamics simulations with quantized momenta are performed for Lennard-Jones helium-4. The viscosity of the quantum liquid is significantly less than that of the classical liquid, being almost 5 times smaller at the lowest temperature studied. The classical and quantum liquids are identical except for Bose-Einstein condensation, which pinpoints the molecular mechanism for superfluidity. The results rely on the existence of stochastic but real particle trajectories, which has implications for the interpretation of quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Collective dynamic length increases monotonically in pinned and unpinned glass forming systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19372v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Random First Order Transition Theory (RFOT) predicts that transport proceeds by cooperative movement of particles in domains whose sizes increase as a liquid is compressed above a characteristic volume fraction, $\phi_d$. The rounded dynamical transition around $\phi_d$, which signals a crossover to activated transport, is accompanied by a growing correlation length that is predicted to diverge at the thermodynamic glass transition density ($&gt; \phi_d$). Simulations and imaging experiments probed the single particle dynamics of mobile particles in response to pinning all the particles in a semi-infinite space or randomly pinning (RP) a fraction of particles in a liquid at equilibrium. The extracted dynamic length increases non-monotonically with a peak around $\phi_d$, which not only depends on the pinning method but is different from $\phi_d$ of the actual liquid. This finding is at variance with the results obtained using the small wave length limit of a four-point structure factor for unpinned systems. To obtain a consistent picture of the growth of the dynamic length, one that is impervious to the use of RP, we introduce a multi particle structure factor, $S^c_{mp}(q,t)$, that probes collective dynamics. The collective dynamic length, calculated from the small wave vector limit of $S^c_{mp}(q,t)$, increases monotonically as a function of the volume fraction in glass forming binary mixture of charged colloidal particles in both unpinned and pinned systems. This prediction, which also holds in the presence of added monovalent salt, may be validated using imaging experiments.</description>

      <title>Existence and Uniqueness of Solutions to the Generalized Hydrodynamics Equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04922v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The generalized hydrodynamics (GHD) equation is the equivalent of the Euler equations of hydrodynamics for integrable models. Systems of hyperbolic equations such as the Euler equations usually develop shocks and are plagued by problems of uniqueness. We establish for the first time the existence and uniqueness of solutions to the full GHD equation and the absence of shocks, from a large class of initial conditions with bounded occupation function. We assume only absolute integrability of the two-body scattering shift. In applications to quantum models of fermionic type, this includes all commonly used physical initial states, such as locally thermal states and zero-entropy states. We show in particular that differentiable initial conditions give differentiable solutions at all times and that weak initial conditions such as the Riemann problem have unique weak solutions which preserve entropy. For this purpose, we write the GHD equation as a new fixed-point problem (announced in a companion paper). We show that the fixed point exists, is unique, and is approached, under an iterative solution procedure, in the Banach topology on functions of momenta.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.11097v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Competition among repetitive measurements of noncommuting observables and unitary dynamics can give rise to a rich variety of entanglement phases. We here characterize topological phases in monitored quantum systems by their spectrum and many-body topological invariants. We analyze (1+1)-dimensional monitored circuits for Majorana fermions, which have topological and trivial area-law entangled phases and a critical phase with sub-volume-law entanglement, through the Lyapunov spectrum. We uncover the presence (absence) of edge-localized zero modes inside the bulk gap in the topological (trivial) area-law phase and a bulk gapless spectrum in the critical phase. Furthermore, by suitably exploiting the fermion parity with twisted measurement outcomes at the boundary, we construct a topological invariant that sharply distinguishes the two area-law phases and dynamically characterizes the critical phase. Our work thus paves the way to extend the bulk-edge correspondence for topological phases from equilibrium to monitored quantum dynamics.</description>
