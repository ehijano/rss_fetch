      <title>Embedding Reliability for Unsupervised Classification of Gamma Ray Burst progenitors from Prompt Gamma-ray Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a statistical method based on scDEED to assess the reliability of a 2D embedding showing a low-dimensional representation of the distribution of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) detected by the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM). The original dataset consists of 12 waterfall plots for each event, which contain key information about the prompt emission of each GRB. The dataset's dimensionality is first reduced to a 30-dimensional latent space using an autoencoder, and subsequently to 2D using UMAP. While the methodology and results are discussed in a previous work (arXiv:2406.03643), here we introduce a statistical approach to evaluate the reliability of the final 2D distribution based on the scDEED algorithm. Our analysis shows that the 2D embedding demonstrates overall good reliability, with more than 90\% of the events classified as trustworthy.</description>

      <title>Illuminating gravitational wave sources with Sgr A* flares</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way, exhibits daily energetic flares characterized by non-thermal emission in the infrared and X-ray bands. While the underlying accretion flow is a Radiatively Inefficient Accretion Flow (RIAF) peaking at radio frequencies, the mechanism powering these non-thermal transients remains debated. Stellar dynamics predict a population of faint brown dwarfs orbiting Sgr A*. These objects are progenitors of Extremely Large Mass Ratio Inspirals (XMRIs), crucial sources of low-frequency gravitational waves for the future Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. We investigate whether the tidal stripping of brown dwarfs provides a viable fueling mechanism for the observed flares. Here we present high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations of grazing tidal interactions coupled with a parameterized non-thermal radiation model. We demonstrate that the dynamics of the tidal fallback and subsequent viscous evolution naturally reproduce the fundamental temporal characteristics of observed flares: the peak luminosity and the characteristic 1-hour duration. We show that this fueling mechanism is dynamically viable and energetically consistent, placing strong constraints on the required efficiency of the non-thermal emission process, suggesting extreme radiative inefficiency. These findings provide compelling evidence for a hidden population of brown dwarfs in the Galactic Center. Crucially, the observed high flare frequency implies tight orbits characteristic of advanced inspirals. This establishes a direct link between electromagnetic transients and active gravitational wave sources, alerting the LISA consortium years in advance to the presence of specific XMRI systems promising exceptionally high signal-to-noise ratios for precision tests of general relativity.</description>

      <title>It's always the quiet ones: Single Degenerate Double Detonation Type Ia Supernova from Quiescent Helium Accretion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a sub-Chandrasekhar mass double detonation pathway for Type Ia supernovae arising from single degenerate helium accreting carbon-oxygen white dwarfs. Building on our previous one dimensional study of recurrent helium novae (Hillman et al. 2025), we evolve a 0.7 solar mass white dwarf through steady accretion at 10^-8 Msun yr^-1 until it reaches 1.1 solar mass, yielding realistic, time evolved helium rich profiles. These profiles are mapped into FLASH simulations, incorporating nuclear burning for helium and carbon-oxygen detonation, in multi-dimensional hydrodynamic runs. A localized, modest temperature perturbation near the base of the helium shell robustly triggers an outward helium-shell detonation. The ensuing inward propagating shock converges in the carbon-oxygen core, igniting a secondary detonation that unbinds the star. We obtain a Ni56 yield of ~0.64 solar mass, an intermediate-mass element (Si-Ca) mass of ~0.41 solar mass, and maximum ejecta velocities approaching 22,000 km/s, values consistent with normal Type Ia supernovae. Our results demonstrate that recurrent helium accretors, typically quiescent over long timescales, can evolve under subtle, "quiet" conditions to trigger robust double detonations, supporting their role as viable progenitors of sub-Chandrasekhar mass Type Ia supernovae.</description>

      <title>Auger@TA: In-situ Cross-Calibration of the World's Largest Cosmic Ray Observatories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20911</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20911v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory (Auger) and the Telescope Array (TA) are the world's two largest ultra-high-energy cosmic ray (UHECR) observatories. They operate in the Southern and Northern hemispheres, respectively, at similar latitudes but with distinct surface detector (SD) designs. A significant challenge in studying UHECR physics across the full sky is the apparent discrepancy in flux measurements between the two experiments. This discrepancy could arise from astrophysical differences and/or systematic effects related to their detector designs and sensitivities to extensive air shower components. To address this, the Auger@TA working group aims to cross-calibrate the two observatories with a self-triggering micro-Auger array within the TA array. This micro-array consists of eight Auger Surface Detector (SD) stations equipped with Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCDs) and AugerPrime Surface Scintillator Detectors. Seven SD stations, configured with a centered-1-PMT design, are arranged in a hexagonal pattern with one station in the center, with 1.5 km spacing, mirroring the Auger layout. The eighth station, which features a standard 3-PMT Auger station, is located in conjunction with a TA detector at the center of the hexagon, forming a triplet for high-statistics and low-uncertainty cross-calibration. A custom communication system that uses readily available components enables seamless communication between stations and remote access to each station through a central computer. The micro-array is now fully deployed, and initial data-taking is about to start. This presentation will detail the instrumentation, communication systems, central data acquisition system, expected performance of the micro-array, and preliminary results as appropriate.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength view of circumstellar interaction in supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interaction of post-explosion supernova ejecta with the surrounding circumstellar medium creates emission across the electromagnetic spectrum. Since the circumstellar medium is created by the mass lost from the progenitor star, it carries tell-tale signatures of the progenitor. Consequently, observations and modeling of radiation produced by the interaction in various types of supernovae have provided valuable insights into their progenitors. Detailed studies have shown that the interaction in supernovae begins and sustains over various timescales and lengthscales, with differing mass-loss rates in distinct sub-classes. This reveals diverse progenitor histories for these stellar explosions. This review paper summarizes various supernova subtypes, linking them to stellar death pathways, and presents an updated supernova classification diagram. We then present a multi-wavelength study of circumstellar interaction in different supernova classes. We also present unpublished Chandra X-ray as well as radio observations of a type IIn supernova, SN 2010jl, which allow us to extend its circumstellar interaction studies to about 7 years post-explosion. The new data indicates that the extreme mass-loss rate 0.1 Msun/yr in SN 2010jl, reported by Chandra et al. (2015), commenced within the last 300 years before the explosion. We summarize the current status of the field and argue that via detailed studies of the circumstellar interaction, a.k.a. Time Machine technique, one of the big mysteries of stellar evolution, i.e., mapping supernovae progenitors to their explosive outcomes can be solved.</description>

      <title>Spectroscopic Classification of Extragalactic Transients from CRTS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20989</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20989v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Catalina Real-time Transient Survey (CRTS) carried out a public survey for optical transients between 2007 and 2019, discovering more than 16,000 transient candidates. Here we present the spectra and highlight the results of the spectroscopic follow-up of CRTS extragalactic transients. As expected, we find that the bulk of these transients are normal supernovae. However, as we prioritised transients exhibiting unusual features or environments during our spectroscopic follow-up, we focus on the rarer types of transients. These objects include more than a dozen type-I superluminous supernovae and dozens of type-I and II supernovae that underwent circumstellar medium interactions. We highlight several specific supernovae, including a new analysis of SN 2008iy, a type-IIn which exhibited a bright pre-supernova outburst event similar to SN 2009ip and lasted more than 1800 days; CSS111225:140122+161705, a type-I supernova that showed an extreme 2.5 magnitude rebrightening event more than 200 days after its initial outburst; and SN 2009ny, a type-Ibn supernova that exhibited strong helium emission lines similar to SN 2002ao. We confirm our previous finding that numerous CRTS transients are associated with galaxies of extremely low luminosity. We discuss the difficulty in determining the origin of transients associated with outbursts in active galactic nuclei (AGN), tidal disruption events, and type-IIn supernovae. As an example, we present CSS150120:110008+385352, a CRTS transient similar to CSS100217:102913+404220 that occurred within a quiescent AGN and peaked at Mv = -23.6.</description>

      <title>Detecting Population III Gamma-Ray Bursts in the Era of EP and SVOM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-redshift gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), putative counterparts of massive, low-metallicity Population III (Pop III) stars, are a promising probe of the first stars. We assess the detectability of these Pop III GRBs using a metallicity-based progenitor criterion and cosmological $N$-body/hydrodynamical simulations with three distinct Pop III initial mass functions (IMFs), focusing on the capabilities of the Wide-field X-ray Telescope (WXT) aboard the Einstein Probe (\emph{EP}) and the coded-mask gamma-ray imager (ECLAIRs) aboard the Space-based multi-band astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (\emph{SVOM}). Our population synthesis model, calibrated to \emph{Swift} data, predicts the following Population II/I (Pop II/I) GRB detection rates at $z&gt;6$: $\sim2.4\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{EP}/WXT and $\sim0.9\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ for \emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs. For the IMF with very massive first stars ($\mathrm{100\textrm{--}500\,M_\odot}$), we derive upper limits on the Pop III GRB rate at $z&gt;6$ of $&lt;0.06\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{EP}/WXT) and $&lt;0.13\,\mathrm{events\,yr^{-1}}$ (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs), based on the absence of confirmed Pop III progenitors in \emph{Swift} bursts at $z&gt;5.5$. Our results indicate that while Pop III GRBs are subdominant to Pop II/I GRBs at $z&lt;10$, their fractional contribution rises significantly with redshift, reaching $\sim8\%$ ($\sim34\%$) at $z&gt;10$ and $\sim28\%$ ($\sim68\%$) at $z&gt;16$ for \emph{EP}/WXT (\emph{SVOM}/ECLAIRs). This trend is systematically enhanced in the other two IMF models, which adopt a lower stellar mass range of $\mathrm{[0.1,\,100]\,M_\odot}$. We conclude that detecting Pop III GRBs at high redshifts is a realistic prospect, and any GRB detected at $z&gt;16$ is most likely of Pop III origin.</description>

      <title>Observation of In-ice Askaryan Radiation from High-Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21104v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first experimental evidence for in-ice Askaryan radiation -- coherent charge-excess radio emission -- from high-energy particle cascades developing in the Antarctic ice sheet. In 208 days of data recorded with the phased-array instrument of the Askaryan Radio Array, a previous analysis has incidentally identified 13 events with impulsive radiofrequency signals originating from below the ice surface. We here present a detailed reanalysis of these events. The observed event rate, radiation arrival directions, signal shape, spectral content, and electric field polarization are consistent with in-ice Askaryan radiation from cosmic ray air shower cores impacting the ice sheet. For the brightest events, the angular radiation pattern favors an extended cascade-like emitter over a pointlike source. An origin from the geomagnetic separation of charges in cosmic ray air showers is disfavored by the arrival directions and polarization. Considering the arrival angles, timing properties, and the impulsive nature of the passing events, the event rate is inconsistent with the estimation of the combined background from thermal noise events and on-surface events at the level of $5.1\,\sigma$.</description>

      <title>Dissipation and particle acceleration at intermittent structures with velocity and magnetic shear: Interaction of Kelvin-Helmholtz and Drift-Kink instabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21187v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present two-dimensional (2D) particle-in-cell simulations of a magnetized, collisionless, relativistic pair plasma subjected to combined velocity and magnetic-field shear, a scenario typical at intermittent structures in plasma turbulence. We create conditions where only the Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) and Drift-Kink (DK) instabilities can develop, while tearing modes are forbidden. The interaction of DKI and KHI generates qualitatively new structures, marked by a thickened shear layer with very weak electromagnetic field, modulated by KH vortices. Over a range of moderately strong velocity shears explored, the interaction of DKI and KHI results in a significant enhancement of dissipation over cases with only velocity shear or only magnetic shear. Moreover, we observe a new and efficient way of particle acceleration where particles are stochastically accelerated by the motional electric field exterior to the shear layer as they meander in an S-shaped pattern in and out of it. This process takes advantage of the bent geometry of the shear layer caused by the DK-KHI interaction and is responsible for most of the highest-energy particles produced in our simulations. These results further our understanding of dissipation and particle acceleration at intermittent structures, which are present in plasma turbulence across a wide range of astrophysical contexts such as in AGN jet sheaths, potentially relevant to limb-brightened emission, etc., and highlight the sensitivity of dissipation to multiple interacting instabilities, thus providing a strong motivation for further studies of their nonlinear interaction at the kinetic level.</description>

      <title>Detection of Quasi-periodic Oscillations in the $\gamma$-Ray Light Curve of 4FGL J0309.9-6058</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we report, for the first time, a quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) in the $\gamma$-ray band of 4FGL J0309.9-6058, also known as PKS 0308-611. We employed three analytical methods (the Lomb-Scargle periodogram, REDFIT, and the weighted wavelet Z-transform) to analyze the QPO signal using \textit{Fermi} $\gamma$-ray light curve data. The analysis reveals a potential QPO during MJD 57983$-$60503, with a period of approximately 550 days and a maximum local significance of 3.72$\sigma$ and global significance of 2.72$\sigma$ derived from the WWZ analysis. To validate this result, we applied Gaussian Process (GP) to the same light curve, which independently confirms the presence of QPO signal consistent with our Fourier-based results. We further extended the analysis to the full duration of the \textit{Fermi} observations, and the results consistently support and strengthen the presence of this QPO signal. Additionally, a time lag between the optical and $\gamma$-ray bands indicates separate emission regions for these two bands. Given the year-like timescale of the QPO signal and the fact that a QPO signal with local significance over 3$\sigma$ for full \textit{Fermi}-LAT observed time, we suggest that the QPO is most likely caused by a precessing jet.</description>

      <title>The relation between the optical variability timescale, magnetic field of jets and black hole spin in active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the relationship among the jet magnetic field, black hole spin, black hole mass, Eddington ratio, and optical variability timescales in jetted active galactic nuclei (AGNs). By fitting a damped random walk (DRW) model to the g-band light curves, we obtain the characteristic variability timescale ($\tau_{\rm DRW}$) for 41 jetted AGNs with precise supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass measurements. Our main results are as follows: (i) Our analysis reveals a significant correlation between the jet magnetic field ($B_{\rm 1pc}$), black hole spin ($j$) and the characteristic variability timescale within our sample. These findings suggest that the optical variability of jetted AGNs is influenced by the jet magnetic field and black hole spin. Furthermore, the characteristic variability timescale aligns with the electron escape timescale, as evidenced by the relationship between the characteristic variability timescale and jet magnetic field ($\tau_{\rm DRW}\propto B_{\rm 1pc}^{0.76\pm0.22}$). (ii) We confirm a significant correlation between the characteristic variability timescale and SMBH mass, expressed as: $\log \rm \tau_{\rm DRW} = 0.52(\pm0.21)\log M _{\rm BH}/M_{\rm \odot}-3.12(\pm1.90)$, with an intrinsic scatter of 0.08 dex. The slope of this relationship is consistent with that between the thermal timescale and black hole mass. Our results support the hypothesis that magnetorotational instability (MRI) fluctuations drive the intrinsic variability observed in the light curves emitted by the AGNs accretion disk.</description>

      <title>A simple toy model for the electromagnetic variability of lump-dominated circumbinary disks around binary black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electromagnetic detection of circumbinary disks around pre-merger binary black holes (BBHs) relies on theoretical predictions. These are generally obtained through expensive numerical simulations, but simple or fast toy models are lacking to unleash the potential of these theoretical advances for observational purposes. We aim to present a simple toy model to compute the electromagnetic variability of circumbinary disks around circular-orbit BBHs at relativistic separations, focusing on the impact of disk non-axisymmetries. We assume that the disk is threaded by spiral arms and hosts a hotspot linked to an overdense structure (the {\lq}lump{\rq}) preferably reported in binaries close to equal mass. We build a simple temperature distribution, and estimate its thermal emission, perceived by a distant observer, via a ray-tracing code in a BBH approximate metric. We propose a toy model reproducing the main lightcurve features and show it is consistent with 2D general-hydrodynamical simulations under the assumption of compressional heating and expansional cooling except for purely dynamical effects such as the binary-lump beat. The lightcurve exhibits a main modulation at the lump's period (i.e. a few times the orbital period), due to relativistic Doppler effect, and a shorter one at the orbital-like period, due to spiral arms or the beat. These are more prominent in the optical/UV band for a total binary mass $M\, {=} \, 10^{4-10}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, where the disk energy spectrum peaks. For $M=10^{9}\mathrm{M_\odot}$, a $4\%$-amplitude lump modulation is detectable with the Vera Rubin Observatory after six months of observation, up to $z\, {=}\, 0.5$. We proposed a new, simple toy model that can be used, for instance, to test the compatibility of the periodicity of BBH candidate sources with a circumbinary disk origin.</description>

      <title>The population of Galactic young massive star clusters in the TeV range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Young massive star clusters (YMSCs) can produce gamma rays in the very-high-energy (VHE, E&gt;100 GeV) range and have been proposed as sources that can accelerate cosmic rays up to PeV energies. Observations with current instruments have lead to the detection of only a few YMSCs but future instruments should significantly increase this number. However, the details of the production of the VHE emission are not well understood: What is the spectrum of accelerated particles? What is the efficiency of cosmic-ray production? What fraction of the wind luminosity is converted into the turbulent magnetic field?
  To address these questions, we simulate the population of YMSCs in the gamma-ray domain, by means of Monte Carlo methods, and apply the constraints based on the subsample of YMSCs currently detected at TeV energies. We confront our simulated populations with the catalogue of the H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey and the First LHAASO Catalogue of Gamma-Ray Sources, allowing us to investigate crucial aspects of particle acceleration at YMSCs.</description>

      <title>Multi-Messenger Search for Neutrino and Gravitational-Wave Emissions from Binary Black Holes Near Active Galactic Nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Binary black holes (BBHs) in the vicinity of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs) are particularly interesting systems from both a cosmological and astrophysical point of view. Matter and radiation fields within the dense AGN environment could produce electromagnetic and neutrino emission in addition to gravitational waves (GWs). Moreover, interactions between BBHs and AGN accretion disks are expected to influence BBH formation channels and merger rates. Understanding these sources could help explain the unexpectedly high BBH masses observed through GWs by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA collaborations. We present a search for coincident gravitational-wave and neutrino emission from AGNs. Our innovative approach combines information from gravitational-wave data, neutrino observations, and AGN optical catalogs to increase the chances of identifying potential sources and studying their properties. We assess the sensitivity of the search using subthreshold gravitational-wave candidates from LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA data, neutrino event candidates from public IceCube Neutrino Observatory data and AGN candidates from the Quaia catalog. A confident detection of such an event would mark a breakthrough in multi-messenger astronomy.</description>

      <title>Sco X-1 as a continuous gravitational waves source: modelling the secular evolution using MESA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21529v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the prospects for detecting continuous gravitational waves (GWs) from Sco X-1 and evaluate the most likely waveform- and progenitor- parameters. We study the evolution of different Sco X-1 progenitors, identifying those that give rise to detectable signals. We model the spin evolution of the neutron star (NS) by the accretion torque and the GW torque. We consider two mechanisms for generating the non-axisymmetry responsible for the GW torque: i) magnetic mountains and ii) deformation after crustal breakage. Both torques are intertwined with the binary evolution, which we trace from the formation of the NS in a binary system with a main-sequence companion. We do this with MESA, starting from a set of initial binary configurations. At current sensitivity, a magnetic ellipticity of $\varepsilon\gtrsim 10^{-6}$ is necessary for detection. The highest frequency at which we have detectable signals increases with the accretion efficiency $\eta$, and it can be as high as 360Hz. At 3G (Cosmic Explorer/Einstein telescope) sensitivity, less deformed Sco X-1 NSs, with ellipticities as small as $6\cdot 10^{-9}$, are detectable, but the waveform highly depends on the binary system: the highest frequency of detectable signals spans the very broad range 600-1700Hz, strongly depending on $\eta$ and mass of the progenitor donor star $M^d$. If $\eta\leq$30%, the crust does not break. When $\eta\in$[40%,60%] only progenitors with $M^d\geq[1.1,1.5]M_{\odot}$ present crustal breakage, while if $\eta\geq$70% all crusts break. In some systems the crust breaks during their Sco X-1 phase. If Sco X-1 were one of those systems, it would be emitting a very loud GW signal sweeping from O(1000)Hz down to torque-balance frequencies. We estimate current detection probability for this signal to be under 1%; this probability increases substantially -- to around 41% -- with third-generation detectors.</description>

      <title>From nuclear star clusters to Little Red Dots: black hole growth, mergers, and tidal disruptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21709</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21709v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Little Red Dots, discovered by the James Webb Space Telescope, are hypothesized to be active galactic nuclei containing a supermassive black hole, possibly surrounded by a dense stellar cluster, large amounts of gas, and likely by a population of stellar-mass black holes. We develop a simple nuclear star cluster model to evolve the rapid mass growth of black hole seeds into the supermassive regime. The combined processes of tidal disruption events, black hole captures, and gas accretion are accounted for self-consistently in our model. Given the observed number density of Little Red Dots, and under reasonable assumptions, we predict at least a few tens of tidal disruption events and at least a few black hole captures at $z=4$-$6$, with a tidal disruption event rate an order of magnitude larger than the black hole capture rate. We also estimate the uncertainties in these estimates. Finally, we comment on the low x-ray luminosity of Little Red Dots.</description>

      <title>Ab uno disce omnes: Single-harmonic search for extreme mass-ratio inspirals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Extreme mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) are one of the key sources of gravitational waves for space-based detectors such as LISA. However, their detection remains a major data analysis challenge due to the signals' complexity and length. We present a semi-coherent, time-frequency search strategy for detecting EMRI harmonics without relying on full waveform templates. We perform an injection and search campaign of single mildly-eccentric equatorial EMRIs in stationary Gaussian noise. The detection statistic is constructed solely from the EMRI frequency evolution, which is modeled phenomenologically using a Singular Value Decomposition basis. The pipeline and the detection statistic are implemented in time-frequency, enabling efficient searches over one year of data in approximately one hour on a single GPU. The search pipeline achieves 94% detection probability at $\mathrm{SNR} = 30$ for a false-alarm probability of $10^{-2}$, recovering the frequency evolution of the dominant harmonic to 1% relative error. By mapping the EMRI parameters consistent with the recovered frequency evolution, we show that the semi-coherent detection statistic enables a sub-percent precision estimation of the EMRI intrinsic parameters. These results establish a computationally efficient framework for constructing EMRI proposals for the LISA global fit.</description>

Abstract: This work is based on the letter Phys. Lett. B, 865, 139484 (2025), where we developed the analytical expression of the coordinate time in terms of the eccentric anomaly at the second post-Newtonian order in General Relativity for a compact binary system moving on eccentric orbits. The aim of this paper is to provide more details about the performed calculations and to produce other new results. More specifically, we will focus on deriving the analytical expression of the coordinate time at the second Post-Newtonian order for circular orbits and then discuss two astrophysical applications involving binary neutron star and black hole systems.</description>

      <title>Grain Boundary Diffusion in Yukawa Crystals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20980v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present calculations of diffusion coefficients in grain boundaries in Yukawa crystals for astrophysics. Our methods follow from our recent work calculating diffusion coefficients in perfect body-centered cubic crystals. These diffusion coefficients show only a weak dependence on the crystal orientations at the grain boundary and are consistent with those expected for a supercooled liquid scaled down by one to two orders of magnitude. We argue that the local disorder at the grain boundary produces a landscape of potential barriers similar to that of an amorphous liquid thin film, significantly reducing activation barriers to diffusive hops relative to the bulk solid. This also introduces a screening dependence, such that boundary diffusion does not exhibit the same universality as the bulk crystal. These diffusion coefficients suggest that grain boundaries may be a dominant source of viscous dissipation in neutron star crusts.</description>

      <title>Exploring potential astrophysical applications of black holes in nonlinear electrodynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21555v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spacetimes arising from nonlinear electrodynamics (NED) are a good laboratory for studying both the nature of regular black holes (RBH) solutions and the imprints of nonlinear electromagnetic fields within this context. Over the past few decades, NED-sourced black hole (BH) spacetimes have attracted considerable attention, but electrically charged RBHs obtained in the so-called $F$ framework have been less addressed in the literature. We consider two members of the h-family of electrically charged, fully RBHs that are solutions to general relativity minimally coupled to NED. Because of their potential astrophysical and astronomical applications, we mainly focus our investigation on the motion of photons and its implications in the shadow radius and gravitational and kinematic redshift, considering the effective geometry followed by photons in NED. For a BH charge-to-mass ratio below some moderate value, there is almost no way to distinguish these members (and likely all members) of the h-family from the Reissner-Nordstr\"om (RN) BH. In its turn, for a BH charge-to-mass ratio above some moderate value, we observe discrepancies in their physical and geometric properties in comparison to those of the RN BH. Furthermore, we also consider observational data for Sagittarius A$^{*}$ and Messier 87$^{*}$ BHs to impose some constraints on the charge-to-mass ratio of the fully RBHs.</description>

      <title>An observational study of rotation and binarity of Galactic O-type runaway stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21577</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21577v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaia DR3 data have revealed new massive runaway stars, while spectroscopic surveys enable detailed characterization. The relative contributions of binary supernova (BSS) and dynamical ejection (DES) scenarios to explain their runaway origin remain poorly constrained, particularly in the Milky Way. We aim to characterize the largest sample of Galactic O-type runaway stars ever investigated through their kinematics, rotation, and binarity to shed light into their origins. We use the GOSC-Gaia DR3 catalog, and IACOB spectroscopic information to build a sample with 214 O-type stars with projected rotational velocities ($v \sin{i}$), and a subsample of 168 O-type stars with additional information about their likely single (LS) or single-lined (SB1) spectroscopic binary nature. We also consider an additional sample of 65 double-lined (SB2) spectroscopic binaries. We find that among our sample of Galactic O-type runaways, most (74%) have $v \sin{i}&lt;200$ km/s, whereas for normal stars this fraction is slightly higher (82%). There are no fast-moving runaways being fast rotators, except for HD 124 979. Runaways show lower SB1 fractions than normal stars, with no runaway SB1 fast-rotating systems; on average, runaways rotate faster than normal stars; and their runaway fraction is higher among fast rotators (44%) vs. the slow rotators (34%). This is consistent with BSS dominance for fast rotators. We also found that SB2 systems hardly reach runaway velocities with a low runaway fraction (10%). Runaways with 2D velocities &gt; 60 km/s are mostly single and interpreted as DES products, while runaways with 2D velocities &gt; 85 km/s are also interpreted as two-step products. Three of 12 runaway SB1 systems are HMXBs. Our study reveals that most Galactic O-type runaways are slow rotators, suggests a dominance of BSS among fast-rotating runaways, and of DES and two-step among the high-velocity ones.

      <title>3D Synthetic Convective Velocity Fields to Initialise Core-Collapse Supernova Simulations from 1D Progenitors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) are among the most energetic and complex astrophysical phenomena, requiring threedimensional (3D) simulations to capture their intricate explosion mechanisms. One of the key ingredients for such simulations is the 3D pre-collapse structure, which can impact the development and geometry of the subsequent explosion. While stellar convection simulations can provide such 3D initial conditions, these remain too expensive and demanding for widespread use. In this work, we present a method to generate synthetic 3D velocity fields for convective zones from 1D initial conditions, creating initial conditions for CCSN simulations using a vector spherical harmonics expansion without the need for expensive hydrodynamic progenitor simulations. The synthetic velocity field is designed to capture the typical scales and velocities of the convective flow as the most relevant parameters for the subsequent explosions. In addition, it respects relevant physical constraints such as the near-anelasticity of flow, vanishing radial vorticity, and zero net angular momentum in the convective zones. A Python implementation of this method is publicly available, offering the CCSN community a practical tool for generating synthetic velocity fields for multi-dimensional simulations to study the impact of 3D progenitor asymmetries on the CCSN mechanism.</description>

      <title>HOLISMOKES XIX: SN 2025wny at $z=2$, the first strongly lensed superluminous supernova</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21694v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present imaging and spectroscopic observations of supernova SN 2025wny, associated with the lens candidate PS1 J0716+3821. Photometric monitoring from the Lulin and Maidanak observatories confirms multiple point-like images, consistent with SN 2025wny being strongly lensed by two foreground galaxies. Optical spectroscopy of the brightest image with the Nordic Optical Telescope and the University of Hawaii 88-inch Telescope allows us to determine the redshift to be z_s = 2.008 +- 0.001, based on narrow absorption lines originating in the interstellar medium of the supernova host galaxy. At this redshift, the spectra of SN 2025wny are consistent with those of superluminous supernovae of Type I. We find a high ejecta temperature and depressed spectral lines compared to other similar objects. We also measure, for the first time, the redshift of the fainter of the two lens galaxies (the "perturber") to be z_p = 0.375 +- 0.001, fully consistent with the DESI spectroscopic redshift of the main deflector at z_d = 0.3754. SN 2025wny thus represents the first confirmed galaxy-scale strongly lensed supernova with time delays likely in the range of days to weeks, as judged from the image separations. This makes SN 2025wny suitable for cosmography, offering a promising new system for independent measurements of the Hubble constant. Following a tradition in the field of strongly-lensed SNe, we give SN 2025wny the nickname SN Winny.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from Diffuse Supernova Background</title>

Abstract: Neutrinos are the second most abundant particles in the universe according to the Standard Model, yet they are the least likely to interact. This feature implies that detecting a neutrino can reveal valuable insights into its source. Among the known sources of neutrinos, core-collapse supernovae are one of the most efficient factories. On average, a single collapse occurs every second in the observable universe, emitting approximately $10^{58}$ neutrinos. The total flux of neutrinos reaching Earth from all core-collapse supernovae across the universe is the diffuse supernova neutrino background (DSNB). Detection of the DSNB is just around the corner. This guaranteed flux of astrophysical neutrinos encodes information about the whole supernova population, including an answer to a currently unsolved question about the rate at which black holes form from massive stars. This chapter discusses the ingredients entering the DSNB calculation as well as current experimental limits and hints.</description>

Abstract: The Tibet AS$\gamma$ experiment successfully detected sub-PeV $\gamma$-rays from the Crab nebula using a Surface Array and underground muon detector. Considering this, we are building in Bolivia a new experiment to explore the Southern Hemisphere, looking for the origins of cosmic rays in our Galaxy. The name of this project is Andes Large area PArticle detector for Cosmic ray physics and Astronomy (ALPACA). A prototype array called ALPAQUITA, with $1/4$ the total area of the full ALPACA, started observations in September $2022$. In this paper we introduce the status of ALPAQUITA and the plans to extend the array. We also report the results of the observation of the moon shadow in cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Probabilistic mapping between multiparticle production variables and the depth of maximum in proton-induced extensive air showers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08610v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interaction of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays with air nuclei triggers extensive air showers that reach their maximal energy deposition at the atmospheric depth $X_{\max}$. The distribution of this shower observable encodes information about the proton-air cross-section via fluctuations of the primary interaction point, $X_1$, and hadron production through $\Delta X_{\max} \equiv X_{\max} - X_1$.
  We introduce new multiparticle production variables, $\alpha_{\textrm{had}}$, $\zeta_{\textrm{had}}$, and $\zeta_{\mathrm{EM}}$, built from the energy spectra of secondaries in the primary interaction. Their linear combination, $\xi$, predicts over $50 \%$ of the fluctuations in $\Delta X_{\max}$. Moreover, we build a probabilistic mapping based on the causal connection between $\xi$ and $\Delta X_{\max}$ that enables model-independent predictions of $X_{\max}$ moments with biases below $3\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-2}}$. Therefore, measurements of the distribution of $X_{\max}$ allow a data-driven probing of secondary hadron spectra from the cosmic-ray-air interaction, in proton-induced showers.
  The distributions of the new multiparticle production variables can be measured in rapidity regions accessible to current accelerators and are strongly dependent on the hadronic interaction model in the kinematic regions exclusive to ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.</description>

      <title>Compact stellar systems hosting an intermediate mass black hole: magnetohydrodynamic study of inflow-outflow dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.21640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intermediate-mass black holes (IMBHs) are a missing link in black hole demographics, with only tentative observational evidence to date. Dense stellar clusters such as IRS 13E near the Galactic Center are promising IMBH hosts, where accretion is likely driven by winds from nearby Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars. Yet, the dynamics of such wind-fed systems remain largely unexplored. We investigate how high-velocity stellar winds, magnetic fields, and metallicity-dependent radiative cooling influence gas dynamics and black hole accretion in compact WR clusters. Using three-dimensional (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations, we model each WR star as a source of mass, momentum, energy, and magnetic flux, and include a cooling function that depends on chemical abundance. We compare isotropic versus disk-like stellar distributions to explore the impact of cluster geometry. Across all models, we find that the accretion rate onto the IMBH is suppressed by up to five orders of magnitude relative to the total stellar mass-loss rate. Turbulent, shock-heated outflows driven by wind-wind collisions dominate the flow, expelling most injected gas. While enhanced cooling in high-metallicity runs promotes the formation of dense clumps, these structures are typically unable to reach the black hole. The system's integrated X-ray luminosity is dominated by colliding WR winds, masking the IMBH's radiative signature. Accretion occurs in short-lived, quasi-periodic episodes triggered by close stellar passages, but even these flares remain difficult to detect against the luminous wind background. Our results naturally explain the low detectability of IMBHs in compact WR clusters and provide theoretical predictions to guide future X-ray and infrared observational strategies.</description>

      <title>Searching for Historical Extragalactic Optical Transients Associated with Fast Radio Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06420v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a systematic search for past supernovae (SNe) and other historical optical transients at the positions of fast radio burst (FRB) sources to test FRB progenitor systems. Our sample comprises 83 FRBs detected by the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) and its KKO Outrigger, along with 93 literature FRBs representing all known well-localized FRBs. We search for optical transients coincident in position and redshift with FRBs and find no significant associations within the 5-sigma FRB localization uncertainties except for a previously identified potential optical counterpart to FRB 20180916B. By constraining the timescale for SN ejecta to become transparent to FRB emission, we predict that it takes at least 6-10 years before the FRB emission can escape. From this, we infer that approximately 7% of matched optical transients, up to 30% of currently known SNe, and up to 40% of core-collapse SNe could have an observable FRB based on timescales alone. We derive the number of new, well-localized FRBs required to produce one FRB-SN match by chance, and find it will take ~ 22,700 FRBs to yield one chance association at the projected CHIME/FRB Outrigger detection rate. Looking forward, we demonstrate redshift overlap between SNe detected by the upcoming Vera C. Rubin Observatory and CHIME/FRB Outrigger FRBs, indicating the prospect of an increase in potential associations at redshift z &lt; 1. Our framework is publicly available, flexible to a wide range of transient timescales and FRB localization sizes, and can be applied to any optical transient populations in future searches.</description>

      <title>The Pierre Auger Observatory: Contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference (ICRC 2025)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13771</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13771v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Pierre Auger Observatory, located in La Pampa Amarilla, Argentina, has been continuously acquiring data since 2004. It comprises a surface detector array covering 3,000 km$^2$ and 27 fluorescence telescopes, designed to detect extensive air showers initiated by ultra-high-energy cosmic rays. An upgrade to the Observatory was commissioned in 2024, enhancing the existing water-Cherenkov detectors with additional radio antennas, surface scintillator detectors, and a buried scintillator array. This compilation of contributions to the 39th International Cosmic Ray Conference, held in Geneva, Switzerland (July 15-24, 2025), presents recent results from the Pierre Auger Collaboration, addressing a wide range of fundamental questions in astroparticle physics. The included papers cover measurements of the energy spectrum, mass composition, and arrival directions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays, investigations of hadronic interactions in extensive air showers, and searches for ultra-high-energy photons and neutrinos. Additional topics include radio detection techniques, solar-related phenomena, and atmospheric events such as ELVES and TGFs. The list also contains first results and performance evaluations of the upgraded detectors, AugerPrime, along with reports on outreach and social engagement initiatives conducted by the Collaboration.</description>

      <title>Rotating Proto-Neutron Stars Admixed with Mirror Dark Matter: A two fluid approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20823</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20823v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work investigates the impact of mirror dark matter (DM) on the global properties of rotating neutron stars (NSs) across evolutionary stages, from hot, lepton-rich protoneutron stars (PNSs) to cold, catalyzed NSs along the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale. The baryonic matter (BM) is modeled using a relativistic mean-field (RMF) approach with density-dependent couplings, while the dark sector mirrors the visible sector with analogous thermodynamic conditions. Using a two-fluid formalism with purely gravitational DM-BM interaction, we find that rotation enlarges the star, whereas DM admixture increases compactness and enhances gravitational stability. However, increased compactness due to DM lowers the threshold for rotational instabilities, making DM-admixed stars more susceptible. Rotation decreases {central temperature behavior} by redistributing thermal energy over a larger volume and reducing central density, while DM raises temperatures by deepening the gravitational potential and increasing thermal energy. Stars become more prone to collapse and rotational instabilities as frequency ($\nu$) rises and the polar-to-equatorial radius ratio ($r_p/r_e$) decreases, especially near the Keplerian limit ($\nu_K$). DM-admixed stars also show higher surface gravitational redshifts due to their compactness. Our results qualitatively agree with universal relations primarily derived for rotating cold stars. These findings highlight competing effects of rotation and DM on NS thermal evolution, structure, and observables, potentially offering indirect probes of DM within NSs.</description>

      <title>Enabling Early Transient Discovery in LSST via Difference Imaging with DECam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22156</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22156v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present SLIDE, a pipeline that enables transient discovery in data from the Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), using archival images from the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) as templates for difference imaging. We apply this pipeline to the recently released Data Preview 1 (DP1; the first public release of Rubin commissioning data) and search for transients in the resulting difference images. The image subtraction, photometry extraction, and transient detection are all performed on the Rubin Science Platform. We demonstrate that SLIDE effectively extracts clean photometry by circumventing poor or missing LSST templates. We identified 29 previously unreported transients, 12 of which would not have been detected based on the DP1 DiaObject catalog. SLIDE will be especially useful for transient analysis in the early years of LSST, when template coverage will be largely incomplete or when templates may be contaminated by transients present at the time of acquisition. We present multiband light curves for a sample of known transients, along with new transient candidates identified through our search. Finally, we discuss the prospects of applying this pipeline during the main LSST survey. Our pipeline is broadly applicable and will support studies of all transients with slowly evolving phases.</description>

Abstract: GRB 250702B is an exceptional transient that produced multiple episodes of luminous gamma-ray radiation lasting for $&gt;25$ ks, placing it among the class of ultra-long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). However, unlike any known GRB, the \textit{Einstein Probe} detected soft X-ray emission up to 24 hours before the gamma-ray triggers. We present comprehensive X-ray observations of the transient's afterglow obtained with the Neil Gehrels Swift Observatory, the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array, and the Chandra X-ray Observatory between 0.5 to 65 days (observer frame) after the initial high-energy trigger. The X-ray emission decays steeply as $\sim t^{-1.9}$, and shows short timescale X-ray variability ($\Delta T/T &lt; 0.03$) in both Swift and NuSTAR, consistent with flares superposed on an external shock continuum. Serendipitous detections by the Swift Burst Alert Telescope (BAT) out to $\sim$0.3 days and continued NuSTAR variability to $\sim$2 days imply sustained central engine activity; including the precursor, the required engine duration is $\gtrsim 3$ days. Afterglow modeling favors the combination of forward and reverse shock emission in a wind-like ($k \approx 2$) environment. These properties, especially the long-lived engine and early soft X-ray emission, are difficult to reconcile with a collapsar origin, and GRB 250702B does not fit neatly with canonical ultra-long GRBs or relativistic tidal disruption events (TDEs). A hybrid scenario in which a star is disrupted by a stellar-mass black hole (a micro-TDE) provides a plausible explanation, although a relativistic TDE from an intermediate-mass black hole remains viable.</description>

      <title>Current constraints on the minimally extended varying speed of light model through the cosmic distance duality relation</title>

Abstract: One of the most crucial tests of the standard cosmological model consists on testing possible variations on fundamental physical constants. In frameworks such as the minimally extended varying speed of light model (meVSL), the relationship between the luminosity distance ($D_{\text{L}}$) and the angular diameter distance ($D_{\text{A}}$), namely the cosmic distance duality relation (CDDR), is expected to deviate from $\eta(z) \equiv D_{\text{L}}/D_{\text{A}}(z)(1+z)^{-2} = 1$, making it a powerful probe to check a potential variation of fundamental constants. Hence, we test the viability of the meVSL model through the CDDR by comparing $D_{\text{A}}$ measurements, provided by the transverse (2D) and anisotropic (3D) baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) observations from different surveys, like SDSS, DES and DESI, in combination with $D_{\text{L}}$ measurements from Pantheon+ type Ia Supernova (SNe) compilation. The Gaussian Process reconstruction is employed on the SN data to match $D_{\text{A}}$ with $D_{\text{L}}$ at the same redshift. We find no deviation of the standard CDDR relation within 1-2.6$\sigma$ confidence level when considering SNe with 2D and 3D BAO samples combined together. However, when SNe and 2D BAO only are considered, the standard CDDR is only recovered at $\sim 4\sigma$ confidence level. However, such a result might be due to some recently discussed tensions between SN and BAO datasets, especially at low redshifts, in addition to possible inconsistencies between the BAO datasets individually. Therefore, our results show no significant evidence in favour of the meVSL model, once these potential systematics are taken into account.</description>

      <title>On Pulsar Timing Detection of Ultralight Vector Dark Matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22719</link>

Abstract: Ultralight vector dark matter induces metric fluctuations that generate timing residuals in the arrival times of pulsar emissions through two distinct modes: a fast mode, sourced by coherent field oscillations, and a slow mode, arising from interference patterns. These modes enable the detection of vector dark matter with masses $m \sim 10^{-24} - 10^{-22}\ \mathrm{eV}$ and $m \sim 10^{-18} - 10^{-16}\ \mathrm{eV}$, respectively, using pulsar timing arrays. While previous studies have explored the fast mode, they neglect the full statistical treatment of the vector field and a precise treatment of its polarization structure. In this work, we investigate the timing residuals from both modes, fully accounting for the statistical properties of ultralight vector dark matter, assuming equipartition among its three polarization states. The two-point correlation functions of timing residuals that we derive serve as direct tools for identifying vector dark matter signatures as a stochastic background in pulsar timing data.</description>

      <title>Primordial high energy neutrinos: theoretical/observational constraints and sharp spectral features</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02063v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among the few ways that allow or could allow us to probe the early Universe from the observation of a flux of primordial particles, there is one possibility which has been little studied: the observation today of high energy neutrinos which could have been emitted shortly after the Big Bang, from the decay or annihilation of early universe relics. We perform a general study of such a possibility. To this end, we first emphasise that these neutrinos could display various kinds of sharp spectral features, resulting from the primary energy spectrum at emission, and from how this spectrum is smoothed by redshift and radiative correction effects. Next, we determine the ranges of mass (from a fraction of eV all the way to the Planck scale) and lifetime of the source particles along which we do not/we do expect that the sharp spectral feature will be altered by interactions of the neutrinos on their way to the detector, mainly with the cosmic neutrino background or between themselves. We also study the theoretical (i.e. mainly BBN and CMB) and observational constraints which hold on such a possibility. This allows us to delineate the regions of parameter space (mass, lifetime and abundance) that are already excluded, hopeless for future observation or, instead, which could lead to the observation of such neutrinos in the near future.</description>
