      <title>Wall in the stability space of the gluing stability conditions on Hirzebruch surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01063v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates the wall structure of the space of stability conditions on Hirzebruch surfaces. Using the gluing construction of \cite{CP} and \cite{Uch} with respect to a fixed semiorthogonal decomposition, we focus on two main objectives: observing the intersection of the geometric chamber $U(S) \subset \mathrm{Stab}(\Sigma_e)$ with the walls of the resulting subspace, and determining the moduli space of $\sigma$-semistable objects on this subspace.</description>

      <title>On the universal curve with unordered marked points in positive characteristic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01336</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01336v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the relative pro-$\ell$ and continuous relative completions of the algebraic fundamental groups of universal curves over the moduli stack of curves with unordered marked points in positive characteristic. Using specialization and homotopy exact sequences, we compare the ordered and unordered settings and prove that the natural projection from the relative completion of the universal curve over the unordered moduli stack admits no section in positive characteristic. This yields a non-splitting result for the corresponding projection on algebraic fundamental groups. The present paper is a sequel to our earlier work in characteristic zero.</description>

      <title>Around the 'Fundamental Theorem of Algebra' (extended version)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01458v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Fundamental Theorem of Algebra (FTA) asserts that every complex polynomial has as many complex roots, counted with multiplicities, as its degree. A probabilistic analogue of this theorem for real roots of real polynomials, sometimes referred to as the Kac theorem, was found between 1938 and 1943 by J. Littlewood, A. Offord, and M. Kac. In this paper, we present several more versions of FTA: Kac type FTA for Laurent polynomials in one and many variables, Kac type FTA for polynomials on complex reductive groups arising in the context of compact group representations (similar to Laurent polynomials arising in torus representation theory), and FTA for exponential sums in one and many variables. In the case of Laurent polynomials, the result, even in the one-dimensional case, is unexpected: most of the zeros of a real Laurent polynomial are real. This text is a supplemented and more detailed version of \cite{arx}.</description>

      <title>Abelian varieties are de Rham $K(\pi,1)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01595v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by the work of Esnault-Hai, one has the notion of de Rham $K(\pi,1)$ schemes, defined as follows. Given a smooth proper geometrically connected scheme $X$ over a field $k$ of characteristic 0 and a base point $x \in X(k)$, one can define its differential fundamental group $\pi^{\mathrm{diff}}(X/k)$, which comes from the Tannakian duality of the category of coherent integrable connections on $X$. Using the formalism of $\delta$-functor, one can define natural morphisms between the group-scheme cohomology of $\pi^{\mathrm{diff}}(X/k)$ and the de Rham cohomology of $X$. One says that $X$ with $x \in X(k)$ is de Rham $K(\pi,1)$ if such morphisms are all isomorphisms. In this article, we prove that abelian varieties in characteristic 0 are de Rham $K(\pi,1)$. In the second part of the article, we study the group-scheme cohomology of the abelianization of the differential fundamental group of a smooth proper geometrically connected scheme via its Albanese variety.</description>

      <title>The geometry and singularities of the Bilinear scheme</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The goal is to study the geometry of the Bilinear scheme $\mathrm{Bilin}_{d_1,d_2,d_3}^{r_1, r_2}(\mathbb{A}^n)$ introduced by Joachim Jelisiejew. This functor can be viewed as a generalization of the Quot scheme, giving the moduli space of bilinear maps of locally free modules. We describe the relation to the Quot scheme by proving that the Bilinear functor can be realized as a closed subfunctor of a product of Quot schemes, hence the Bilinear functor is representable by a closed subscheme of the product of Quot schemes. We use this result to compute the tangent space to the Bilinear scheme representing $\mathrm{Bilin}_{d_1,d_2,d_3}^{r_1, r_2}(\mathbb{A}^n)$. We define two types of loci: the locus corresponding to tuples of points, and the totally degenerate locus. The first locus gives the main irreducible component of the Bilinear scheme. We use the theory of minimal border rank tensors and secant varieties, and find that $\mathrm{Bilin}_{d_1,d_2,d_3}^{r_1, r_2}(\mathbb{A}^n)$ is reducible for all $n$ whenever $r_i \geq d \geq 3$. We describe the $\Bbbk$-points of $\mathrm{Bilin}_{2,2,2}^{2, 2}(\mathbb{A}^1)$ in detail.</description>

      <title>Hilbert Polynomials of Calabi Yau Hypersurfaces in Toric Varieties and Lattice Points in Polytope Boundaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02176</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02176v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the Hilbert polynomial of a Calabi-Yau hypersurface $Z$ in a smooth toric variety $M$ associated to a convex polytope $\Delta$ is given by a lattice point count in the polytope boundary $\partial \Delta,$ just as the Hilbert polynomial of $M$ is known to be given by a lattice point count in the convex polytope $\Delta.$ Our main tool is a computation of the Euler class in $K$-theory of the normal line bundle to the hypersurface $Z,$ in terms of the Euler classes of the divisors corresponding to the facets of the moment polytope. We observe a remarkable parallel between our expression for the Euler class and the inclusion-exclusion principle in combinatorics. To obtain our result we combine these facts with the known relation between lattice point counts in the facets of $\Delta$ and the Hilbert polynomials of the smooth toric varieties corresponding to these facets.</description>

      <title>Local Monodromy of Constructible Sheaves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02178v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a morphism $f: X \rightarrow S$ of complex algebraic varieties and a constructible sheaf $\mathcal{G}$ on $X$, we compute the local monodromy of $Rf_*(\mathcal{G})$ and $Rf_!(\mathcal{G})$ in terms of the local monodromy of $\mathcal{G}$. Our results generalize previous results by Brieskorn, Borel, Clemens, Deligne, Landsman, Griffiths, Grothendieck, and Kashiwara in the setting of quasi-unipotent sheaves. In the following, we consider the general setting of sheaves of $R$-modules for a commutative noetherian ring $R$, and give applications to computing local monodromy of abelian covers in a uniform manner. We also obtain applications in the context of `generalized Alexander modules' and intersection cohomology with torsion coefficients.</description>

      <title>Poles of real motivic zeta functions for curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To a given real polynomial function f $\in$ R[x1, . . . , x d ], we associate real topological zeta functions Ztop,0(f\,; s) and Z $\pm$ top,0 (f\,; s) $\in$ Q(s), analogous to the topological zeta function of Denef and Loeser in the complex case. These functions are specializations of the real motivic zeta functions studied in [Fic05a] and [Cam17]. Therefore, these functions and their sets of poles are invariants of the blow-Nash equivalence. Using the approach of [Vey95], we study the poles of these real topological zeta functions, as well as real motivic zeta functions, when f is a real polynomial in two variables.</description>

      <title>Hilbert scheme of smooth projective curves of unexpected dimension \&amp; existence of a component with less than the expected number of moduli</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02235</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.02235v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We denote by $\mathcal{H}_{d,g,r}$ the Hilbert scheme of smooth curves of degree $d$ and genus $g$ in $\mathbb{P}^r$. Denoting by $\mathcal{M}_g$ the moduli space of smooth curves of genus $g$, let $\mu: \mathcal{H}_{d,g,r}\dasharrow \mathcal{M}_g$ be the natural map sending $X\in\mathcal{H}_{d,g,r}$ to its isomorphism class $\mu (X)=[X]\in\mathcal{M}_g$.
  It has been conjectured that a component $\mathcal{H}\subset\mathcal{H}_{d,g,r}$ has the minimal possible dimension $$\Xx(d,g,r):=3g-3+\rho(d,g,r)+\dim\operatorname{Aut}(\mathbb{P}^r)$$ \noindent if $\codim_{\mathcal{M}_g}\mu(\mathcal{H})\le g-5$ provided $\Xx(d,g,r)\ge 0$, where $\rho(d,g,r):=g-(r+1)(g-d+r)$ is the Brill-Noether number. In this article, we exhibit examples against the conjecture discuss further for the study of the functorial map $\mu: \\mathcal{H}{d,g,r}\dasharrow\mathcal{M}_g$ along this line.
  A component $\mathcal{H}\subset \mathcal{H}_{d,g,r}$ is said to have the {\it expected number of moduli} if $$\dim\mu({\Hh})=\min\{3g-3, 3g-3+\rho(d,g,r)\},$$provided $3g-3+\rho(d,g,r)\ge 0$. The existence of a component with strictly less than the expected number of moduli has not been known. In this paper, we show the existence of components with less than the expected number of moduli.</description>

      <title>Averages of Arithmetic Functions over Conductors of Function Fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: For a finite group $G$ and a sufficiently large (but fixed) prime power $q$ coprime to $G$ we obtain asymptotics for the number of regular Galois extensions $L/ \mathbb{F}_q(t)$, with $\mathrm{Gal}(L/\mathbb{F}_q(t)) \cong G$, ramified at a single place of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$, thus making progress on a positive characteristic analog of the Boston--Markin conjecture. We also obtain similar results for other arithmetic functions of the product of places of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$ ramified in $L$, and for more general one-variable function fields over $\mathbb{F}_q$ in place of $\mathbb{F}_q(t)$.
  Some of our proofs make crucial use of a series of recent breakthroughs by Landesman--Levy, as well as a new `vanishing of stable homology in a given direction' result for representations of braid groups arising from braided vector spaces. Other inputs include a study of (rings of coinvariants of) braided vector spaces associated to racks with $2$-cocycles, a connection between convolution of arithmetic functions and direct sums of braided vector spaces, and a Goursat lemma for racks.</description>

      <title>The existence of valuative interpolation at a singular point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01396v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The present paper studies the existence of valuative interpolation on the local ring of an irreducible analytic subvariety at singular points. We firstly develop the concepts and methods of Zhou weights and Tian functions near singular points of irreducible analytic subvarieties. By applying these tools, we establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of valuative interpolations on the rings of germs of holomorphic functions and weakly holomorphic functions at a singular point.
  As applications, we characterize the existence of valuative interpolations on the quotient ring of the ring of convergent power series in real variables. We also present separated necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of valuative interpolations on the quotient ring of polynomial rings with complex coefficients and real coefficients. Furthermore, we show that the conditions become both necessary and sufficient under certain conditions on the zero set of the given polynomials.</description>

      <title>Shifted quantum groups via critical stable envelopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.01518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.01518v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Given a symmetric quiver with potential, we develop a geometric construction of shifted Yangians acting on the critical cohomologies of antidominantly framed quiver varieties with extended potentials, using the $R$-matrices constructed from critical stable envelopes. We relate such Reshetikhin type Yangians to Drinfeld type Yangians arising from critical cohomological Hall algebras. Several detailed examples, including the trivial, Jordan, and tripled Jordan quivers are explicitly computed.
  For symmetric quiver varieties with potentials, by using the smallness property of their affinization maps, we derive explicit formulas for quantum multiplication by divisors in terms of Casimir elements of the associated Lie (super)algebras, extending results from Nakajima quiver varieties to the critical setting. A similar formula in the antidominantly framed case is also obtained, which includes Hilbert schemes of points on $\mathbb C^3$ as examples.</description>

Further, we construct projective $B$-modules $Q$ with $rank(Q)=p$, such that $x=[Q] -[B^p]\neq 0$ in $K_0(B)$ and the total Chern class $C(Q)=1+\sum_{i=1}^{p}C^k(Q) =1$ is trivial. We use the splitting theorem in \cite{ABH} that for projective $B$-modules $P$ with $rank(P)=r=\dim B-1$, vanishing $C^r(P)=0 \Longrightarrow P\cong Q\oplus B$.</description>

Abstract: We partially resolve conjectures of Deligne and Simpson concerning $\mathbb{Z}$-local systems on quasi-projective varieties that underlie a polarized variation of Hodge structure. For local systems with $\mathbb{Q}$-anisotropic monodromy, we prove (1) a relative form of Deligne's finiteness theorem, for any family of quasi-projective varieties, and (2) algebraicity of the corresponding non-abelian Hodge locus.</description>

      <title>The minimal volume of surfaces of log general type with non-empty non-klt locus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.14268</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.14268v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the minimal volume of surfaces of log general type, with non-empty non-klt locus on the ample model, is $\frac{1}{825}$. Furthermore, the ample model $V$ achieving the minimal volume is determined uniquely up to isomorphism. The canonical embedding presents $V$ as a degree $86$ hypersurface of $\mathbb P(6,11,25,43)$. This motivates a one-parameter deformation of $V$ to klt stable surfaces within the weighted projective space. Consequently, we identify a $\textit{complete}$ rational curve in the corresponding moduli space $M_{\frac{1}{825}}$.
  As an important application, we deduce that the smallest accumulation point of the set of volumes for projective log canonical surfaces equals $\frac{1}{825}$.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic morphisms, tangential basepoints, and little disks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13108v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the theory of "virtual morphisms" in logarithmic algebraic geometry, introduced by Howell. It allows one to give algebro-geometric meaning to various useful maps of topological spaces that do not correspond to morphisms of (log) schemes in the classical sense, while retaining functoriality of key constructions. In particular, we explain how virtual morphisms provide a natural categorical home for Deligne's theory of tangential basepoints: the latter are simply the virtual morphisms from a point. We also extend Howell's results on the functoriality of Betti and de Rham cohomology.
  Using this framework, we lift the topological operad of little $2$-disks to an operad in log schemes over the integers, whose virtual points are isomorphism classes of stable marked curves of genus zero equipped with a tangential basepoint. The gluing of such curves along marked points is performed using virtual morphisms that transport tangential basepoints around the curves. This builds on Vaintrob's analogous construction for framed little disks, for which the classical notion of morphism in logarithmic geometry sufficed. In this way, we obtain a direct algebro-geometric proof of the formality of the little disks operad, following the strategy envisioned by Beilinson. Furthermore, Bar-Natan's parenthesized braids naturally appear as the fundamental groupoids of our moduli spaces, with all virtual basepoints defined over the integers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.16858v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We define a derived enhancement of the hyperquot scheme (also known as nested Quot scheme), which classically parametrises flags of quotients of a perfect coherent sheaf on a projective scheme. We prove it is representable by a derived scheme, and we compute its global tangent complex. As an application, we provide a natural obstruction theory on the classical hyperquot scheme. The latter recovers the virtual fundamental class recently constructed by the first and third author in the context of the enumerative geometry of hyperquot schemes on smooth projective curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.08952v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We use categorification of monoid actions to study algebraic geometry over symmetric monoidal categories. This brings together the relative algebraic geometry over symmetric monoidal categories developed by To\"{e}n and Vaqui\'{e}, along with the theory of actegories over monoidal categories. We obtain schemes over a datum $(\mathcal C,\mathcal M)$, where $(\mathcal C,\otimes,1)$ is a symmetric monoidal category and $\mathcal M$ is an actegory over $\mathcal C$. One of our main tools is using the datum $(\mathcal C,\mathcal M)$ to give a Grothendieck topology on the category of affine schemes over $(\mathcal C,\otimes,1)$ that we call the ``spectral $\mathcal M$-topology.'' This consists of ``fpqc $\mathcal M$-coverings'' with certain special properties. We provide a description of schemes over $(\mathcal C,\mathcal M)$ in terms of quotients of disjoint unions of affine schemes over a certain equivalence relation. These categories of schemes are closed under pullbacks and coproducts, and are equipped with change of base functors induced by symmetric monoidal adjuctions accompanied by lax $\mathcal C$-linear functors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.19632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Harder-Narasimhan theory provides a canonical filtration of a vector bundle on a projective curve whose successive quotients are semistable with strictly decreasing slopes. In this article, we present the formalization of Harder-Narasimhan theory in the proof assistant Lean 4 with Mathlib. This formalization is based on a recent approach of Harder-Narasimhan theory by Chen and Jeannin, which reinterprets the theory in order-theoretic terms and avoids the classical dependence on algebraic geometry. As an application, we formalize the uniqueness of coprimary filtration of a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring, and the existence of the Jordan-H\"older filtration of a semistable Harder-Narasimhan game.

      <title>Stronger Bogomolov--Gieseker type inequality on quintic threefold</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.21288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish a stronger Bogomolov--Gieseker type inequality for slope-semistable sheaves on the smooth quintic threefold. Our approach combines a refined restriction theorem for tilt-stable objects with explicit Clifford-type bounds for semistable bundles on plane quintic curves. As a consequence, we obtain an explicit piecewise linear inequality on the Chern characters of any slope-semistable sheaf improving upon the classical Bogomolov--Gieseker bound and implying Toda's conjectural inequality.
  The method also yields a stronger Bogomolov--Gieseker type inequality on smooth quintic surfaces.
  These results provide new evidence toward the existence of a Bridgeland stability condition of Gepner type on the quintic threefold.</description>

Abstract: In the strict semi stable reduction situation, we describe the various filtrations of the perverse sheaf of nearby cycles in terms of irreducible perverse sheaves together with the action of the monodromy operator. We then study the spectral sequences associated to these filtration computing the sheaf cohomology groups. Finally we propose an illustration of how it can be used to compute the cohomology groups. Considering the similarity with the results of my paper at Duke Math. Journal,, it could be a good introduction before reading loc. cit.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18759v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $X$ be a smooth projective geometrically connected variety defined over a number field $K$. We prove that the geometric \'etale cohomology of $X$ with $\mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}$-coefficients has finitely many classes invariant under the Galois group of the maximal Kummer extension of $K$ in odd degrees. In particular, every abelian variety has finite torsion over the maximal Kummer extension. This improves results by R\"ossler and the second author as well as Murotani and Ozeki. We also show that finiteness of torsion of a given abelian variety over non-abelian solvable extensions of $K$ is not controlled by the Galois group of the extension.</description>

This problem asks whether a given local system on the complement can be realized as the solution sheaf of a logarithmic Pfaffian system with constant coefficients. In this paper, we generalize Katz's middle convolution as a functor for local systems on hyperplane complements and show that it preserves the solvability of this problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2301.05214v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: It was recently shown how to account for all instantons of hermitian matrix models via (anti-) eigenvalue-tunneling -- including both exponentially-suppressed and exponentially-enhanced transseries-transmonomials which are predicted by resurgence. Matrix-model eigenvalue-tunneling corresponds to ZZ-branes. The present work shows how matrix-model anti-eigenvalues correspond to negative-tension ZZ-branes; and how to compute generic nonperturbative sectors -- with both ZZ and negative-tension-ZZ branes -- in the minimal-string free-energy. Negative-tension D-branes are herein a requirement of resurgence. This results in the construction of minimal-string free-energy transseries and the analytic computation of their resurgent Stokes data. Calculations are presented via Liouville boundary conformal field theory and via (matching) matrix model analysis. Minimal-string results are extended to Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. Building on the matrix model analysis, one extension towards topological string theory is obtained via the remodeling-conjecture -- which allows for addressing one-cut, toric Calabi-Yau geometries. Building on the Liouville theory calculation, one other extension towards critical string theory is obtained via the H3+ - Liouville correspondence -- which allows for addressing negative-tension D-instantons in AdS spacetime. Throughout, checks of the construction and formulae are made in several examples, against both Borel resurgent analysis and string-equation transseries data.</description>

Abstract: We show that the volume of transcendental big $(1,1)$-classes on compact K\"ahler manifolds can be realized by convex bodies, thus answering questions of Lazarsfeld-Musta\c{t}\u{a} and Deng. In our approach we use an approximation process by partial Okounkov bodies together with properties of the restricted volume, and we study the extension of K\"ahler currents, as well as the bimeromorphic behavior of currents with analytic singularities. We also establish a connection between transcendental Okounkov bodies and toric degenerations.</description>

Abstract: Let $p$ be a prime number. Motivated by the local lifting problem for $(\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z})^n$ with $n&gt;1$, we prove several new results on certain $\mathbb{F}_p$-vector spaces of logarithmic differential forms on the projective line in characteristic $p$, called "spaces $L_{m+1,n}$". Expanding the previous work by the first two authors, we prove positive and negative results for the existence of spaces $L_{m+1,n}$ in many situations. Moreover, we classify all spaces $L_{4p,2}$ for any $p$, and all spaces $L_{15,2}$ for $p=3$. Among the novel tools we use, Moore determinants and computational algebra play a prominent role.</description>

      <title>Cyclic Division Algebras of Odd Prime Degree are never Amitsur-Small</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07451</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.07451v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A division ring $D$ is Amitsur-Small if for every $n$ and every maximal left ideal $I$ in $D[x_1,\dots,x_n]$, $I \cap D[x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}]$ is maximal in $D[x_1,\dots,x_{n-1}]$. The goal of this note is to prove that cyclic division algebras of odd prime degree over their center are never Amitsur-Small.</description>

      <title>Code Equivalence, Point Set Equivalence, and Polynomial Isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.06843v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The linear code equivalence (LCE) problem is shown to be equivalent to the point set equivalence (PSE) problem, i.e., the problem to check whether two sets of points in a projective space over a finite field differ by a linear change of coordinates. For such a point set $\mathbb{X}$, let $R$ be its homogeneous coordinate ring and $\mathfrak{J}_{\mathbb{X}}$ its canonical ideal. Then the LCE problem is shown to be equivalent to an algebra isomorphism problem for the doubling $R/\mathfrak{J}_{\mathbb{X}}$. As this doubling is an Artinian Gorenstein algebra, we can use its Macaulay inverse system to reduce the LCE problem to a Polynomial Isomorphism (PI) problem for homogeneous polynomials. The last step is polynomial time under some mild assumptions about the codes. Moreover, for indecomposable iso-dual codes we can reduce the LCE search problem to the PI search problem of degree 3 by noting that the corresponding point sets are self-associated and arithmetically Gorenstein, so that we can use the isomorphism problem for the Artinian reductions of the coordinate rings and form their Macaulay inverse systems.</description>

      <title>Classification of locally standard $T$-pseudomanifolds over topological stratified pseudomanifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10153</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10153v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce the notion of a locally standard $T$-pseudomanifold, a class that generalizes both complete toric varieties and locally standard $T$-manifolds. The main goal of this paper is to show that locally standard $T$-pseudomanifolds over topological stratified pseudomanifolds satisfying certain conditions are completely classified, up to (weakly) equivariant homeomorphism, by their characteristic data. This result extends the classification of quasitoric manifolds by Davis-Januszkiewicz. (v2: proof of Proposition 14.4 updated, several typos corrected)</description>

      <title>The leading constant in Malle's conjecture over function fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12838v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove the analogue of Malle's conjecture for the global function field $\F_q(t)$ with $q$ sufficiently large, including a precise formula for the leading constant. The main ingredients are the recent breakthrough of Landesman--Levy on the stable homology of Hurwitz spaces, a novel interpretation of the Frobenius fixed components of Hurwitz spaces in terms of the Brauer group of the stack $BG$ and an interpretation of the number of $\F_q$ points of configuration spaces as a certain Tamagawa volume.</description>
