      <title>Bridging Function Approximation and Device Physics via Negative Differential Resistance Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23638v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Achieving fully analog neural computation requires hardware that can natively implement both linear and nonlinear operations with high efficiency. While analogue matrix-vector multiplication has advanced via compute-in-memory architectures, nonlinear activation functions remain a bottleneck, often requiring digital or hybrid solutions. Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold framework, we propose KANalogue, a fully analogue implementation of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) using negative differential resistance devices as physical realizations of learnable univariate basis functions. By leveraging the intrinsic negative differential resistance characteristics of tunnel diodes fabricated from NbSi2N4/HfSi2N4 heterostructures, we construct coordinate-wise nonlinearities with distinct curvature and support profiles. We extract I-V data from fabricated armchair and zigzag devices, fit high-order polynomials to emulate diode behavior in software, and train KANs on vision benchmarks using these learned basis functions. Our results demonstrate that KANalogue can approximate complex functions with minimal parameters while maintaining classification accuracy competitive with digital baselines. This work bridges device-level physics and function approximation theory, charting a path toward scalable, energy-efficient analogue machine learning systems.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Fitness Averaging Strategies in Cooperative NeuroCoEvolution for Automated Soft Actuator Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Soft robotics are increasingly favoured in specific applications such as healthcare, due to their adaptability, which stems from the non-linear properties of their building materials. However, these properties also pose significant challenges in designing the morphologies and controllers of soft robots. The relatively short history of this field has not yet produced sufficient knowledge to consistently derive optimal solutions. Consequently, an automated process for the design of soft robot morphologies can be extremely helpful. This study focusses on the cooperative NeuroCoEvolution of networks that are indirect representations of soft robot actuators. Both the morphologies and controllers represented by Compositional Pattern Producing Networks are evolved using the well-established method NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies (CPPN-NEAT). The CoEvolution of controllers and morphologies is implemented using the top n individuals from the cooperating population, with various averaging methods tested to determine the fitness of the evaluated individuals. The test-case application for this research is the optimisation of a soft actuator for a drug delivery system. The primary metric used is the maximum displacement of one end of the actuator in a specified direction. Additionally, the robustness of the evolved morphologies is assessed against a range of randomly generated controllers to simulate potential noise in real-world applications. The results of this investigation indicate that CPPN-NEAT produces superior morphologies compared to previously published results from multi-objective optimisation, with reduced computational effort and time. Moreover, the best configuration is found to be CoEvolution with the two best individuals from the cooperative population and the averaging of their fitness using the weighted mean method.</description>

      <title>Dynamic RIS-Assisted THz Quantum Networks: Joint Optimization of Entanglement Generation and Fidelity under Channel Impairments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum networks (QNs) supported by terahertz (THz) wireless links present a transformative alternative to fiber-based infrastructures, particularly in mobile and infrastructure-scarce environments. However, signal attenuation, molecular absorption, and severe propagation losses in THz channels pose significant challenges to reliable quantum state transmission and entanglement distribution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a dynamic reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted wireless QN architecture that leverages adaptive RIS elements capable of switching between active and passive modes based on the incident signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). These dynamic RIS elements enhance beamforming control over amplitude and phase, enabling robust redirection and compensation for THz-specific impairments. We develop a detailed analytical model that incorporates key physical layer phenomena in THz quantum links, including path loss, fading, thermal noise, and alignment variations. A secure optimization framework is formulated to jointly determine RIS placement and entanglement generation rate (EGR) allocation, while satisfying fidelity, security, and fairness constraints under diverse quality of service (QoS) demands. The model also includes an exploration of side-channel vulnerabilities arising from dynamic RIS switching patterns. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed architecture yields up to 87\% fidelity enhancement and 65\% fairness improvement compared to static RIS baselines, while maintaining robustness under realistic THz channel conditions. These results underscore the promise of dynamic RIS technology in enabling scalable and adaptive quantum communications over wireless THz links.</description>

      <title>Quantum Machine Learning for Image Classification: A Hybrid Model of Residual Network with Quantum Support Vector Machine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23659v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recently, there has been growing attention on combining quantum machine learning (QML) with classical deep learning approaches, as computational techniques are key to improving the performance of image classification tasks. This study presents a hybrid approach that uses ResNet-50 (Residual Network) for feature extraction and Quantum Support Vector Machines (QSVM) for classification in the context of potato disease detection. Classical machine learning as well as deep learning models often struggle with high-dimensional and complex datasets, necessitating advanced techniques like quantum computing to improve classification efficiency. In our research, we use ResNet-50 to extract deep feature representations from RGB images of potato diseases. These features are then subjected to dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The resulting features are processed through QSVM models which apply various quantum feature maps such as ZZ, Z, and Pauli-X to transform classical data into quantum states. To assess the model performance, we compared it with classical machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) using five-fold stratified cross-validation for comprehensive evaluation. The experimental results demonstrate that the Z-feature map-based QSVM outperforms classical models, achieving an accuracy of 99.23 percent, surpassing both SVM and RF models. This research highlights the advantages of integrating quantum computing into image classification and provides a potential disease detection solution through hybrid quantum-classical modeling.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning-Driven User Localization in RIS-Assisted Wireless Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) targets ultra reliable, low latency (URLLC) gigabit connectivity in mmWave bands, where directional channels require precise beam alignment. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) reshape wave propagation and extend coverage, but they enlarge the beam search space at the base station, making exhaustive sweeps inefficient due to control overhead and latency. We propose an ML based user localization framework for RIS assisted communication at 27 GHz. A 20x20 RIS reflects signals from a core network connected base station and sweeps beams across the 0-90 degree elevation plane, divided into four angular sectors. We build a dataset by recording received signal power (Pr in dBm) across user locations and train multiple regressors, including decision tree (DT), support vector regressor (SVR), k nearest neighbor (KNN), XGBoost, gradient boosting, and random forest. In operation, an unknown user in the same plane measures four received power values (one per sector) and reports them to the pretrained RIS controller, which predicts the user's angular position in real time. Evaluation using mean absolute error (MAE), root mean squared error (RMSE), and R squared (R2) shows high accuracy. The DT model achieves an MAE of 4.8 degrees with R2 = 0.96, while other models reach 70 to 86 percent. Predicted radiation patterns, including main lobe alignment between 52 and 55 degrees, closely track ground truth. The framework reduces beam probing, enables faster alignment, and lowers latency for RIS assisted 6G networks.</description>

      <title>MFiSP: A Multimodal Fire Spread Prediction Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.23934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The 2019-2020 Black Summer bushfires in Australia devastated 19 million hectares, destroyed 3,000 homes, and lasted seven months, demonstrating the escalating scale and urgency of wildfire threats requiring better forecasting for effective response. Traditional fire modeling relies on manual interpretation by Fire Behaviour Analysts (FBAns) and static environmental data, often leading to inaccuracies and operational limitations. Emerging data sources, such as NASA's FIRMS satellite imagery and Volunteered Geographic Information, offer potential improvements by enabling dynamic fire spread prediction. This study proposes a Multimodal Fire Spread Prediction Framework (MFiSP) that integrates social media data and remote sensing observations to enhance forecast accuracy. By adapting fuel map manipulation strategies between assimilation cycles, the framework dynamically adjusts fire behavior predictions to align with the observed rate of spread. We evaluate the efficacy of MFiSP using synthetically generated fire event polygons across multiple scenarios, analyzing individual and combined impacts on forecast perimeters. Results suggest that our MFiSP integrating multimodal data can improve fire spread prediction beyond conventional methods reliant on FBAn expertise and static inputs.</description>

      <title>Flexing RISC-V Instruction Subset Processors to Extreme Edge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04567v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents an automated approach for designing processors that support a subset of the RISC-V instruction set architecture (ISA) for a new class of applications at Extreme Edge. The electronics used in extreme edge applications must be area and power-efficient, but also provide additional qualities, such as low cost, conformability, comfort and sustainability. Flexible electronics, rather than silicon-based electronics, will be able to meet the above qualities. For this purpose, we propose a methodology for generating RISC-V instruction subset processors (RISSPs) tailored to these applications and implementing them as flexible integrated circuits (FlexICs). The methodology makes verification an integral part of the processor design by treating each instruction in the ISA as a discrete, fully functional, pre-verified hardware block. It automatically builds a custom processor by stitching together the instruction hardware blocks required by an application or a set of applications in a specific domain. We generate RISSPs using the proposed methodology for three extreme edge applications, and embedded applications from the Embench benchmark suite. When synthesized, RISSPs can achieve 8-to-43% reduction in area and 3-to-30% reduction in power compared to a processor supporting the full RISC-V ISA, and are also on average ~40 times more energy efficient than Serv - the world's smallest 32-bit RISC-V processor. When physically implemented as FlexICs, the three extreme edge RISSPs achieve up to 42% area and 21% power savings with respect to the full RISC-V processor.</description>

      <title>Measuring multi-site pulse transit time with an AI-enabled mmWave radar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18141</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18141v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Pulse Transit Time (PTT) is a measure of arterial stiffness and a physiological marker associated with cardiovascular function, with an inverse relationship to diastolic blood pressure (DBP). We present the first AI-enabled mmWave system for contactless multi-site PTT measurement using a single radar. By leveraging radar beamforming and deep learning algorithms our system simultaneously measures PTT and estimates diastolic blood pressure at multiple sites. The system was evaluated across three physiological pathways - heart-to-radial artery, heart-to-carotid artery, and mastoid area-to-radial artery -- achieving correlation coefficients of 0.73-0.89 compared to contact-based reference sensors for measuring PTT. Furthermore, the system demonstrated correlation coefficients of 0.90-0.92 for estimating DBP, and achieved a mean error of -1.00-0.62 mmHg and standard deviation of 4.97-5.70 mmHg, meeting the FDA's AAMI guidelines for non-invasive blood pressure monitors. These results suggest that our proposed system has the potential to provide a non-invasive measure of cardiovascular health across multiple regions of the body.</description>
