      <title>A Theoretical Review on Solving Algebra Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving algebra problems (APs) continues to attract significant research interest as evidenced by the large number of algorithms and theories proposed over the past decade. Despite these important research contributions, however, the body of work remains incomplete in terms of theoretical justification and scope. The current contribution intends to fill the gap by developing a review framework that aims to lay a theoretical base, create an evaluation scheme, and extend the scope of the investigation. This paper first develops the State Transform Theory (STT), which emphasizes that the problem-solving algorithms are structured according to states and transforms unlike the understanding that underlies traditional surveys which merely emphasize the progress of transforms. The STT, thus, lays the theoretical basis for a new framework for reviewing algorithms. This new construct accommodates the relation-centric algorithms for solving both word and diagrammatic algebra problems. The latter not only highlights the necessity of introducing new states but also allows revelation of contributions of individual algorithms obscured in prior reviews without this approach.</description>

      <title>Integrating Fuzzy Logic into Deep Symbolic Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00431v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Credit card fraud detection is a critical concern for financial institutions, intensified by the rise of contactless payment technologies. While deep learning models offer high accuracy, their lack of explainability poses significant challenges in financial settings. This paper explores the integration of fuzzy logic into Deep Symbolic Regression (DSR) to enhance both performance and explainability in fraud detection. We investigate the effectiveness of different fuzzy logic implications, specifically {\L}ukasiewicz, G\"odel, and Product, in handling the complexity and uncertainty of fraud detection datasets. Our analysis suggest that the {\L}ukasiewicz implication achieves the highest F1-score and overall accuracy, while the Product implication offers a favorable balance between performance and explainability. Despite having a performance lower than state-of-the-art (SOTA) models due to information loss in data transformation, our approach provides novelty and insights into into integrating fuzzy logic into DSR for fraud detection, providing a comprehensive comparison between different implications and methods.</description>

      <title>Symbolic Regression with a Learned Concept Library</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.09359v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a novel method for symbolic regression (SR), the task of searching for compact programmatic hypotheses that best explain a dataset. The problem is commonly solved using genetic algorithms; we show that we can enhance such methods by inducing a library of abstract textual concepts. Our algorithm, called LaSR, uses zero-shot queries to a large language model (LLM) to discover and evolve concepts occurring in known high-performing hypotheses. We discover new hypotheses using a mix of standard evolutionary steps and LLM-guided steps (obtained through zero-shot LLM queries) conditioned on discovered concepts. Once discovered, hypotheses are used in a new round of concept abstraction and evolution. We validate LaSR on the Feynman equations, a popular SR benchmark, as well as a set of synthetic tasks. On these benchmarks, LaSR substantially outperforms a variety of state-of-the-art SR approaches based on deep learning and evolutionary algorithms. Moreover, we show that LaSR can be used to discover a novel and powerful scaling law for LLMs.</description>
