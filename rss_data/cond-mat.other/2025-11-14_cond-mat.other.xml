      <title>Chiral orbital/spin textures and Edelstein effects in monolayer Janus TMDs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the orbital and spin Edelstein effect(OEE and SEE) in two-dimensional Janus transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) of the form MXX$^\prime$ $(M = Mo,\ W,\ Nb;\ X/X^\prime = S,\ Se,\ Te)$ with the aid of density functional theory calculations and tight-binding model Hamiltonian studies. The chalcogen layers $X$ and $X^\prime$, break the mirror symmetry to introduce an internal electric field $E_{int}$ normal to the plane, which is responsible for OEE and SEE. Our results show that in a non-Janus framework, the wavefunctions at the valence and conduction bands are dominated with the $|x^2-y^2&gt;$, $|xy&gt;$, and $|z^2&gt;$ orbitals. Due to the $E_{int}$ of the Janus system, these orbitals are now intermixed with the $|xz&gt;$ and $|yz&gt;$ orbitals to produce a robust orbital texture around the valleys $\Gamma,K$ and $K^\prime$. The spin orbit coupling, in addition to the formation of a spin texture, introduces a chirality reversal to the orbital texture. An applied in plane electric field creates both OEE and SEE with the former being one order higher in magnitude. This makes the Janus materials promising for spin-orbitronics. Our work paves the way for further experimental exploration for orbital and spin orbital torque in Janus TMDs.</description>

      <title>From One to Two Dimensions: Magnetic Phases in Weakly Coupled Spin Ladders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A large variety of materials can be approximately described by means of spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladders. Here, the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm together with a previously established numerical self-consistent mean-field approximation is used to investigate the magnetic properties of spin ladders coupled in a second dimension. The full ground state phase diagram including spin-gapped, antiferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and fully polarized phases is presented as a function of interladder and intraladder coupling and magnetic field. Measurement of the dependence of magnetization on applied magnetic field is shown to enable location of a material on the phase diagram and determination of the Hamiltonian parameters. These results provide a practical route toward identifying and characterizing magnetic materials composed of coupled spin ladders.</description>

      <title>Broadband ultrafast self-heterodyned chiro-optical spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10574v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy provides unique access to the structural dynamics of molecules, spin-valley relaxation in semiconductors, and the non-equilibrium optical response of chiral nanophotonic systems. Yet, because chiral signals are intrinsically weak and time-resolved spectroscopy probes small photoinduced changes, transient chiro-optical responses are often difficult to isolate from parasitic achiral contributions. Here, we introduce a broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy technique that integrates a birefringent common-path interferometer with an optical polarization bridge to sensitively detect photoinduced changes in the polarization state of light. Phase-sensitive self-heterodyned detection enables simultaneous measurement of transient circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion across a broad spectral range with ultrafast temporal resolution. Balanced detection suppresses excess laser noise, enabling exceptional sensitivity (&lt;50 ${\mu}$deg) close to shot-noise limit. We demonstrate this approach on an array of gold nano-helicoids, supported by a full-wave time-resolved model of the spatiotemporal dynamics of plasmonic non-equilibrium carriers and their associated optical nonlinearities. The model traces the system's transient chiro-optical response back to photoinduced modulations of the electric-magnetic dipole interaction in the nano-helicoid, elucidating the connection of near- and far-field dynamics in the non-equilibrium regime. We further investigate spin excitation, thermalization, and relaxation in a lead halide perovskite, establishing a novel approach to broadband time-resolved Faraday rotation. The simplicity, sensitivity, and wide applicability of this detection scheme provide a powerful platform for broadband ultrafast chiro-optical spectroscopy, opening new opportunities in biochemistry, solid-state physics, and nanophotonics.</description>

      <title>Financial Interactions and Collective States: Part II. Banks, Investors and Firms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17328v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In a previous paper, we applied a field formalism to analyze capital allocation and accumulation within a microeconomic framework of investors and firms. The financial connections were modeled by a field of stakes, representing the links between agents. We showed that the resulting collective states were composed of interconnected groups of agents defined by their connections, their returns and disposable capital. However, within this framework, the collective states exhibited structural instability, as capital shortages in specific sectors could trigger cascades of defaults. The present model refines this framework by introducing a third type of agent, banks, a type of investor that can create money through loans. We show that money creation neither eliminates systemic instability nor prevents the emergence of defaults. In fact, the effect of banks on system stability and defaults is ambiguous: When banks favor firms over investors, money creation stabilizes the system by providing the necessary capital to prevent initial defaults, whereas when banks favor investors over firms, investors' influence is strengthened, potentially amplifying instability and defaults. Moreover, regardless of whether they favor investors or firms, banks may facilitate the propagation of defaults once they have started. Ultimately, because banks are themselves investors, the emergence of highly capitalized, high-return banks can directly generate instability in the system. Beyond these mechanisms, the analysis reveals the structural limits of macroprudential regulation. Highly capitalized, high-return investors and banks may appear more diversified and resilient, yet they constitute the primary source of endogenous instability. The model thus highlights that systemic fragility is inherent to the very structure of financial interdependence and capital flows.</description>

      <title>A Gross-Pitaevskii theory for an excitonic incompressible Bose solid</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20236</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.20236v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that interlayer excitons in double-layer semiconductor heterostructures can form a Bose solid, which is an incompressible supersolid characterized by exactly one boson per lattice site. This exciton Bose solid would be the first realization of an incompressible supersolid, unlike the generally compressible cluster supersolids seen in dipolar quantum gases. Capturing its characteristics and associated emergent phenomena requires extending the Gross-Pitaevskii formalism to include strong two-particle correlations and exclude exciton self-interactions. We develop such a formalism, we apply it across experimentally accessible exciton densities and interlayer separations, and we show that it incorporates both superfluid and incompressible supersolid ground states. This extended framework allows us to determine the superfluid-supersolid transition and explore the low-temperature properties of the exciton supersolid across its complete parameter space.</description>
