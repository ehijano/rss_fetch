      <title>Poutine: Vision-Language-Trajectory Pre-Training and Reinforcement Learning Post-Training Enable Robust End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11234</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11234v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present Poutine, a 3B-parameter vision-language model (VLM) tailored for end-to-end autonomous driving in long-tail driving scenarios. Poutine is trained in two stages. To obtain strong base driving capabilities, we train Poutine-Base in a self-supervised vision-language-trajectory (VLT) next-token prediction fashion on 83 hours of CoVLA nominal driving and 11 hours of Waymo long-tail driving. Accompanying language annotations are auto-generated with a 72B-parameter VLM. Poutine is obtained by fine-tuning Poutine-Base with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using less than 500 preference-labeled frames from the Waymo validation set. We show that both VLT pretraining and RL fine-tuning are critical to attain strong driving performance in the long-tail. Poutine-Base achieves a rater-feedback score (RFS) of 8.12 on the validation set, nearly matching Waymo's expert ground-truth RFS. The final Poutine model achieves an RFS of 7.99 on the official Waymo test set, placing 1st in the 2025 Waymo Vision-Based End-to-End Driving Challenge by a significant margin. These results highlight the promise of scalable VLT pre-training and lightweight RL fine-tuning to enable robust and generalizable autonomy.</description>

      <title>Gondola: Grounded Vision Language Planning for Generalizable Robotic Manipulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11261v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Robotic manipulation faces a significant challenge in generalizing across unseen objects, environments and tasks specified by diverse language instructions. To improve generalization capabilities, recent research has incorporated large language models (LLMs) for planning and action execution. While promising, these methods often fall short in generating grounded plans in visual environments. Although efforts have been made to perform visual instructional tuning on LLMs for robotic manipulation, existing methods are typically constrained by single-view image input and struggle with precise object grounding. In this work, we introduce Gondola, a novel grounded vision-language planning model based on LLMs for generalizable robotic manipulation. Gondola takes multi-view images and history plans to produce the next action plan with interleaved texts and segmentation masks of target objects and locations. To support the training of Gondola, we construct three types of datasets using the RLBench simulator, namely robot grounded planning, multi-view referring expression and pseudo long-horizon task datasets. Gondola outperforms the state-of-the-art LLM-based method across all four generalization levels of the GemBench dataset, including novel placements, rigid objects, articulated objects and long-horizon tasks.</description>

      <title>Demonstration Sidetracks: Categorizing Systematic Non-Optimality in Human Demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Learning from Demonstration (LfD) is a popular approach for robots to acquire new skills, but most LfD methods suffer from imperfections in human demonstrations. Prior work typically treats these suboptimalities as random noise. In this paper we study non-optimal behaviors in non-expert demonstrations and show that they are systematic, forming what we call demonstration sidetracks. Using a public space study with 40 participants performing a long-horizon robot task, we recreated the setup in simulation and annotated all demonstrations. We identify four types of sidetracks (Exploration, Mistake, Alignment, Pause) and one control pattern (one-dimension control). Sidetracks appear frequently across participants, and their temporal and spatial distribution is tied to task context. We also find that users' control patterns depend on the control interface. These insights point to the need for better models of suboptimal demonstrations to improve LfD algorithms and bridge the gap between lab training and real-world deployment. All demonstrations, infrastructure, and annotations are available at https://github.com/AABL-Lab/Human-Demonstration-Sidetracks.</description>

      <title>Sensor Model Identification via Simultaneous Model Selection and State Variable Determination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a method for the unattended gray-box identification of sensor models commonly used by localization algorithms in the field of robotics. The objective is to determine the most likely sensor model for a time series of unknown measurement data, given an extendable catalog of predefined sensor models. Sensor model definitions may require states for rigid-body calibrations and dedicated reference frames to replicate a measurement based on the robot's localization state. A health metric is introduced, which verifies the outcome of the selection process in order to detect false positives and facilitate reliable decision-making. In a second stage, an initial guess for identified calibration states is generated, and the necessity of sensor world reference frames is evaluated. The identified sensor model with its parameter information is then used to parameterize and initialize a state estimation application, thus ensuring a more accurate and robust integration of new sensor elements. This method is helpful for inexperienced users who want to identify the source and type of a measurement, sensor calibrations, or sensor reference frames. It will also be important in the field of modular multi-agent scenarios and modularized robotic platforms that are augmented by sensor modalities during runtime. Overall, this work aims to provide a simplified integration of sensor modalities to downstream applications and circumvent common pitfalls in the usage and development of localization approaches.</description>

      <title>Robust Optimal Task Planning to Maximize Battery Life</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper proposes a control-oriented optimization platform for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs), focusing on extending battery life while ensuring task completion. The requirement of fast AMR task planning while maintaining minimum battery state of charge, thus maximizing the battery life, renders a bilinear optimization problem. McCormick envelop technique is proposed to linearize the bilinear term. A novel planning algorithm with relaxed constraints is also developed to handle parameter uncertainties robustly with high efficiency ensured. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the utility of the proposed methods in reducing battery degradation while satisfying task completion requirements.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11335v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Do fish respond to the presence of underwater vehicles, potentially biasing our estimates about them? If so, are there strategies to measure and mitigate this response? This work provides a theoretical and practical framework towards bias-free estimation of animal behavior from underwater vehicle observations. We also provide preliminary results from the field in coral reef environments to address these questions.</description>

      <title>Robotic System for Chemical Experiment Automation with Dual Demonstration of End-effector and Jig Operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While robotic automation has demonstrated remarkable performance, such as executing hundreds of experiments continuously over several days, it is challenging to design a program that synchronizes the robot's movements with the experimental jigs to conduct an experiment. We propose a concept that enables the automation of experiments by utilizing dual demonstrations of robot motions and jig operations by chemists in an experimental environment constructed to be controlled by a robot. To verify this concept, we developed a chemical-experiment-automation system consisting of jigs to assist the robot in experiments, a motion-demonstration interface, a jig-control interface, and a mobile manipulator. We validate the concept through polymer-synthesis experiments, focusing on critical liquid-handling tasks such as pipetting and dilution. The experimental results indicate high reproducibility of the demonstrated motions and robust task-success rates. This comprehensive concept not only simplifies the robot programming process for chemists but also provides a flexible and efficient solution to accommodate a wide range of experimental conditions, contributing significantly to the field of chemical experiment automation.</description>

      <title>Control Architecture and Design for a Multi-robotic Visual Servoing System in Automated Manufacturing Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11387</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11387v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The use of robotic technology has drastically increased in manufacturing in the 21st century. But by utilizing their sensory cues, humans still outperform machines, especially in micro scale manufacturing, which requires high-precision robot manipulators. These sensory cues naturally compensate for high levels of uncertainties that exist in the manufacturing environment. Uncertainties in performing manufacturing tasks may come from measurement noise, model inaccuracy, joint compliance (e.g., elasticity), etc. Although advanced metrology sensors and high precision microprocessors, which are utilized in modern robots, have compensated for many structural and dynamic errors in robot positioning, a well-designed control algorithm still works as a comparable and cheaper alternative to reduce uncertainties in automated manufacturing. Our work illustrates that a multi-robot control system that simulates the positioning process for fastening and unfastening applications can reduce various uncertainties, which may occur in this process, to a great extent. In addition, most research papers in visual servoing mainly focus on developing control and observation architectures in various scenarios, but few have discussed the importance of the camera's location in the configuration. In a manufacturing environment, the quality of camera estimations may vary significantly from one observation location to another, as the combined effects of environmental conditions result in different noise levels of a single image shot at different locations. Therefore, in this paper, we also propose a novel algorithm for the camera's moving policy so that it explores the camera workspace and searches for the optimal location where the image noise level is minimized.</description>

      <title>Multi-Loco: Unifying Multi-Embodiment Legged Locomotion via Reinforcement Learning Augmented Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Generalizing locomotion policies across diverse legged robots with varying morphologies is a key challenge due to differences in observation/action dimensions and system dynamics. In this work, we propose Multi-Loco, a novel unified framework combining a morphology-agnostic generative diffusion model with a lightweight residual policy optimized via reinforcement learning (RL). The diffusion model captures morphology-invariant locomotion patterns from diverse cross-embodiment datasets, improving generalization and robustness. The residual policy is shared across all embodiments and refines the actions generated by the diffusion model, enhancing task-aware performance and robustness for real-world deployment. We evaluated our method with a rich library of four legged robots in both simulation and real-world experiments. Compared to a standard RL framework with PPO, our approach -- replacing the Gaussian policy with a diffusion model and residual term -- achieves a 10.35% average return improvement, with gains up to 13.57% in wheeled-biped locomotion tasks. These results highlight the benefits of cross-embodiment data and composite generative architectures in learning robust, generalized locomotion skills.</description>

      <title>Foundation Models in Autonomous Driving: A Survey on Scenario Generation and Scenario Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For autonomous vehicles, safe navigation in complex environments depends on handling a broad range of diverse and rare driving scenarios. Simulation- and scenario-based testing have emerged as key approaches to development and validation of autonomous driving systems. Traditional scenario generation relies on rule-based systems, knowledge-driven models, and data-driven synthesis, often producing limited diversity and unrealistic safety-critical cases. With the emergence of foundation models, which represent a new generation of pre-trained, general-purpose AI models, developers can process heterogeneous inputs (e.g., natural language, sensor data, HD maps, and control actions), enabling the synthesis and interpretation of complex driving scenarios. In this paper, we conduct a survey about the application of foundation models for scenario generation and scenario analysis in autonomous driving (as of May 2025). Our survey presents a unified taxonomy that includes large language models, vision-language models, multimodal large language models, diffusion models, and world models for the generation and analysis of autonomous driving scenarios. In addition, we review the methodologies, open-source datasets, simulation platforms, and benchmark challenges, and we examine the evaluation metrics tailored explicitly to scenario generation and analysis. Finally, the survey concludes by highlighting the open challenges and research questions, and outlining promising future research directions. All reviewed papers are listed in a continuously maintained repository, which contains supplementary materials and is available at https://github.com/TUM-AVS/FM-for-Scenario-Generation-Analysis.</description>

      <title>Construction of a Multiple-DOF Under-actuated Gripper with Force-Sensing via Deep Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a novel under-actuated gripper with two 3-joint fingers, which realizes force feedback control by the deep learning technique- Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, without any force sensor. First, a five-linkage mechanism stacked by double four-linkages is designed as a finger to automatically achieve the transformation between parallel and enveloping grasping modes. This enables the creation of a low-cost under-actuated gripper comprising a single actuator and two 3-phalange fingers. Second, we devise theoretical models of kinematics and power transmission based on the proposed gripper, accurately obtaining fingertip positions and contact forces. Through coupling and decoupling of five-linkage mechanisms, the proposed gripper offers the expected capabilities of grasping payload/force/stability and objects with large dimension ranges. Third, to realize the force control, an LSTM model is proposed to determine the grasping mode for synthesizing force-feedback control policies that exploit contact sensing after outlining the uncertainty of currents using a statistical method. Finally, a series of experiments are implemented to measure quantitative indicators, such as the payload, grasping force, force sensing, grasping stability and the dimension ranges of objects to be grasped. Additionally, the grasping performance of the proposed gripper is verified experimentally to guarantee the high versatility and robustness of the proposed gripper.</description>

      <title>Robot Context Protocol (RCP): A Runtime-Agnostic Interface for Agent-Aware Robot Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11650</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11650v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Robot Context Protocol (RCP) is a lightweight, middleware-agnostic communication protocol designed to simplify the complexity of robotic systems and enable seamless interaction between robots, users, and autonomous agents. RCP provides a unified and semantically meaningful interface that decouples client-facing operations from backend implementations, supporting a wide range of deployment environments including physical robots, cloud-based orchestrators, and simulated platforms. Built on HTTP and WebSocket transport layers, the protocol defines a schema-driven message format with structured operations such as read, write, execute, and subscribe. It integrates features such as runtime introspection, asynchronous feedback, multi-tenant namespace isolation, and strict type validation to ensure robustness, scalability, and security. The architecture, message structure, interface model, and adapter-based backend integration strategy of RCP are described, along with deployment practices and applicability across industries including manufacturing, logistics, and healthcare. RCP enables intelligent, resilient, and safe robotic operations in complex, multi-agent ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Collaborative Material Distribution System for Intelligent Robots In Smart Manufacturing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11723</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11723v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The collaboration and interaction of multiple robots have become integral aspects of smart manufacturing. Effective planning and management play a crucial role in achieving energy savings and minimising overall costs. This paper addresses the real-time Dynamic Multiple Sources to Single Destination (DMS-SD) navigation problem, particularly with a material distribution case for multiple intelligent robots in smart manufacturing. Enumerated solutions, such as in \cite{xiao2022efficient}, tackle the problem by generating as many optimal or near-optimal solutions as possible but do not learn patterns from the previous experience, whereas the method in \cite{xiao2023collaborative} only uses limited information from the earlier trajectories. Consequently, these methods may take a considerable amount of time to compute results on large maps, rendering real-time operations impractical. To overcome this challenge, we propose a lightweight Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) method to address the DMS-SD problem. The proposed DRL method can be efficiently trained and rapidly converges to the optimal solution using the designed target-guided reward function. A well-trained DRL model significantly reduces the computation time for the next movement to a millisecond level, which improves the time up to 100 times in our experiments compared to the enumerated solutions. Moreover, the trained DRL model can be easily deployed on lightweight devices in smart manufacturing, such as Internet of Things devices and mobile phones, which only require limited computational resources.</description>

      <title>CIRO7.2: A Material Network with Circularity of -7.2 and Reinforcement-Learning-Controlled Robotic Disassembler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11748</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The competition over natural reserves of minerals is expected to increase in part because of the linear-economy paradigm based on take-make-dispose. Simultaneously, the linear economy considers end-of-use products as waste rather than as a resource, which results in large volumes of waste whose management remains an unsolved problem. Since a transition to a circular economy can mitigate these open issues, in this paper we begin by enhancing the notion of circularity based on compartmental dynamical thermodynamics, namely, $\lambda$, and then, we model a thermodynamical material network processing a batch of 2 solid materials of criticality coefficients of 0.1 and 0.95, with a robotic disassembler compartment controlled via reinforcement learning (RL), and processing 2-7 kg of materials. Subsequently, we focused on the design of the robotic disassembler compartment using state-of-the-art RL algorithms and assessing the algorithm performance with respect to $\lambda$ (Fig. 1). The highest circularity is -2.1 achieved in the case of disassembling 2 parts of 1 kg each, whereas it reduces to -7.2 in the case of disassembling 4 parts of 1 kg each contained inside a chassis of 3 kg. Finally, a sensitivity analysis highlighted that the impact on $\lambda$ of the performance of an RL controller has a positive correlation with the quantity and the criticality of the materials to be disassembled.

      <title>ExoStart: Efficient learning for dexterous manipulation with sensorized exoskeleton demonstrations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advancements in teleoperation systems have enabled high-quality data collection for robotic manipulators, showing impressive results in learning manipulation at scale. This progress suggests that extending these capabilities to robotic hands could unlock an even broader range of manipulation skills, especially if we could achieve the same level of dexterity that human hands exhibit. However, teleoperating robotic hands is far from a solved problem, as it presents a significant challenge due to the high degrees of freedom of robotic hands and the complex dynamics occurring during contact-rich settings. In this work, we present ExoStart, a general and scalable learning framework that leverages human dexterity to improve robotic hand control. In particular, we obtain high-quality data by collecting direct demonstrations without a robot in the loop using a sensorized low-cost wearable exoskeleton, capturing the rich behaviors that humans can demonstrate with their own hands. We also propose a simulation-based dynamics filter that generates dynamically feasible trajectories from the collected demonstrations and use the generated trajectories to bootstrap an auto-curriculum reinforcement learning method that relies only on simple sparse rewards. The ExoStart pipeline is generalizable and yields robust policies that transfer zero-shot to the real robot. Our results demonstrate that ExoStart can generate dexterous real-world hand skills, achieving a success rate above 50% on a wide range of complex tasks such as opening an AirPods case or inserting and turning a key in a lock.

      <title>Auditory-Tactile Congruence for Synthesis of Adaptive Pain Expressions in RoboPatients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misdiagnosis can lead to delayed treatments and harm. Robotic patients offer a controlled way to train and evaluate clinicians in rare, subtle, or complex cases, reducing diagnostic errors. We present RoboPatient, a medical robotic simulator aimed at multimodal pain synthesis based on haptic and auditory feedback during palpation-based training scenarios. The robopatient functions as an adaptive intermediary, capable of synthesizing plausible pain expressions vocal and facial in response to tactile stimuli generated during palpation. Using an abdominal phantom, robopatient captures and processes haptic input via an internal palpation-to-pain mapping model. To evaluate perceptual congruence between palpation and the corresponding auditory output, we conducted a study involving 7680 trials across 20 participants, where they evaluated pain intensity through sound. Results show that amplitude and pitch significantly influence agreement with the robot's pain expressions, irrespective of pain sounds. Stronger palpation forces elicited stronger agreement, aligning with psychophysical patterns. The study revealed two key dimensions: pitch and amplitude are central to how people perceive pain sounds, with pitch being the most influential cue. These acoustic features shape how well the sound matches the applied force during palpation, impacting perceived realism. This approach lays the groundwork for high-fidelity robotic patients in clinical education and diagnostic simulation.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a multimethod framework for studying spatial and social dynamics in real-world group-agent interactions with socially interactive agents. Drawing on proxemics and bonding theories, the method combines subjective self-reports and objective spatial tracking. Applied in two field studies in a museum (N = 187) with a robot and a virtual agent, the paper addresses the challenges in aligning human perception and behavior. We focus on presenting an open source, scalable, and field-tested toolkit for future studies.</description>

      <title>Your Ride, Your Rules: Psychology and Cognition Enabled Automated Driving Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite rapid advances in autonomous driving, current autonomous vehicles (AVs) lack effective bidirectional communication with occupants, limiting personalization and recovery from immobilization. This reduces comfort and trust, potentially slowing broader AV adoption. We propose PACE-ADS (Psychology and Cognition Enabled Automated Driving Systems), a human-centered autonomy framework that enables AVs to sense, interpret, and respond to both external traffic and internal occupant states. PACE-ADS comprises three foundation model-based agents: a Driver Agent that analyzes the driving context, a Psychologist Agent that interprets occupant psychological signals (e.g., EEG, heart rate, facial expressions) and cognitive commands (e.g., speech), and a Coordinator Agent that integrates these inputs to produce high-level behavior decisions and operational parameters. Rather than replacing existing AV modules, PACE-ADS complements them by operating at the behavioral level, delegating low-level control to native AV systems. This separation enables closed-loop adaptation and supports integration across diverse platforms. We evaluate PACE-ADS in simulation across varied scenarios involving traffic lights, pedestrians, work zones, and car following. Results show that PACE-ADS adapts driving styles to occupant states, improves ride comfort, and enables safe recovery from immobilization via autonomous reasoning or human guidance. Our findings highlight the promise of LLM-based frameworks for bridging the gap between machine autonomy and human-centered driving.</description>

      <title>Palpation Alters Auditory Pain Expressions with Gender-Specific Variations in Robopatients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11906</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11906v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Diagnostic errors remain a major cause of preventable deaths, particularly in resource-limited regions. Medical training simulators, including robopatients, play a vital role in reducing these errors by mimicking real patients for procedural training such as palpation. However, generating multimodal feedback, especially auditory pain expressions, remains challenging due to the complex relationship between palpation behavior and sound. The high-dimensional nature of pain sounds makes exploration challenging with conventional methods. This study introduces a novel experimental paradigm for pain expressivity in robopatients where they dynamically generate auditory pain expressions in response to palpation force, by co-optimizing human feedback using machine learning. Using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a reinforcement learning (RL) technique optimized for continuous adaptation, our robot iteratively refines pain sounds based on real-time human feedback. This robot initializes randomized pain responses to palpation forces, and the RL agent learns to adjust these sounds to align with human preferences. The results demonstrated that the system adapts to an individual's palpation forces and sound preferences and captures a broad spectrum of pain intensity, from mild discomfort to acute distress, through RL-guided exploration of the auditory pain space. The study further showed that pain sound perception exhibits saturation at lower forces with gender specific thresholds. These findings highlight the system's potential to enhance abdominal palpation training by offering a controllable and immersive simulation platform.</description>

      <title>mimic-one: a Scalable Model Recipe for General Purpose Robot Dexterity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11916v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a diffusion-based model recipe for real-world control of a highly dexterous humanoid robotic hand, designed for sample-efficient learning and smooth fine-motor action inference. Our system features a newly designed 16-DoF tendon-driven hand, equipped with wide angle wrist cameras and mounted on a Franka Emika Panda arm. We develop a versatile teleoperation pipeline and data collection protocol using both glove-based and VR interfaces, enabling high-quality data collection across diverse tasks such as pick and place, item sorting and assembly insertion. Leveraging high-frequency generative control, we train end-to-end policies from raw sensory inputs, enabling smooth, self-correcting motions in complex manipulation scenarios. Real-world evaluations demonstrate up to 93.3% out of distribution success rates, with up to a +33.3% performance boost due to emergent self-correcting behaviors, while also revealing scaling trends in policy performance. Our results advance the state-of-the-art in dexterous robotic manipulation through a fully integrated, practical approach to hardware, learning, and real-world deployment.</description>

      <title>SAIL: Faster-than-Demonstration Execution of Imitation Learning Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11948v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Offline Imitation Learning (IL) methods such as Behavior Cloning are effective at acquiring complex robotic manipulation skills. However, existing IL-trained policies are confined to executing the task at the same speed as shown in demonstration data. This limits the task throughput of a robotic system, a critical requirement for applications such as industrial automation. In this paper, we introduce and formalize the novel problem of enabling faster-than-demonstration execution of visuomotor policies and identify fundamental challenges in robot dynamics and state-action distribution shifts. We instantiate the key insights as SAIL (Speed Adaptation for Imitation Learning), a full-stack system integrating four tightly-connected components: (1) a consistency-preserving action inference algorithm for smooth motion at high speed, (2) high-fidelity tracking of controller-invariant motion targets, (3) adaptive speed modulation that dynamically adjusts execution speed based on motion complexity, and (4) action scheduling to handle real-world system latencies. Experiments on 12 tasks across simulation and two real, distinct robot platforms show that SAIL achieves up to a 4x speedup over demonstration speed in simulation and up to 3.2x speedup in the real world.

Abstract: Autonomous drones are rapidly reshaping industries ranging from aerial delivery and infrastructure inspection to environmental monitoring and disaster response. Ensuring the safety, reliability, and efficiency of these systems is paramount as they transition from research prototypes to mission-critical platforms. This paper presents a step-by-step guide to establishing a robust autonomous drone testing pipeline, covering each critical stage: Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) Simulation Testing, Hardware-in-the-Loop (HIL) Testing, Controlled Real-World Testing, and In-Field Testing. Using practical examples, including the marker-based autonomous landing system, we demonstrate how to systematically verify drone system behaviors, identify integration issues, and optimize performance. Furthermore, we highlight emerging trends shaping the future of drone testing, including the integration of Neurosymbolic and LLMs, creating co-simulation environments, and Digital Twin-enabled simulation-based testing techniques. By following this pipeline, developers and researchers can achieve comprehensive validation, minimize deployment risks, and prepare autonomous drones for safe and reliable real-world operations.</description>

      <title>FocalAD: Local Motion Planning for End-to-End Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11419v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In end-to-end autonomous driving,the motion prediction plays a pivotal role in ego-vehicle planning. However, existing methods often rely on globally aggregated motion features, ignoring the fact that planning decisions are primarily influenced by a small number of locally interacting agents. Failing to attend to these critical local interactions can obscure potential risks and undermine planning reliability. In this work, we propose FocalAD, a novel end-to-end autonomous driving framework that focuses on critical local neighbors and refines planning by enhancing local motion representations. Specifically, FocalAD comprises two core modules: the Ego-Local-Agents Interactor (ELAI) and the Focal-Local-Agents Loss (FLA Loss). ELAI conducts a graph-based ego-centric interaction representation that captures motion dynamics with local neighbors to enhance both ego planning and agent motion queries. FLA Loss increases the weights of decision-critical neighboring agents, guiding the model to prioritize those more relevant to planning. Extensive experiments show that FocalAD outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods on the open-loop nuScenes datasets and closed-loop Bench2Drive benchmark. Notably, on the robustness-focused Adv-nuScenes dataset, FocalAD achieves even greater improvements, reducing the average colilision rate by 41.9% compared to DiffusionDrive and by 15.6% compared to SparseDrive.</description>

      <title>Linearly Solving Robust Rotation Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11547v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Rotation estimation plays a fundamental role in computer vision and robot tasks, and extremely robust rotation estimation is significantly useful for safety-critical applications. Typically, estimating a rotation is considered a non-linear and non-convex optimization problem that requires careful design. However, in this paper, we provide some new perspectives that solving a rotation estimation problem can be reformulated as solving a linear model fitting problem without dropping any constraints and without introducing any singularities. In addition, we explore the dual structure of a rotation motion, revealing that it can be represented as a great circle on a quaternion sphere surface. Accordingly, we propose an easily understandable voting-based method to solve rotation estimation. The proposed method exhibits exceptional robustness to noise and outliers and can be computed in parallel with graphics processing units (GPUs) effortlessly. Particularly, leveraging the power of GPUs, the proposed method can obtain a satisfactory rotation solution for large-scale($10^6$) and severely corrupted (99$\%$ outlier ratio) rotation estimation problems under 0.5 seconds. Furthermore, to validate our theoretical framework and demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method, we conduct controlled experiments and real-world dataset experiments. These experiments provide compelling evidence supporting the effectiveness and robustness of our approach in solving rotation estimation problems.</description>

      <title>Scheduling Agile Earth Observation Satellites with Onboard Processing and Real-Time Monitoring</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.11556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emergence of Agile Earth Observation Satellites (AEOSs) has marked a significant turning point in the field of Earth Observation (EO), offering enhanced flexibility in data acquisition. Concurrently, advancements in onboard satellite computing and communication technologies have greatly enhanced data compression efficiency, reducing network latency and congestion while supporting near real-time information delivery. In this paper, we address the Agile Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem (AEOSSP), which involves determining the optimal sequence of target observations to maximize overall observation profit. Our approach integrates onboard data processing for real-time remote monitoring into the multi-satellite optimization problem. To this end, we define a set of priority indicators and develop a constructive heuristic method, further enhanced with a Local Search (LS) strategy. The results show that the proposed algorithm provides high-quality information by increasing the resolution of the collected frames by up to 10% on average, while reducing the variance in the monitoring frequency of the targets within the instance by up to 83%, ensuring more up-to-date information across the entire set compared to a First-In First-Out (FIFO) method.</description>

      <title>Learning Multimodal Latent Dynamics for Human-Robot Interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.16380</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.16380v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article presents a method for learning well-coordinated Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) from Human-Human Interactions (HHI). We devise a hybrid approach using Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) as the latent space priors for a Variational Autoencoder to model a joint distribution over the interacting agents. We leverage the interaction dynamics learned from HHI to learn HRI and incorporate the conditional generation of robot motions from human observations into the training, thereby predicting more accurate robot trajectories. The generated robot motions are further adapted with Inverse Kinematics to ensure the desired physical proximity with a human, combining the ease of joint space learning and accurate task space reachability. For contact-rich interactions, we modulate the robot's stiffness using HMM segmentation for a compliant interaction. We verify the effectiveness of our approach deployed on a Humanoid robot via a user study. Our method generalizes well to various humans despite being trained on data from just two humans. We find that users perceive our method as more human-like, timely, and accurate and rank our method with a higher degree of preference over other baselines. We additionally show the ability of our approach to generate successful interactions in a more complex scenario of Bimanual Robot-to-Human Handovers.</description>

      <title>Autonomous Robotic Radio Source Localization via a Novel Gaussian Mixture Filtering Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10349v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study proposes a new Gaussian Mixture Filter (GMF) to improve the estimation performance for the autonomous robotic radio signal source search and localization problem in unknown environments. The proposed filter is first tested with a benchmark numerical problem to validate the performance with other state-of-the-practice approaches such as Particle Filter (PF) and Particle Gaussian Mixture (PGM) filters. Then the proposed approach is tested and compared against PF and PGM filters in real-world robotic field experiments to validate its impact for real-world applications. The considered real-world scenarios have partial observability with the range-only measurement and uncertainty with the measurement model. The results show that the proposed filter can handle this partial observability effectively whilst showing improved performance compared to PF, reducing the computation requirements while demonstrating improved robustness over compared techniques.</description>

      <title>Extended Hybrid Zero Dynamics for Bipedal Walking of the Knee-less Robot SLIDER</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01165v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Knee-less bipedal robots like SLIDER have the advantage of ultra-lightweight legs and improved walking energy efficiency compared to traditional humanoid robots. In this paper, we firstly introduce an improved hardware design of the SLIDER bipedal robot with new line-feet and more optimized mass distribution that enables higher locomotion speeds. Secondly, we propose an extended Hybrid Zero Dynamics (eHZD) method, which can be applied to prismatic joint robots like SLIDER. The eHZD method is then used to generate a library of gaits with varying reference velocities in an offline way. Thirdly, a Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed to use the pre-generated library to create walking control policies in real-time. This approach allows us to combine the advantages of both HZD (for generating stable gaits with a full-dynamics model) and DRL (for real-time adaptive gait generation). The experimental results show that this approach achieves 150% higher walking velocity than the previous MPC-based approach.</description>

      <title>ReinFlow: Fine-tuning Flow Matching Policy with Online Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.22094v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose ReinFlow, a simple yet effective online reinforcement learning (RL) framework that fine-tunes a family of flow matching policies for continuous robotic control. Derived from rigorous RL theory, ReinFlow injects learnable noise into a flow policy's deterministic path, converting the flow into a discrete-time Markov Process for exact and straightforward likelihood computation. This conversion facilitates exploration and ensures training stability, enabling ReinFlow to fine-tune diverse flow model variants, including Rectified Flow [35] and Shortcut Models [19], particularly at very few or even one denoising step. We benchmark ReinFlow in representative locomotion and manipulation tasks, including long-horizon planning with visual input and sparse reward. The episode reward of Rectified Flow policies obtained an average net growth of 135.36% after fine-tuning in challenging legged locomotion tasks while saving denoising steps and 82.63% of wall time compared to state-of-the-art diffusion RL fine-tuning method DPPO [43]. The success rate of the Shortcut Model policies in state and visual manipulation tasks achieved an average net increase of 40.34% after fine-tuning with ReinFlow at four or even one denoising step, whose performance is comparable to fine-tuned DDIM policies while saving computation time for an average of 23.20%.

      <title>A Soft Robotic Module with Pneumatic Actuation and Enhanced Controllability Using a Shape Memory Alloy Wire</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05741</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.05741v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, a compressed air-actuated soft robotic module was developed by incorporating a shape memory alloy (SMA) wire into its structure to achieve the desired bending angle with greater precision. First, a fiber-reinforced bending module with a strain-limiting layer made of polypropylene was fabricated. The SMA wire was then placed in a silicon matrix, which was used as a new strain-limiting layer. A simple closed-loop control algorithm was used to regulate the bending angle of the soft robot within its workspace. A camera was utilized to measure the angular changes in the vertical plane. Different angles, ranging from 0 to 65 degrees, were covered to evaluate the performance of the module and the bending angle control algorithm. The experimental tests demonstrate that using the SMA wire results in more precise control of bending in the vertical plane. In addition, it is possible to bend more with less working pressure. The error range was reduced from an average of 5 degrees to 2 degrees, and the rise time was reduced from an average of 19 seconds to 3 seconds.</description>

      <title>DURA-CPS: A Multi-Role Orchestrator for Dependability Assurance in LLM-Enabled Cyber-Physical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06381</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.06381v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) increasingly depend on advanced AI techniques to operate in critical applications. However, traditional verification and validation methods often struggle to handle the unpredictable and dynamic nature of AI components. In this paper, we introduce DURA-CPS, a novel framework that employs multi-role orchestration to automate the iterative assurance process for AI-powered CPS. By assigning specialized roles (e.g., safety monitoring, security assessment, fault injection, and recovery planning) to dedicated agents within a simulated environment, DURA-CPS continuously evaluates and refines AI behavior against a range of dependability requirements. We demonstrate the framework through a case study involving an autonomous vehicle navigating an intersection with an AI-based planner. Our results show that DURA-CPS effectively detects vulnerabilities, manages performance impacts, and supports adaptive recovery strategies, thereby offering a structured and extensible solution for rigorous V&amp;V in safety- and security-critical systems.</description>

      <title>RationalVLA: A Rational Vision-Language-Action Model with Dual System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.10826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A fundamental requirement for real-world robotic deployment is the ability to understand and respond to natural language instructions. Existing language-conditioned manipulation tasks typically assume that instructions are perfectly aligned with the environment. This assumption limits robustness and generalization in realistic scenarios where instructions may be ambiguous, irrelevant, or infeasible. To address this problem, we introduce RAtional MAnipulation (RAMA), a new benchmark that challenges models with both unseen executable instructions and defective ones that should be rejected. In RAMA, we construct a dataset with over 14,000 samples, including diverse defective instructions spanning six dimensions: visual, physical, semantic, motion, safety, and out-of-context. We further propose the Rational Vision-Language-Action model (RationalVLA). It is a dual system for robotic arms that integrates the high-level vision-language model with the low-level manipulation policy by introducing learnable latent space embeddings. This design enables RationalVLA to reason over instructions, reject infeasible commands, and execute manipulation effectively. Experiments demonstrate that RationalVLA outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on RAMA by a 14.5% higher success rate and 0.94 average task length, while maintaining competitive performance on standard manipulation tasks. Real-world trials further validate its effectiveness and robustness in practical applications. Our project page is https://irpn-eai.github.io/RationalVLA.</description>

      <title>DiffTORI: Differentiable Trajectory Optimization for Deep Reinforcement and Imitation Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05421</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05421v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces DiffTORI, which utilizes Differentiable Trajectory Optimization as the policy representation to generate actions for deep Reinforcement and Imitation learning. Trajectory optimization is a powerful and widely used algorithm in control, parameterized by a cost and a dynamics function. The key to our approach is to leverage the recent progress in differentiable trajectory optimization, which enables computing the gradients of the loss with respect to the parameters of trajectory optimization. As a result, the cost and dynamics functions of trajectory optimization can be learned end-to-end. DiffTORI addresses the ``objective mismatch'' issue of prior model-based RL algorithms, as the dynamics model in DiffTORI is learned to directly maximize task performance by differentiating the policy gradient loss through the trajectory optimization process. We further benchmark DiffTORI for imitation learning on standard robotic manipulation task suites with high-dimensional sensory observations and compare our method to feed-forward policy classes as well as Energy-Based Models (EBM) and Diffusion. Across 15 model-based RL tasks and 35 imitation learning tasks with high-dimensional image and point cloud inputs, DiffTORI outperforms prior state-of-the-art methods in both domains.

      <title>Control Industrial Automation System with Large Language Model Agents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18009v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Traditional industrial automation systems require specialized expertise to operate and complex reprogramming to adapt to new processes. Large language models offer the intelligence to make them more flexible and easier to use. However, LLMs' application in industrial settings is underexplored. This paper introduces a framework for integrating LLMs to achieve end-to-end control of industrial automation systems. At the core of the framework are an agent system designed for industrial tasks, a structured prompting method, and an event-driven information modeling mechanism that provides real-time data for LLM inference. The framework supplies LLMs with real-time events on different context semantic levels, allowing them to interpret the information, generate production plans, and control operations on the automation system. It also supports structured dataset creation for fine-tuning on this downstream application of LLMs. Our contribution includes a formal system design, proof-of-concept implementation, and a method for generating task-specific datasets for LLM fine-tuning and testing. This approach enables a more adaptive automation system that can respond to spontaneous events, while allowing easier operation and configuration through natural language for more intuitive human-machine interaction. We provide demo videos and detailed data on GitHub: https://github.com/YuchenXia/LLM4IAS.</description>

      <title>V-Max: A Reinforcement Learning Framework for Autonomous Driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.08388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Learning-based decision-making has the potential to enable generalizable Autonomous Driving (AD) policies, reducing the engineering overhead of rule-based approaches. Imitation Learning (IL) remains the dominant paradigm, benefiting from large-scale human demonstration datasets, but it suffers from inherent limitations such as distribution shift and imitation gaps. Reinforcement Learning (RL) presents a promising alternative, yet its adoption in AD remains limited due to the lack of standardized and efficient research frameworks. To this end, we introduce V-Max, an open research framework providing all the necessary tools to make RL practical for AD. V-Max is built on Waymax, a hardware-accelerated AD simulator designed for large-scale experimentation. We extend it using ScenarioNet's approach, enabling the fast simulation of diverse AD datasets.</description>

      <title>Interior Point Differential Dynamic Programming, Redux</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08278v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present IPDDP2, a structure-exploiting algorithm for solving discrete-time, finite-horizon optimal control problems (OCPs) with nonlinear constraints. Inequality constraints are handled using a primal-dual interior point formulation and step acceptance for equality constraints follows a line-search filter approach. The iterates of the algorithm are derived under the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) framework. A proof of local quadratic convergence of the IPDDP2 iterates is provided. Our numerical experiments evaluate IPDDP2 on over 500 OCPs derived from five different classes of robotic motion planning problems, three of which are contact-implicit trajectory optimisation problems. IPDDP2 demonstrates improvements in robustness against existing constrained DDP algorithms for contact-implicit planning, while being significantly faster than general-purpose solver IPOPT. We provide a full implementation of IPDDP2 in the Julia programming language.</description>

Abstract: Posidonia oceanica meadows are a species of seagrass highly dependent on rocks for their survival and conservation. In recent years, there has been a concerning global decline in this species, emphasizing the critical need for efficient monitoring and assessment tools. While deep learning-based semantic segmentation and visual automated monitoring systems have shown promise in a variety of applications, their performance in underwater environments remains challenging due to complex water conditions and limited datasets. This paper introduces a framework that combines machine learning and computer vision techniques to enable an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to inspect the boundaries of Posidonia oceanica meadows autonomously. The framework incorporates an image segmentation module using an existing Mask R-CNN model and a strategy for Posidonia oceanica meadow boundary tracking. Furthermore, a new class dedicated to rocks is introduced to enhance the existing model, aiming to contribute to a comprehensive monitoring approach and provide a deeper understanding of the intricate interactions between the meadow and its surrounding environment. The image segmentation model is validated using real underwater images, while the overall inspection framework is evaluated in a realistic simulation environment, replicating actual monitoring scenarios with real underwater images. The results demonstrate that the proposed framework enables the AUV to autonomously accomplish the main tasks of underwater inspection and segmentation of rocks. Consequently, this work holds significant potential for the conservation and protection of marine environments, providing valuable insights into the status of Posidonia oceanica meadows and supporting targeted preservation efforts</description>

      <title>PhysNav-DG: A Novel Adaptive Framework for Robust VLM-Sensor Fusion in Navigation Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.01881v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Robust navigation in diverse environments and domains requires both accurate state estimation and transparent decision making. We present PhysNav-DG, a novel framework that integrates classical sensor fusion with the semantic power of vision-language models. Our dual-branch architecture predicts navigation actions from multi-sensor inputs while simultaneously generating detailed chain-of-thought explanations. A modified Adaptive Kalman Filter dynamically adjusts its noise parameters based on environmental context. It leverages several streams of raw sensor data along with semantic insights from models such as LLaMA 3.2 11B and BLIP-2. To evaluate our approach, we introduce the MD-NEX Benchmark, a novel multi-domain dataset that unifies indoor navigation, autonomous driving, and social navigation tasks with ground-truth actions and human-validated explanations. Extensive experiments and ablations show that PhysNav-DG improves navigation success rates by over 20% and achieves high efficiency, with explanations that are both highly grounded and clear. This work connects high-level semantic reasoning and geometric planning for safer and more trustworthy autonomous systems.</description>

      <title>Graph-Based Floor Separation Using Node Embeddings and Clustering of WiFi Trajectories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08088</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08088v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Indoor positioning systems (IPSs) are increasingly vital for location-based services in complex multi-storey environments. This study proposes a novel graph-based approach for floor separation using Wi-Fi fingerprint trajectories, addressing the challenge of vertical localization in indoor settings. We construct a graph where nodes represent Wi-Fi fingerprints, and edges are weighted by signal similarity and contextual transitions. Node2Vec is employed to generate low-dimensional embeddings, which are subsequently clustered using K-means to identify distinct floors. Evaluated on the Huawei University Challenge 2021 dataset, our method outperforms traditional community detection algorithms, achieving an accuracy of 68.97\%, an F1-score of 61.99\%, and an Adjusted Rand Index of 57.19\%. By publicly releasing the preprocessed dataset and implementation code, this work contributes to advancing research in indoor positioning. The proposed approach demonstrates robustness to signal noise and architectural complexities, offering a scalable solution for floor-level localization.</description>
