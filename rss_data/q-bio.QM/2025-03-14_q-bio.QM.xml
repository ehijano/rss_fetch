      <title>BioSerenity-E1: a self-supervised EEG model for medical applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10362</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10362v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) serves as an essential diagnostic tool in neurology; however, its accurate manual interpretation is a time-intensive process that demands highly specialized expertise, which remains relatively scarce and not consistently accessible. To address these limitations, the implementation of automated pre-screening and analysis systems for EEG data holds considerable promise. Advances in self-supervised learning made it possible to pre-train complex deep learning architectures on large volumes of unlabeled EEG data to learn generalizable representations, that can later be used to enhance performance on multiple tasks while needing less downstream data. In the present paper, we introduce BioSerenity-E1, the first of a family of self-supervised foundation models for clinical EEG applications that combines spectral tokenization with masked prediction to achieve state-of-the-art performance across relevant diagnostic tasks. The two-phase self-supervised pretraining framework initially acquires compressed EEG representations via a transformer-based VQ-VAE architecture designed to reconstruct log-multitaper spectral projections, then implements extensive (70% block) masked token prediction to force the model to learn complex spatiotemporal dependencies in EEG signals. BioSerenity-E1 achieves strong performance across three clinical tasks, either in line or above state-of-the-art methods: seizure detection (AUROC = 0.926, Sensitivity = 0.909), normal/abnormal classification (AUPRC = 0.970 on proprietary data; 0.910 on TUH-Abnormal), and multiclass pathology differentiation on unbalanced data (Weighted F1 = 0.730). The utility of BioSerenity-E1 is further confirmed in low-data regimes scenarios, showing clear improvements in AUPRC (from +2% to 17%) when trained on less than 10% of the available data.</description>

      <title>Extreme Learning Machines for Attention-based Multiple Instance Learning in Whole-Slide Image Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10510v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Whole-slide image classification represents a key challenge in computational pathology and medicine. Attention-based multiple instance learning (MIL) has emerged as an effective approach for this problem. However, the effect of attention mechanism architecture on model performance is not well-documented for biomedical imagery. In this work, we compare different methods and implementations of MIL, including deep learning variants. We introduce a new method using higher-dimensional feature spaces for deep MIL. We also develop a novel algorithm for whole-slide image classification where extreme machine learning is combined with attention-based MIL to improve sensitivity and reduce training complexity. We apply our algorithms to the problem of detecting circulating rare cells (CRCs), such as erythroblasts, in peripheral blood. Our results indicate that nonlinearities play a key role in the classification, as removing them leads to a sharp decrease in stability in addition to a decrease in average area under the curve (AUC) of over 4%. We also demonstrate a considerable increase in robustness of the model with improvements of over 10% in average AUC when higher-dimensional feature spaces are leveraged. In addition, we show that extreme learning machines can offer clear improvements in terms of training efficiency by reducing the number of trained parameters by a factor of 5 whilst still maintaining the average AUC to within 1.5% of the deep MIL model. Finally, we discuss options of enriching the classical computing framework with quantum algorithms in the future. This work can thus help pave the way towards more accurate and efficient single-cell diagnostics, one of the building blocks of precision medicine.</description>

      <title>Climate land use and other drivers impacts on island ecosystem services: a global review</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10278v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Islands are diversity hotspots and vulnerable to environmental degradation, climate variations, land use changes and societal crises. These factors can exhibit interactive impacts on ecosystem services. The study reviewed a large number of papers on the climate change-islands-ecosystem services topic worldwide. Potential inclusion of land use changes and other drivers of impacts on ecosystem services were sequentially also recorded. The study sought to investigate the impacts of climate change, land use change, and other non-climatic driver changes on island ecosystem services. Explanatory variables examined were divided into two categories: environmental variables and methodological ones. Environmental variables include sea zone geographic location, ecosystem, ecosystem services, climate, land use, other driver variables, Methodological variables include consideration of policy interventions, uncertainty assessment, cumulative effects of climate change, synergistic effects of climate change with land use change and other anthropogenic and environmental drivers, and the diversity of variables used in the analysis. Machine learning and statistical methods were used to analyze their effects on island ecosystem services. Negative climate change impacts on ecosystem services are better quantified by land use change or other non-climatic driver variables than by climate variables. The synergy of land use together with climate changes is modulating the impact outcome and critical for a better impact assessment. Analyzed together, there is little evidence of more pronounced for a specific sea zone, ecosystem, or ecosystem service. Climate change impacts may be underestimated due to the use of a single climate variable deployed in most studies. Policy interventions exhibit low classification accuracy in quantifying impacts indicating insufficient efficacy or integration in the studies.</description>

      <title>Riemannian L-systems: Modeling growing forms in curved spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.03270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the past 50 years, the formalism of L-systems has been successfully used and developed to model the growth of filamentous and branching biological forms. These simulations take place in classical 2-D or 3-D Euclidean spaces. However, various biological forms actually grow in curved, non-Euclidean, spaces. This is for example the case of vein networks growing within curved leaf blades, of unicellular filaments, such as pollen tubes, growing on curved surfaces to fertilize distant ovules, of teeth patterns growing on folded epithelia of animals, of diffusion of chemical or mechanical signals at the surface of plant or animal tissues, etc. To model these forms growing in curved spaces, we thus extended the formalism of L-systems to non-Euclidean spaces. In a first step we show that this extension can be carried out by integrating concepts of differential geometry in the notion of turtle geometry. We then illustrate how this extension can be applied to model and program the development of both mathematical and biological forms on curved surfaces embedded in our Euclidean space. We provide various examples applied to plant development. We finally show that this approach can be extended to more abstract spaces, called abstract Riemannian spaces, that are not embedded into any higher space, while being intrinsically curved. We suggest that this abstract extension can be used to provide a new approach for effective modeling of tropism phenomena and illustrate this idea on a few conceptual examples.</description>

      <title>Coupling in situ and remote sensing data to assess $\alpha$- and $\beta$-diversity over biogeographic gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18485</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.18485v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The mapping of plant biodiversity represents a fundamental stage in establishing conservation priorities, particularly in identifying groups of species that share ecological requirements or evolutionary histories. This is often achieved by assessing different spatial diversity patterns in plant population distributions. In this paper, we present two primary data sources crucial for biodiversity monitoring: in situ measurements from botanical observations and remote sensing (RS). In situ methods involve directly collecting data from specific sites, providing detailed insights into ecological patterns but often constrained by resource limitations. Integrating in situ and RS data highlights their complementary strengths, which depend on factors such as study scale, resolution, and logistical feasibility. While in situ approaches are characterized by precision, RS offers efficiency and extensive, repeated coverage. This research integrates in situ and RS data to analyze plant and spectral diversity across France at a spatial resolution of 5 km, encompassing over 23,000 grid cells. We employ four established diversity metrics leveraging the spatial distribution of 6,650 plant species and 250 spectral clusters (derived from MODIS data at a 500-meter resolution). Through bioregionalization network analysis combining these data sources, we identified five distinct bioregions that capture the biogeographical structure of plant biodiversity in France. Additionally, we explore the relationship between plant species diversity and spectral cluster diversity within and between these bioregions, offering novel insights into the spatial dynamics of plant biodiversity.</description>

      <title>Causal Representation Learning from Multimodal Biomedical Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06518</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06518v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Prevalent in biomedical applications (e.g., human phenotype research), multimodal datasets can provide valuable insights into the underlying physiological mechanisms. However, current machine learning (ML) models designed to analyze these datasets often lack interpretability and identifiability guarantees, which are essential for biomedical research. Recent advances in causal representation learning have shown promise in identifying interpretable latent causal variables with formal theoretical guarantees. Unfortunately, most current work on multimodal distributions either relies on restrictive parametric assumptions or yields only coarse identification results, limiting their applicability to biomedical research that favors a detailed understanding of the mechanisms.
  In this work, we aim to develop flexible identification conditions for multimodal data and principled methods to facilitate the understanding of biomedical datasets. Theoretically, we consider a nonparametric latent distribution (c.f., parametric assumptions in previous work) that allows for causal relationships across potentially different modalities. We establish identifiability guarantees for each latent component, extending the subspace identification results from previous work. Our key theoretical contribution is the structural sparsity of causal connections between modalities, which, as we will discuss, is natural for a large collection of biomedical systems. Empirically, we present a practical framework to instantiate our theoretical insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through extensive experiments on both numerical and synthetic datasets. Results on a real-world human phenotype dataset are consistent with established biomedical research, validating our theoretical and methodological framework.</description>
