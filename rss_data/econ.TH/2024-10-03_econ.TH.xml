      <title>The Banks Set and the Bipartisan Set May Be Disjoint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.01881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.01881v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tournament solutions play an important role within social choice theory and the mathematical social sciences at large. We construct a tournament of order 36 for which the Banks set and the bipartisan set are disjoint. This implies that refinements of the Banks set, such as the minimal extending set and the tournament equilibrium set, can also be disjoint from the bipartisan set.</description>

      <title>Optimal Budget Aggregation with Star-Shaped Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15904v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the problem of aggregating distributions, such as budget proposals, into a collective distribution. An ideal aggregation mechanism would be Pareto efficient, strategyproof, and fair. Most previous work assumes that agents evaluate budgets according to the $\ell_1$ distance to their ideal budget. We investigate and compare different models from the larger class of star-shaped utility functions - a multi-dimensional generalization of single-peaked preferences. For the case of two alternatives, we extend existing results by proving that under very general assumptions, the uniform phantom mechanism is the only strategyproof mechanism that satisfies proportionality - a minimal notion of fairness introduced by Freeman et al. (2021). Moving to the case of more than two alternatives, we establish sweeping impossibilities for $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$ disutilities: no mechanism satisfies efficiency, strategyproofness, and proportionality. We then propose a new kind of star-shaped utilities based on evaluating budgets by the ratios of shares between a given budget and an ideal budget. For these utilities, efficiency, strategyproofness, and fairness become compatible. In particular, we prove that the mechanism that maximizes the Nash product of individual utilities is characterized by group-strategyproofness and a core-based fairness condition.</description>

      <title>Disappointment concordance and duet expectiles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.17751</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.17751v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce an axiom of disappointment-concordance (disco) aversion for a preference relation over acts in an Anscombe-Aumann setting. This axiom means that the decision maker, facing the sum of two acts, dislikes the situation where both acts realize simultaneously as disappointments. Our main result is that, under strict monotonicity and continuity, the axiom of disco aversion characterizes preference relations represented by a new class of functionals belonging to the Gilboa-Schmeidler family, which we call the duet expectiled utilities. When the outcome space is the real line, a duet expectiled utility becomes a duet expectile, which involves two endogenous probability measures. It further becomes a usual expectile, ,a statistical quantity popular in regression and risk measures, when these two probability measures coincide. We discuss properties of duet expectiles and connections with fundamental concepts including probabilistic sophistication, risk aversion, and uncertainty aversion.</description>
