      <title>Quantification of Multi-Compartment Flow with Spectral Diffusion MRI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: Estimation of multi-compartment intravoxel flow in fD in ml/100g/min with multi-b-value diffusion weighted imaging and a multi-Gaussian model in the kidneys. Theory and Methods: A multi-Gaussian model of intravoxel flow using water transport time to quantify fD is presented and simulated. Multi-compartment anisotropic DWI signal is simulated analyzed with (1) a rigid bi-exponential, (2) a rigid tri-exponential, and (3) diffusion spectrum imaging model of intravoxel incoherent motion (spectral diffusion). The application is demonstrated in a two-center study of 54 kidney allografts with 9 b-value advanced DWI that were split by function (CKD-EPI 2021 eGFR&lt;45ml/min/1.73m2) and fibrosis (Banff 2017 interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy score 0-6). Results: Spectral diffusion demonstrated strong correlation to truth for simulated three-compartment anisotropic diffusion (y=1.08x+0.1, R2=0.71) and two-compartment anisotropic diffusion (y=0.91x+0.6, R2=0.74), outperforming rigid models in cases of variable compartment number. Use of a fixed regularization parameter set to {\lambda}=0.1 increased computation up to 208-fold and agreed with voxel-wise cross-validated regularization (concordance correlation coefficient=0.99). Spectral diffusion of renal allografts showed significant increase in tissue parenchyma compartment fD (f-stat=3.86, p=0.02). Tubular fD was significantly decreased in allografts with impaired function (Mann-Whitney Utest t-stat=-2.14, p=0.04). Conclusions: Quantitative multi-compartment intravoxel flow can be estimated in ml/100g/min with fD from multi-Gaussian diffusion, even with moderate anisotropy such as in kidneys. The use of spectral diffusion with a multi-Gaussian model and a fixed regularization parameter shows promise in organs such as the kidney with variable numbers of physiologic compartments.</description>

      <title>From Diagnostic CT to DTI Tractography labels: Using Deep Learning for Corticospinal Tract Injury Assessment and Outcome Prediction in Intracerebral Haemorrhage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.06403v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The preservation of the corticospinal tract (CST) is key to good motor recovery after stroke. The gold standard method of assessing the CST with imaging is diffusion tensor tractography. However, this is not available for most intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) patients. Non-contrast CT scans are routinely available in most ICH diagnostic pipelines, but delineating white matter from a CT scan is challenging. We utilise nnU-Net, trained on paired diagnostic CT scans and high-directional diffusion tractography maps, to segment the CST from diagnostic CT scans alone, and we show our model reproduces diffusion based tractography maps of the CST with a Dice similarity coefficient of 57%.
  Surgical haematoma evacuation is sometimes performed after ICH, but published clinical trials to date show that whilst surgery reduces mortality, there is no evidence of improved functional recovery. Restricting surgery to patients with an intact CST may reveal a subset of patients for whom haematoma evacuation improves functional outcome. We investigated the clinical utility of our model in the MISTIE III clinical trial dataset. We found that our model's CST integrity measure significantly predicted outcome after ICH in the acute and chronic time frames, therefore providing a prognostic marker for patients to whom advanced diffusion tensor imaging is unavailable. This will allow for future probing of subgroups who may benefit from surgery.</description>

      <title>Recommendations and guidelines from the ISMRM Diffusion Study Group for preclinical diffusion MRI: Part 1 -- In vivo small-animal imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.12994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2209.12994v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The value of in vivo preclinical diffusion MRI (dMRI) is substantial. Small-animal dMRI has been used for methodological development and validation, characterizing the biological basis of diffusion phenomena, and comparative anatomy. Many of the influential works in this field were first performed in small animals or ex vivo samples. The steps from animal setup and monitoring, to acquisition, analysis, and interpretation are complex, with many decisions that may ultimately affect what questions can be answered using the resultant data. This work aims to present selected recommendations and guidelines from the diffusion community, on best practices for preclinical dMRI of in vivo animals. We describe the general considerations and foundational knowledge that must be considered when designing experiments. We briefly describe differences in animal species and disease models and discuss why some may be more or less appropriate for different studies. We then give guidelines for in vivo acquisition protocols, including decisions on hardware, animal preparation, and imaging sequences, followed by advice for data processing including pre-processing, model-fitting, and tractography. Finally, we provide an online resource which lists publicly available preclinical dMRI datasets and software packages, to promote responsible and reproducible research. In each section, we attempt to provide guides and recommendations, but also highlight areas for which no guidelines exist (and why), and where future work should focus. An overarching goal herein is to enhance the rigor and reproducibility of small animal dMRI acquisitions and analyses, and thereby advance biomedical knowledge.</description>

      <title>Divergent Clinical Equivalence Findings from DVH and NTCP Metrics for Alternative OAR Delineations with Increasing Setup Variability in Head-and-Neck Radiotherapy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.05656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.05656v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Purpose: This study quantifies the variation in dose-volume histogram (DVH) and normal tissue complication probability (NTCP) metrics for head-and-neck (HN) cancer patients when alternative organ-at-risk (OAR) delineations are used for treatment planning and for treatment plan evaluation. We particularly focus on the effects of daily patient positioning/setup variations (SV) in relation to treatment technique and delineation variability. Materials and Methods: We generated two-arc VMAT, 5-beam IMRT, and 9-beam IMRT treatment plans for a cohort of 209 HN patients. These plans incorporated five different OAR delineation sets, including manual and four automated algorithms. Each treatment plan was assessed under various simulated per-fraction patient setup uncertainties, evaluating the potential clinical impacts through DVH and NTCP metrics. Results: The study demonstrates that increasing setup variability generally reduces differences in DVH metrics between alternative delineations. However, in contrast, differences in NTCP metrics tend to increase with higher setup variability. This pattern is observed consistently across different treatment plans and delineator combinations, illustrating the intricate relationship between SV and delineation accuracy. Additionally, the need for delineation accuracy in treatment planning is shown to be case-specific and dependent on factors beyond geometric variations. Conclusions: The findings highlight the necessity for comprehensive quality assurance programs in radiotherapy, incorporating both dosimetric impact analysis and geometric variation assessment to ensure optimal delineation quality. The study emphasizes the complex dynamics of treatment planning in radiotherapy, advocating for personalized, case-specific strategies in clinical practice to enhance patient care quality and efficacy in the face of varying SV and delineation accuracies.</description>

      <title>CT-based Anomaly Detection of Liver Tumors Using Generative Diffusion Prior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00092v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CT is a main modality for imaging liver diseases, valuable in detecting and localizing liver tumors. Traditional anomaly detection methods analyze reconstructed images to identify pathological structures. However, these methods may produce suboptimal results, overlooking subtle differences among various tissue types. To address this challenge, here we employ generative diffusion prior to inpaint the liver as the reference facilitating anomaly detection. Specifically, we use an adaptive threshold to extract a mask of abnormal regions, which are then inpainted using a diffusion prior to calculating an anomaly score based on the discrepancy between the original CT image and the inpainted counterpart. Our methodology has been tested on two liver CT datasets, demonstrating a significant improvement in detection accuracy, with a 7.9% boost in the area under the curve (AUC) compared to the state-of-the-art. This performance gain underscores the potential of our approach to refine the radiological assessment of liver diseases.</description>
