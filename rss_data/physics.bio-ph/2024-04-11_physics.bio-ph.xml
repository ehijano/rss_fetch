      <title>Application of the chemical master equation and its analytical solution to the illness-death model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07238v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of this article is relating the chemical master equation (CME) to the illness-death model for chronic diseases. We show that a recently developed differential equation for the prevalence directly follows from the CME. As an application, we use the theory of the CME in a simulation study about diabetes in Germany from a previous publication. We find a good agreement between the theory and the simulations.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear dynamics of confined cell migration -- modeling and inference</title>

Abstract: The motility of eukaryotic cells is strongly influenced by their environment, with confined cells often developing qualitatively different motility patterns from those migrating on simple two-dimensional substrates. Recent experiments, coupled with data-driven methods to extract a cell's equation of motion, showed that cancerous MDA-MB-231 cells persistently hop in a limit cycle when placed on two-state adhesive micropatterns (two large squares connected by a narrow bridge), while they remain stationary on average in rectangular confinements. In contrast, healthy MCF10A cells migrating on the two-state micropattern are bistable, i.e., they settle into either basin on average with only noise-induced hops between the two states. We can capture all these behaviors with a single computational phase field model of a crawling cell, under the assumption that contact with non-adhesive substrate inhibits the cell front. Our model predicts that larger and softer cells are more likely to persistently hop, while smaller and stiffer cells are more likely to be bistable. Other key factors controlling cell migration are the frequency of protrusions and their magnitude of noise. Our results show that relatively simple assumptions about how cells sense their geometry can explain a wide variety of different cell behaviors, and show the power of data-driven approaches to characterize both experiment and simulation.</description>

      <title>Dynamic learning of synchronization in nonlinear coupled systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.11691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Synchronization phenomena are pervasive in nonlinear systems across the natural world and engineering domains. Understanding how to dynamically identify the parameter space (or network structure) of nonlinear systems in a synchronized state is crucial for the study of system synchronization. To address the challenge of achieving stable synchronization in nonlinear coupled systems, we develop a set of mathematical optimization techniques for dynamic learning of synchronization (DLS) inspired by machine learning. This technology captures the state differences between nodes within the system and dynamically adjusts weights, allowing nonlinear coupled systems to maintain a stable state of synchronization after appropriate weight adjustments. We introduce several variants of the DLS technique, including adaptive, supervised, and hybrid methods, effectively promoting synchronization in heterogeneous networks such as small-world, scale-free, and random networks. The efficacy of this technique is validated through its application to simple FitzHugh-Nagumo neural networks and complex Hodgkin-Huxley neuronal networks, examining its impact on both global and local synchronization. The DLS technique proposed in this study offers a new solution to synchronization problems in dynamic network environments, addressing the deficiencies in adaptability and flexibility of existing technologies and providing a fresh perspective for understanding and implementing synchronization phenomena in nonlinear systems.</description>

      <title>Motile bacteria crossing liquid-liquid interfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.05095v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-life bacteria often swim in complex fluids, but our understanding of the interactions between bacteria and complex surroundings is still evolving. In this work, rod-like \textit{Bacillus subtilis} swims in a quasi-2D environment with aqueous liquid-liquid interfaces, \textit{i.e.}, the isotropic-nematic coexistence phase of an aqueous chromonic liquid crystal. Focusing on the bacteria motion near and at the liquid-liquid interfaces, we collect and quantify bacterial trajectories ranging across the isotropic to the nematic phase. Despite its small magnitude, the interfacial tension of the order of 10 $\mathrm{\mu N/m}$ at the isotropic-nematic interface justifies our observations that bacteria swimming more perpendicular to the interface have a higher probability of crossing the interface. Our force-balance model, considering the interfacial tension, further predicts how the length and speed of the bacteria affect their crossing behaviors. We also find, as soon as the bacteria cross the interface and enter the nematic phase, they wiggle less, but faster, and that this occurs as the flagellar bundles aggregate within the nematic phase.</description>
