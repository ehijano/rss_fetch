      <title>Readout electronics for low occupancy High-Pressure Gas TPCs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: HPgTPCs have benefits such as low energy threshold, magnetisability, and 4$\pi$ acceptance, making them ideal for neutrino experiments such as DUNE. We present the design of an FPGA-based solution optimised for ND-GAr, which is part of the Phase-II more capable near detector for DUNE. These electronics reduce the cost significantly compared to using collider readout electronics which are typically designed for much higher occupancy and therefore, for example, need much larger numbers of FPGAs and power per channel. We demonstrate the performance of our electronics with the TOAD at Fermilab in the US at a range of pressures and gas mixtures up to 4.5barA, reading out ~10000 channels from a multi-wire proportional chamber. The operation took place between April and July of 2024. We measure the noise characteristics of the system to be sufficiently low and we identify sources of noise that can be further mitigated in the next iteration. We also note that the cooling scheme used in the test requires improvement before full-scale deployment. Despite these necessary improvements, we show that the system can fulfil the needs of a HPgTPC for a fraction of the price of collider readout electronics.</description>

      <title>Helium recovery system at IB3A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The growing demand for sustainable cryogenic operations at Fermilab has underscored the need to improve helium management, particularly at the Industrial Building 3A (IB3A) test facility. IB3A characterizes and tests superconductors, cables, and coils for projects such as the HL-LHC AUP and Mu2e, yet currently relies on 500 L Dewars whose boil-off is vented to atmosphere, wasting a critical, non-renewable resource and increasing the cost of testing. A project is therefore under way to link IB3A to an existing purification and liquefaction station in a neighboring building through a dedicated pipeline. Captured helium will be transferred, purified, reliquefied, and returned for reuse, cutting losses and operating costs. This paper details the first two project phases: "Design and Engineering" and "Procurement and Installation." The design phase finalizes pipeline specifications, establishes flow-control requirements, and resolves integration challenges with existing cryogenic infrastructure. The procurement and installation phase covers material sourcing, pipeline construction, and deployment of control and monitoring systems to assure reliable, efficient operation. Key technical hurdles-route optimization, pressure drop mitigation, and interface compatibility-are discussed alongside implemented solutions. Implementing the pipeline and upgrading IB3A will dramatically reduce helium consumption and therefore testing cost, strengthening Fermilab's capacity to support frontier science far into the future.</description>

      <title>Metalens-coupled terahertz NbN hot electron bolometer mixer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.16868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enabled by planarized phase engineering, metalenses based on metasurfaces offer compact and scalable solutions for applications such as sensing, imaging, and virtual reality. They are particularly attractive for multi-pixel, large-scale heterodyne focal plane arrays in space observatories, where a flat metalens array on a silicon wafer can replace individual lenses, greatly simplifying system integration and beam alignment. In this work, we demonstrate, for the first time, a superconducting niobium nitride (NbN) hot electron bolometer (HEB) mixer coupled with a silicon-based metalens operating at terahertz frequencies. The metalens phase profile was derived from a finite-size Gaussian beam source using the Rayleigh-Sommerfeld diffraction integral, and its focusing behavior was validated through 2D simulation. Experimentally, the metalens-coupled NbN HEB receiver exhibited a noise temperature of 1800 K at 1.63 THz. The power coupling efficiency from free space to the mixer via the metalens was measured to be 25 %. Measured far-field beam profiles are Gaussian-like with sidelobes below -14 dB. These results demonstrate the feasibility of integrating metalenses with HEB mixers for THz detection, offering a scalable path for compact focal plane arrays in space-based THz instrumentation.</description>

      <title>Fast 4D-STEM-based phase mapping for amorphous and mixed materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17068</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17068v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: All materials are made from atoms arranged either in repeating (crystalline) or in random (amorphous) structures. Diffraction measurements probe average distances between atoms and/or planes of atoms. A transmission electron microscope in scanning mode (STEM) can collect spatially resolved 2-dimensional diffraction data, effectively creating a 4-dimensional (4D) hyperspectral dataset (4D-STEM). Interpretation strategies for such 4D data are well-developed for crystalline materials, because their diffraction spectra show intense peaks, allowing for effective phase and crystal orientation mapping at the nanoscale. Yet, because of the continuous nature of the diffraction data for amorphous and mixed materials, it is challenging to separate different amorphous contributions. Nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) allows separation of 4D-STEM data into components with interpretable diffraction signatures and intensity maps, independent of the structure. However, NMF is a non-convex optimization problem and scales ~ O(nmk) with n the number of positions probed, m the number of diffraction features and k the number of components, making analysis of large 4D datasets inaccessible. Here, we apply QB decomposition as a preprocessing step for NMF (Randomized NMF or RNMF) to achieve scaling independent of the largest data dimension (~O(nk)), opening the door for NMF analysis of 4D-STEM data. We demonstrate our approach by mapping a thin TiO$_2$ layer on top of SiO$_2$, and a LiNi$_{0.6}$Co$_{0.2}$Mn$_{0.2}$O$_{2}$ (NMC) - Li$_{10}$GeP$_2$S$_{12}$ (LGPS) mixed crystalline-amorphous battery interface, illustrating strengths and limitations of using RNMF for structure-independent phase mapping in 4D-STEM experiments.</description>

      <title>Sensor Drift Compensation in Electronic-Nose-Based Gas Recognition Using Knowledge Distillation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.17071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to environmental changes and sensor aging, sensor drift challenges the performance of electronic nose systems in gas classification during real-world deployment. Previous studies using the UCI Gas Sensor Array Drift Dataset reported promising drift compensation results but lacked robust statistical experimental validation and may overcompensate for sensor drift, losing class-related variance.To address these limitations and improve sensor drift compensation with statistical rigor, we first designed two domain adaptation tasks based on the same electronic nose dataset: using the first batch to predict the remaining batches, simulating a controlled laboratory setting; and predicting the next batch using all prior batches, simulating continuous training data updates for online training. We then systematically tested three methods: our proposed novel Knowledge Distillation (KD) method, the benchmark method Domain Regularized Component Analysis (DRCA), and a hybrid method KD-DRCA, across 30 random test set partitions on the UCI dataset. We showed that KD consistently outperformed both DRCA and KD-DRCA, achieving up to an 18% improvement in accuracy and 15% in F1-score, demonstrating KD's superior effectiveness in drift compensation. This is the first application of KD for electronic nose drift mitigation, significantly outperforming the previous state-of-the-art DRCA method and enhancing the reliability of sensor drift compensation in real-world environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17560v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work presents numerical results of a computer simulation performed with six centroiding algorithms targeting a star tracker in development at INPE, including readout noise and considering a Gaussian point spread function. Five of the tested algorithms are light-weight centroiding algorithms with low computational costs. These were compared to a shape fitting algorithm based on the lsqnonlin function available in Matlab and GNU Octave. The algorithms studied here are also applicable for astrometry and adaptive optics.</description>

      <title>Study of the Radiation Hardness of the ATLAS Tile Calorimeter Optical Instrumentation with Run 2 data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15944v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a study of the radiation hardness of the hadronic Tile Calorimeter of the ATLAS experiment in the LHC Run 2. Both the plastic scintillators constituting the detector active media and the wavelength-shifting optical fibres collecting the scintillation light into the photodetector readout are elements susceptible to radiation damage. The dedicated calibration and monitoring systems of the detector (caesium radioactive sources, laser and minimum bias integrator) allow to assess the response of these optical components. Data collected with these systems between 2015 and 2018 are analysed to measure the degradation of the optical instrumentation across Run 2. Moreover, a simulation of the total ionising dose in the calorimeter is employed to study and model the degradation profile as a function of the exposure conditions, both integrated dose and dose rate. The measurement of the relative light output loss in Run 2 is presented and extrapolations to future scenarios are drawn based on current data. The impact of radiation damage on the cell response uniformity is also analysed.</description>

      <title>First Event-by-Event Identification of Cherenkov Radiation from Sub-MeV Particles in Liquid Argon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08886v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This Letter reports the event-by-event observation of Cherenkov light from sub-MeV electrons in a high scintillation light-yield liquid argon (LAr) detector by the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) experiment. The CCM200 detector, located at Los Alamos National Laboratory, instruments 7 tons (fiducial volume) of LAr with 200 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs), 80% of which are coated in a wavelength shifting material and the remaining 20% are uncoated. In the prompt time region of an event, defined as $-6 \leq t \leq 0$ ns relative to the event start time $t=0$, the uncoated PMTs are primarily sensitive to visible Cherenkov photons. Using gamma-rays from a $^{22}$Na source for production of sub-MeV electrons, we isolated prompt Cherenkov light with $&gt;5\sigma$ confidence and developed a selection to obtain a low-background electromagnetic sample. This is the first event-by-event observation of Cherenkov photons from sub-MeV electrons in a high-yield scintillator detector, and represents a milestone in low-energy particle detector development.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Liquid Argon Scintillation Pulse Shape Using Differentiable Simulation in the Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills Experiment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.08887v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Coherent CAPTAIN-Mills (CCM) experiment is a liquid argon (LAr) light collection detector searching for MeV-scale neutrino and Beyond Standard Model physics signatures. Two hundred 8-inch photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) instrument the 7 ton fiducial volume with 50% photocathode coverage to detect light produced by charged particles. CCM's light-based approach reduces requirements of LAr purity, compared to other detection technologies, such that sub-MeV particles can be reliably detected without additional LAr filtration and with O(1) parts-per-million of common contaminants. We present a measurement of LAr light production and propagation parameters, with uncertainties, obtained from a sample of MeV-scale electromagnetic events. The optimization of this high-dimensional parameter space was facilitated by a differentiable optical photon Monte-Carlo simulation, and detailed PMT response characterization. This result accurately predicts the timing and spatial distribution of light due to scintillation and Cherenkov emission in the detector. This is the first description of photon propagation in LAr to include several effects, including: anomalous dispersion of the index of refraction near the ultraviolet resonance, Mie scattering from impurities, and Cherenkov light production.</description>
