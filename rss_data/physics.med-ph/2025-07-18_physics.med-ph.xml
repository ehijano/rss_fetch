      <title>Multi-objective CFD optimization of an intermediate diffuser stage for PediaFlow pediatric ventricular assist device</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12491v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Background: Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) has become an essential design tool for ventricular assist devices (VADs), where the goal of maximizing performance often conflicts with biocompatibility. This tradeoff becomes even more pronounced in pediatric applications due to the stringent size constraints imposed by the smaller patient population. This study presents an automated CFD-driven shape optimization of a new intermediate diffuser stage for the PediaFlow pediatric VAD, positioned immediately downstream of the impeller to improve pressure recovery.
  Methods: We adopted a multi-objective optimization approach to maximize pressure recovery while minimizing hemolysis. The proposed diffuser stage was isolated from the rest of the flow domain, enabling efficient evaluation of over 450 design variants using Sobol sequence, which yielded a Pareto front of non-dominated solutions. The selected best candidate was further refined using local T-search algorithm. We then incorporated the optimized front diffuser into the full pump for CFD verification and in vitro validation.
  Results: We identified critical dependencies where longer blades increased pressure recovery but also hemolysis, while the wrap angle showed a strong parabolic relationship with pressure recovery but a monotonic relationship with hemolysis. Counterintuitively, configurations with fewer blades (2-3) consistently outperformed those with more blades (4-5) in both metrics. The optimized two-blade design enabled operation at lower pump speeds (14,000 vs 16,000 RPM), improving hydraulic efficiency from 26.3% to 32.5% and reducing hemolysis by 31%.
  Conclusion: This approach demonstrates that multi-objective CFD optimization can systematically explore complex design spaces while balancing competing priorities of performance and hemocompatibility for pediatric VADs.</description>

      <title>Real-time, inline quantitative MRI enabled by scanner-integrated machine learning: a proof of principle with NODDI</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.12632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Purpose: The clinical feasibility and translation of many advanced quantitative MRI (qMRI) techniques are inhibited by their restriction to 'research mode', due to resource-intensive, offline parameter estimation. This work aimed to achieve 'clinical mode' qMRI, by real-time, inline parameter estimation with a trained neural network (NN) fully integrated into a vendor's image reconstruction environment, therefore facilitating and encouraging clinical adoption of advanced qMRI techniques. Methods: The Siemens Image Calculation Environment (ICE) pipeline was customised to deploy trained NNs for advanced diffusion MRI parameter estimation with Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) Runtime. Two fully-connected NNs were trained offline with data synthesised with the neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) model, using either conventionally estimated (NNMLE) or ground truth (NNGT) parameters as training labels. The strategy was demonstrated online with an in vivo acquisition and evaluated offline with synthetic test data. Results: NNs were successfully integrated and deployed natively in ICE, performing inline, whole-brain, in vivo NODDI parameter estimation in &lt;10 seconds. DICOM parametric maps were exported from the scanner for further analysis, generally finding that NNMLE estimates were more consistent than NNGT with conventional estimates. Offline evaluation confirms that NNMLE has comparable accuracy and slightly better noise robustness than conventional fitting, whereas NNGT exhibits compromised accuracy at the benefit of higher noise robustness. Conclusion: Real-time, inline parameter estimation with the proposed generalisable framework resolves a key practical barrier to clinical uptake of advanced qMRI methods and enables their efficient integration into clinical workflows.</description>

      <title>Analytic Model of Radial Sensitivity in Cylindrical PET Systems Based on First Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.13118v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In cylindrical positron emission tomography (PET) systems, the center of the field of view (FOV) is typically assumed to have the highest system sensitivity. This assumption underlies standardized protocols such as NEMA NU 2-2018, which specify measurements at the CFOV, and influences how systems are characterized and compared. However, experimental studies report varying radial sensitivity trends, some showing comparable or higher sensitivity off center, while others reveal more complex, non-monotonic patterns. Despite these observations, a first-principles theoretical model describing radial plane sensitivity has not been clearly established. In this work, we derive an analytic model for the radial sensitivity distribution in a cylindrical PET system, based solely on ideal scanner geometry and basic detection physics. To our knowledge, this is the first closed-form theoretical formulation of its kind, offering a foundational description of radial sensitivity variation under idealized conditions. The model excludes system-specific factors such as detector efficiency or crystal shape, and thus provides a generalizable baseline for conceptual understanding and practical reference. To evaluate the model's relevance in real-world systems, we perform both Monte Carlo simulations and physical experiments using a representative PET system. The measured and simulated sensitivity profiles align well with theoretical predictions, with deviations attributable to system-specific factors. Beyond serving as a reference for interpreting empirical inconsistencies, this work contributes fundamental insight that may support system design, quantitative modeling, and educational materials on PET instrumentation.</description>
