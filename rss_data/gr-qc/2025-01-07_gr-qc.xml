      <title>Resumming Fermion Loops for Inflationary Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01972</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.01972v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the 1-loop contribution to the graviton self-energy from a loop of massless fermions on a general cosmological background. The result is used to quantum-correct the linearized Einstein equation on de Sitter background and work out 1-loop corrections to gravitational radiation and to the response to a point mass. The renormalization group is employed to sum these to all orders for as long as the de Sitter phase persists.</description>

      <title>Search for continuous gravitational wave signals from luminous dark photon superradiance clouds with LVK O3 observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02052v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superradiance clouds of kinetically-mixed dark photons around spinning black holes can produce observable multi-messenger electromagnetic and gravitational wave signals. The cloud generates electric fields of up to a Teravolt-per-meter, which lead to a cascade production of charged particles, yielding a turbulent quasi-equilibrium plasma around the black hole, and resulting in electromagnetic fluxes ranging from supernova to pulsar-like luminosities. For stellar mass black holes, such systems resemble millisecond pulsars and are expected to emit pulsating radio waves and continuous gravitational waves (CWs) within the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) sensitivity band. We select 44 sources with approximately coincident frequencies or positive frequency drifts from existing pulsar catalogs as potential candidates of long-lasting superradiance clouds around old galactic black holes. For a subset of 34 sources that are well measured and have not been previously targeted, we perform the first search for CW emission in LVK data from the third observing run. We find no evidence of a CW signal and place 95% confidence level upper limits on the emitted strain amplitude. We interpret these results, together with limits from previous searches, in terms of the underlying dark photon theory by performing an analysis of the expected signals from superradiance clouds from galactic black holes. We find that, even for moderately spinning black holes, the absence of an observed CW signal disfavors a discrete set of dark photon masses between about $10^{-13}$ $\rm{eV}/c^2$ and $10^{-12}$ $\rm{eV}/c^2$ and kinetic mixing couplings in the range of $10^{-9}$-$10^{-7}$, subject to assumptions about the properties of the black hole population and the cloud's electromagnetic emission.</description>

      <title>A sufficient condition for the development of superradiant instabilities in charged black-hole spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02053v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The physical and mathematical properties of charged black holes that are linearly coupled to charged massive scalar fields are studied analytically. In particular, we prove that, in the eikonal large-mass regime $M\mu\gg1$, the compact dimensionless inequality $\Phi_{\text{H}}&gt;Q/M$ provides a sufficient condition for the development of superradiant instabilities in the curved black-hole spacetime [here $\{M,Q,\Phi_{\text{H}}\}$ are respectively the mass, the electric charge, and the horizon electrostatic potential of the central black hole and $\mu$ is the proper mass of the field]. The familiar charged Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole does not satisfy this inequality. On the other hand, we explicitly prove that all charged Ay\'on-Beato-Garc\'ia (ABG) black-hole spacetimes satisfy this analytically derived sufficient condition and may therefore become superradiantly unstable to perturbations of charged massive scalar fields.</description>

      <title>Role of internal space correlations in the dynamics of a higher-dimensional Bianchi type-I universe: shear scalar and Hubble parameter perspectives</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02109</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02109v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate exact solutions of the Einstein field equations in higher-dimensional, spatially homogeneous Bianchi type-I spacetimes, introducing a real parameter $\lambda$ that correlates the expansion rates of external and internal spaces. Extending beyond Robertson--Walker spacetime, our approach includes positive and negative correlations, suggesting a broader and isotropic/anisotropic cosmological model space. Positively correlated dimensions manifest as a cosmological constant at late times, while at early times, they mimic stiff-fluid-like dark energy that dilutes faster than radiation, paralleling early dark energy models. This suggests a pathway for alleviating the Hubble tension by tailoring higher-dimensional dynamics to reduce the sound horizon. When anisotropic expansion is allowed, these models achieve isotropization more efficiently than predicted by Wald's cosmic no-hair theorem. Negative correlations, in contrast, yield a higher-dimensional steady-state universe where the shear scalar remains constant, effectively emulating a negative cosmological constant. These distinct behaviors arise from a simple signature change: positive correlation accelerates shear scalar decay, while negative correlation stabilizes it. We demonstrate that the solutions admit analytic continuation from the Lorentzian to Euclidean regime ($t \to -i\tau$), revealing a wormhole-like topology that connects two asymptotic regions via a throat, with $\lambda \to -\lambda$.</description>

      <title>Greybody Factor for massive scalar field in charged black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02247</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02247v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The spectrum of Hawking radiation from black holes can be partially observed due to the spacetime curvature of the black hole behaving like a potential barrier. This spectrum can be described by arranging the Klein-Gordon equation on curved spacetime into the Regge-Wheeler equation. The transmission probabilities of Hawking radiation from this incident are called the greybody factor. In this work, the greybody factor of a massive scalar field in the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole is investigated using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation and rigorous bound methods. As a result, we found that transmission probability and behavior of potential are directly related in such a way that the higher the potential the lower the greybody factor. Both methods achieve a similar conclusion, which states that the greybody factor and mass of the scalar field have an inverse relationship. This can be interpreted in a similar way in quantum mechanics, namely the scalar field with the higher mass will encounter a stronger interaction from the potential and then it is more difficult to penetrate through the potential barrier.</description>

      <title>Gravitational energy in pp-wave spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The description of the gravitation energy is a long standing problem. Although some success has been achieved, there is no satisfactory solution to this problem yet. Probably the most promising approach to this problem is given by teleparallelism. Many consistent and interesting results have been obtained in the context of the so-called Teleparallel Equivalent of General Relativity, including results obtained with spacetimes that are neither static nor asymptotically flat. One example is the analysis of the plus-polarized $pp$-waves that has been made recently [Phys. Rev. D 108, 044043 (2023)]. In this paper, this analysis is extended to arbitrary polarization and some new results that shows the consistency of the teleparallel approach is obtained.</description>

      <title>Study on Gravitational Waves from Binary Mergers and Constraints on the Hubble Parameter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Einstein's General Theory of Relativity predicted the existence of gravitational waves (GWs), which offer a way to explore cosmic events like binary mergers and could help resolve the Hubble Tension. The Hubble Tension refers to the discrepancy in the measurements of the Hubble Constant, Ho, obtained through different methods and missions over various periods. By analyzing gravitational wave data, particularly from mergers that also emit light (electromagnetic radiation), such as Bright Sirens, we aim to reduce this tension. This paper will investigate the properties of GWs produced by these binary mergers and utilize a mathematical framework to tackle the Hubble Tension. Future advancements in gravitational wave astronomy, particularly with initiatives like LIGO-India and LISA, promise to enhance research outcomes. The ground-based LIGO-India will increase sensitivity and improve localization, while the space-based LISA will target lower frequency ranges of GWs, enabling the detection of signals from a wider array of sources.</description>

      <title>On the Klein-Gordon scalar field oscillators in a spacetime with spiral-like dislocations in external magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02443</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02443v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effects of two types of spiral dislocation (the distortion of the radial line, labeled as spiral dislocation I, and the distortion of a circle, labeled as spiral dislocation II) on the relativistic dynamics of the Klein-Gordon (KG) oscillator fields, both in the presence and absence of external magnetic fields. In this context, our investigations show that while spiral dislocation I affects the energies of the KG oscillators (with or without the magnetic field), spiral dislocation II has, interestingly, no effect on the KG oscillator's energies unless a magnetic field is applied. However, for both types of spiral dislocations, we observe that the corresponding wave functions incorporate the effects of the dislocation parameter. Our findings are based on the exact solvability and conditional exact solvability (associated with the biconfluent Heun polynomials) of the KG oscillators (with or without the magnetic field, respectively) for spiral dislocation I, and the exact solvability of the KG oscillators (with or without the magnetic field) for spiral dislocation II. The exact solvability of the latter suggests that the oscillator's frequency is solely determined by the magnetic field strength.</description>

      <title>H0 tension in Tsallis and Renyi statistics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02457v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent attempts to study the implications of Tsallis and Renyi statistics in gravitational, cosmological, and astrophysical systems, the possible relationships between H0 tension and generalized statistics are explored. It is obtained that, in the light of H0 tension, the energytime uncertainty relations in Tsallis and Renyi statistics constrain the values of Tsallis and Renyi parameters. Hence, the way to find the footprints of non-extensivity in the universe is paved.</description>

      <title>Repulsive quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02470v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate, in the framework of linearized quantum gravity, the quantum gravitational interaction between a gravitoelectrically polarizable object and a gravitomagnetically polarizable object. This interaction originates from the coupling between the instantaneous mass quadrupole moment and the mass-current quadrupole moment of the objects, induced by fluctuating gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic fields in a vacuum. Using leading-order perturbation theory, we derive the explicit expression of the quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction energy, which shows a distance dependence of $r^{-8}$ in the near regime and $r^{-11}$ in the far regime, where $r$ is the distance between the two objects. Remarkably, this interaction energy is positive, indicating that the force is repulsive. Since interactions between objects polarizable in the same gravitoelectric or gravitomagnetic manner are inherently attractive, for objects which are both gravitoelectrically and gravitomagnetically polarizable, the overall quantum gravitational interaction potential is reduced when the repulsive quantum gravitoelectric-gravitomagnetic interaction is taken into account. However, for two isotropically polarizable objects with identical gravitoelectric and gravitomagnetic polarizabilities and energy level spacing, the repulsive quantum interaction cannot surpass the attractive interactions.</description>

      <title>Effects of hair on the image of a rotating black hole illuminated by a thin accretion disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02496</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02496v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the shadow and optical appearance of the hairy Kerr black hole illuminated by a thin accretion disk, the materials of which outside the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) move on the equatorial circular orbit, while inside the ISCO they quickly plunge into the black hole. The deformation parameter $\alpha$ and hair parameter $l_o$ are found to influence the motions of accretion as well as the redshift effect of the photon, such that they significantly affect the shadow and image of the hairy Kerr black hole. Especially, these two parameters have competing effects on the size of the black hole's shadow, and significantly increase the width of photon ring. This study provides a preliminary theoretical prediction that the image of the hairy Kerr black hole, especially the photon ring structure, may be used to constrain the hair parameters with future high-precision astronomical observation.</description>

      <title>The pseudospectrum for the Kerr black hole: spin $s=0$ case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02522</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02522v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the pseudospectrum of the Kerr black hole, which indicates the instability of the spectrum of QNMs of the Kerr black hole. Methodologically, we use the hyperboloidal framework to cast the quasinormal mode (QNM) problem into a two-dimensional eigenvalue problem associated with a non-self-adjoint operator, and then the spectrum and pseudospectrum are solved by imposing the two-dimensional Chebyshev collocation method. The (energy) norm is constructed by using the conserved current method for the spin $s=0$ case. In order to study the convergence issues, an extra $H^k$-norm term is added into the original energy norm. For the finite rank approximation of the operator, it is found that as $k$ increases, the pseudospectrum becomes sharp when the complex number $\omega$ is close to the QNM spectra. In contrast, when $\omega$ moves away from the QNM spectra, the pseudospectrum becomes mild. Furthermore, we discussed the convergence of pseudospectra with different $H^k$-norms. As $k$ increases, the convergence of the pseudospectrum improves. However, at the same time, an increase in the imaginary part of $\omega$ can deteriorate the convergence of the pseudospectrum under the condition of the same norms.</description>

      <title>Conformal Solutions of Static Plane Symmetric Cosmological Models in Cases of a Perfect Fluid and a Cosmic String Cloud</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we obtained exact solutions of Einstein's field equations for plane symmetric cosmological models by assuming that thy admit conformal motion. The space-time geometry of these solutions is found to be nonsingular, non-vacuum and conformally flat. We have shown that in the case of a perfect fluid, these solutions have an energy-momentum tensor possessing dark energy with negative pressure and the energy equation of state is $\rho +p=0$. We have shown that a fluid has acceleration, rotation, shear-free, vanishing expansion, and rotation. In the case of a cosmic string cloud, we found that the tension density and particle density decrease as the fluid moves along the direction of the strings, then vanish at infinity. We shown that the exact conformal solution for a static plane symmetric model reduces to the the well-known anti-De Sitter space time. We obtained that the space-time under consideration admits a conformal vector field orthogonal to the four-velocity vector and does not admits a vector parallel to the four-velocity vector. Some physical and kinematic properties of the resulting models are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Black hole surrounded by a magnetic vortex in $f(R)$ gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02712v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modified Gravity Theories (MGTs) are extensions of General Relativity (GR) in its standard formulation. In light of this premise, we employ Heisenberg's non-perturbative approach to promote the three-dimensional Einstein-Hilbert theory to a modified $f(R)$ gravity. Within this context, we investigate a cosmological system composed of a black hole (BH) surrounded by Maxwell-Higgs vortices, forming the BH-vortex system. In the case of linear $f(R)$ gravity derived from quantum metric fluctuations, one shows the existence of a three-dimensional ring-like BH-vortex system with quantized magnetic flux. Within this system, one notes the BH at $r=0$ and its event horizon at $r= r_0$, while the magnetic vortices are at $r\in (r_0, \infty)$. A remarkable result is the constancy of the Bekenstein-Hawking temperature ($T_H$), regardless of MGTs and vortex parameters. This invariance of $T_H$ suggests that the BH-vortex system reaches thermodynamic stability. Unlike the standard theory of Maxwell-Higgs vortices in flat spacetime, in $f(R)$ gravity, the vortices suffer the influence of the BH's event horizon. This interaction induces perturbations in the magnetic vortex profile, forming cosmological ring-like magnetic structures.</description>

      <title>Holographic inflation and holographic dark energy from entropy of the anti-de Sitter black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the entropy of anti-de Sitter black hole, a new holographic dark energy model has been proposed. When the Hubble horizon and particle horizon are chosen as the IR cutoff, the late-time accelerated expansion of universe is realized. In this paper, we consider the Hubble horizon as the IR cutoff to investigate holographic inflation and slow-roll inflation in this model. We find that slow-roll inflation with the chaotic potential $V_{0}\phi^{n}$ is favored by Planck results for some special cases, such as $n=1/3$ and $n=1/2$, while holographic inflation is not supported by Planck results. Then, we use the dynamical analysis method, statefinder diagnostic pairs, and the Hubble diagram to analyze this model. Our results indicate that when $b^{2}$ takes a small value, this model cannot be distinguished from the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and can serve as an alternative to it.</description>

      <title>Thermal RG Flow of AS Quantum Gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02878</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02878v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform the thermal Renormalization Group (RG) study of the Asymptotically Safe (AS) quantum gravity in the Einstein-Hilbert truncation by relating the temperature parameter to the running RG scale as $T \equiv k_T = \tau k$ (in natural units) in order to determine its thermal evolution in terms of the dimensionless temperature $\tau$ which is associated with the temperature of the expanding Universe. Thus, $k_T$ and $k$ are understood as running cutoffs for thermal and quantum fluctuations, respectively. Quantum effects are taken into account by moving along the thermal RG trajectory with fixed value of $\tau$ producing the quantum effective action at a given dimensionless temperature. The $\tau$-evolution of the dimensionless Newton coupling $g(\tau)$ and the dimensionless cosmological constant $\lambda(\tau)$ results in a vanishing $g$-coordinate of the Reuter (i.e., non-Gaussian UV) fixed point in the high temperature limit ($\tau \to \infty$) which means that only the symmetric phase of AS gravity survives at $\tau = \infty$.</description>

      <title>On the Polynomial Degeneracy of Ricci Invariants and Spacetime Singularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02903</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02903v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the connection of a general relativistic matter-energy momentum tensor with the polynomial degeneracies of higher order curvature invariants defined in Riemannian geometry. The degeneracies enforce additional constraints on the energy-momentum tensor components. Due to these constraints the formation of a curvature singularity, for instance during a gravitational collapse can no longer be treated as inevitable. We find that there can be a formation of singularity iff the interior fluid evolves into (i) a pressure-less dust, (ii) an isotropic sphere or (iii) a distribution with negative pressure.</description>

      <title>Surrogate modeling of gravitational waves microlensed by spherically symmetric potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02974v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anticipated observation of the gravitational microlensing of gravitational waves (GWs) promises to shed light on a host of astrophysical and cosmological questions. However, extracting the parameters of the lens from the modulated GWs requires accurate modeling of the lensing amplification factor, accounting for wave-optics effects. Analytic solutions to the lens equation have not been found to date, except for a handful of simplistic lens models. While numerical solutions to this equation have been developed, the time and computational resources required to evaluate the amplification factor numerically make large-scale parameter estimation of the lens (and source) parameters prohibitive. On the other hand, surrogate modeling of GWs has proven to be a powerful tool to accurately, and rapidly, produce GW templates at arbitrary points in parameter space, interpolating from a finite set of available waveforms at discrete parameter values. In this work, we demonstrate that surrogate modeling can also effectively be applied to the evaluation of the time-domain microlensing amplification factor $\widetilde{F}(t)$, for arbitrary lens configurations. We show this by constructing $\widetilde{F}(t)$ for two lens models, viz. point-mass lens, and singular isothermal sphere. We benchmark the evaluation times, and accuracy, of the surrogate microlensed templates, and show that indeed surrogate modeling is a powerful tool to make large-scale parameter estimation in the context of microlensed GWs practicable.</description>

      <title>On the renormalization of ultraviolet divergences in the inflationary angular power spectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03125v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revise the role that ultraviolet divergences of quantum fields play in slow-roll inflation, and discuss the renormalization of cosmological observables from a space-time perspective, namely the angular power spectrum. We first derive an explicit expression for the multipole coefficients $C_{\ell}$ in the Sachs-Wolfe regime in terms of the two-point function of primordial perturbations. We then analyze the ultraviolet behavior, and point out that the standard result in the literature is equivalent to a renormalization of $C_{\ell}$ at zero ``adiabatic'' order. We further argue that renormalization at second ``adiabatic'' order may be more appropriate from the viewpoint of standard quantum field theory. This may change significantly the predictions for $C_{\ell}$, while maintaining scale invariance.</description>

      <title>Effects of Spatial Curvature on Blackbody Radiation: Modifications to Energy Distribution and Fundamental Laws</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the effects of spatial curvature on blackbody radiation. By employing an analog model of general relativity, we replace the conventional straight-line harmonic oscillators used to model blackbody radiation with oscillators on a circle. This innovative approach provides an effective framework for describing blackbody radiation influenced by spatial curvature. We derive the curvature-dependent Planck energy distribution and find that moving from flat to curved space results in a reduction in both the height and width of the Planck function. Moreover, increasing the curvature leads to a pronounced redshift in the peak frequency. We also analyze the influence of spatial curvature on the Stefan-Boltzmann law, Rayleigh-Jeans law, and Wien law.</description>

      <title>Effects of Galaxy Cluster Structure on Lensed Transients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02096v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lenses come in many forms, but are typically divided into two populations: galaxies, and groups and clusters of galaxies. When calculating the properties of the images we expect to see from these lenses, it is typically assumed that each lens is roughly a singular isothermal sphere. In reality, the largest objects in the Universe (i.e. galaxy clusters) are highly irregular and composed of many components due to a history of (or active) hierarchical mergers. In this work, we analyze the discrepancies in the observables of strongly lensed transients in both scenarios, namely relative magnifications, time delays, and image multiplicities. Focusing on gravitational waves, we compare the detection rates between the single spherical dark matter halo models found in the literature, and publicly available state-of-the-art cluster lens models. We find there to be approximately an order of magnitude fewer detection of strongly lensed transients in the realistic model case, likely caused by their loss of overall strong lensing optical depth. We also report detection rates in the weak lensing or single-image regime. Additionally, we find a systemic shift towards lower time delays between the brightest image pairs in the cases of the realistic models, as well as higher fractions of positive versus negative parity images, as seen elsewhere in the literature. This significant deviation in the joint relative magnification factor-time delay distribution will hinder the feasibility of the reconstruction of lenses through time domain transients alone, but can still provide a lower limit on the lens mass.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02258v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The de Sitter conjecture yields a severe bound on possible vacua for a consistent quantum gravity. We extend the de Sitter conjecture by taking into account dynamics of the scalar field. We then apply such an extended de Sitter conjecture to a quintessence model of inflation for which dynamics of the scalar field is essential, and obtain an allowed region of parameters of the scalar potential wider than previously considered cases with the conventional de Sitter conjecture. The new bounds in the swampland conjecture could have implications in several situations to construct compactification models.</description>

      <title>Constraining electromagnetic couplings of ultralight scalars from compact stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02286</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02286v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: If an ultralight scalar interacts with the electromagnetic fields of a compact rotating star, then a long-range scalar field is developed outside the star. The Coulomb-like profile of the scalar field is equivalent to an effective scalar charge on the star. In a binary star system, the scalar-induced charge would result in a long-range force between the stars, with the scalar field acting as the mediator. The scalar-photon interactions would modify Maxwell's equations for electromagnetic fields in vacuum, resulting in a modified dispersion relation. This could be observed as an apparent redshift for photons emitted by such sources. The scalar field would also induce additional electric and magnetic fields and hence affect the electromagnetic energy radiated from such compact objects. A scalar field sourced by time-varying electromagnetic fields can also carry away energy from a compact star in the form of radiation, and hence contribute to its spin-down luminosity. We constrain the scalar-photon coupling from the measurements of the electromagnetic radiation of the compact star and its spin-down luminosity. We also project the prospective bounds on these couplings with future measurements of the apparent redshifts of compact stars and of the long-range force between two magnetars in a binary. We analyze the systems of the binary pulsar PSR J0737-3039, the Crab pulsar, the soft gamma repeater SGR 1806-20, and the gamma ray burst GRB 080905A. The bounds on the coupling can be significantly improved by future measurements of compact stars with large magnetic fields, experiments with better sensitivity, and precision clock measurements.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute the renormalized expectation value of the stress-energy tensor operator for a quantum scalar field propagating on three-dimensional global anti-de Sitter space-time. The scalar field has general mass and nonminimal coupling to the Ricci scalar curvature, and is subject to Dirichlet, Neumann or Robin boundary conditions at the space-time boundary. We consider both vacuum and thermal states, and explore whether the weak and null energy conditions are satisfied by the quantum stress-energy tensor. We uncover a rather complicated picture: compliance with these two energy conditions depends strongly on the mass and coupling of the scalar field to the curvature, and the boundary conditions applied.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A traversable wormhole generally violates the averaged null energy condition, usually requiring exotic matter. Recently, it has been found that the traversable wormhole can be realized by non-exotic matter in Einstein-Dirac-Maxwell theories in flat space. This paper generalizes discussions to the AdS spacetime and finds traversable wormholes with spherical and planar topologies. Furthermore, based on the AdS/CFT correspondence, we compute the entanglement entropy of strips and disks on two AdS boundaries of the wormhole. We find that entanglement entropy undergoes a phase transition as the subsystem size increases.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02359v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent arguments based on the quantum extremal surface formula or the gravitational path integral have given fairly compelling evidence that the Hilbert space of quantum gravity in a closed universe is one-dimensional and real. How can this be consistent with the complexity of our own experiences? In this paper we propose that the experiences of any observer $Ob$ in a closed universe can be approximately described by a quantum mechanical theory with a Hilbert space whose dimension is roughly $e^{S_{Ob}}$, where $S_{Ob}$ is the number of degrees of freedom of $Ob$. Moreover we argue that the errors in this description are exponentially small in $S_{Ob}$. We give evidence for this proposal using the gravitational path integral and the coding interpretation of holography, and we explain how similar effects arise in black hole physics in appropriate circumstances.</description>

      <title>Investigating quantum criticality through charged scalar fields near the BTZ black hole horizon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine a charged scalar field with a position-dependent mass \( m(\rho) = m_0 + \mathcal{S}(\rho) \), where \(\mathcal{S}(\rho)\) represents a Lorentz scalar potential, near a BTZ black hole in the presence of an external magnetic field. By deriving the Klein-Gordon equation for this setup, we explore two scenarios: (i) a mass-modified scalar field with \(m(\rho) = m_0 - a/\rho\) (an exactly solvable case), and (ii) a scenario involving both mass modification and an external magnetic field (conditionally exactly solvable). We identify quantum critical points (QCPs) associated with the coupling constant \(a\). In the first scenario, for massless charged scalar fields, critical points occur at \(a = n + 1/2\) for all radial quantum numbers \(n \geq 0\) and magnetic quantum numbers \(|m| \geq 0\). In the second scenario, these critical points shift to \(a = n + 3/2\) for \(n \geq 0\) and \(|m| &gt; 0\), with the case \(m = 0\) excluded. For massive scalar fields, QCPs emerge at \(a = (n + 1/2)/2\), leading to non-propagating fields at zero frequency. At these QCPs, the field frequencies drop to zero, marking transitions from stable oscillatory modes to non-propagating states. Below the critical points, the system exhibits instability, characterized by negative imaginary frequencies that suggest rapid decay and high dissipation. Above the critical points, the modes stabilize and propagate, indicating a transition to a superconducting-like phase, where dissipation vanishes and stable excitations dominate.</description>

      <title>Quantum noise in time-dependent media and cosmic expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02495</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02495v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In spatially uniform, but time-dependent dielectric media with equal electric and magnetic response, classical electromagnetic waves propagate exactly like in empty, flat space with transformed time, called conformal time, and so do quantum fluctuations. In empty, flat space the renormalized vacuum energy is exactly zero, but not in time-dependent media, as we show in this paper. This is because renormalization is local and causal, and so cannot compensate fully for the transformation to conformal time. The expanding universe appears as such a medium to the electromagnetic field. We show that the vacuum energy during cosmic expansion effectively reduces the weights of radiation and matter by characteristic factors. This quantum buoyancy naturally resolves the Hubble tension, the discrepancy between the measured and the inferred Hubble constant, and it might resolve other cosmological tensions as well.</description>

      <title>Parametrization Framework for the Deceleration Parameter in Scalar Field Dark Energy Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker cosmological model with a scalar field that represents dark energy. A new parametrization of the deceleration parameter is introduced of the form $q = 1 + \eta (1 + \mu a^{\eta})$ where $\eta$ and $\mu$ are model parameters. and the compatibility of the model is constrained by recent observational datasets, including cosmic chronometers, Pantheon+ and Baryon Acoustic Observations. By considering a variable deceleration parameter, we address the expansion history of the universe, providing a viable description of the transition from deceleration to acceleration. Using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, the parameters of the model are constrained and we examine the cosmological parameters. A comparison is then made with the $\Lambda$CDM model using the latest observations. We examine the history of the main cosmological parameters, such as the deceleration parameter, jerk parameter, snap parameter, density parameter, and equation-of-state parameter, by constraining and interpreting them to reveal insights into what has been dubbed "dynamical dark energy" under the assumptions made above. Our method provides a framework that is independent of the model to explore dark energy, leading to a deeper and more subtle understanding of the mechanisms driving late-time cosmic acceleration.</description>

      <title>The gravitational path integral from an observer's point of view</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02632v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the fundamental problems in quantum gravity is to describe the experience of a gravitating observer in generic spacetimes. In this paper, we develop a framework for describing non-perturbative physics relative to an observer using the gravitational path integral. We apply our proposal to an observer that lives in a closed universe and one that falls behind a black hole horizon. We find that the Hilbert space that describes the experience of the observer is much larger than the Hilbert space in the absence of an observer. In the case of closed universes, the Hilbert space is not one-dimensional, as calculations in the absence of the observer suggest. Rather, its dimension scales exponentially with $G_N^{-1}$. Similarly, from an observer's perspective, the dimension of the Hilbert space in a two-sided black hole is increased. We compute various observables probing the experience of a gravitating observer in this Hilbert space. We find that an observer experiences non-trivial physics in the closed universe in contrast to what it would see in a one-dimensional Hilbert space. In the two-sided black hole setting, our proposal implies that non-perturbative corrections to effective field theory for an infalling observer are suppressed until times exponential in the black hole entropy, resolving a recently raised puzzle in black hole physics. While the framework that we develop is exemplified in the toy-model of JT gravity, most of our analysis can be extended to higher dimensions and, in particular, to generic spacetimes not admitting a conventional holographic description, such as cosmological universes or black hole interiors.</description>

Abstract: We extract the complex frequency of the lowest quasi-normal mode from the holographically computed entropy density near thermodynamic equilibrium. The system consists of a purely thermal Supersymmetric Yang-Mills N=4 plasma in homogeneous isotropization dynamics. The initial state is far-from-equilibrium, proceeding to thermalization over time. The system evolves to equilibrium entropy forming a stairway pattern. The analysis reveals that the rate of increase of the stairway is twice the decay rate of the lowest quasi-normal mode. This leads us to propose a model explaining how this information is encoded in entropy. The model is extended to consider finite temperature, R-charge density and scalar condensate of the medium, disclosing an additional feature. The system's main dissipation channel may shift to one driven by the scalar condensate, depending on the chemical potential.</description>

      <title>The Influence of General Relativity on the Spins of Celestial Bodies in Inclined Orbits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02717</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02717v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Through the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, several hot Jupiters have been found to exhibit spin-orbit misalignment, and even retrograde orbits. The high obliquity observed in these planets can be attributed to two primary formation mechanisms, as summarized in the existing literature. First, the host star's spin becomes misaligned with the planetary disk during the late stages of star formation, primarily due to chaotic accretion and magnetic interactions between the star and the planetary disk. Second, the orbital inclination of an individual planet can be excited by dynamical processes such as planet-planet scattering, the Lidov-Kozai cycle, and secular chaos within the framework of Newtonian mechanics. This study introduces a third mechanism, where, within the framework of general relativity, the post-Newtonian spin-orbit coupling term induces precession of the host star's spin around the orbital angular momentum. The orbital inclination, relative to a reference plane, can expand the range of deviation in the spatial orientation of the bodies' spins from the plane's normal. The varying amplitude and period of spin precession for both the star and the planet are derived theoretically, and the results, which can be applied without restriction, agree well with numerical simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02757v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that encrypted cloning of unknown quantum states is possible. Any number of encrypted clones of a qubit can be created through a unitary transformation, and each of the encrypted clones can be decrypted through a unitary transformation. The decryption of an encrypted clone consumes the decryption key, i.e., only one decryption is possible, in agreement with the no-cloning theorem. A possible application of encrypted cloning is to enable encrypted quantum multi-cloud storage. Beyond applications in cryptography, encrypted cloning could provide a form of redundancy, parallelism, fault tolerance or scalability where direct duplication is forbidden by the no-cloning theorem.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Chern-Simons interaction during inflation with a non-canonical pseudo-scalar</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02890v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A Chern-Simons interaction between a pseudo-scalar field and a U(1) gauge field results in the generation of a chiral gravitational wave background. The detection of this signal is contrasted by the fact that this coupling also generates primordial scalar perturbations, on which strong limits exist, particularly at CMB scales. In this study, we propose a new extension of this mechanism characterized by a non-canonical kinetic term for the pseudo-scalar. We find that a decrease of the sound speed of the pseudo-scalar field highly suppresses the sourced scalar with respect to the sourced tensor modes, thus effectively allowing for the production of a greater tensor signal. Contrary to the case of a canonical axion inflaton, it is in this case possible for the sourced tensor modes to dominate over the vacuum ones without violating the non-Gaussianity constraints from the scalar sector, which results in a nearly totally polarized tensor signal at CMB scales. We also study the extension of this mechanisms to the multiple field case, in which the axion is not the inflaton.</description>

      <title>Radiation-Reaction and Angular Momentum Loss at $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02904v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We point out that the contribution to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss for two-body scattering involving two radiation modes, $J_\text{2rad}$, is determined by the radiation-reaction contribution to the one-loop waveform. The latter is proportional to the tree-level one, and this reduces the calculation of $J_\text{2rad}$ to cut two-loop integrals. We exploit this simplification, which follows from unitarity, to obtain a closed-form expression for $J_\text{2rad}$ for generic velocities, which resums all fractional post-Newtonian (PN) corrections to the $\mathcal{O}(G^4)$ angular momentum loss starting at 1.5PN.</description>

      <title>Isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves induced by cosmological soliton isocurvature perturbations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.02965v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmological solitons are widely predicted by scenarios of the early Universe. In this work, we investigate the isotropic background and anisotropies of gravitational waves (GWs) induced by soliton isocurvature perturbations, especially considering the effects of non-Gaussianity in these perturbations. Regardless of non-Gaussianity, the energy-density fraction spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs approximately has a universal shape within the perturbative regime, thus serving as a distinctive signal of solitons. We derive the angular power spectrum of isocurvature-induced GWs to characterize their anisotropies. Non-Gaussianity plays a key role in generating anisotropies through the couplings between large- and small-scale isocurvature perturbations, making the angular power spectrum to be a powerful probe of non-Gaussianity. Moreover, the isocurvature-induced GWs have nearly no cross-correlations with the cosmic microwave background, providing a new observable to distinguish them from other GW sources, e.g., GWs induced by cosmological curvature perturbations enhanced at small scales. Therefore, detection of both the isotropic background and anisotropies of isocurvature-induced GWs could reveal important implications for the solitons as well as the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Cosmic Whispers of the Early Universe: Gravitational Waves and Dark Matter from Primordial Black Holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03065v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Various mechanisms have been suggested for the formation of Primordial Black Holes (PBHs), and this thesis focuses on the standard mechanism based on the critical collapse of cosmological fluctuations. The underlying idea is that during inflation, a period of rapid expansion in the early Universe, large cosmological fluctuations could have been generated. After inflation, when the cosmic horizon reached a size comparable to these fluctuations, if the latter were high enough, they could collapse and form a PBH.
  Beyond the fascinating possibility that these compact objects might make up all or part of the Dark Matter (DM) we observe today, their formation and existence is also associated with the generation of gravitational waves (GWs). These waves could contribute to the merger events observed by the LIGO/Virgo/KAGRA Collaboration (LVK) or account for signals detected by pulsar timing array experiments (PTA). In the first part of this thesis, we investigate the PBH scenario, examining the computation of the abundance beyond the Gaussian paradigm. In the second part, we discuss how PBH formation can produce a stochastic GW background and how observations, related to recent experiments such as LVK and PTA collaborations, can help in distinguishing between different PBH production models. Finally, in the last part, we investigate some aspects of the interplay between black holes and fundamental physics in the early Universe, describing some characteristics and challenges of various PBH production models.</description>

Abstract: We reconsider velocity addition/subtraction in Special Relativity and re-derive its well-known non-commutative and non-associative algebraic properties in a self contained way, including various explicit expressions for the Thomas angle, the derivation of which will be seen to be not as challenging as often suggested. All this is based on the polar-decomposition theorem in the traditional component language, in which Lorentz transformations are ordinary matrices. In the second part of this paper we offer a less familiar alternative geometric view, that leads to an invariant definition of the concept of relative velocity between two states of motion, which is based on the boost-link-theorem, of which we also offer an elementary proof that does not seem to be widely known in the relativity literature. Finally we compare this to the corresponding geometric definitions in Galilei-Newton spacetime, emphasising similarities and differences.</description>

Abstract: In the framework of general relativity (GR), gravitational waves (GWs) travel at the speed of light across all frequencies. However, massive gravity and weak equivalence principle (WEP) violation may lead to frequency-dependent variations in the propagation speed of GWs, which can be examined by comparing the theoretical and observed discrepancies in the arrival times of GW signals at various frequencies. This provides us with an opportunity to test these theories. For massive gravity, we consider that gravitons may have a nonzero rest mass. For WEP violations, we hypothesize that different massless particles exposed to the same gravitational source should exhibit varying gravitational time delays. The gravitational time delay induced by massive gravitational sources is proportional to $\gamma+1$, where the parameter $\gamma=1$ in GR. Therefore, we can quantify these two deviations using phenomenological parameters $m_g$ and $|\Delta \gamma|$, respectively. In this study, we use selected GW data from binary black hole coalescences in the LIGO-Virgo catalogs GWTC-2.1 and GWTC-3 to place constraints on the parameters $m_g$ and $|\Delta \gamma|$. We analyze the relationship between $m_g$ and luminosity distance,as well as between $|\Delta \gamma|$ and both luminosity distance sky location of GW events to determine the presence of graviton mass and WEP violation. Nevertheless, we find no evidence of such relationships. We also compute Bayes factors for models that assume the existence of graviton mass and WEP violation compared to the standard GW model, respectively. The absolute value of the natural logarithm of the Bayes factor is generally less than 2. Our analysis reveals no significant preference for either model. Additionally, the Bayes factors between these two models do not provide obvious evidence in favor of either one.</description>

Abstract: An observer at rest with the expanding universe experiences some extra noise in the quantum vacuum, and so does an accelerated observer in a vacuum at rest (in Minkowski space). The literature mainly focuses on the ideal cases of exponential expansion (de-Sitter space) or uniform acceleration (Rindler trajectories) or both, but the real cosmic expansion is non-exponential and real accelerations are non-uniform. Here we use the frequency-time Wigner function of vacuum correlations to define time-dependent spectra. We found excellent Planck spectra for a class of realistic cosmological models, but also strongly non-Planckian, negative Wigner functions for a standard scenario testable with laboratory analogues.</description>

      <title>Exact cosmological solutions with magnetic field in the theory of gravity with non-minimal kinetic coupling</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.03683v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate anisotropic and homogeneous cosmological models in the scalar-tensor theory of gravity with non-minimal kinetic coupling of a scalar field to the curvature given by the function $\eta\cdot(\phi/2)\cdot G_{\mu\nu}\,\nabla^\mu \nabla^\nu\phi$ in the Lagrangian. We assume that the space-times are filled a global unidirectional magnetic field that minimally interacts with the scalar field. The matter sector is not included, since the model is studied in relation to the early times of the Universe evolution. We limit ourselves to the period before and during primary inflation. The Horndeski theory allows anisotropy to grow over time. The question arises about isotropization. In the theory under consideration, a zero scalar charge imposes a condition on the anisotropy level, namely its dynamics develops in a limited region. This condition uniquely determines a viable branch of solutions of the field equations. The magnetic energy density that corresponds to this branch is a bounded function of time. The sign of parameter $l=1+\varepsilon\eta \Lambda/\mu$ determines the properties of cosmological models, where $\Lambda$ is the cosmological constant, $\mu=M^2_{PL}$ is the Planck mass squared. The sign $\varepsilon=\pm 1$ defines the canonical scalar field and the phantom field, respectively. An inequality $\varepsilon/\eta&gt;0$ is a necessary condition for isotropization of models, but not sufficient. Three cases were considered: $l=0$, the isotropization does not occur; $l&gt;0$, there is isotropization; $l&lt;0$, there are two branches, one of which has the property of isotropization, and the other describes the Universe with collapse. The model with $l&lt;0$ has an anisotropic bounce and the Universe evolution begins with a non-zero volume value. Models of an infinitely expanding Universe eventually go into inflation mode with the scale factor $a(t)\propto e^{h_\eta\cdot t}$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.04176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In any diffeomorphism invariant theory of gravity, one can define a Noether charge arising from the invariance of the Lagrangian under diffeomorphisms. We have determined the Noether charge for scalar-tensor theories of gravity, in which case the gravity is mediated by the metric tensor as well as by a scalar degree of freedom. In particular, we demonstrate that the total Noether charge within an appropriate spatial volume can be related to the heat content of the boundary surface. For static spacetimes, in these theories, there exist an ``equipartition" between properly defined bulk and surface degrees of freedom. While the dynamical evolution of spacetime in these theories of scalar-tensor gravity arises due to the departure from the equipartition regime. These results demonstrate that thermodynamical interpretations for gravitational theories transcend Einstein and Lovelock theories of gravity, holding true for theories with additional scalar degrees of freedom as well. Moreover, they hold in both the Jordan and the Einstein frames. However, it turns out that there are two dynamically equivalent representations of the scalar-tensor theory in the Jordan frame, differing by total derivatives in the action, which are thermodynamically inequivalent. This depicts the importance of having a thermodynamic description, which can be used in distinguishing various dynamically equivalent representations of gravity theories beyond Einstein.</description>

Abstract: The properties of metric perturbations are determined in the context of an expanding Universe governed by a modified theory of gravity with a non-minimal coupling between curvature and matter. We analyse the dynamics of the 6 components of a general helicity decomposition of the metric and stress-energy perturbations, consisting of scalar, vector and tensor sectors. The tensor polarisations are shown to still propagate luminally, in agreement with recent data from gravitational interferometry experiments, while their magnitude decays with an additional factor sourced by the nonminimal coupling. We show that the production of these modes is associated with a modified quadrupole formula at leading order. The vector perturbations still exhibit no radiative behaviour, although their temporal evolution is found to be modified, with spatial dependence remaining unaffected. We establish that the scalar perturbations can no longer be treated as identical. We investigate the scalar sector by writing the modified model as an equivalent two-field scalar-tensor theory and find the same scalar degrees of freedom as in previous literature. The different sectors are paired with the corresponding polarisation modes, which can be observationally measured by their effects on the relative motion of test particles, thus providing the possibility of testing the modified theory and constraining its parameters.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-AdS black hole in non-commutative geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.03650v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the thermodynamics of Schwarzschild-anti-de Sitter black holes within the framework of non-commutative geometry. By solving the Einstein's equations, we derive the corrected Schwarzschild-AdS black hole with Lorentzian distribution and analyze the thermodynamics. Our results confirm that if the energy-momentum tensor outside the event horizon is related to the mass of the black hole, the conventional first law of thermodynamics will be violated. The study of criticality reveals that the black hole undergoes a small black hole-large black hole phase transition similar to that of the Van der Waals system, with a critical point and a critical ratio slightly smaller than that of the Van der Waals fluid. As the non-commutative parameter increases, the phase transition process shortens, leading to a critical point, and ultimately to the disappearance of the phase transition. The violation of the conventional first law results in a discontinuity of the Gibbs free energy during the phase transition, indicating the occurrence of zeroth-order phase transition. Moreover, we investigate the Joule-Thomson expansion, obtaining the minimum inversion temperature and the minimum inversion mass.</description>

      <title>From Landau two-fluid model to de Sitter Universe</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04392v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The condensed matter analogs are useful for consideration of the phenomena related to the quantum vacuum. This is because in condensed matter we know physics both in the infrared and in the ultraviolet limits, while in particle physics and gravity the physics at trans-Planckian scale is unknown. One of the corner stones of the connections between the non-relativistic condensed matter and the modern relativistic theories is the two-fluid hydrodynamics of superfluid helium. The dynamics and thermodynamics of the de Sitter state of the expansion of the Universe bear some features of the multi-fluid system. There are actually three components: the quantum vacuum, the gravitational component and relativistic matter. The expanding de Sitter vacuum serves as the thermal bath with local temperature, which is twice the Gibbons-Hawking temperature related to the cosmological horizon. This local temperature leads to the heating of matter component and the gravitational component. The latter behaves as Zel'dovich stiff matter and represents the dark matter. In equilibrium and in the absence of the conventional matter the positive partial pressure of dark matter compensates the negative partial pressure of quantum vacuum. That is why in the full equilibrium the total pressure is zero. This is similar to the superfluid and normal components in superfluids, which together produce the zero pressure of the liquid in the absence of environment. If one assumes that in dynamics, the gravitational dark matter behaves as the real Zel'dovich stiff matter, one obtains that both components experience the power law decay due to the energy exchange between these components. Then it follows that their values at present time have the correct order of magnitude. We also consider the other problems through the prism of condensed matter physics, including the black holes and Planck constant.</description>

      <title>Cold Collapse and Bounce of a FLRW Cloud</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.06785v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the collapse of spherical cold clouds beyond black hole (BH) formation to investigate the possibility of a bounce in the in-falling matter when a critical density or pressure is reached. As a first step, we analyze the pressureless collapse in general relativity (GR), where an analytic solution exists, and demonstrate that an equivalent Newtonian solution can be derived. Such equivalence also holds for spherically symmetric perfect fluids with uniform density and non-vanishing pressure. We numerically investigate the Newtonian collapse of such clouds with masses of $5$, $20$, and $1000$ M$_\odot$ obeying a polytropic equation of state (EoS). By choosing EoS parameters inspired by typical neutron star conditions, we observe bounces at and above nuclear saturation density. Assuming approximate uniformity, we explore the equivalent GR behaviour of the matter during the bounce. Our findings are: i) A GR bounce occurs around the ground state of the matter, characterized by $P = -\rho$. ii) The GR solution significantly differs from the Newtonian result due to the presence of curvature ($k \neq 0$). iii) Both the curvature and the ground state are crucial factors in allowing a GR bounce to occur.</description>

      <title>Connecting quasi-normal modes with causality in Lovelock theories of gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.08883v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The eikonal correspondence between the quasi-normal modes (QNMs) of asymptotically flat static spherically symmetric black holes and the properties of unstable null circular geodesics is studied in the case of higher dimensional Lovelock black holes (BHs). It is known that such correspondence does not generically hold for gravitational QNMs associated with BHs in Lovelock theories. In the present work, we revisit this correspondence and establish the relationship between the eikonal QNMs and the causal properties of the gravitational field equations in Lovelock theories of gravity.</description>

      <title>Gravitational waves from burdened primordial black holes dark matter</title>

Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are the natural candidate of dark matter (DM) as they only interact gravitationally and can evade any experiments on earth. In the standard semiclassical calculation of Hawking radiation, PBHs with mass below $10^{15}\rm g$ evaporated by now and therefore cannot be DM. However, the recently-discovered quantum memory burden effect can significantly suppress the evaporation of PBHs after the half-decay time. This quantum effect could open up a new mass window below $10^{10} \rm g$ where PBHs can still exist today and be DM. In this paper, we compute the gravitational wave (GW) signals associated with the formation of PBHs in this new mass window. We consider two formation scenarios: PBHs formed from inflationary perturbation and PBHs formed from collapse of Fermi-balls in a first-order phase transition (FOPT). GWs produced from these two scenarios have distinct features and, while the GW from inflation peaks at high frequency, the GW from FOPT peaks at lower frequency that can be within the reach of future experiments.</description>

      <title>Renormalization group improved cosmology in the presence of a stiff matter era</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03693v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.92.103004}{Phys. Rev. D 92 (2015) 103004}, simple analytical solutions of the Friedman equations were obtained for a universe having stiff matter component in the early universe together with a dark matter, and a dark energy component. In this analysis, the universe is considered to be made of a dark fluid which behaves as a stiff matter in the early phase of the universe (when the internal energy dominates). It is also more logical to consider quantum gravitational effects in the early phase of the cosmological evolution. In this analysis, following \href{https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.65.043508}{Phys. Rev. D 65 (2002) 043508}, we consider renormalization group improved modified Friedmann equations where the Newton's gravitational constant ($G$) and the cosmological constant ($\Lambda$) flows with the momentum scale $k$ of the universe. It is observed that for a universe undergoing a stiff matter era, radiation era, and matter era, inflation is absent in the early time regime of the universe when the flow of the Newton's gravitational constant and cosmological constant is under consideration. Using the identification of the momentum scale with the scale factor of the universe, we then explore the era $t&gt;t_{\text{Pl}}$ which indicates a primarily matter dominated era with accelerated expansion due to the presence of dark energy. Finally, considering the total equation of state as a combination of linear equation of state along with a polytropic equation of state, we observe that after the Planck-time the universe can undergo an inflationary phase and we find out that the inflation is enhanced by quantum gravitational effects arising due to the consideration of renormalization group approach to quantum gravity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04674v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we start by examining a spherically symmetric black hole within the framework of non-commutative geometry and apply a modified Newman-Janis method to obtain a new rotating solution. We then investigate its consequences, focusing on the horizon structure, ergospheres, and the black hole's angular velocity. Following this, a detailed thermodynamic analysis is performed, covering surface gravity, Hawking temperature, entropy, and heat capacity. We also study geodesic motion, with particular emphasis on null geodesics and their associated radial accelerations. Additionally, the photon sphere and the resulting black hole shadows are explored. Finally, we compute the quasinormal modes for scalar perturbations using the 6th-order WKB approximation.</description>

      <title>Rotating Traversable wormholes with two cosmic strings at the throat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.18961v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates how rotating traversable wormholes incorporate two cosmic strings at the throat of the wormhole. Building on arXiv:gr-qc/9803098v2 for rotating traversable wormholes and arXiv:gr-qc/0401036 analysis of scalar perturbations, a modified metric that accounts for these cosmic string perturbations is presented. This paper evaluates the Null Energy Condition in the presence of these string perturbations and focuses mainly on the scalar field dynamics in this modified spacetime. Using localized Gaussian perturbations to model cosmic string effects, this paper discusses the impact of angular and radial distributions from the cosmic strings on the spacetime geometry. Regularization has been applied to the shape function and energy condition violations at the wormhole throat, helping to eliminate divergences. The paper concludes with the result that the presence of cosmic strings induces unique anisotropic contributions. Future work could explore gravitational wave signatures associated with similar systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19626v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modifications of standard general relativity that bring torsion into a game have a long-standing history. However, no convincing arguments exist for or against its presence in physically acceptable gravity models. In this Letter, we provide an argument based on spectral geometry (using methods of pseudo-differential calculus) that suggests that the torsion shall be excluded from the consideration. We demonstrate that there is no well-defined functional extending to the torsion-full case of the spectral formulation of the Einstein tensor.</description>

      <title>Strong gravitational lensing effects around rotating regular black holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the strong gravitational lensing effects around two classes of rotating regular black holes, which behave as non-singular Minkowski core at the center. Starting from the null geodesic in the equatorial plane of the regular black holes, we analyze the deflection angle for both prograde photons and retrograde photons, which are found to significantly shift from that for Kerr black hole. Then we suppose the rotating regular black holes as the supermassive M87* and SgrA* black holes, respectively, and evaluate the lensing observables such as the image position, separation, magnification and the time delays between the relativistic images for the black holes. In both cases, the time delay differences between the regular black holes and Kerr black hole seem to be measurable, especially for the M87* black hole, but the deviations of outermost relativistic image and the asymptotic relativistic image for the two rotating regular black holes from those for Kerr black hole are less than 10 $\mu as$. This means that it is difficult to probe the regularity of the black hole via the current observations, but we can expect the next generation Event Horizon Telescope to test more precise properties of strong field regime.</description>

      <title>Algorithms for generating and analyzing black hole images based on the analytical equations of lightlike geodesics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.00361v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The analytical orbit equation of the lightlike geodesics through any fixed spatial point in Schwarzschild spacetime is explicitly presented in terms of the impact parameter, and with the result, the algorithms for generating and analyzing the black hole images under various accretion models are constructed. For the static and infalling spherical shell models of optically thin accretion, the integrated intensity observed by a distant observer is derived based on the backward ray tracing method. By taking the monochromatic emission pattern with a $1/r^{2}$ radial profile as example, the black hole images for the spherical shell with different boundaries are plotted, and then, the geometrical features and luminosity variations of these images are summarized. A notable feature of the black hole images for the infalling spherical shell model is that when the inner boundary of the spherical shell is sufficiently large, the doppler effects can strengthen the luminosity in the small adjacent region outside the shadow. The circular annulus models of optically and geometrically thin accretion are further explored. For a lightlike geodesic, the transfer functions establishing the connection between the emitting and receiving points are first provided in the algebraic manner, and the redshift factors in the static, infalling, and rotating circular annulus models are then deduced. With these results, in the three models, the integrated intensities observed by a distant observer viewing the circular annulus at an inclination angle are derived, and the corresponding black hole images for each emission pattern furnished in Phys. Rev. D \textbf{100} (2019) 024018 are plotted. Finally, the geometrical features and the luminosity variations of these images are also summarized.</description>

Abstract: Recent years have seen rapid progress in calculations of gravitational waveforms from asymmetric compact binaries containing spinning secondaries. Here we outline a complete waveform-generation scheme, through first post-adiabatic order (1PA) in gravitational self-force theory, for generic secondary spin and generic (eccentric, precessing) orbital configurations around a generic Kerr primary. We emphasize the utility of a Fermi-Walker frame in parametrizing the secondary spin, and we analyse precession and nutation effects in the spin-orbit dynamics. We also explain convenient gauge choices within the waveform-generation scheme, and the gauge invariance of the resulting waveform. Finally, we highlight that, thanks to recent results due to Grant and Witzany et al., all relevant spin effects at 1PA order can now be computed without evaluating local self-forces or torques.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09712v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We provide an improved definition of new conserved quantities derived from the energy-momentum tensor in curved spacetime by introducing an additional scalar function. We find that the conserved current and the associated conserved charge become geometric under a certain initial condition of the scalar function, and show that such a conserved geometric current generally exists in curved spacetime. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the geometric conserved current agrees with the entropy current in an effective theory of a perfect fluid, thus the conserved charge is the total entropy of the system. While the geometric charge can be regarded as the entropy for a nondissipative fluid, its physical meaning should be investigated for more general cases.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity and control of a 6-axis fused-silica seismometer</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.13475v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a pair of seismometers capable of measurement in all six axes of rigid motion. The vacuum-compatible devices implement compact interferometric displacement sensors to surpass the sensitivity of typical electrical readout schemes. Together with the capability to subtract the sensitivity-limiting coupling of ground tilt into horizontal motion, our seismometers can widen the sensing band towards mHz frequencies. This has notable applications across a range of fields requiring access to low-frequency signals, such as seismology and climate research. We particularly highlight their potential application in gravitational-wave observatories (LIGO) in improving their observation capability of intermediate-mass black holes ($\sim 1000\,M_\odot$). The sensors are based on a near-monolithic fused-silica design consisting of a fused-silica mass and fibre, showing improved stability and robustness to tilt drifts, alignment, and control compared to all-metal or mixed metal-silica designs. We demonstrate tilt sensitivity that surpasses the best commercial alternatives in a significantly reduced footprint compared to our previous iterations of these sensors.</description>

      <title>Covariant approach to relativistic large-eddy simulations: Lagrangian filtering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.13593v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a proof-of-principle implementation of the first fully covariant filtering scheme applied to relativistic fluid turbulence. The filtering is performed with respect to special observers, identified dynamically as moving with the "bulk of the flow". This means that filtering does not depend on foliations of spacetime but rather on the intrinsic fibration traced out by the observers. The covariance of the approach means that the results may be lifted into an arbitrary, curved spacetime. This practical step follows theoretical work showing that the residuals introduced by filtering a fine-scale ideal fluid can be represented by a non-ideal fluid prescription at the coarse scale. We interpret such non-ideal terms using a simple first-order gradient model, which allows us to extract effective turbulent viscosities and conductivity. A statistical regression on these terms shows that the majority of their variation may be explained by the thermodynamic properties of the filtered fluid and invariants of its flow, such as the shear and vorticity. This serves as a validation of the method and enables us to fit a functional, power-law form for the non-ideal coefficients -- an approach that may be used practically to give a sub-grid closure model in large-eddy simulations.</description>

      <title>There and Back Again: Mapping and Factorising Cosmological Observables</title>

Abstract: Cosmological correlators encode invaluable information about the wavefunction of the primordial universe. In this letter we present a duality between correlators and wavefunction coefficients that is valid to all orders in the loop expansion and manifests itself as a $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry. To demonstrate the power of the duality, we derive a correlator-to-correlator factorisation (CCF) formula for the parity-odd part of cosmological correlators that relates $n$-point observables to lower-point ones via a series of diagrammatic cuts. These relations serve as the first example of physically testable cutting rules as they involve observables defined for arbitrary physical kinematics. We further show how the duality allows us to translate the cosmological optical theorem for wavefunction coefficients into statements about cosmological correlators.</description>

      <title>Dark Spiky Primordial Black Holes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.07624v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent observations of two nearby black hole low-mass X-ray binaries have suggested possible indication of dark matter density spikes. While the evidence is compelling, one issue with this interpretation is that light black holes formed from stellar collapse are not expected to form dark matter spikes, and so it is unclear how the stellar-mass black holes in these binaries could have acquired such features. Since primordial black holes are expected to form ultra-dense dark matter mini-spikes, in this article we explore the possibility of a primordial origin for these light black holes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.15994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We shed a new light on the longstanding problem of covariant charges in diffeomorphism invariant theories like General Relativity (GR) by noting the other important feature of the theory, the background independence. To this end, we develop covariant phase space formalism in which we allow for the boundaries of spacetime to have arbitrary fluctuations. Within this formalism we show non-covariance of charges appear in inevitable integration constants which also break background independence in the expression of charges. We then apply the same formalism to black hole thermodynamics. We generalize the seminal Iyer-Wald derivation the first law of bl1ack hole thermodynamics by relaxing the need for the assumptions at a bifurcation surface and asymptotic infinity, as well as addressing questions regarding the integrability of charges. We also present a first principles derivation of the Smarr relation within our framework.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.18012v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Nonlinear simulations of neutron star mergers are complicated by the need to represent turbulent dynamics. As we cannot (yet) perform simulations that resolve accurately both the gravitational-wave scale and the smallest scales at which magneto/hydrodynamic turbulence plays a role, we need to rely on approximations. Addressing this problem in the context of large-eddy models, we outline a coherent Lagrangian filtering framework that allows us to explore the many issues that arise, linking conceptual problems to practical implementations and the interpretation of the results. We develop understanding crucial for quantifying unavoidable uncertainties in current and future numerical relativity simulations and consider the implications for neutron-star parameter estimation and constraints on the equation of state of matter under extreme conditions.</description>

      <title>A simplified approach for reproducing fully relativistic spectra in X-ray binary systems: Application to Cygnus X-1</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02415v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: General relativistic effects are strong near the black hole of an X-ray binary and significantly impact the total energy released at the innermost accretion disk's region. Our goal is to fully incorporate the black hole's spin and all the general relativistic effects on the observed spectra coming from X-ray binary systems while maintaining the simplicity of the standard disk model. That is possible by appropriately shifting only the disk's inner radius. We employ some of the most efficient pseudo-Newtonian potentials around Kerr black holes and derive two generalized disk temperature profiles, thus incorporating the spin's contribution to the thermal spectra. Then, we associate the observed radiative efficiency with the emission pattern featuring all the relativistic effects included in the kerrbb model, obtaining an expression about the modified inner radius of the disk. Moreover, we apply this method to Cygnus X-1 by fitting the observational data obtained during its high/soft and hard/low spectral states. The fully relativistic spectra are reproduced to a very good approximation with an error margin of 0.03-4%. The disk is parameterized by a modified innermost radius within the range of $(0.2-2)R_{ISCO}$, depending on the source's viewing angle and black hole spin. Relativistic effects near the black hole make an otherwise standard accretion disk with inclination $\theta &lt;60^{\circ}$ seem truncated to larger radii to a distant observer. On the other hand, an edge-on view of the disk gives the perspective of being pulled closer to the central object than the respective ISCO radius. In addition, we show that the observational data of Cygnus X-1 can be satisfactorily fitted by employing a reasonably simple lepto-hadronic jet model and a hybrid thermal/non-thermal corona along with the Kerr-adjusted standard accretion disk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2408.04833v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct several solutions of effective actions for string theories beyond the supergravity approximation utilizing the framework of the Double Field Theory (DFT). The DFT effective actions, which are well suited for accommodating abelian and non-abelian T dualities, are naturally written in terms of modified connections and curvatures with torsion. We construct the most general solutions with vanishing modified torsion, and such geometries don't receive quantum corrections. We also compute the leading $\alpha'$ corrections to several supergravity solutions, including a pair of geometries related by a non-abelian T duality.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb R)$ Yang-Mills theory is three-dimensional gravity with background sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14228</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14228v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Chern-Simons theory with certain gauge groups is known to be equivalent to a first-order formulation of three-dimensional Einstein gravity with a cosmological constant, where both are purely topological. Here, we extend this correspondence to theories with dynamical degrees of freedom. We show that three-dimensional Yang-Mills theory with gauge group $\operatorname{SL}(2,\mathbb R)$ is equivalent to the first-order formulation of three-dimensional Einstein gravity with no cosmological constant coupled to a background stress-energy tensor density (which breaks the diffeomorphism symmetry). The local degree of freedom of three-dimensional Yang-Mills theory corresponds to degenerate "gravitational waves" in which the metric is degenerate and the spin connection is no longer completely determined by the metric. Turning on a cosmological constant produces the third-way (for $\Lambda&lt;0$) or the imaginary third-way (for $\Lambda&gt;0$) gauge theories with a background stress-energy tensor density.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Machine Learning Models for Supernova Gravitational Wave Signal Classification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.14508v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the potential of using gravitational wave (GW) signals from rotating core-collapse supernovae to probe the equation of state (EOS) of nuclear matter. By generating GW signals from simulations with various EOSs, we train machine learning models to classify them and evaluate their performance. Our study builds on previous work by examining how different machine learning models, parameters, and data preprocessing techniques impact classification accuracy. We test convolutional and recurrent neural networks, as well as six classical algorithms: random forest, support vector machines, na\"{i}ve Bayes, logistic regression, $k$-nearest neighbors, and eXtreme gradient boosting. All models, except na\"{i}ve Bayes, achieve over 90 per cent accuracy on our dataset. Additionally, we assess the impact of approximating the GW signal using the general relativistic effective potential (GREP) on EOS classification. We find that models trained on GREP data exhibit low classification accuracy. However, normalizing time by the peak signal frequency, which partially compensates for the absence of the time dilation effect in GREP, leads to a notable improvement in accuracy. Despite this, the accuracy does not exceed 70 per cent, suggesting that GREP lacks the precision necessary for EOS classification. Finally, our study has several limitations, including the omission of detector noise and the focus on a single progenitor mass model, which will be addressed in future works.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial black holes from $N_{\text{eff}}$ : scalar induced gravitational waves as an extra radiation component</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10111</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10111v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In June 2023, multiple pulsar timing array collaborations provided evidence for the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background. Scalar induced gravitational waves (SIGWs), as one of the most likely sources of stochastic gravitational waves, have received widespread attention. When primordial curvature perturbations on small scales are sufficiently large, \acp{PBH} inevitably form, concurrently producing SIGWs with significant observable effects. These SIGWs can serve as an additional radiation component, influencing the relativistic degrees of freedom $N_{\text{eff}}$. Taking into account primordial non-Gaussianity, we study the energy density spectrum of SIGWs up to the third order and use the current observational data of $N_{\text{eff}}$ to constrain small-scale primordial curvature perturbations and the abundance of \acp{PBH}.</description>

      <title>On a Rigidity Result in Positive Scalar Curvature Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.23406v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: I prove a scalar curvature rigidity theorem for spheres. In particular, I prove that geodesic balls of radii strictly less than $\frac{\pi}{2}$ in $n+1~(n\geq 2)$ dimensional unit sphere are rigid under smooth perturbations that increase scalar curvature preserving the intrinsic geometry and the mean curvature of the boundary, and such rigidity result fails for the hemisphere. The proof of this assertion requires the notion of a real Killing connection and solution of the boundary value problem associated with its Dirac operator. The result serves as the sharpest refinement of the now-disproven Min-Oo conjecture.</description>

      <title>Black Holes and Baryon Number Violation: Unveiling the Origins of Early Galaxies and the Low-Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10847</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10847v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose that modifications to the Higgs potential within a narrow atmospheric layer near the event horizon of an astrophysical black hole could significantly enhance the rate of sphaleron transitions, as well as transform the Chern-Simons number into a dynamic variable. As a result, sphaleron transitions in this region occur without suppression, in contrast to low-temperature conditions, and each transition may generate a substantially greater baryon number than would be produced by winding around the Higgs potential in Minkowski spacetime. This effect amplifies baryon number violation near the black hole horizon, potentially leading to a considerable generation of matter. Given the possibility of a departure from equilibrium during the absorption of matter and the formation of relativistic jets in supermassive black holes, we conjecture that this process could contribute to the creation of a significant amount of matter around such black holes. This phenomenon may offer an alternative explanation for the rapid growth of supermassive black holes and their surrounding galaxies in the early Universe, as suggested by recent observations from the JWST. Furthermore, this mechanism may provide insights into the low-mass gap puzzle, addressing the observed scarcity of black holes with masses near the Oppenheimer-Volkoff limit.</description>

      <title>Outer Solar System spacecraft without drag-free control to probe the $\mu$Hz gravitational wave frontier</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15072</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.15072v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The microhertz frequency band of gravitational waves probes the merger of supermassive black holes as well as many other gravitational wave phenomena. However, space-interferometry methods that use test masses would require substantial development of test-mass isolation systems to detect anticipated astrophysical events. We propose an approach that avoids inertial test masses by situating spacecraft in the low-acceleration environment of the outer Solar System. We show that for Earth-spacecraft and inter-spacecraft distances of $\gtrsim 10$ AU, the accelerations on the spacecraft would be sufficiently small to potentially achieve sensitivities determined by stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds. We further argue, for arm lengths of $10-30$ AU and $10$ Watt transmissions, that stable phase locks should be achievable with 20 cm mirrors or 5 m radio dishes. We discuss designs that send both laser beams and radio waves between the spacecraft, finding that despite the $\sim10^4\times$ longer wavelengths, even a design with radio transmissions could reach stochastic background-limited sensitivities at $\lesssim 0.3\times 10^{-4}$ Hz. Operating in the radio significantly reduces many spacecraft design tolerances. Our baseline concept requires two arms to do interferometry. However, if one spacecraft carries a clock with Allan deviations at $10^4$ seconds of $10^{-17}$, a comparable sensitivity could be achieved with a single arm. Finally, we discuss the feasibility of achieving similar gravitational wave sensitivities in a `Doppler tracking' configuration where the single arm is anchored to Earth.</description>
