      <title>Nonlinear quantum evolution of a dissipative superconducting qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unitary and dissipative models of quantum dynamics are linear maps on the space of states or density matrices. This linearity encodes the superposition principle, a key feature of quantum theory. However, this principle can break down in effective non-Hermitian dynamics arising from postselected quantum evolution. We theoretically characterize and experimentally investigate this breakdown in a dissipative superconducting transmon circuit. Within the circuit's three-level manifold, no-jump postselection generates an effective non-Hermitian Hamiltonian governing the excited two-level subspace and an anti-Hermitian nonlinearity. We prepare different initial states and use quantum state tomography to track their evolution under this effective, nonlinear Hamiltonian. By comparing the evolution of a superposition-state to a superposition of individually-evolved basis states, we test linearity and observe clear violations which we quantify across the exceptional-point (EP) degeneracy of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian. We extend the analysis to density matrices, revealing a breakdown in linearity for the two-level subspace while demonstrating that linearity is preserved in the full three-level system. These results provide direct evidence of nonlinearity in non-Hermitian quantum evolution, highlighting unique features that are absent in classical non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Heuristic Quantum Advantage with Peaked Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25838</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25838v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We design and demonstrate heuristic quantum advantage with peaked circuits (HQAP circuits) on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum processor. Through extensive experimentation with state-of-the-art classical simulation strategies, we identify a clear gap between classical and quantum runtimes. Our largest instance involves all-to-all connectivity with 2000 two-qubit gates, which H2 can produce the target peaked bitstring directly in under 2 hours. Our extrapolations from leading classical simulation techniques such as tensor networks with belief propagation and Pauli path simulators indicate the same instance would take years on exascale systems (Frontier, Summit), suggesting a potentially exponential separation. This work marks an important milestone toward verifiable quantum advantage, as well as providing a useful benchmarking protocol for current utility-scale quantum hardware. We sketch our protocol for designing these circuits and provide extensive numerical results leading to our extrapolation estimates. Separate from our constructed HQAP circuits, we prove hardness on a decision problem involving generic peaked circuits. When both the input and output bitstrings of a peaked circuit are unknown, determining whether the circuit is peaked constitutes a QCMA-complete problem, meaning the problem remains hard even for a quantum polynomial-time machine under commonly accepted complexity assumptions. Inspired by this observation, we propose an application of the peaked circuits as a potentially quantum-safe encryption scheme~\cite{chen2016report,kumar2020post,joseph2022transitioning,dam2023survey}. We make our peaked circuits publicly available and invite the community to try additional methods to solve these circuits to see if this gap persists even with novel classical techniques.</description>

      <title>Establishing Baselines for Photonic Quantum Machine Learning: Insights from an Open, Collaborative Initiative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25839v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Perceval Challenge is an open, reproducible benchmark designed to assess the potential of photonic quantum computing for machine learning. Focusing on a reduced and hardware-feasible version of the MNIST digit classification task or near-term photonic processors, it offers a concrete framework to evaluate how photonic quantum circuits learn and generalize from limited data. Conducted over more than three months, the challenge attracted 64 teams worldwide in its first phase. After an initial selection, 11 finalist teams were granted access to GPU resources for large-scale simulation and photonic hardware execution through cloud service. The results establish the first unified baseline of photonic machine-learning performance, revealing complementary strengths between variational, hardware-native, and hybrid approaches. This challenge also underscores the importance of open, reproducible experimentation and interdisciplinary collaboration, highlighting how shared benchmarks can accelerate progress in quantum-enhanced learning. All implementations are publicly available in a single shared repository (https://github.com/Quandela/HybridAIQuantum-Challenge), supporting transparent benchmarking and cumulative research. Beyond this specific task, the Perceval Challenge illustrates how systematic, collaborative experimentation can map the current landscape of photonic quantum machine learning and pave the way toward hybrid, quantum-augmented AI workflows.</description>

      <title>GHZ-Preserving Gates and Optimized Distillation Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25854v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) states play a central role in quantum computing and communication protocols, as a typical multipartite entanglement resource. This work introduces an efficient enumeration and simulation method for circuits that preserve and distill noisy GHZ states, significantly reducing the simulation complexity of a gate on $n$ qubits, from exponential $O(2^n)$ for standard state-vector methods or $O(n)$ for Clifford circuits, to a constant $O(1)$ for the method presented here. This method has profound implications for the design of quantum networks, where preservation and purification of entanglement with minimal resource overhead is critical. In particular, we demonstrate the use of the new method in an optimization procedure enabled by the fast simulation, that discovers GHZ distillation circuits far outperforming the state of the art. Fine-tuning to arbitrary noise models is possible as well. We also show that the method naturally extends to graph states that are local Clifford equivalent to GHZ states.</description>

      <title>Optimal Displacement Sensing with Spin-Dependent Squeezed States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25870</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25870v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Displacement sensing is a fundamental task in metrology. However, the development of quantum-enhanced sensors that fully utilize the available degrees of freedom in many-body quantum systems remains an outstanding challenge. We propose novel many-body displacement sensing schemes that use spin-dependent squeezed (SDS) states -- hybrid spin-boson states whose bosonic squeezed quadrature is conditioned on an auxiliary spin. We prove that SDS states are \emph{optimal}, i.e. their quantum Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound saturates the Heisenberg limit. We propose explicit measurement sequences that can be readily implemented in systems such as trapped ions. We also introduce a scalable state-preparation protocol and numerically demonstrate the preparation of $8.7$~dB of spin-dependent squeezing $15$ times faster than the standard approach using second-order sidebands in trapped ions. The potential applications of our sensing protocols range from measuring single-photon scattering to searches for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Control of memory effects in a spin-boson system by periodic driving</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25875</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25875v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the emergence of quantum memory effects in a spin-boson system at finite temperature driven by an external time-periodic force. Quantifying memory effects by the trace-distance based measure for non-Markovianity and performing numerical simulations employing the hierarchical equations of motion approach, we find a pronounced peak structure when plotting the non-Markovianity measure as a function of the driving amplitude. This distinctive feature is interpreted using Floquet theory and the Floquet-Lindblad master equation, associating the peaks with the degeneracies of the quasienergy spectrum which lead to a strong enhancement of the relaxation times of the system. These results suggest strategies for the efficient control of non-Markovianity in open quantum systems by periodic driving.</description>

      <title>From Divergent Series to Geometry: Resurgence of the Quantum Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25907v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze perturbative expansions of the quantum metric tensor (QMT) in anharmonic oscillators, focusing on quartic, sextic, and $d$-dimensional models. Using high-order perturbation theory, we show that the divergent QMT series exhibit factorial growth. Our analysis identifies universal non-perturbative scales, with coefficients displaying large-order behavior consistent with resurgence theory. Then, we apply resurgence and Borel--Pad\'e resummation to the QMT. Comparisons with exact diagonalization confirm that Borel--Pad\'e resummations yield accurate results, especially for the ground state. For completeness, we also present the analysis of the energy eigenvalues in the examples. Our findings extend resurgent techniques from energies to the QMT, highlighting the interplay between quantum geometry and non-perturbative physics.</description>

      <title>Double categories for adaptive quantum computation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25915v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computation can be formulated through various models, each highlighting distinct structural and resource-theoretic aspects of quantum computational power. This paper develops a unified categorical framework that encompasses these models and their interrelations using the language of double categories. We introduce double port graphs, a bidirectional generalization of port graphs, to represent the quantum (horizontal) and classical (vertical) flows of information within computational architectures. Quantum op- erations are described as adaptive instruments, organized into a one-object double category whose horizontal and vertical directions correspond to quantum channels and stochastic maps, respectively. Within this setting, we capture prominent adaptive quantum compu- tation models, including measurement-based and magic-state models. To analyze compu- tational power, we extend the theory of contextuality to an adaptive setting through the notion of simplicial instruments, which generalize simplicial distributions to double cat- egorical form. This construction yields a quantitative characterization of computational power in terms of contextual fraction, leading to a categorical formulation of the result that non-contextual resources can compute only affine Boolean functions. The frame- work thus offers a new perspective on the interplay between adaptivity, contextuality, and computational power in quantum computational models.</description>

      <title>Enabling Fast and Accurate Neutral Atom Readout through Image Denoising</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neutral atom quantum computers hold promise for scaling up to hundreds of thousands of qubits, but their progress is constrained by slow qubit readout. Measuring qubits currently takes milliseconds-much longer than the underlying quantum gate operations-making readout the primary bottleneck in deploying quantum error correction. Because each round of QEC depends on measurement, long readout times increase cycle duration and slow down program execution. Reducing the readout duration speeds up cycles and reduces decoherence errors that accumulate while qubits idle, but it also lowers the number of collected photons, making measurements noisier and more error-prone. This tradeoff leaves neutral atom systems stuck between slow but accurate readout and fast but unreliable readout.
  We show that image denoising can resolve this tension. Our framework, GANDALF, uses explicit denoising using image translation to reconstruct clear signals from short, low-photon measurements, enabling reliable classification at up to 1.6x shorter readout times. Combined with lightweight classifiers and a pipelined readout design, our approach both reduces logical error rate by up to 35x and overall QEC cycle time up to 1.77x compared to state-of-the-art CNN-based readout for Cesium (Cs) Neutral Atom arrays.</description>

      <title>Overcoming disorder in superconducting globally-driven quantum computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25996</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25996v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the impact of static disorder on a globally-controlled superconducting quantum computing architecture based on a quasi-two-dimensional ladder geometry [R. Menta et al., Phys. Rev. Research 7, L012065 (2025)]. Specifically, we examine how fabrication-induced inhomogeneities in qubit resonant frequencies and coupling strengths affect quantum state propagation and the fidelity of fundamental quantum operations. Using numerical simulations, we quantify the degradation in performance due to disorder and identify single-qubit rotations, two-qubit entangling gates, and quantum information transport as particularly susceptible. To address this challenge, we rely on pulse optimization schemes, and, in particular, on the GRAPE (Gradient Ascent Pulse Engineering) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that, even for realistic levels of disorder, optimized pulse sequences can achieve high-fidelity operations, exceeding 99.9% for the three quantum operations, restoring reliable universal quantum logic and robust information flow. These findings highlight pulse optimization as a powerful strategy to enhance the resilience to disorder of solid-state globally-driven quantum computing platforms.</description>

      <title>In situ quantum verification of polarization-stabilized optical channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26034v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The active stabilization of polarization channels is a task of growing importance as quantum networks move to deployed demonstrations over existing fiber infrastructure. However, the uniquely strict requirements for high-fidelity qubit transmission complicate the extent to which classical solutions may apply to future quantum networks, particularly in terms of recognizing noise sources present in low-flux, nonunitary channels. Here we introduce a novel in situ benchmarking approach that augments a classical polarization tracking system, limited to unitary correction, with simultaneously transmitted quantum light for ancilla-assisted process tomography of the full quantum map. Implemented in a local-area quantum network, our method uses the reconstructed map both to validate the classical compensation and to expose noise sources it fails to capture. A sliding measurement window that continuously updates the estimated quantum process further increases sensitivity to rapid channel fluctuations. Our results should unlock new opportunities for in situ channel characterization in quantum-classical coexistence networks.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We evaluate strategies for reducing the run time of fault-tolerant quantum computations, targeting practical utility in scientific or industrial workflows. Delivering a technology with broad impact requires scaling devices, while also maintaining acceptable run times for computations. Optimizing logical clock speed may require moving beyond current strategies, and adopting methods that trade faster run time for increased qubit counts or engineering complexity. We discuss how the co-design of hardware, fault tolerance, and algorithmic subroutines can reduce run times. We illustrate a selection of these topics with resource estimates for simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model.</description>

      <title>Modeling of simple bandpass filters: bandwidth broadening of Josephson parametric devices due to non-Markovian coupling to dressed transmission-line modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Josephson parametric devices are widely used in superconducting quantum computing research but suffer from an inherent gain-bandwidth trade-off. This limitation is partly overcome by coupling the device to its input/output transmission line via a bandpass filter, leading to wider bandwidth at undiminished gain. Here we perform a non-perturbative circuit analysis in terms of dressed transmission-line modes for representative resonant coupling circuits, going beyond the weak-coupling treatment. The strong frequency dependence of the resulting coupling coefficients implies that the Markov approximation commonly employed in cQED analysis is inadequate. By retaining the full frequency dependence of the coupling, we arrive at a non-Markovian form of the quantum Langevin equation with the frequency-dependent complex-valued self-energy of the coupling in place of a single damping parameter. We also consistently generalize the input-output relations and unitarity conditions. Using the exact self-energies of elementary filter networks -- a series- and parallel-LC circuit and a simple representative bandpass filter consisting of their combination -- we calculate the generalized parametric gain factors. Compared with their Markovian counterpart, these gain profiles are strongly modified. We find bandwidth broadening not only in the established parameter regime, where the self-energy of the coupling is in resonance with the device and its real part has unity slope, but also within off-resonant parameter regimes where the real part of the self-energy is large. Our results offer insight for the bandwidth engineering of Josephson parametric devices using simple coupling networks.</description>

      <title>Stesso: A reconfigurable decomposition of $n$-bit Toffoli gates using symmetrical logical structures and adjustable support qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gate is mainly utilized to construct other quantum gates and operators, such as Fredkin gates, arithmetical adders, and logical comparators, where $n \geq 2$. Several researchers introduced different methods to decompose $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates in a quantum circuit into a set of standard 3-bit Toffoli gates or a set of elementary quantum gates, such as single-qubit and two-qubit gates. However, these methods are not effectively reconfigurable for linearly connected symmetrical structures (layouts) of contemporary quantum computers, usually utilizing more ancilla qubits. This paper introduces a new structural design method to effectively decompose $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates by utilizing configurable ancilla qubits, which we named the ``support qubits". Collectively, we call our decomposition method for symmetrical structures using support qubits the ``step-decreasing structures shaped operators (Stesso)". The main advantage of Stesso is to configurable construct different decomposed operators of various polarities and intermediate sub-circuits, such as Positive Polarity-Stesso, Mixed Polarity-Stesso, and Generalized-Stesso. With Stesso, it has been experimentally proven that $(n+1)$-bit Toffoli gates always have lower quantum costs than using conventional composition methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum-coherent nonlinear interferometry using electron-phonon systems for entanglement-assisted terahertz sensing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a theoretical framework for quantum-coherent nonlinear interferometry in which the nonlinear medium is modeled as active electron-phonon quantum systems rather than a passive $\chi^{(2)}$ converter. By explicitly retaining the quantum coherence of the coupled electron-phonon-photon dynamics, our model describes a two-stage buildup of entanglement - first between signal and idler photons and subsequently between idler photons mediated by material coherence. This coherent light-matter interaction imprints the internal dynamics of the medium onto the interferometer output, yielding phase-sensitive interference that enables indirect readout of terahertz-band signal modes via near-infrared detection. The results reveal a route toward entanglement-assisted terahertz sensing and establish a general framework for treating nonlinear quantum media as active components in interferometric architectures.</description>

      <title>Practical hybrid decoding scheme for parity-encoded spin systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a practical hybrid decoding scheme for the parity-encoding architecture. This architecture was first introduced by N. Sourlas as a computational technique for tackling hard optimization problems, especially those modeled by spin systems such as the Ising model and spin glasses, and reinvented by W. Lechner, P. Hauke, and P. Zoller to develop quantum annealing devices. We study the specific model, called the SLHZ model, aiming to achieve a near-term quantum annealing device implemented solely through geometrically local spin interactions. Taking account of the close connection between the SLHZ model and a classical low-density-parity-check code, two approaches can be chosen for the decoding: (1) finding the ground state of a spin Hamiltonian derived from the SLHZ model, which can be achieved via stochastic decoders such as quantum annealing or classical Monte Carlo samplers; (2) using deterministic decoding techniques for the classical LDPC code, such as belief propagation and bit-flip decoder. The proposed hybrid approach combines the two approaches by applying bit-flip decoding to the readout of the stochastic decoder based on the SLHZ model. We present simulations demonstrating that this approach can reveal the latent potential of the SLHZ model, realizing soft-annealing concept proposed by Sourlas.</description>

      <title>Single-Light-Pulse Driven Compact Atom Interferometry with Measurement Induced Large Momentum Transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a fundamentally new design strategy of light-pulsed atom interferometry (LPAI) with a single atomic beam splitter. A traditional $\pi/2$-pulse Raman beam is employed to render a small momentum transfer at the initial state. After a short period of evolution during which physical relevant information can be loaded, a quantum weak measurement is applied to the internal state of the atoms. The final information will be detected from the transmission spectrum of a probe light to obviate the measurement of florescence signal. An effective amplification of the order of $10^3$ about the momentum offset is achieved in our simulation employing $Cs$ atoms with current experimental condition. Our proposal offers a cost-effective, high-accuracy measurement and readout strategy for LPAI. Furthermore, the strategy makes the physical setup much simpler and more compact offering new direction towards portable sensitive LPAI.</description>

      <title>Limitation of Quantum Walk Approach to the Maximum Matching Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26246</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26246v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Maximum Matching problem has a quantum query complexity lower bound of $\Omega(n^{3/2})$ for graphs on $n$ vertices represented by an adjacency matrix. The current best quantum algorithm has the query complexity $O(n^{7/4})$, which is an improvement over the trivial bound $O(n^2)$. Constructing a quantum algorithm for this problem with a query complexity improving the upper bound $O(n^{7/4})$ is an open problem. The quantum walk technique is a general framework for constructing quantum algorithms by transforming a classical random walk search into a quantum search, and has been successfully applied to constructing an algorithm with a tight query complexity for another problem. In this work we show that the quantum walk technique fails to produce a fast algorithm improving the known (or even the trivial) upper bound on the query complexity. Specifically, if a quantum walk algorithm designed with the known technique solves the Maximum Matching problem using $O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ queries with any constant $\epsilon&gt;0$, and if the underlying classical random walk is independent of an input graph, then the guaranteed time complexity is larger than any polynomial of $n$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26255v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Piani and Watrous [Phys. Rev. Lett.102, 250501 (2009)] proved that all entangled states are useful for discrimination of quantum channels. We pose the same question in the context of antidiscrimination of quantum channels. We partially answer this by showing that for every $d\otimes d$ entangled state (with even $d$), there exist three projective measurements which are antidiscriminable (but not discriminable) with that input state but those three measurements are not antidiscriminable with the product probe.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Superactivation in Multiphoton Distillation Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26290v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In quantum networks, after passing through noisy channels or information processing, residual states may lack sufficient entanglement for further tasks, yet they may retain hidden quantum resources that can be recycled. Efficiently recycling these states to extract entanglement resources such as genuine multipartite entanglement or Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pairs is essential for optimizing network performance. Here, we develop a tripartite entanglement distillation scheme using an eight-photon quantum platform, demonstrating entanglement superactivation phenomena which are unique to multipartite systems. We successfully generate a three-photon genuinely entangled state from two bi-separable states via local operations and classical communication, demonstrating superactivation of genuine multipartite entanglement. Furthermore, we extend our scheme to generate a three-photon state capable of extracting an Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen pair from two initial states lacking this capability, revealing a previously unobserved entanglement superactivation phenomenon. Our methods and findings offer not only practical applications for quantum networks, but also lead to a deeper understanding of multipartite entanglement structures.</description>

      <title>Quantum predator-prey cycles in dissipative Rydberg lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26295v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Lotka-Volterra model is a paradigm for self-organized predator-prey oscillations in far-from-equilibrium systems, yet testing it in real-world ecosystems is hindered by uncontrollable microscopic parameters. Here, we propose a quantum analogue of predator-prey dynamics using a tunable two-dimensional Rydberg atom array. Through mean-field analysis and numerical simulations based on the open-system discrete truncated Wigner approximation, we demonstrate that Rydberg excitations exhibit predator-prey cycles on microsecond timescales. We show that quantum coherence drives spontaneous symmetry breaking, while long-range interactions stabilize global oscillations against quantum-noise-induced desynchronization. We further reveal that quantum jump induce quasicycles whose amplitude scales inversely with the square root of the system size. Our work extends the study of predator-prey models to the quantum realm and advances quantum simulation stratagies that leverage engineered many-body nonequilibrium effects.</description>

      <title>Fermionic dynamics on a trapped-ion quantum computer beyond exact classical simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulation of the time-dynamics of fermionic many-body systems has long been predicted to be one of the key applications of quantum computers. Such simulations -- for which classical methods are often inaccurate -- are critical to advancing our knowledge and understanding of quantum chemistry and materials, underpinning a wide range of fields, from biochemistry to clean-energy technologies and chemical synthesis. However, the performance of all previous digital quantum simulations has been matched by classical methods, and it has thus far remained unclear whether near-term, intermediate-scale quantum hardware could offer any computational advantage in this area. Here, we implement an efficient quantum simulation algorithm on Quantinuum's System Model H2 trapped-ion quantum computer for the time dynamics of a 56-qubit system that is too complex for exact classical simulation. We focus on the periodic spinful 2D Fermi-Hubbard model and present evidence of spin-charge separation, where the elementary electron's charge and spin decouple. In the limited cases where ground truth is available through exact classical simulation, we find that it agrees with the results we obtain from the quantum device. Employing long-range Wilson operators to study deconfinement of the effective gauge field between spinons and the effective potential between charge carriers, we find behaviour that differs from predictions made by classical tensor network methods. Our results herald the use of quantum computing for simulating strongly correlated electronic systems beyond the capacity of classical computing.</description>

      <title>Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution: Protocols, Security, and Open Problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26320</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26320v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Twin-Field Quantum Key Distribution (TF-QKD) has emerged as a potential protocol for long distance secure communication, overcoming the rate-distance limitations of conventional quantum key distribution without requiring trusted repeaters. By having two parties transmit phase encoded weak coherent pulses (WCP) to an untrusted central node, the TF-QKD exploits single-photon interference to achieve secret key rates scaling as square-root of channel length, enabling quantum-secured communication over unprecedented distances. This survey provides a comprehensive survey of TF-QKD, covering the original protocol, its fundamental principles, and key-rate derivation. We discuss major TF-QKD variants, including Phase-Matching QKD and Sending-or-Not-Sending QKD, with various improved versions. We compare their performance, implementation trade-offs, protocol-specific vulnerabilities, and countermeasures. The survey summarizes security proofs ranging from asymptotic decoy-state analyses to finite-key composable frameworks, experimental milestones, technological enablers, and practical deployment challenges. Finally, we outline open problems in the field and present a roadmap for integrating TF-QKD into scalable quantum networks, underscoring its central role in the future quantum internet.</description>

      <title>Benchmarking quantum key distribution by mixing single photons and laser light</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26337v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum key distribution is a key application of quantum mechanics, shaping the future of privacy and secure communications. Many protocols require single photons, often approximated by strongly attenuated laser pulses. Here, we harness the emission of a quantum dot embedded in a micropillar and explore a hybrid approach where the information is encoded on a mixture of single photons and laser pulses. We derive a phenomenological analysis of the configuration where both sources of light are mixed incoherently to perform the BB84 protocol, showing nearly perfect matching between theory and experiment. This provides a flexible technology compensating limited collected brightnesses of single-photon sources as well as a thorough investigation of single-photon statistics advantage scenarios over Poisson-distributed statistics. Explicitly, our model highlights an efficiency threshold for unconditional advantage of single photons over laser along with insights on the interplay between single-photon purity and collected brightness in the performances of BB84.</description>

Abstract: Using the formalism of Maya diagrams and ladder operators, we describe the algebra of annihilating operators for the class of rational extensions of the harmonic oscillator. This allows us to construct the corresponding coherent state in the sense of Barut and Girardello. The resulting time-dependent function is an exact solution of the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation and a joint eigenfunction of the algebra of annihilators. Using an argument based on Schur functions, we also show that the newly exhibited coherent states asymptotically minimize position-momentum uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Quantum Nonlocality under Latency Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26349v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bell inequality violation is the phenomenon where multiple non-communicating parties can exhibit correlations using quantum resources that are impossible if they can only use classical resources. One way to enforce non-communication is to apply a latency constraint: the parties must all produce outputs after they receive their inputs within a time window shorter than the speed of light delay between any pair of parties. If this latency constraint is relaxed so that a subset of the parties can communicate, we can obtain a new set of inequalities on correlations that extends Bell inequalities in a very natural way. Moreover, with this relaxed latency constraint, we can also have quantum communication between a subset of parties and thereby achieve possible quantum violations of these new inequalities. We ultimately wish to answer the fundamental question: "What are the physically realizable correlations between multiple parties under varying latency constraints?" To answer this question, we introduce latency-constrained games, a mathematical framework that extends nonlocal games to the setting where a subset of parties can communicate. The notion of latency-constrained games can have real-world applications, including high frequency trading, distributed computing, computer architecture, and distributed control systems.</description>

      <title>Quantum dynamics of large spins in static and rotating magnetic fields: Entanglement resonances and kinks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26351v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the quantum dynamics of a large spin in the presence of static and rotating magnetic fields. By mapping the system onto a gas of non-interacting spin-1/2 particles, we derive exact analytical results for the dynamics with different initial states. The dynamics exhibit periodic oscillations between two maximally stretched states, irrespective of how large the spin is. Further, we observe periodic transitions between sublevels with magnetic quantum numbers of opposite signs. Additionally, the dynamics features the periodic transfer of the spin to the maximally stretched state starting from a superposition state. The evolution of the dipole moment is also explored in each case, and as expected, it is precessing about the instantaneous, resultant magnetic field. Furthermore, we extend our analysis to a pair of spins, taking into account the dipole-dipole interactions between them. We analyze how the ground state entanglement between the spins depends on the external fields. The quantum dynamics of the two spins reveal entanglement resonances and kinks, which can be identified from the energy spectrum when weak transverse field strengths are considered. Finally, we discuss the regime in which the dipolar interactions are relatively weak.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26373v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum batteries (QBs) exploit collective quantum resources to surpass the limits of classical energy storage and power delivery. We analyze $N$-qubit cavity-coupled QBs governed by Dicke and Tavis--Cummings models under Gaussian driving and open-system dynamics. Finite-size scaling laws $\mathcal{O}(N)\!\sim\!N^{\alpha}$ demonstrate an optimal region of relaxation and dephasing where coherent driving stabilizes entanglement entropy growth for thermodynamic observables (maximum energy $E_{\mathrm{max}}$, charging time $\tau$, and maximum power $\bar{P}_{\mathrm{max}}$) and for qubit and cavity entanglement entropies. The Dicke model exhibits entropy-suppressed extensive behavior, while the Tavis--Cummings model achieves super-extensive scaling with $\alpha_{E_{\mathrm{max}}}\!\in\![1.08,1.26]$, $\alpha_{\tau}\!\approx\!-0.49$, $\alpha_{\bar{P}_{\mathrm{max}}}\!\in\![1.57,1.73]$, supported by qubit-cavity entanglement. We demonstrate that dissipation can act as a stabilizer source, yielding scaling benchmarks that are relevant to several experimental platforms. Our findings connect entanglement, dissipation-enhanced scaling laws and superabsorption, outlining a pathway towards scalable quantum batteries offering practical quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the reachability of variational quantum algorithms via input-state design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) face an inherent trade-off between expressivity and trainability: deeper circuits can represent richer states but suffer from noise accumulation and barren plateaus, while shallow circuits remain trainable and implementable but lack expressive power. Here, we propose a general framework to address this challenge by enhancing the VQA performance with a specially designed input state constructed using a linear combination technique. This approach systematically modified the set of states reachable by the original circuit, enhancing accuracy while preserving efficiency. We provide a rigorous proof that such framework increases the expressive capacity of any given VQA ansatz, and demonstrate its broad applicability across different ansatz families. As applications, we apply the method to ground-state preparation of the transverse-field Ising, cluster-Ising, and Fermi-Hubbard models, achieving consistently higher accuracy under the same gate budget compared with standard VQAs. These results highlight input-state design as a powerful complement to circuit design in realizing VQAs that are both expressive and trainable.</description>

      <title>Quadratic Quantum Speedup for Finding Independent Set of a Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26395v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A quadratic speedup of the quantum adiabatic algorithm (QAA) for finding independent sets (ISs) in a graph is proven analytically. In comparison to the best classical algorithm with $O(n^2)$ scaling, where $n$ is the number of vertexes, our quantum algorithm achieves a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ for finding a large IS, which reduces to $O(n)$ for identifying a size-2 IS. The complexity bounds we obtain are confirmed numerically for a specific case with the $O(n^2)$ quantum algorithm outperforming the classical greedy algorithm, that also runs in $O(n^2)$. The definitive analytical and numerical evidence for the quadratic quantum speedup benefited from an analytical framework based on the Magnus expansion in the interaction picture (MEIP), which overcomes the dependence on the ground state degeneracy encountered in conventional energy gap analysis. In addition, our analysis links the performance of QAA to the spectral structure of the median graph, bridging algorithmic complexity, graph theory, and experimentally realizable Rydberg Hamiltonians. The understanding gained provides practical guidance for optimizing near-term Rydberg atom experiments by revealing the significant impact of detuning on blockade violations.</description>

      <title>Engineered Kerr Nonlinearities for Precise Quantum Control of Fock States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26399</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26399v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a practical design framework for high-fidelity quantum control in coupled Kerr-nonlinear oscillators, directly addressing the challenge of spectral crowding. We show that systematic spectral degeneracies, which hinder selective addressing, are a direct consequence of rational Kerr-nonlinearity ratios ($K_1/K_2$). Our solution is a universal architectural principle: engineer this ratio to be a complex rational value, approximating an incommensurate number to systematically eliminate parasitic resonances. Using a Magnus expansion, we derive a complete effective Hamiltonian, including all Stark-shift corrections, to accurately target transitions. We numerically validate this framework by demonstrating protocols for the deterministic synthesis of NOON states, and high-photon-number Fock states (e.g., $n=4$), achieving ideal fidelities exceeding $\mathcal{F}&gt;99.9\%$. The protocols are shown to be robust against environmental decay and thermal effects. This work provides an architectural blueprint for bosonic processors in circuit QED and establishes foundational principles that could inform future designs of multi-mode quantum systems.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Feynman path integral formalism has inspired the development of memory-efficient and parallelizable classical algorithms for simulating quantum computers. We adapt this approach for the calculation of probability amplitudes of linear-optical boson sampling experiments, which involve Fock-state inputs, linear optical circuits, and photo-detection at the output. We describe this simulation method and compare it with alternative approaches. Additionally, we implement a Linear-Optical Feynman Path simulator in open-source C code, enhancing its performance using tensor contraction techniques. Our method is benchmarked for low-depth linear optical circuits, where it offers advantages in runtime and memory efficiency.</description>

      <title>Generation and detection of squeezed states via a synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26414v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A synchronously pumped optical parametric oscillator (SPOPO) operating at 93 MHz is used to generate squeezed states at 1035 nm. The system features a counter-propagating beam at the same wavelength as the quantum state, which simultaneously actively stabilizes the cavity and, after transmission, acts as the local oscillator for homodyne detection. By deriving the local oscillator directly from the SPOPO cavity, the setup establishes an intrinsically excellent spatial mode overlap and high interference visibility, forming a distinctive self-referenced architecture. Two spatial light modulators enable precise spectral shaping of both the pump and the local oscillator in amplitude and phase, allowing investigation of the spectral properties of the generated states. The versatility of the setup further allows exploration of different SPOPO configurations, including regimes with varied finesse and escape efficiency. Representative measurements, including homodyne traces and squeezing levels as functions of pump power and local oscillator bandwidth, demonstrate the performance of the system. Theoretical simulations based on a multimode singular-value-decomposition model reproduce well the measured dependence of squeezing on pump power and LO bandwidth, confirming the accuracy of the description and the robustness of the setup. Measured squeezing levels up to -3.3 dB are achieved, corresponding to -5.7 dB at SPOPO output, evidencing the robustness and versatility of this platform for stable pulsed squeezed-light generation and advanced quantum optical applications.</description>

      <title>Quantum Random Number Generator with Internal Consistency Check and Public Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum Random Number Generators provide true physical randomness based on quantum processes, essential for cryptographic and scientific applications. However, practical implementations face challenges in robustness and verifiability: ensuring that the entropy source remains secure and stable over time, and enabling independent confirmation of randomness quality without compromising security. We present a system based on a simple looped beam splitter architecture that uses only passive optical components. The device features an intrinsic self-testing mechanism derived from the stability of detection-probability ratios, allowing continuous validation of correct operation. In addition, the same physical process generates two independent random sequences with identical entropy: a private sequence, used for secure applications, and a public one, enabling external statistical verification with zero mutual information between them. This approach demonstrates that robust, self-testing, and publicly verifiable quantum randomness can be achieved with minimal optical complexity without jeopardizing security.</description>

      <title>Entanglement Certification in Bulk Nonlinear Crystal for Degenerate and Non-degenerate SPDC for Quantum Imaging Application</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum imaging with entangled photon pairs promises performance beyond classical limits, yet phase-matching, nonlinear crystal properties, and pump size jointly constrain its ultimate spatial resolution. We develop a unified model that relates these factors to the transverse correlations observed in both near and far-field planes, treating both degenerate and non-degenerate Type-I SPDC processes equally. By explicitly incorporating crystal length, pump beam waist, and spectral filtering into the biphoton amplitude, we demonstrate that narrowband signal filtering influences frequency-angle mixing. This approach minimizes conditional position uncertainty, particularly in non-degenerate SPDC scenarios, which enhances spatial resolution while maintaining the necessary multimode structure for imaging. We further analyze birefringent walk-off in bulk crystals and demonstrate that its apparent degradation of entanglement, such as weakened transverse anti-correlations and inflated Reid products, can be corrected. This correction follows frequency non-degeneracy and walk-off-aware reconstruction, recovering the correct correlation ridge and improving entanglement strength. The framework provides quantitative design rules that link filter bandwidth, crystal length, and pump waist to achievable resolution. Our results offer practical guidance for optimizing quantum microscopy and ghost imaging setups, where achieving high spatial resolution and robust entanglement certification simultaneously is crucial.</description>

      <title>Network nonlocality breaking channels</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Network nonlocality, a recently noted form of nonlocality has been shown to have distinctive features, marking a significant departure from the notion of standard Bell nonlocality in the context of quantum correlations. On a pragmatic front, it has gained significant importance as researchers worldwide actively engage in the study on quantum networks. However, as typical to any quantum resource, network nonlocality is also vulnerable to environmental noise, which sometimes prove to be detrimental. Environmental interactions are modeled in terms of quantum channels. In the present study, we introduce and characterize network nonlocality breaking channels. Network nonlocality breaking channels model environmental influences which results in the loss of resource, i.e., the system loses its nonlocal resource due to such interactions. The study is done in the ambit of some suitably chosen inequalities in (i) linear networks and (ii) star-shaped networks. Further, the loss in full network nonlocality is also studied. Furthermore, we also characterize quantum channels according to their ability in preserving quantum resources, i.e., they do not break network nonlocality, which enables one to identify useful quantum channels in networks. The study is vindicated by illustrations from various noise models like depolarizing and dephasing channels.</description>

      <title>Reusability of Quantum Catalysts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum catalysts enable transformations that otherwise would be forbidden, offering a pathway to surpass conventional limits in quantum information processing. Among them, embezzling catalysts stand out for achieving near-perfect performance while tolerating only minimal disturbance, bridging the gap between ideal and practical catalysis. Yet, this superior capability comes at a cost: Each use slightly degrades the catalyst, leading to an inevitable accumulation of imperfection. This gradual decay defines their most distinctive property -- reusability -- which, despite its fundamental importance, remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish a quantitative framework to characterize the operational lifetime of embezzling catalysts, focusing on their role in entanglement distillation and extending the analysis to quantum teleportation. We show that the catalytic advantage inevitably diminishes with repeated use, deriving bounds on the maximum effective reuse rounds for a desired performance gain. Our results uncover the finite reusability of catalysts in quantum processes and point toward sustainable strategies for quantum communication.</description>

      <title>Super-Heisenberg Scaling Using Nonlinear Quantum Scrambling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26448</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26448v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Super-Heisenberg scaling, which scales as $N^{-\beta}$ with $\beta&gt;1$ in terms of the number of particles $N$ or $T^{-\beta}$ in terms of the evolution time $T$, is better than Heisenberg scaling in quantum metrology. It has been proven that super-Heisenberg scaling can be achieved when the Hamiltonian of the system involves many-body interactions or the time-dependent terms. We demonstrate that nonlinear quantum scrambling facilitates the achievement of super-Heisenberg scaling $T^{-\beta}$ when the generator of the parameter is time-independent. More importantly, in dissipative systems, we can still obtain super-Heisenberg scaling in the friction model. In the optical cavity system, an exponential improvement in measurement precision over time can be achieved by combining injected external squeezing and intracavity squeezing. Our work provides an optimal method for leveraging nonlinear resources to enhance the measurement precision of the driving field.</description>

      <title>Correlations in a quantum switch-based heat engine with measurements: A proof-of-principle demonstration</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26460v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Allowing the order of quantum operations to exist in superposition is known to open new routes for thermodynamic tasks. We investigate a quantum heat engine where energy exchanges are driven by generalized measurements, and the sequence of these operations is coherently controlled in a superposition of causal orders. Our analysis explores how initial correlations between the working medium and the controller affect the engine's performance. Considering uncorrelated, classically correlated, and entangled initial states, we show that entanglement enables the superposed causal order to generate coherence in the working medium, thereby enhancing work extraction and efficiency beyond the separable and uncorrelated cases. Finally, we present a proof-of-principle simulation on the IBM Quantum Experience platform, realizing a quantum switch of two measurement channels with tunable strengths and experimentally confirming the predicted efficiency enhancement enabled by correlation-assisted superposed causal order.</description>

      <title>Simulation Framework for the Automated Search of Optimal Parameters Using Physically Relevant Metrics in Nonlinear Superconducting Quantum Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26479</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26479v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this contribution we present JosephsonCircuitsOptimizer.jl (JCO), a simulation and optimization framework based on the JosephsonCircuits.jl library for Julia. It models superconducting circuits that include Josephson junctions (JJs) and other nonlinear elements within a lumped-element approach, leveraging harmonic balance, a frequency-domain technique that provides a computationally efficient alternative to traditional time-domain simulations. JCO automates the evaluation of optimal circuit parameters by implementing Bayesian optimization with Gaussian processes through a device-specific metric and identifying the optimal working point to achieve a defined performance function. This makes it well suited for circuits with strong nonlinearity and a high-dimensional set of coupled design parameters. To demonstrate its capabilities, we focus on optimizing a Josephson Traveling-Wave Parametric Amplifier (JTWPA) based on Superconducting Nonlinear Asymmetric Inductive eLements (SNAILs), operating in the three-wave mixing regime. The device consists of an array of unit cells, each containing a loop with multiple JJs, that amplifies weak quantum signals near the quantum noise limit. By integrating efficient simulation and optimization strategies, the framework supports the systematic development of superconducting circuits for a broad range of applications.</description>

      <title>Certification and Classification of Linear Quantum Error Mitigation Methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerous mitigation methods exist for quantum noise suppression, making it challenging to identify the optimum approach for a specific application; especially as ongoing advances in hardware tuning and error correction are expected to reduce logical error rates. In order to facilitate the future-proof application-dependent comparison of mitigation methods, we develop a set of quantitative metrics that account for continual improvements in logical gate quality. We use these metrics to define qualitative criteria (e.g. scalability, efficiency, and robustness to characterised imperfections in the mitigation implementation), which we combine into application-specific certifications. We then provide a taxonomy of linear mitigation methods, characterising them by their features and requirements. Finally, we use our framework to produce and evaluate a mitigation strategy. A mitigation strategy is a collections of mitigation methods and compilation procedures designed to mitigate all relevant errors for a given piece of characterised hardware. Our example mitigation strategy is targeted at mitigating the outputs of hardware suffering from stochastic noise and/or rotational errors. We find the most significant determinant of efficient mitigation is accurate and precise characterisation.</description>

Abstract: We employ quantum variational methods to investigate a single-site interacting fermion--boson system -- an example of a minimal supersymmetric model that can exhibit spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. Our study addresses the challenges inherent in calculating mixed fermion--boson systems and explores the potential of quantum computing to advance their analysis. By using adaptive variational techniques, we identify optimal ans\"atze that scale efficiently, allowing for reliable identification of spontaneous supersymmetry breaking. This work lays a foundation for future quantum computing investigations of more complex and physically rich fermion--boson quantum field theories in higher dimensions.</description>

Abstract: This is a concise, pedagogical introduction to the dynamic field of open quantum systems governed by Markovian master equations. We focus on the mathematical and physical origins of the Lindblad equation, its unraveling in terms of pure-state trajectories, the structure of steady states with emphasis on the role of symmetry and conservation laws, and a sampling of the novel physical phenomena that arise from nonunitary dynamics (dissipation and measurements). This is far from a comprehensive summary of the field. Rather, the objective is to provide a conceptual foundation and physically illuminating examples that are useful to graduate students and researchers entering this subject. There are exercise problems and references for further reading throughout the notes.</description>

      <title>Achieving Utility-Scale Applications through Full Stack Co-Design of Fault Tolerant Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26547v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum computing promises revolutionary advances in modeling materials and molecules. However, the up-to-date runtime estimates for utility-scale applications on certain quantum hardware systems are in the order of years rendering quantum computations impractical. Our work incorporates state-of-the-art innovations in all key aspects of the fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) stack to show how quantum computers could realistically and practically tackle CO$_2$ utilization for green energy production. We bring down the quantum computation runtime from 22 years to just 1 day, achieving a significant 7.9e03 reduction from previous state-of-the-art work. This reduction renders the quantum computation feasible, challenges state-of-the-art classical methods and results to a predicted run-time quantum advantage. We provide a rigorous analysis of how different innovations across the stack combine to provide such reductions. Our work provides strong evidence that all layers of FTQC are crucial in the quest for quantum advantage. Our analysis can be applied to related problems on FTQC and for any type of quantum architecture. Our methodology connects quantum algorithms to applications of positive real-world impact and leads to compelling evidence of achievable quantum advantage.</description>

      <title>Limits of Absoluteness of Observed Events in Timelike Scenarios: A No-Go Theorem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wigner's Friend-type paradoxes challenge the assumption that events are absolute- that when we measure a system, we obtain a single result, which is not relative to anything or anyone else. These paradoxes highlight the tension between quantum theory and our intuitions about reality being observer-independent. Building on a recent result that developed these paradoxes into a no-go theorem, namely the Local Friendliness Theorem, we introduce the Causal Friendliness Paradox, a time-ordered analogue of it. In this framework, we replace the usual locality assumption with Axiological Time Symmetry (ATS), and show that, when combined with the assumptions of Absoluteness of Observed Events (AOE), No Retrocausality (NRC), and Screening via Pseudo Events (SPE), we obtain a causal inequality. We then show that quantum mechanics violates this inequality and is therefore incompatible with at least one of these assumptions. To probe which assumption might be incompatible, we then examine whether AOE in its entirety is essential for this no-go result. We propose a weaker, operational form of AOE that still leads to inequalities that quantum mechanics violates. This result shows that even under relaxed assumptions, quantum theory resists reconciliation with classical notions of absolute events, reinforcing the foundational significance of Wigner's Friend-type paradoxes in timelike scenarios.</description>

      <title>Tackling the Challenges of Adding Pulse-level Support to a Heterogeneous HPCQC Software Stack: MQSS Pulse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26565</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26565v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the problem of adding native pulse-level control to heterogeneous High Performance Computing-Quantum Computing (HPCQC) software stacks, using the Munich Quantum Software Stack (MQSS) as a case study. The goal is to expand the capabilities of HPCQC environments by offering the ability for low-level access and control, currently typically not foreseen for such hybrid systems. For this, we need to establish new interfaces that integrate such pulse-level control into the lower layers of the software stack, including the need for proper representation.
  Pulse-level quantum programs can be fully described with only three low-level abstractions: ports (input/output channels), frames (reference signals), and waveforms (pulse envelopes). We identify four key challenges to represent those pulse abstractions at: the user-interface level, at the compiler level (including the Intermediate Representation (IR)), and at the backend-interface level (including the appropriate exchange format). For each challenge, we propose concrete solutions in the context of MQSS. These include introducing a compiled (C/C++) pulse Application Programming Interface (API) to overcome Python runtime overhead, extending its LLVM support to include pulse-related instructions, using its C-based backend interface to query relevant hardware constraints, and designing a portable exchange format for pulse sequences. Our integrated approach provides an end-to-end path for pulse-aware compilation and runtime execution in HPCQC environments. This work lays out the architectural blueprint for extending HPCQC integration to support pulse-level quantum operations without disrupting state-of-the-art classical workflows.</description>

      <title>Higher-order discrete time crystals in a quantum chaotic top</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize various dynamical phases of the simplest version of the quantum kicked-top model, a paradigmatic system for studying quantum chaos. This system exhibits both regular and chaotic behavior depending on the kick strength. The existence of the $2$-DTC phase has previously been reported around the rotationally symmetric point of the system, where it displays regular dynamics. We show that the system hosts robust $2$-DTC and dynamical freezing (DF) phases around alternating rotationally symmetric points. Interestingly, we also identify $4$-DTC phases that cannot be explained by the system's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry; these phases become stable for higher values of angular momentum. We explain the emergence of higher-order DTC phases through classical phase portraits of the system, connected with spin coherent states (SCSs). The $4$-DTC phases appear for certain initial states that are close to the spiral saddle points identified in the classical picture. Moreover, the linear entropy decreases as the angular momentum increases, indicating enhanced stability of the $4$-DTC phases. We also find an emergent conservation law for both the $2$-DTC and DF phases, while dynamical conservation arises periodically for the $4$-DTC phases.</description>

      <title>Diamond quantum sensing at record high pressure up to 240 GPa</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum sensing utilizing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond has emerged as a transformative technology for probing magnetic phase transition1-4, evidencing Meissner effect of superconductors1,5-9, and visualizing stress distribution3,9 under extreme conditions. Recent development in NV configurations and hydrostatic environments have raised the operational pressures of NV centers to 140 GPa2,6,10,11, but substantial challenges remain in extending sensing capabilities into multi-megabar range, critical for research in hydrogen-rich superconductors like La-Sc-H ($T_{\text{c}}$ of 271-298 K at 195-266 GPa)12 and evolution of minerals near Earth's core13. Here we report the fabrication of shallow NV centers through ion implantation followed by high-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) annealing, leading to increased density, improved coherence, and mitigated internal stresses, a pre-requisite for reducing their degradation under compression. This NV magnetometry enable breakthrough of pressure capabilities exceeding 240 GPa, constrained by structural integrity of the 50 um diamond anvils, suggesting that the untapped pressure limit may enable further advancements with smaller cutlets or more robust diamonds. We present compelling evidence of the Meissner effect and trapped flux at record-high pressure of 180 GPa for superconducting transition in elemental titanium (Ti) as benchmark, establishing a solid foundation for high-pressure magnetometry in exploring complex quantum phenomena at previously unreachable pressures.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26612v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a general form of a two-parameter family of local interactions between quantum walkers conditioned on the internal state of their coins. By choosing their particular case, we systematically study the impact of these interactions on the dynamics of two initially localized and noncorrelated walkers. Our general interaction framework, which reduces to several previously studied models as special cases, provides a versatile platform for engineering quantum correlations with applications in quantum simulation, state preparation, and sensing protocols. It also opens up the possibility of analyzing many-body interactions for larger numbers of walkers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Simulating the dynamics of quantum impurity models remains a fundamental challenge due to the complex memory effects that arise from system-environment interactions. Of particular interest are two-time correlation functions of an impurity, which are central to the characterization of these many-body systems, and are a cornerstone of the description of correlated materials in dynamical mean field theory (DMFT). In this work, we extend our previous work on the extrapolation of single-time observables to demonstrate an efficient scheme for computing two-time impurity correlation functions, by combining the non-Markovian quantum Mpemba effect (NMQMpE) with a dynamical map-based framework for open quantum systems. Our method is benchmarked against exact and known accurate results in prototypical impurity models for both fermionic and bosonic environments, demonstrating significant computational savings compared to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>FlowQ-Net: A Generative Framework for Automated Quantum Circuit Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26688v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Designing efficient quantum circuits is a central bottleneck to exploring the potential of quantum computing, particularly for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, where circuit efficiency and resilience to errors are paramount. The search space of gate sequences grows combinatorially, and handcrafted templates often waste scarce qubit and depth budgets. We introduce \textsc{FlowQ-Net} (Flow-based Quantum design Network), a generative framework for automated quantum circuit synthesis based on Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets). This framework learns a stochastic policy to construct circuits sequentially, sampling them in proportion to a flexible, user-defined reward function that can encode multiple design objectives such as performance, depth, and gate count. This approach uniquely enables the generation of a diverse ensemble of high-quality circuits, moving beyond single-solution optimization. We demonstrate the efficacy of \textsc{FlowQ-Net} through an extensive set of simulations. We apply our method to Variational Quantum Algorithm (VQA) ansatz design for molecular ground state estimation, Max-Cut, and image classification, key challenges in near-term quantum computing. Circuits designed by \textsc{FlowQ-Net} achieve significant improvements, yielding circuits that are 10$\times$-30$\times$ more compact in terms of parameters, gates, and depth compared to commonly used unitary baselines, without compromising accuracy. This trend holds even when subjected to error profiles from real-world quantum devices. Our results underline the potential of generative models as a general-purpose methodology for automated quantum circuit design, offering a promising path towards more efficient quantum algorithms and accelerating scientific discovery in the quantum domain.</description>

      <title>Witnessing Short- and Long-Range Nonstabilizerness via the Information Lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study nonstabilizerness on the information lattice, and demonstrate that noninteger local information directly indicates nonstabilizerness. For states with a clear separation of short- and large-scale information, noninteger total information at large scales $\Gamma$ serves as a witness of long-range nonstabilizerness. We propose a folding procedure to separate the global and edge-to-edge contributions to $\Gamma$. As an example we show that the ferromagnetic ground state of the spin-1/2 three-state Potts model has long-range nonstabilizerness originating from global correlations, while the paramagnetic ground state has at most short-range nonstabilizerness.</description>

      <title>Graph theoretic quantum contextuality and unextendible Product Bases</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26719</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26719v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Unextendible product bases(UPBs) are central to the study of local distinguishability of orthogonal product states. While their connection to quantum nonlocality via Bell inequalities is well established, their link to quantum contextuality remains largely unexplored. We establish a graph theoretic connection between contextuality and UPBs. First, an equivalence between Klyachko-Can-Binicio\u{g}lu-Shumovsky (KCBS) vectors and the Pyramid UPB is shown and then by constructing a one parameter family of UPB vectors, a quantitative connection between `contextuality strength' and bound entanglement of states associated with the corresponding UPB is demonstrated. This equivalence is extended to generalized KCBS vectors and the GenPyramid UPB. A new class of minimal UPBs in $\mathbb{C}^3 \otimes \mathbb{C}^n$ is constructed using Lov\'asz-optimal orthogonal representations (LOORs) of cycle graphs and their complements which we term the GenContextual UPB. Any minimal UPB in this dimension is shown to be graph-equivalent to the GenContextual UPB. We briefly discuss the distinguishability properties of GenContextual UPB. In the reverse direction, we observe that the constituent vectors of the QuadRes UPB are LOORs of Paley graphs. The structural properties of these graphs make them suitable candidates for constructing noncontextuality inequalities, thereby establishing a bidirectional connection between quantum contextuality and UPBs.</description>

      <title>Digitized Counterdiabatic Quantum Sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26735</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26735v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose digitized counterdiabatic quantum sampling (DCQS), a hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for efficient sampling from energy-based models, such as low-temperature Boltzmann distributions. The method utilizes counterdiabatic protocols, which suppress non-adiabatic transitions, with an iterative bias-field procedure that progressively steers the sampling toward low-energy regions. We observe that the samples obtained at each iteration correspond to approximate Boltzmann distributions at effective temperatures. By aggregating these samples and applying classical reweighting, the method reconstructs the Boltzmann distribution at a desired temperature. We define a scalable performance metric, based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the total variation distance, to quantify convergence toward the exact Boltzmann distribution. DCQS is validated on one-dimensional Ising models with random couplings up to 124 qubits, where exact results are available through transfer-matrix methods. We then apply it to a higher-order spin-glass Hamiltonian with 156 qubits executed on IBM quantum processors. We show that classical sampling algorithms, including Metropolis-Hastings and the state-of-the-art low-temperature technique parallel tempering, require up to three orders of magnitude more samples to match the quality of DCQS, corresponding to an approximately 2x runtime advantage. Boltzmann sampling underlies applications ranging from statistical physics to machine learning, yet classical algorithms exhibit exponentially slow convergence at low temperatures. Our results thus demonstrate a robust route toward scalable and efficient Boltzmann sampling on current quantum processors.</description>

      <title>Tunable frequency conversion and comb generation with a superconducting artificial atom</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26749v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the power spectral density emitted by a superconducting artificial atom coupled to the end of a semi-infinite transmission line and driven by two continuous radio-frequency fields. In this setup, we observe the generation of multiple frequency peaks and the formation of frequency combs with equal detuning between those peaks. The frequency peaks originate from wave mixing of the drive fields, mediated by the artificial atom, highlighting the potential of this system as both a frequency converter and a frequency-comb generator. We demonstrate precise control and tunability in generating these frequency features, aligning well with theoretical predictions, across a relatively wide frequency range (tens of MHz, exceeding the linewidth of the artificial atom). The extensive and simple tunability of this frequency converter and comb generator, combined with its small physical footprint, makes it promising for quantum optics on chips and other applications in quantum technology.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26754</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26754v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a quantum-enhanced protocol for detecting wave-like dark matter using an array of $N$ entangled superconducting cavities initialized in an $m$-photon Fock state. By distributing and recollecting the quantum state with an entanglement-distribution operation, the scan rate scales as $N^2(m+1)$ while thermal excitation is the dominant background, significantly outperforming classical single-cavity methods under matched conditions. We evaluate the robustness of our scheme against additional noise sources, including decoherence and beamsplitter infidelity, through theoretical analysis and numerical simulations. In practice, the key requirements, namely high-Q superconducting radio-frequency cavities that support long integration times, high-fidelity microwave beamsplitters, and universal cavity control, are already available on current experimental platforms, making the protocol experimentally feasible.</description>

      <title>Approximate quantum error correction, eigenstate thermalization and the chaos bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26758</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26758v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum error correction, thermalization, and quantum chaos are fundamental aspects of quantum many-body physics that have each developed largely independently, despite their deep conceptual overlap. In this work, we establish a precise link between all three in systems that satisfy the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) and exhibit a well-defined hierarchy of time scales between dissipation and scrambling. Building on the ETH matrix ansatz and the structure of the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC), we show that the chaos bound directly constrains the error of an approximate quantum error-correcting code. This establishes a quantitative relation between information scrambling, thermalization, and correctability. Furthermore, we derive bounds on dynamical fluctuations around the infinite-time average and on fluctuation-dissipation relations, expressed in terms of both the code error and the Lyapunov exponent. Our results reveal how the limits of quantum chaos constrain information preservation in thermalizing quantum systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Additional state evolutions performed before measurement, also called measurement-after-interactions (MAI) protocols, have shown a great potential for increasing the sensitivity of metrological scenarios. Here, we go beyond this result and show that MAI techniques can significantly enhance the detection capability of witnesses for quantum correlations. In particular, we show the possibility of detecting Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen steering and mode entanglement of non-Gaussian states from linear measurements only. Moreover, we show that such approach allows for a significantly higher noise robustness.</description>

      <title>"Enough" Wigner negativity implies genuine multipartite entanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wigner negativity and genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) are key nonclassical resources that enable computational advantages and broader quantum-information tasks. In this work, we prove two theorems for multimode continuous-variable systems that relate these nonclassical resources. Both theorems show that "enough" Wigner negativity -- either a large-enough Wigner negativity volume along a suitably-chosen two-dimensional slice, or a large-enough nonclassicality depth of the centre-of-mass of a system -- certifies the presence of GME. Moreover, violations of the latter inequality provide lower bounds of the trace distance to the set of non-GME states. Our results also provide sufficient conditions for generating GME by interfering a state with the vacuum through a multiport interferometer, complementing long-known necessary conditions. Beyond these fundamental connections, our methods have practical advantages for systems with native phase-space measurements: they require only measuring the Wigner function over a finite region, or measuring a finite number of characteristic function points. Such measurements are frequently performed with readouts common in circuit/cavity quantum electrodynamic systems, trapped ions and atoms, and circuit quantum acoustodynamic systems. As such, our GME criteria are readily implementable in these platforms.</description>

      <title>Witnessing genuine multipartite entanglement in phase space with controlled Gaussian unitaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Many existing genuine multipartite entanglement (GME) witnesses for continuous-variable (CV) quantum systems typically rely on quadrature measurements, which is challenging to implement in platforms where the CV degrees of freedom can be indirectly accessed only through qubit readouts. In this work, we propose methods to implement GME witnesses through phase-space measurements in state-of-the-art experimental platforms, leveraging controlled Gaussian unitaries readily available in qubit-CV architectures. Based on two theoretical results showing that sufficient Wigner negativity can certify GME, we present five concrete implementation schemes using controlled parity, displacement, and beamsplitter operations. Our witnesses can detect paradigmatic GME states like the Dicke and multipartite $N00N$ states, which include the W states as a special case, and GHZ-type entangled cat states. We analyze the performance of these witnesses under realistic noise conditions and finite measurement resolution, showing their robustness to experimental imperfections. Crucially, our implementations require exponentially fewer measurement settings than full tomography, with one scheme requiring only a single measurement on auxiliary modes. The methods are readily applicable to circuit/cavity quantum electrodynamics, circuit quantum acoustodynamics, as well as trapped ions and atoms systems, where such dichotomic phase-space measurements are already routinely performed as native readouts.</description>

      <title>Entanglement-assisted circuit knitting</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Distributed quantum computing (DQC) provides a promising route toward scalable quantum computation, where entanglement-assisted LOCC and circuit knitting represent two complementary approaches. The former deterministically realizes nonlocal operations but demands extensive entanglement resources, whereas the latter requires no entanglement yet suffers from exponential sampling overhead. Here, we propose a hybrid framework that integrates these two paradigms by performing circuit knitting assisted with a limited amount of entanglement. We establish a general theoretical formulation that yields lower bounds on the optimal sampling overhead and present a constructive protocol demonstrating that a single shared Bell pair can reduce the overhead to the asymptotic limit of standard circuit knitting without requiring classical communication. This hybrid approach enhances both sampling and entanglement efficiency, enabling more resource-practical implementations of distributed quantum computation.</description>

      <title>Cavity-assisted single-shot T center spin readout</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26797v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-fidelity spin readout is a crucial component for quantum information processing with optically interfaced solid-state spins. Here, we propose and investigate two theoretical protocols for fast single-shot readout of cavity-coupled single T center electronic spins. For fluorescence-based readout, we selectively couple one of the T center spin-conserving transitions to a single-mode photonic cavity, exploiting the enhancement of the fluorescence emission and cyclicity. For reflection-based readout, we leverage the spin-dependent cavity reflection contrast to generate the qubit readout signal. We show that the cavity reflection approach enables high-fidelity spin readout even when the T center only has a modest cyclicity. With realistic system parameters, such as cavity quality factor $Q = 2\times10^5$ and T center optical linewidth $\Gamma/2\pi = 100$ MHz, we calculate a single-shot readout fidelity exceeding 99% within 8.7 $\mu$s for both spin readout protocols.</description>

      <title>Universal trade-off between irreversibility and intrinsic timescale in thermal relaxation with applications to thermodynamic inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.06428v3 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish a general lower bound for the entropy production rate (EPR) based on the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the Logarithmic-Sobolev constant that characterizes the time-scale of relaxation. This bound can be considered as an enhanced second law of thermodynamics. When applied to thermal relaxation, it reveals a universal trade-off relation between the dissipation rate and the intrinsic relaxation timescale. From this relation, a thermodynamic upper bound on the relaxation time between two given states emerges, acting as an inverse speed limit over the entire time region. We also obtain a quantum version of this upper bound, which is always tighter than its classical counterpart, incorporating an additional term due to decoherence. Remarkably, we further demonstrate that the trade-off relation remains valid for any generally non-Markovian coarse-grained relaxation dynamics, highlighting its significant applications in thermodynamic inference. This trade-off relation is a new tool in inferring EPRs in molecular dynamics simulations and practical experiments.</description>

      <title>Artificial Transmission Line Synthesis Tailored for Traveling-Wave Parametric Processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.24753v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Artificial transmission lines built with lumped-element inductors and capacitors form the backbone of broadband, nearly quantum-limited traveling-wave parametric amplifiers (TWPAs). However, systematic design methods for TWPAs, and more generally artificial transmission lines, are lacking. Here, I develop a general synthesis framework for lossless artificial transmission lines by borrowing from periodic structure theory and passive network synthesis. These complementary approaches divide the design space: periodic loading synthesis employs spatial modulation of frequency-independent components, while filter synthesis employs frequency-dependent responses in spatially-uniform components. When tailoring transmission lines for parametric processes, nonlinear elements are added, typically nonlinear inductances in superconducting circuits, while ensuring energy and momentum conservation between interacting tones. Applying this framework, I design a kinetic inductance TWPA with a novel phase-matching architecture, and a backward-pumped Josephson TWPA exploiting an ambidextrous i.e., right-left-handed transmission line.</description>

      <title>Group theoretic quantization of punctured plane</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25794</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25794v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We quantize punctured plane, $X=\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$, employing Isham's group theoretic quantization procedure. After sketching out a brief review of group theoretic quantization procedure, we apply the quantization scheme to the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$, corresponding to the punctured plane, $X$. Particularly, we find the canonical Lie group, $\mathscr{G}$, corresponding to the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$, to be $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times \R^+)$. We establish an algebra homomorphism between the Lie algebra corresponding to the canonical group, $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times \R^+)$, and the smooth functions, $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$, in the phase space, $M=X \times \R^2$. Making use of this homomorphism and unitary representation of the canonical group, $\mathscr{G} = \R^2 \rtimes (SO(2)\times \R^+)$, we deduce a quantization map that maps a subspace of classical observables, $f\in C^{\infty}(M)$, to self-adjoint operators on the Hilbert space, $\mathscr{H}$, which is the space of all square integrable functions on $X=\mathbb{R}^2-\{0\}$ with respect to the measure $\dd \mu = \dd \phi\dd\rho/(2\pi\rho)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.25864v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting diode effects (SDE), both in bulk superconductors and in Josephson junctions, have garnered a lot of attention due to potential applications in classical and quantum computing, as well as superconducting sensors. Here we review various mechanisms that have been theoretically proposed for their realization. We first provide a brief historical overview and discuss the basic but subtle phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory of SDE, emphasizing the need to the simultaneous breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries. We then proceed to more microscopic treatments, focusing especially on implementations in noncentrosymmetric materials described by the Rashba-Zeeman model. Finally, we review proposals based on other condensed matter systems such as altermagnets, valley polarized and topological materials, and systems out of equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Spatially Structured Entanglement from Nonequilibrium Thermal Pure States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25868v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study quantum quench dynamics in (1+1)-dimensional critical systems, starting from thermal pure states called crosscap states, and evolving them under spatially inhomogeneous Hamiltonians. The spatial inhomogeneity is introduced through a deformation of the Hamiltonian, expressed as linear combinations of the generators of the $SL^{(q)}(2,\mathbb{R})$ subalgebra of the Virasoro algebra. We analyze the free massless Dirac fermion theory and holographic conformal field theory as prototypical examples of integrable and non-integrable dynamics. Consistent with general expectations, "M\"obius-type" deformations lead to thermalization in the non-integrable case, and to periodic revivals in the integrable one. In contrast, "sine-square-type" and "displacement-type" deformations prevent both thermalization and scrambling, instead producing late-time, graph-like entanglement patterns. These patterns emerge from the interplay between the deformed Hamiltonian and the crosscap initial state and appear to be universal: they are determined solely by the deformation profile while remaining largely insensitive to microscopic details. Finally, we perform a holographic calculation in three-dimensional gravity using AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$, which reproduces the main features of our (1+1)-dimensional study.</description>

      <title>Hyperbolic Fracton Model, Subsystem Symmetry and Holography III: Extension to Generic Tessellations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.25994v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We generalize the Hyperbolic Fracton Model from the $\{5,4\}$ tessellation to generic tessellations, and investigate its core properties: subsystem symmetries, fracton mobility, and holographic correspondence. While the model on the original tessellation has features reminiscent of the flat-space lattice cases, the generalized tessellations exhibit a far richer and more intricate structure. The ground-state degeneracy and subsystem symmetries are generated recursively layer-by-layer, through the inflation rule, but without a simple, uniform pattern. The fracton excitations follow exponential-in-distance and algebraic-in-lattice-size growing patterns when moving outward, and depend sensitively to the tessellation geometry, differing qualitatively from both type-I or type-II fracton model on flat lattices. Despite this increased complexity, the hallmark holographic features -- subregion duality via Rindler reconstruction, the Ryu-Takayanagi formula for mutual information, and effective black hole entropy scaling with horizon area -- remain valid. These results demonstrate that the holographic correspondence in fracton models persists in generic tessellations, and provide a natural platform to explore more intricate subsystem symmetries and fracton physics.</description>

      <title>A Zero Added Loss Multiplexing (ZALM) Source Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26009v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Zero Added Loss Multiplexing (ZALM) offers broadband, per channel heralded EPR pairs, with a rich parameter space that allows its performance to be tailored for specific applications. We present a modular ZALM simulator that demonstrates how design choices affect output rate and fidelity. Built in NetSquid with QSI controllers, it exposes 20+ tunable parameters, supports IDEAL and REALISTIC modes, and provides reusable components for Spontaneous Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) sources, interference, Dense Wavelength Division Multiplexing (DWDM) filtering, fiber delay, active polarization gates, detectors, and lossy fiber. Physics based models capture Hong Ou Mandel (HOM) visibility, insertion loss, detector efficiency, gate errors, and attenuation. Using this tool, we map trade offs among fidelity, link distance, and entangled pairs per use, and show how SPDC bandwidth and DWDM grid spacing steer performance. Using the default configuration settings, average fidelity emains constant at 0.8 but the ebit rate decreases from 0.0175 at the source to 0.0 at 50 km; narrowing the SPDC degeneracy bandwidth increases the ebit rate significantly without affecting fidelity. The simulator enables codesign of source, filtering, and feedforward settings for specific quantum memories and integrates as a building block for end to end quantum network studies.</description>

      <title>Invariants for (2+1)D bosonic crystalline topological insulators for all 17 wallpaper groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26074v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study bosonic symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in (2+1) dimensions with symmetry $G = G_{\text{space}}\times K$, where $G_{\text{space}}$ is a general wallpaper group and $K=\text{U}(1),\mathbb{Z}_N, \text{SO}(3)$ is an internal symmetry. In each case we propose a set of many-body invariants that can detect all the different phases predicted from real space constructions and group cohomology classifications. They are obtained by applying partial rotations and reflections to a given ground state, combined with suitable operations in $K$. The reflection symmetry invariants that we introduce include `double partial reflections', `weak partial reflections' and their `relative' or `twisted' versions which also depend on $K$. We verify our proposal through exact calculations on ground states constructed using real space constructions. We demonstrate our method in detail for the groups p4m and p4g, and in the case of p4m also derive a topological effective action involving gauge fields for orientation-reversing symmetries. Our results provide a concrete method to fully characterize (2+1)D crystalline topological invariants in bosonic SPT ground states.</description>

      <title>QCoder Benchmark: Bridging Language Generation and Quantum Hardware through Simulator-Based Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26101</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26101v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to automatic programming code generation. This task can be viewed as a language generation task that bridges natural language, human knowledge, and programming logic. However, it remains underexplored in domains that require interaction with hardware devices, such as quantum programming, where human coders write Python code that is executed on a quantum computer. To address this gap, we introduce QCoder Benchmark, an evaluation framework that assesses LLMs on quantum programming with feedback from simulated hardware devices. Our benchmark offers two key features. First, it supports evaluation using a quantum simulator environment beyond conventional Python execution, allowing feedback of domain-specific metrics such as circuit depth, execution time, and error classification, which can be used to guide better generation. Second, it incorporates human-written code submissions collected from real programming contests, enabling both quantitative comparisons and qualitative analyses of LLM outputs against human-written codes. Our experiments reveal that even advanced models like GPT-4o achieve only around 18.97% accuracy, highlighting the difficulty of the benchmark. In contrast, reasoning-based models such as o3 reach up to 78% accuracy, outperforming averaged success rates of human-written codes (39.98%). We release the QCoder Benchmark dataset and public evaluation API to support further research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the Josephson effect in a two-dimensional superconducting system with a smoothly and periodically varying order parameter. The order parameter is modulated along one direction while remaining uniform in the perpendicular direction, leading to a spatially periodic superconducting phase. We show that the periodicity of the order parameter determines the winding number of the eigenfunctions, which serves as a topological characterization of the system. The winding number is calculated analytically and visualized through the trajectory of the corresponding three-dimensional Bloch vector. By solving the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation, we obtain both plane-wave solutions describing bulk states and exponentially localized solutions that correspond to edge modes. The analytic bulk-edge connection is employed to identify the conditions under which the edge states emerge from the bulk spectrum. We find that the winding numbers depend on the boundary conditions, which differ between the plane-wave and exponential solutions. These results establish a direct connection between the spatial modulation of the order parameter, the topological structure of the eigenstates, and the emergence of edge modes in periodically modulated Josephson systems.</description>

      <title>Thermal Casimir effect in the spin-orbit coupled Bose gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26240v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the thermal Casimir effect in ideal Bose gases with spin-orbit (S-O) coupling of Rashba type below the critical temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation. In contrast to the standard situation involving no S-O coupling, the system exhibits long-ranged Casimir forces both in two and three dimensions ($d=2$ and $d=3$). We identify the relevant scaling variable involving the ratio $D/\nu$ of the separation between the confining walls $D$ and the S-O coupling magnitude $\nu$. We derive and discuss the corresponding scaling functions for the Casimir energy. In all the considered cases the resulting Casimir force is attractive and the S-O coupling $\nu$ has impact on its magnitude. In $d=3$ the exponent governing the decay of the Casimir force becomes modified by the presence of the S-O coupling, and its value depends on the orientation of the confining walls relative to the plane defined by the Rashba coupling. In $d=2$ the obtained Casimir force displays singular behavior in the limit of vanishing $\nu$</description>

Abstract: We present a short review of an unusual but important application for a high-temperature charged plasma. The unorthodox proposition was made by Ninham concerning a contribution from Casimir forces across high-temperature electron-positron plasma in nuclear interactions. The key message in the current work is how high temperatures ($\sim10^{11}$ \,K) pop out as essential. Clearly, classical, semi-classical, and quantum considerations for the background media impact both the Casimir effect and the physics of stars and the Universe.</description>

      <title>Weak-Memory Dynamics in Discrete Time</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26325v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Discrete dynamics arise naturally in systems with broken temporal translation symmetry and are typically described by first-order recurrence relations representing classical or quantum Markov chains. When memory effects induced by hidden degrees of freedom are relevant, however, higher-order discrete evolution equations are generally required. Focusing on linear dynamics, we identify a well-delineated weak-memory regime where such equations can, on an intermediate time scale, be systematically reduced to a unique first-order counterpart acting on the same state space. We formulate our results as a mathematical theorem and work out two examples showing how they can be applied to stochastic Floquet dynamics under coarse-grained and quantum collisional models.</description>

      <title>Strong Kantorovich duality for quantum optimal transport with generic cost and optimal couplings on quantum bits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26326</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26326v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove Kantorovich duality for a linearized version of a recently proposed non-quadratic quantum optimal transport problem, where quantum channels realize the transport. As an application, we determine optimal solutions of both the primal and the dual problem using this duality in the case of quantum bits and distinguished cost operators, with certain restrictions on the states involved. Finally, we use this information on optimal solutions to give an analytical proof of the triangle inequality for the induced quantum Wasserstein divergences.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26335v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Waveguide-coupled photonic crystal cavities with a triangular cross section fabricated by angled etching are suitable to interface embedded color centers with flying photonic qubits in quantum information applications. Moreover, their fabrication requires fewer processing steps compared to nanostructures produced by quasi-isotropic undercutting. As an alternative to established hole-based photonic crystal cavities, we introduce corrugated triangular 'Dinosaur' photonic crystal cavities, and develop a tapered, quasi loss-free cavity-waveguide interface to adiabatically interconvert Bloch and waveguide modes. We optimize the cavity-waveguide interface to minimize photon losses and demonstrate that its adjustment allows precise tuning of the light-matter interaction.</description>

      <title>Spin-orbit coupled spin-boson model : A variational analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spin-boson (SB) model is a standard prototype for quantum dissipation, which we generalize in this work, to explore the dissipative effects on a one-dimensional spin-orbit (SO) coupled particle in the presence of a sub-ohmic bath. We analyze this model by extending the well-known variational polaron approach, revealing a localization transition accompanied by an intriguing change in the spectrum, for which the doubly degenerate minima evolves to a single minimum at zero momentum as the system-bath coupling increases. For translational invariant system with conserved momentum, a continuous magnetization transition occurs, whereas the ground state changes discontinuously. We further investigate the transition of the ground state in the presence of harmonic confinement, which effectively models a quantum dot-like nanostructure under the influence of the environment. In both the scenarios, the entanglement entropy of the spin-sector can serve as a marker for these transitions. Interestingly, for the trapped system, a cat-like superposition state corresponds to maximum entanglement entropy below the transition, highlighting the relevance of the present model for studying the effect of decoherence on intra-particle entanglement in the context of quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Ring-polymer instanton theory for tunneling between asymmetric wells</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26592v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Instanton theory has arisen as a practical tool for calculating tunneling splittings in molecular systems. Un- fortunately, the original formulation of instanton theory fundamentally breaks down when trying to calculate the level splitting in asymmetric double wells, as there is no imaginary-time periodic orbit connecting the two non-degenerate minima. We have therefore developed a new formulation of instanton theory based on a projected flux correlation function that is applicable to these asymmetric systems. Comparison with exact quantum-mechanical results in one- and two-dimensional models demonstrates that it has a reasonably high accuracy, similar to that reported for instanton theory in the symmetric case. The theory is then applied to study tunneling between non-degenerate minima in the biomolecule $\alpha$-fenchol, for which we find good agree- ment with experiment. Finally, we use the connection to instanton rate theory, which is also derived from flux correlation functions, to discuss the often misunderstood relationship between tunneling splittings and reaction rate constants.</description>

      <title>Wavefront Curvature and Transverse Atomic Motion in Time-Resolved Atom Interferometry: Impact and Mitigation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.26739v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Time-resolved atom interferometry, as employed in applications such as gravitational wave detection and searches for ultra-light dark matter, requires precise control over systematic effects. In this work, we investigate phase noise arising from shot-to-shot fluctuations in the atoms' transverse motion in the presence of the wavefront curvature of the interferometer beam, and analyse its dependence on the laser-beam geometry in long-baseline, large-momentum-transfer atom interferometers. We use a semi-classical framework to derive analytical expressions for the effective phase perturbation in position-averaged measurements and validate them using Monte Carlo simulations. Applied to 100-m and 1-km atom gradiometers representative of next-generation experiments, the model shows that configurations maximizing pulse efficiency also amplify curvature-induced phase noise, requiring micron-level control of the atom cloud's centre-of-mass position and sub-micron-per-second control of its centre-of-mass velocity to achieve sub-$10^{-5}$ rad phase stability. Alternative beam geometries can suppress this noise by up to two orders of magnitude, but at the cost of reduced pulse efficiency. To address this limitation, we propose a mitigation strategy based on position-resolved phase-shift readout, which empirically learns and corrects the wavefront-induced bias from measurable quantities such as the phase-shift gradient and final cloud position. This approach restores high-sensitivity operation in the maximum-pulse-efficiency configuration without detailed beam characterisation, providing a practical route towards next-generation, time-resolved atom interferometers operating at the $10^{-5}$ rad noise level.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.26780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study wavepackets that propagate across (a) topological interfaces in quantum spin systems exhibiting non-invertible symmetries and (b) duality defects coupling dual theories. We demonstrate that the transmission is always perfect, and that a particle traversing the interface is converted into a nonlocal string-like excitation. We give a systematic way of constructing such a defect by identifying its Hilbert space with the virtual bond dimension of the matrix product operator representing defect lines. Our work both gives an operational meaning to topological interfaces, and provides a lattice analogue of recent results solving the monopole paradox in quantum field theory.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.11350v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Relaxing the postulates of an axiomatic theory is a natural way to find more general theories, and historically, the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry is a famous example of this procedure. Here, we use this way to extend quantum mechanics by ignoring the heart of Heisenberg's quantum mechanics -- We do not assume the existence of a position operator that satisfies the Heisenberg commutation relation, $[\hat x,\hat p]=i\hbar$. The remaining axioms of quantum theory, besides Galilean symmetry, lead to a more general quantum theory with a free parameter $l_0$ of length dimension, such that as $l_0 \to 0$ the theory reduces to standard quantum theory. Perhaps surprisingly, this non-Heisenberg quantum theory, without a priori assumption of the non-commutation relation, leads to a modified Heisenberg uncertainty relation, $\Delta x \Delta p\geq \sqrt{\hbar^2/4+l_0^2(\Delta p)^2}$, which ensures the existence of a minimal position uncertainty, $l_0$, as expected from various quantum gravity studies. By comparing the results of this framework with some observed data, which includes the first longitudinal normal modes of the bar gravitational wave detector AURIGA and the $1S-2S$ transition in the hydrogen atom, we obtain upper bounds on the $l_0$.</description>

      <title>Imposing Constraints on Driver Hamiltonians and Mixing Operators: From Theory to Practical Implementation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01975v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Driver Hamiltonians and Mixing Operators that satisfy constraints is an important part of ansatz construction for many quantum algorithms. In this manuscript, we give general algebraic expressions for finding Hamiltonian terms and analogously unitary primitives, that satisfy constraint embeddings and use these to give complexity characterizations of the related problems. Finding operators that enforce classical constraints is proven to be NP-Complete in the general case; we also give an algorithmic procedure with worse-case polynomial runtime to find any operators with a constant locality bound - a useful result since many constraints imposed admit local operators to enforce them in practice. We then give algorithmic procedures to turn these algebraic primitives into Hamiltonian drivers and unitary mixers that can be used for Constrained Quantum Annealing (CQA) and Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) constructions by tackling practical problems related to finding an appropriate set of reduced generators and defining corresponding drivers and mixers accordingly. We apply these concepts to the construction of ansaetze for 1-in-3 SAT instances. We consider the ordinary x-mixer QAOA, a novel QAOA approach based on the maximally disjoint subset, and a QAOA approach based on the disjoint subset as well as higher order constraint satisfaction terms. We empirically benchmark these approaches on instances sized between $ 12 $ and $ 22 $, showing the best relative performance for the tailored ansaetze and that exponential curve fits on the results are consistent with a quadratic speedup by utilizing alternative ansaetze to the X-mixer. We provide general algorithmic prescriptions for finding driver or mixing terms that satisfy embedded constraints that can be utilized to probe quantum speedups for constraints problems with linear, quadratic, or even higher order polynomial constraints.</description>

      <title>A New Framework for Quantum Phases in Open Systems: Steady State of Imaginary-Time Lindbladian Evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03239</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03239v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study delves into the concept of quantum phases in open quantum systems, examining the shortcomings of existing approaches that focus on steady states of Lindbladians and highlighting their limitations in capturing key phase transitions. In contrast to these methods, we introduce the concept of imaginary-time Lindbladian evolution as an alternative framework. This new approach defines gapped quantum phases in open systems through the spectrum properties of the imaginary-Liouville superoperator. We find that, in addition to all pure gapped ground states, the Gibbs state of a stabilizer Hamiltonian at any finite temperature can also be characterized by our scheme, demonstrated through explicit construction. Moreover, the closing of the imaginary Liouville gap is associated with the divergence of the Markov length, which has recently been proposed as an indicator of phase transitions in open quantum systems. To illustrate the effectiveness of this framework, we apply it to investigate the phase diagram for open systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma}\times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry, including cases with nontrivial average symmetry protected topological order or spontaneous symmetry breaking order. Our findings demonstrate universal properties at quantum criticality, such as nonanalytic behaviors of steady-state observables, divergence of correlation lengths, and closing of the imaginary-Liouville gap. These results advance our understanding of quantum phase transitions in open quantum systems. In contrast, we find that the steady states of real-time Lindbladians do not provide an effective framework for characterizing phase transitions in open systems.</description>

Abstract: Rapid progress in quantum technology has transformed quantum computing and quantum information science from theoretical possibilities into tangible engineering challenges. Breakthroughs in quantum algorithms, quantum simulations, and quantum error correction are bringing useful quantum computation closer to fruition. These remarkable achievements have been facilitated by advances in quantum characterization, verification, and validation (QCVV). QCVV methods and protocols enable scientists and engineers to scrutinize, understand, and enhance the performance of quantum information-processing devices. In this tutorial, we review the fundamental principles underpinning QCVV, and introduce a diverse array of QCVV tools used by quantum researchers. We define and explain QCVV's core models and concepts -- quantum states, measurements, and processes -- and illustrate how these building blocks are leveraged to examine a target system or operation. We survey and introduce protocols ranging from simple qubit characterization to advanced benchmarking methods. Along the way, we provide illustrated examples and detailed descriptions of the protocols, highlight the advantages and disadvantages of each, and discuss their potential scalability to future large-scale quantum computers. This tutorial serves as a guidebook for researchers unfamiliar with the benchmarking and characterization of quantum computers, and also as a detailed reference for experienced practitioners.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.22084v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This manuscript introduces a computationally efficient method to calculate the nonlinearity of a quantum feature map, as well as a method for determining whether a quantum feature map will have a high concentration of quantum states. The technique analyzes quantum operators, through an extension of the functions of von Neumann entropy and state-transition pseudo-entropy, by deriving a method to extract the entropy of an operator. The technique is denoted as operator pseudo-entropy, is rigorously derived, and is generally complex valued; as with state-transition pseudo-entropy, complex values contain a lot of information about entanglement or nonlinearity. The characteristics of a class of quantum feature maps are rigorously shown. The operator pseudo-entropy is illuminated through experiments and compared with von Neumann entropy and state-transition pseudo-entropy. We end the manuscript with open questions and potential directions for further research.</description>

Abstract: In quantum computing, Trotter estimates are critical for enabling efficient simulation of quantum systems and quantum dynamics, help implement complex quantum algorithms, and provide a systematic way to control approximate errors. In this paper, we extend the analysis of Trotter-Suzuki approximations, including third and higher orders, to Jordan-Banach algebras. We solve an open problem in our earlier paper on the existence of second-order Trotter formula error estimation in Jordan-Banach algebras. To illustrate our work, we apply our formula to simulate Trotter-factorized spins, and show improvements in the approximations. Our approach demonstrates the adaptability of Trotter product formulas and estimates to non-associative settings, which offers new insights into the applications of Jordan algebra theory to operator dynamics.</description>

      <title>Quantum transistors for heat flux in and out of working substance parts: harmonic vs transmon and Kerr environs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11629v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum thermal transistors have been widely studied in the context of three-qubit systems, where each qubit interacts separately with a Markovian harmonic bath. Markovianity is an assumption that is imposed on a system if the environment loses its memory within short while, while non-Markovianity is a general feature, inherently present in a large fraction of realistic scenarios. Instead of Markovian environments, here we propose a transistor in which the interaction between the working substance and an environment comprising of an infinite chain of qutrits is based on periodic collisions. We refer to the device as a working-substance thermal transistor, since the model focuses on heat currents flowing in and out of each individual qubit of the working substance to and from different parts of the system and environment. We find that the transistor effect prevails in this apparatus and we depict how the amplification of heat currents depends on the temperature of the modulating environment, the system-environment coupling strength and the interaction time. We further show that there exists a non-zero amplification even if one of the environments, that is not the modulating one, is detached from the system. Additionally, the environment, being comprised of three-level systems, allows us to consider the effects of frail perturbations in the energy-spacings of the qutrit, leading to a non-linearity in the environment. We consider non-linearities that are either of transmon- or of Kerr-type. We find parameter ranges where there is a significant amplification for both transmon- and Kerr-type non-linearities in the environment. Finally, we detect the non-Markovianity induced in the system from a non-monotonic behavior of the amplification observed with respect to time, and quantify it using the distinguishability-based measure of non-Markovianity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.08293v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a class of linear correlation witnesses that detects bound entanglement within a three-party prepare-and-measure scenario with four-dimensional quantum messages. We relate the detection power of our witnesses for two-ququart Bloch-product-diagonal states to that of the computable cross norm-realignment (CCNR) criterion. Several bound entangled states in four or even higher dimensions, including those which are useful in metrology, can exceed the separable bound computed by reliable iterative methods. In particular, we show that a prominent two-ququart bound entangled state with a positive partial transpose (PPT) can be mixed with up to $40\%$ isotropic noise and still be detected as entangled by our prepare-and-measure witness. Furthermore, our witnesses appear to be experimentally practical, requiring only the use of qubit rotations on Alice's and Bob's sides and product qubit measurements with binary outcomes on Charlie's side.</description>

      <title>Transport in a System with a Tower of Quantum Many-Body Scars</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10387v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the observation of unconventional transport phenomena in a spin-1 model that supports a tower of quantum many-body scars, and we discuss their properties uncovering their peculiar nature. In quantum many-body systems, the late-time dynamics of local observables are typically governed by conserved operators with local densities, such as energy and magnetization. In the model under investigation, however, there is an additional dynamical symmetry restricted to the subspace of the Hilbert space spanned by the quantum many-body scars. The latter significantly slows the decay of autocorrelation functions of certain coherent states of quantum many-body scars and is responsible for the unconventional form of transport that we detect numerically. We show that excited states with energy close to that of the quantum many-body scars play a crucial role in sustaining the transport. Finally, we propose a generalized eigenstate thermalization hypothesis to describe specific properties of states with energy close to the scars.</description>

      <title>Scaling active spaces in simulations of surface reactions through sample-based quantum diagonalization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.10923v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum-chemical simulations are essential for predicting energies of chemical reactions. Accurately solving the many-body Schr\"odinger equation for reagent and product states of most relevant chemical process is, however, unfeasible. Quantum computing offers a pathway for predicting energies of correlated electronic systems with localized interactions. Here, we apply a quantum embedding approach for investigating oxygen reduction reactions at the electrode surface in Lithium batteries, a representative example of energetic analysis in localized chemical reactions. We employ an Active Space Selection method based on Density Difference Analysis for identifying the orbitals involved in the reaction. Leveraging the Local Unitary Cluster Jastrow ansatz for state preparation, the active-space orbitals are then processed on a quantum computer. As quantum algorithms, we use Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization, SQD, and its extended version, Ext-SQD, which integrates electronic excitations into the quantum-selected electronic configuration subspace. The largest configurations are represented by quantum circuits mapped onto 80 qubits of an IBM Heron R2 quantum processing unit. For up to 12 orbitals, we are able to benchmark the quantum-computed reaction energies against results obtained with Complete Active Space Configuration Interaction. For benchmarking results in active spaces as large as 32 orbitals, we resort to Heat-Bath Configuration Interaction and Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles calculations, respectively. At 27 orbitals, the Ext-SQD results exhibit prediction accuracy improvements with regard to the standard, quantum-chemical reference methods that remain computationally feasible at that scale. The results indicate the potential of sample-based quantum diagonalization for performing high-accuracy reaction modeling in chemistry and materials science.</description>

      <title>Tracking time-varying signals with quantum-enhanced atomic magnetometers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum entanglement, in the form of spin squeezing, is known to improve the sensitivity of atomic instruments to static or slowly-varying quantities. Sensing transient events presents a distinct challenge, requires different analysis methods, and has not been shown to benefit from entanglement in practically-important scenarios such as spin-precession magnetometry (SPM). Here we adapt estimation control techniques introduced in [PRX Quantum 6, 030331 (2025)] to the experimental setting of SPM and analogous techniques. We demonstrate that real-time tracking of fluctuating fields benefits from measurement-induced spin squeezing and that quantum limits dictated by decoherence are within reach of today's experiments. We illustrate this quantum advantage by single-shot tracking, within the coherence time of a spin-precession magnetometer, of a magnetocardiography signal overlain with broadband noise.</description>

      <title>Spin-Phonon Relaxation of Boron-Vacancy Centers in Two-Dimensional Boron Nitride Polytypes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00154v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials hosting color centers and spin defects are emerging as key platforms for quantum technologies. However, the impact of reduced dimensionality on the spin-lattice relaxation time ($T_1$) of embedded defect spins -- critical for quantum applications -- remains largely unexplored. In this study, we present a systematic first-principles investigation of the negatively charged boron-vacancy (V$_{\text{B}}^-$) defect in monolayer boron nitride (BN), as well as in AA$^\prime$-stacked hexagonal BN (hBN) and ABC-stacked rhombohedral BN (rBN). Our results reveal that the $T_1$ times of V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in monolayer BN and hBN are nearly identical at room temperature. Surprisingly, despite the symmetry reduction in rBN opening additional spin relaxation channels, V$_{\text{B}}^-$ exhibits a longer $T_1$ compared to hBN. We attribute this effect to the stiffer out-of-plane phonon modes in rBN, which activate spin-phonon relaxation at reduced strength. These findings suggest that V$_{\text{B}}^-$ in rBN offers enhanced spin coherence properties, making it a promising candidate for quantum technology applications.</description>

      <title>Digital quantum simulations of scattering in quantum field theories using W states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03111v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: High-energy particle collisions can convert energy into matter through the inelastic production of new particles. Quantum computers are an ideal platform for simulating the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of collisions and the formation of subsequent many-particle states. In this work, evidence for inelastic particle production is observed in one-dimensional Ising field theory using IBM's quantum computers. The scattering experiment is performed on 104 qubits of ibm_marrakesh and uses up to 5,589 two-qubit gates to access the post-collision dynamics. An outgoing heavy particle produced in the collision is identified from the skewness of the measured energy density. Integral to this computation is a new quantum algorithm for preparing the initial state (wavepackets) of a quantum field theory scattering simulation. This method efficiently prepares wavepackets by extending recent protocols for creating W states with mid-circuit measurement and feedforward. The required circuit depth is independent of wavepacket size and spatial dimension, representing a superexponential improvement over previous methods. Our wavepacket preparation algorithm can be applied to a wide range of lattice models and is demonstrated in one-dimensional Ising field theory, scalar field theory, the Schwinger model and two-dimensional Ising field theory.</description>

      <title>Phase Transitions in Open Dicke Model: a degenerate perturbation theory approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.12696v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the steady-state behavior of the open Dicke model, which describes the collective interaction of $N$ spin-$1/2$ particles with a lossy, quantized cavity mode and exhibits a superradiant phase transition above a critical light-matter coupling. While the standard model conserves total spin, Kirton and Keeling \cite{PhysRevLett.118.123602} demonstrated that even infinitesimal homogeneous local dephasing destroys this phase transition, and that local atomic decay can restore it. We analyze this interplay using degenerate perturbation theory across subspaces of fixed total spin, $S$. For coupling strengths above the threshold, there exists a critical spin value $S_c$ such that the superradiant phase transition occurs only for $S&gt;S_c$. The perturbative approach captures how weak dephasing and decay induce mixing between different $S$-subspaces, yielding a steady-state spin distribution whose width scales as $1/\sqrt{N}$. This framework requires only the first and second moments and can be implemented via different methods that can yield these two moments (for example, the 2nd-cumulant approach), circumventing the need for full density matrix calculations. These results bridge the quantum Rabi model and Dicke physics, elucidate the roles of dephasing and decay in collective quantum effects, and apply broadly to open quantum systems with degenerate steady states.</description>

      <title>Sensing high-frequency ac fields via a two-qubit sensor</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.19729v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Quantum sensors allow us to measure weak oscillating fields with incredible precision. One common approach is to use the time evolution of a single two-level system (or a qubit) in conjunction with applied control pulses to measure the oscillating field. For high-frequency fields, the time interval required between the applied pulses decreases, meaning that errors due to the finite width of the pulses can become important. This paper presents an alternative scheme that does not rely on applying pulses with short time intervals. Our scheme uses two interacting qubits. In the presence of an oscillating field, the interaction strength changes. The oscillating field can be estimated by measuring the change in this interaction strength. We quantify the precision of this estimate by calculating the Fisher information. We show the effect of noise on our scheme and discuss how control pulses can be applied to mitigate the impact of noise. Importantly, the time interval between these pulses need not be very short.</description>

      <title>Line search by quantum logic spectroscopy enhanced with squeezing and statistical tests</title>

Abstract: In quantum logic spectroscopy, internal transitions of trapped ions and molecules can be probed by measuring the motional displacement caused by an applied light field of variable frequency. This provides a solution to ``needle in a haystack'' problems, such as the search for narrow clock transitions in highly charged ions, recently discussed by S. Chen et al. (Phys. Rev. Applied 22, 054059). The main bottleneck is the search speed over a frequency bandwitdh, which can be increased by enhancing the sensitivity of displacement detection. In this work, we explore two complementary improvements: the use of squeezed motional states and optimal statistical postprocessing of data using a hypothesis testing framework. We demonstrate that each method independently provides a substantial boost to search speed. Their combination effectively mitigates state preparation and measurement errors, improving the search speed by an order of magnitude and fully leveraging the quantum enhancement offered by squeezing.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.24392v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The quantum or quantum field theory concept of a complex wave function is useful for understanding the information transport in classical statistical generalized Ising models.
  We relate complex conjugation to the discrete transformations charge conjugation ($C$), parity ($P$) and time reversal ($T$).
  A subclass of generalized Ising models are probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) with deterministic updating and probabilistic initial conditions.
  Simple two-dimensional PCA correspond to discretized quantum field theories for Majorana--Weyl, Weyl or Dirac fermions.
  Momentum and energy are conserved statistical observables.
  For PCA describing free massless fermions we investigate the vacuum and field operators for particle excitations.
  For the correlation function one finds the Lorentz-invariant Feynman propagator of quantum field theory.
  Furthermore, these automata admit probabilistic boundary conditions that correspond to thermal equilibrium with the quantum Fermi--Dirac distribution.
  PCA with updating sequences of propagation and interaction steps can realize a rich variety of discrete quantum field theories for fermions with interactions.
  For information theory the quantum formalism for PCA sheds new light on deterministic computing or signal processing with probabilistic input.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.17547v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC) is a machine learning paradigm that harnesses dynamical systems as computational resources. In its quantum extension -- quantum reservoir computing (QRC) -- these principles are applied to quantum systems, whose rich dynamics broadens the landscape of information processing. In classical RC, optimal performance is typically achieved at the ``edge of chaos," the boundary between order and chaos. Here, we identify its quantum many-body counterpart using the QRC implemented on the celebrated Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Our analysis reveals substantial performance enhancements near two distinct characteristic ``edges": a temporal boundary defined by the Thouless time, beyond which system dynamics is described by random matrix theory, and a parametric boundary governing the transition from integrable to chaotic regimes. These findings establish the ``edge of many-body quantum chaos" as a design guideline for QRC.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22043v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the variational optimization of entangled probe states for quantum sensing tasks involving the estimation of a structured linear function of local phase parameters. Specifically, we consider scenarios where each qubit in a spin-1/2 array accumulates a phase phi_i = alpha_i * theta, with a known weight vector alpha, reducing the task to single-parameter estimation of theta. Using parameterized quantum circuits composed of dipolar-interacting gates and global rotations, we optimize probe states with respect to the Classical Fisher Information (CFI) using a gradient-free evolutionary strategy. We benchmark the optimized circuits for two relevant cases: (i) uniform encoding, where all qubits contribute equally to the phase function, and (ii) a custom encoding where a central qubit dominates the weight vector. In both cases, the optimized probe states approach the respective entanglement-enhanced (EE) limits dictated by the encoding structure. Our results demonstrate the power of variational approaches for tailoring metrologically useful entanglement to specific estimation tasks in quantum sensor networks.</description>

      <title>Reducing Circuit Depth in Lindblad Simulation via Step-Size Extrapolation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.22341v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study algorithmic error mitigation via Richardson-style extrapolation for quantum simulations of open quantum systems modelled by the Lindblad equation. Focusing on two specific first-order quantum algorithms, we perform a backward-error analysis to obtain a step-size expansion of the density operator with explicit coefficient bounds. These bounds supply the necessary smoothness for analyzing Richardson extrapolation, allowing us to bound both the deterministic bias and the shot-noise variance that arise in post-processing. For a Lindblad dynamics with generator bounded by $l$, our main theorem shows that an $n=\Omega (\log(1/\varepsilon))$-point extrapolator reduces the maximum circuit depth needed for accuracy $\varepsilon$ from polynomial $\mathcal{O} ((lT)^{2}/\varepsilon)$ to polylogarithmic $\mathcal{O} ((lT)^{2} \log l \log^2(1/\varepsilon))$ scaling, an exponential improvement in~$1/\varepsilon$, while keeping sampling complexity to the standard $1/\varepsilon^2$ level, thus extending such results for Hamiltonian simulations to Lindblad simulations. Several numerical experiments illustrate the practical viability of the method.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.18056v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of entanglement generation in an external quantum system via interaction with a quantum autonomous thermal machine (QATM) under non-Markovian dynamics. The QATM, composed of two qubits each coupled to independent thermal reservoirs, interacts with an external system of two additional qubits. By analyzing the Hilbert space structure, energy level configurations, and temperature gradients, we define a common interaction between the QATM qubits and the external system qubits, which allows the definition of two thermodynamic cycles (A and B) governed by virtual temperatures and energy-conserving transitions. We demonstrate that the QATM can act as a structured reservoir capable of inducing non-Markovian memory effects, as highlighted by negative entropy production rates. Using mutual information and concurrence, we show that entanglement is generated only under cycle A, which is associated with stronger non-Markovian behavior and higher coherence correlations. Our results demonstrate that temperature differences, Hilbert space structure, and coherence serve as quantum resources for controlling and enhancing entanglement in quantum thermodynamic settings, with parameters consistent with experimental superconducting qubit platforms.</description>

Abstract: Non-Gaussian operations are essential for most bosonic quantum technologies. Yet, realizable non-Gaussian gates are rather limited in type and generally suffer from accuracy-duration trade-offs. In this work, we propose to use quantum signal processing (QSP) techniques to engineer non-Gaussian gates on hybrid qumode-qubit systems. For systems with dispersive coupling, our scheme can generate a new non-Gaussian gate that produces a phase shift depending on the modulus of the boson number. This gate reproduces the selective number-dependent arbitrary phase (SNAP) gates under certain parameter choices, but with higher accuracy within a short, fixed and excitation-independent interaction time. The gate unlocks new applications, for example, in entangling logical qudits and deterministically generating multi-component cat states. Additionally, our versatile QSP formalism can be extended to systems with other interactions, and also engineer non-unitary operations, such as noiseless linear amplification and generalized-parity measurement.</description>

      <title>Quantum Potential from the Material Derivative of the Osmotic Velocity: A Two-Fluid Madelung Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.02868v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We derive the quantum potential directly from the material derivative of the osmotic velocity and formulate a two-fluid model that reproduces the Madelung equations. Interactions between the fluids are included but remain secondary. The framework is generalized to incorporate electromagnetic fields, yielding self-consistent description of both the Schrodinger and Klein-Gordon equations. Extenstion to the relativistic Klein-Gordon case demonstrates the model's flexibility and applicability to spinless relativistic quantum systems. This approach unifies hydrodynamic, kinematic, and electromagnetic perspectives, providing a clear physical interpretation of quantum potentials and forces and offering a versatile platform for modeling complex quantum systems in both non-relativistic and relativistic regimes.</description>

      <title>Ion-Based Characterization of Laser Beam Profiles for Quantum Information Processing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.03966v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laser-driven operations are a common approach for engineering one- and two-qubit gates in trapped-ion arrays. Measuring key parameters of these lasers, such as beam sizes, intensities, and polarizations, is central to predicting and optimizing gate speeds and stability. Unfortunately, it is challenging to accurately measure these properties at the ion location within an ultra-high vacuum chamber. Here, we demonstrate how the ions themselves may be used as sensors to directly characterize the laser beams needed for quantum gate operations. Making use of the four-photon Stark Shift effect in $^{171}$Yb$^+$ ions, we measure the profiles, alignments, and polarizations of the lasers driving counter-propagating Raman transitions. We then show that optimizing the parameters of each laser individually leads to higher-speed Raman-driven gates with smaller susceptibility to errors. Our approach demonstrates the capability of trapped ions to probe their local environments and to provide useful feedback for improving system performance.</description>

      <title>Correcting quantum errors using a classical code and one additional qubit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05008</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05008v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical error-correcting codes are powerful but incompatible with quantum noise, which includes both bit-flips and phase-flips. We introduce Hadamard-based Virtual Error Correction (H-VEC), a protocol that empowers any classical bit-flip code to correct arbitrary Pauli noise with the addition of only a single ancilla qubit and two layers of controlled-Hadamard gates. Through classical post-processing, H-VEC virtually filters the error channel, projecting the noise into pure Y-type errors that are subsequently corrected using the classical code's native decoding algorithm. We demonstrate this by applying H-VEC to the classical repetition code. Under a code-capacity noise model, the resulting protocol not only provides full quantum protection but also achieves an exponentially stronger error suppression (in distance) than the original classical code. The improvements over the surface code are even more pronounced, while using far fewer qubits, simpler checks, and straightforward decoding. There are some limitations to the technique, most notably that H-VEC introduces a sampling overhead due to its post-processing nature. Nonetheless, it represents a fundamentally novel hybrid quantum error correction and mitigation framework that redefines the trade-offs between physical hardware requirements and classical processing for error suppression.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.07515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2021, Chen, Liu, and Zhandry presented an efficient quantum algorithm for the average-case $\ell_\infty$-Short Integer Solution ($\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$) problem, in a parameter range outside the normal range of cryptographic interest, but still with no known efficient classical algorithm. This was particularly exciting since $\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$ is a simple problem without structure, and their algorithmic techniques were different from those used in prior exponential quantum speedups.
  We present efficient classical algorithms for all of the $\mathrm{SIS}^\infty$ and (more general) Constrained Integer Solution problems studied in their paper, showing there is no exponential quantum speedup anymore.</description>

Abstract: We demonstrate that Liouvillian exceptional points (LEPs), previously explored only in continuous Lindbladian dynamics, also emerge in discrete brickwork completely positive trace-preserving (CPTP) circuits. By analytically solving a minimal two-qubit brickwork model, we identify the conditions under which discrete-time LEPs arise and show that they retain the hallmark square-root eigenvalue splitting and linear-in-time sensitivity enhancement. These results establish a direct bridge between continuous non-Hermitian physics and discrete quantum-circuit architectures, opening a path toward the realization of exceptional-point-based sensing on near-term quantum processors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11200v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Classical simulation of open quantum system dynamics remains challenging due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space, the need to accurately capture dissipation and decoherence, and the added complexity of memory effects in the non-Markovian regime. We develop an efficient algorithm for simulating both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics in large one-dimensional quantum systems. Extending the Tensor Jump Method, which combines TDVP-based tensor-network evolution with a Suzuki-Trotter decomposition of stochastic trajectories, our approach incorporates time-dependent decay rates-treating positive rates as time-inhomogeneous Markovian processes and negative rates via the Influence Martingale formalism to unravel time-local non-Markovian dynamics. This resource-efficient framework enables scalable simulations of open-system dynamics in the non-Markovian regime, as demonstrated for a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising chain comprising up to 100 spin qubits.</description>

      <title>Cryo-CMOS Antenna for Wireless Communications within a Quantum Computer Cryostat</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.13627v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scaling quantum computers from a few qubits to large numbers remains one of the critical challenges in realizing practical quantum advantage. Multi-core quantum architectures have emerged as a promising solution, enabling scalability through distributed quantum processing units (QPUs) interconnected via classical and quantum links. However, the bottleneck of wired connections persists, as densely packed wired interconnects, both vertically across temperature stages and horizontally within the same layer, introduce spatial constraints, power dissipation, and latency, which could hinder performance as the number of QPUs increases. To overcome these limitations, this work proposes a cryo-compatible on-chip differential dipole antenna operating at 28 GHz to enable short-range wireless communication within a quantum computer cryostat. Temperature-dependent material properties are incorporated to accurately capture antenna behavior at 4 K. Moreover, by embedding the antenna in a realistic cryostat structure, we evaluate the feasibility of antenna operation within the cryogenic environment. The proposed antenna achieves a reflection coefficient of -20.8 dB in free space and -18.38 dB within the cryostat, demonstrating efficient impedance matching.</description>

      <title>Quantifying Unextendibility via Virtual State Extension</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.24895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Monogamy of entanglement, which limits how entanglement can be shared among multiple parties, is a fundamental feature underpinning the privacy of quantum communication. In this work, we introduce a novel operational framework to quantify the unshareability or unextendibility of entanglement via a virtual state-extension task. The virtual extension cost is defined as the minimum simulation cost of a randomized protocol that reproduces the marginals of a $k$-extension. For the important family of isotropic states, we derive an exact closed-form expression for this cost. Our central result establishes a tight connection: the virtual extension cost of a maximally entangled state equals the optimal simulation cost of universal virtual quantum broadcasting. Using the algebra of partially transposed permutation matrices, we obtain an analytical formula and construct an explicit quantum circuit for the optimal broadcasting protocol, thereby resolving an open question in quantum broadcasting. We further relate the virtual extension cost to the absolute robustness of unextendibility, providing it with a clear operational meaning, and show that the virtual extension cost is an entanglement measure that bounds distillable entanglement and connects to logarithmic negativity.</description>

Abstract: We address the realization of Maximum Weighted Independent Set (MWIS) and quantum Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problems under Pasqal's neutral-atom QPU constraints: limited qubit number, bounds on {\Omega} and {\Delta}, sequence duration, confinement space, minimum distances, and parasitic interactions. To obtain results directly compatible with current hardware, we propose a new detuning computation method that mitigates parasitic interactions in arbitrary asymmetric graphs. Three variants are introduced, matching different hardware maturity levels: (I) a theoretical local-detuning approach; (II) a Detuning Map Modulation (DMM) method bridging theory and near-term feasibility; and (III) a global-pulse implementation suitable for current QPUs. All were evaluated on Pasqal's emulators for graphs up to 30 qubits, demonstrating realistic, transferable performance within present-day hardware limits.</description>

      <title>Protein-Based Electrical Junctions with Robust Biocompatible Carbon Electrodes Exhibit Activation-less Charge Transport down to 10 K</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11409v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The integration of functional proteins into solid-state electronic devices remains a central challenge in molecular bioelectronics due to the fragile nature of protein structures and their complex charge-transport behaviour. Here, we present a robust crosswire evaporated top-contact device based on bacteriorhodopsin (bR) single bilayers (SBL), configured as Au/Cys/bR(SBL)/eC/Au (simplified as Au/bR/eC). The evaporated carbon (eC) top electrode forms a conformal, non-invasive contact that suppresses filament formation and ensures electrical integrity across the cross-wire intersecting area (about 200 micron^2). Structural and spectroscopic analyses confirm that the solid-state bR films maintain the native absorption spectrum and have functional photocycle activity after electrode deposition, implying that their native conformation is not significantly affected. Remarkably, electron transport (ETp) through the 9 nm bR-SBL junctions is temperature-independent within 300 K - 10 K, excluding thermally activated hopping, while the length is incompatible with coherent tunneling. Under green illumination, the junctions exhibit a reversible, photo-induced current enhancement (Jgreen/Jdark = 2), ascribed to light-driven conformational changes rather than direct photoexcitation. The Au/bR/eC architecture thus establishes a thermally non-activated, conformationally mediated transport mechanism via a stable, cryo-compatible solid-state protein junction. This work provides a scalable platform for integrating light-responsive biomolecules into future bio-optoelectronic and neuromorphic devices.</description>

      <title>Scaling up the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.07441v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Explicitly correlated methods, such as the transcorrelated method which shifts a Jastrow or Gutzwiller correlator from the wave function to the Hamiltonian, are designed for high-accuracy calculations of electronic structures, but their application to larger systems has been hampered by the computational cost. We develop improved techniques for the transcorrelated density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), in which the ground state of the transcorrelated Hamiltonian is represented as a matrix product state (MPS), and demonstrate large-scale calculations of the ground-state energy of the two-dimensional Fermi-Hubbard model. Our developments stem from three technical inventions: (i) constructing matrix product operators (MPO) of transcorrelated Hamiltonians with low bond dimension and high sparsity, (ii) exploiting the entanglement structure of the ground states to increase the accuracy of the MPS representation, and (iii) optimizing the non-linear parameter of the Gutzwiller correlator to mitigate the non-variational nature of the transcorrelated method. We examine systems of size up to $12 \times 12$ lattice sites, four times larger than previous transcorrelated DMRG studies, and demonstrate that transcorrelated DMRG yields significant improvements over standard non-transcorrelated DMRG for equivalent computational effort. Transcorrelated DMRG reduces the error of the ground state energy by $3\times$-$17 \times$, with the smallest improvement seen for a small system at half-filling and the largest improvement in a dilute closed-shell system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.18675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We explore the finite-density phase diagram of the single-flavour Gross-Neveu-Wilson (GNW) model using matrix product state (MPS) simulations. At zero temperature and along the symmetry line of the phase diagram, we find a sequence of inhomogeneous ground states that arise through a real-space version of the mechanism of Hilbert-space fragmentation. For weak interactions, doping the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase of the GNW model leads to localized charges or holes at periodic arrangements of immobile topological defects separating the fragmented subchains: a topological crystal. Increasing the interactions, we observe a transition into a parity-broken phase with a pseudoscalar condensate displaying a modulated periodic pattern. This soliton lattice is a sequence of topological charges corresponding to anti-kinks, which also bind the doped fermions at their respective centers. Out of this symmetry line, we show that quasi-spiral profiles appear with a characteristic wavevector set by the density $k = 2{\pi}{\rho}$, providing non-perturbative evidence for chiral spirals beyond the large-N limit. These results demonstrate that various exotic inhomogeneous phases can arise in lattice field theories, and motivate the use of quantum simulators to confirm such QCD-inspired phenomena in future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.03219v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thermoelectricity is generally understood as a classical effect emerging from energy-dependent transport asymmetries. Here we uncover a purely quantum mechanism, where a superconducting S-I-S' tunnel junction in thermal equilibrium develops a nonlinear bipolar thermoelectric response owing to the dynamical Coulomb blockade and the emission-absorption imbalance of a cold electromagnetic bath. Two representative environments are analysed, revealing Seebeck coefficients up to 100 $\mu$V/K for realistic junction parameters. Because the response directly reflects the spectral properties of the surrounding environment, our results suggest that bipolar quantum thermoelectricity could provide a new route for spectroscopic sensing of electromagnetic modes and for designing low-temperature thermoelectric devices with environmentally engineered performance.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.10781v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To evaluate a quantum circuit on a quantum processor, one must find a mapping from circuit qubits to processor qubits and plan the instruction execution while satisfying the processor's constraints. This is known as the qubit mapping and routing (QMR) problem. High-quality QMR solutions are key to maximizing the utility of scarce quantum resources and minimizing the probability of logical errors affecting computation. The challenge is that the landscape of quantum processors is incredibly diverse and fast-evolving. Given this diversity, dozens of papers have addressed the QMR problem for different qubit hardware, connectivity constraints, and quantum error correction schemes by a developing a new algorithm for a particular context. We present an alternative approach: automatically generating qubit mapping and routing compilers for arbitrary quantum processors. Though each QMR problem is different, we identify a common core structure-device state machine-that we use to formulate an abstract QMR problem. Our formulation naturally leads to a compact domain-specific language for specifying QMR problems and a powerful parametric algorithm that can be instantiated for any QMR specification. Our thorough evaluation on case studies of important QMR problems shows that generated compilers are competitive with handwritten, specialized compilers in terms of runtime and solution quality.</description>

Abstract: Superconducting qubits have motivated the exploration of Josephson-junction technologies beyond quantum computing, with emerging applications in low-energy photon and phonon detection for astrophysics and dark matter searches. Achieving sensitivity at the THz (meV) scale requires materials with smaller superconducting gaps than those of conventional aluminum or niobium-based devices. Here, we report the fabrication and characterization of hafnium (Hf)-based Josephson junctions (Hf-HfOx-Hf), demonstrating Hf as a promising low-Tc material platform for ultra-low threshold single THz photon and single-phonon detection. Structural and chemical analyses reveal crystalline films and well-defined oxide barriers, while electrical transport measurements at both room and cryogenic temperatures exhibit clear Josephson behavior, enabling extraction of key junction parameters such as critical current, superconducting gap and normal-state resistance. This work presents the first comprehensive study of Hf-based junctions and their potential for next-generation superconducting detectors and qubit architectures leveraging low superconducting gap energies.</description>
