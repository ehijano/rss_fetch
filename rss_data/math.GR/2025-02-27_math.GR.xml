      <title>On Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19372v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cellular automata are a fundamental computational model with applications in mathematics, computer science, and physics. In this work, we explore the study of cellular automata to cases where the universe is a group, introducing the concept of \( \phi \)-cellular automata. We establish new theoretical results, including a generalized Uniform Curtis-Hedlund Theorem and linear \( \phi \)-cellular automata. Additionally, we define the covering map for \( \phi \)-cellular automata and investigate its properties. Specifically, we derive results for quotient covers when the universe of the automaton is a circulant graph. This work contributes to the algebraic and topological understanding of cellular automata, paving the way for future exploration of different types of covers and their applications to broader classes of graphs and dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>CayleyPy RL: Pathfinding and Reinforcement Learning on Cayley Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.18663v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second in a series of studies on developing efficient artificial intelligence-based approaches to pathfinding on extremely large graphs (e.g. $10^{70}$ nodes) with a focus on Cayley graphs and mathematical applications. The open-source CayleyPy project is a central component of our research. The present paper proposes a novel combination of a reinforcement learning approach with a more direct diffusion distance approach from the first paper. Our analysis includes benchmarking various choices for the key building blocks of the approach: architectures of the neural network, generators for the random walks and beam search pathfinding. We compared these methods against the classical computer algebra system GAP, demonstrating that they "overcome the GAP" for the considered examples. As a particular mathematical application we examine the Cayley graph of the symmetric group with cyclic shift and transposition generators. We provide strong support for the OEIS-A186783 conjecture that the diameter is equal to n(n-1)/2 by machine learning and mathematical methods. We identify the conjectured longest element and generate its decomposition of the desired length. We prove a diameter lower bound of n(n-1)/2-n/2 and an upper bound of n(n-1)/2+ 3n by presenting the algorithm with given complexity. We also present several conjectures motivated by numerical experiments, including observations on the central limit phenomenon (with growth approximated by a Gumbel distribution), the uniform distribution for the spectrum of the graph, and a numerical study of sorting networks. To stimulate crowdsourcing activity, we create challenges on the Kaggle platform and invite contributions to improve and benchmark approaches on Cayley graph pathfinding and other tasks.</description>

      <title>Low rank groups of Lie type acting point and line-primitively on finite generalised quadrangles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.03790v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Suppose we have a finite thick generalised quadrangle whose automorphism group $G$ acts primitively on both the set of points and the set of lines. Then $G$ must be almost simple. In this paper, we show that $\operatorname{soc}(G)$ cannot be isomorphic to $\operatorname{Sz}(2^{2m+1})$ or $\operatorname{Ree}(3^{2m+1})$ where $m$ is a positive integer.</description>

      <title>Proportion of Nilpotent Subgroups in Finite Groups and Their Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11724</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.11724v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces and investigates the function $J(G) = \frac{\text{Nil}(G)}{L(G)}$, where $\text{Nil}(G)$ denotes the number of nilpotent subgroups and $L(G)$ the total number of subgroups of a finite group $G$. The function $J(G)$, defined over the interval $(0,1]$, serves as a tool to analyze structural patterns in finite groups, particularly within non-nilpotent families such as supersolvable and dihedral groups. Analytical results demonstrate the product density of $J(G)$ values in $(0,1]$, highlighting its distribution across products of dihedral groups. Additionally, a probabilistic analysis was conducted, and based on extensive computational simulations, it was conjectured that the sample mean of $J(G)$ values converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution, in accordance with the Central Limit Theorem, as the sample size increases. These findings expand the understanding of multiplicative functions in group theory, offering novel insights into the structural and probabilistic behavior of finite groups.</description>

      <title>On residues and conjugacies for germs of 1-D parabolic diffeomorphisms in finite regularity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13182</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13182v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study conjugacy classes of germs of non-flat diffeomorphisms of the real line fixing the origin. Based on the work of Takens and Yoccoz, we establish results that are sharp in terms of differentiability classes and order of tangency to the identity. The core of all of this lies in the invariance of residues under low-regular conjugacies. This may be seen as an extension of the fact (also proved in this article) that the value of the Schwarzian derivative at the origin for germs of $C^3$ parabolic diffeomorphisms is invariant under $C^2$ parabolic conjugacy, though it may vary arbitrarily under parabolic $C^1$ conjugacy.</description>

      <title>Essentially tight bounds for rainbow cycles in proper edge-colourings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04460v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: An edge-coloured graph is said to be rainbow if no colour appears more than once. Extremal problems involving rainbow objects have been a focus of much research over the last decade as they capture the essence of a number of interesting problems in a variety of areas. A particularly intensively studied question due to Keevash, Mubayi, Sudakov and Verstra\"ete from 2007 asks for the maximum possible average degree of a properly edge-coloured graph on $n$ vertices without a rainbow cycle. Improving upon a series of earlier bounds, Tomon proved an upper bound of $(\log n)^{2+o(1)}$ for this question. Very recently, Janzer-Sudakov and Kim-Lee-Liu-Tran independently removed the $o(1)$ term in Tomon's bound, showing a bound of $O(\log^2 n)$. We prove an upper bound of $(\log n)^{1+o(1)}$ for this maximum possible average degree when there is no rainbow cycle. Our result is tight up to the $o(1)$ term, and so it essentially resolves this question. In addition, we observe a connection between this problem and several questions in additive number theory, allowing us to extend existing results on these questions for abelian groups to the case of non-abelian groups.</description>

      <title>The plus construction with respect to subrings of the rationals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.11839v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We construct explicit models of universal $H \mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$-acyclic spaces $\mathcal M$, for any subset $J$ of the prime numbers. The corresponding nullification functors provide thus plus construction functors for ordinary homology with $\mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$ coefficients. Motivated by classical results about Quillen's plus construction for integral homology, we prove that the $H \mathbb{Z}[J^{-1}]$-acyclization functor and the $\mathcal M$-cellularization functor coincide. We show that the acyclization-plus construction fiber sequence is always a cofiber sequence for simply connected spaces, but almost never so when the plus construction is not simply connected, unlike in the classical case.</description>
