      <title>Predicting First-Passage Dynamics in Disordered Systems Exactly: Application to Sparse Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10140</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10140v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantifying how spatial disorder affects the movement of a diffusing particle or agent is fundamental to target search studies. When diffusion occurs on a network, that is on a highly disordered environment, we lack the mathematical tools to calculate exactly the temporal characteristics of search processes, instead relying on estimates provided by stochastic simulations. To close this knowledge gap we devise a general methodology to represent analytically the movement and search dynamics of a diffusing random walk on sparse graphs. We show its utility by uncovering the existence of a bi-modality regime in the time-dependence of the first-passage probability to hit a target node in a small-world network. By identifying the network features that give rise to the bi-modal regime, we challenge long-held beliefs on how the statistics of the so-called direct, intermediate, and indirect trajectories influence the shape of the resulting first-passage and first-absorption probabilities and the interpretation of their mean values. Overall these findings show that temporal features in first-passage studies can be utilised to unearth novel transport paradigms in spatially heterogeneous environments.</description>

      <title>Run-and-tumble dynamics with non-reciprocal transitions between three velocity states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties of active particles undergoing a three-state run-and-tumble dynamics in one dimension, induced by non-reciprocal transition rates between self-propelling velocity states $\{-v, 0, +v\}$ that explicitly break microscopic reversibility. Departing from conventional reciprocal models, our formulation introduces a minimal yet rich framework for studying non-equilibrium transport driven by internal state asymmetries. Using kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and analytical methods, we characterize the particle's transport properties across the transition-rates space. The model exhibits a variety of non-equilibrium behaviors, including ballistic transport, giant diffusion, and Gaussian or non-Gaussian transients, depending on the degree of asymmetry in the transition rates. We identify a manifold in transition-rate space where long-time diffusive behavior emerges despite the absence of microscopic reversibility. Exact expressions are obtained for the drift, effective diffusion coefficient, and moments of the position distribution. Our results establish how internal-state irreversibility governs macroscopic transport, providing a tractable framework to study non-equilibrium active motion beyond reciprocal dynamics.</description>

      <title>FreeBird.jl: An Extensible Toolbox for Simulating Interfacial Phase Equilibria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present FreeBird.jl, an extensible Julia-based platform for computational studies of phase equilibria at generic interfaces. The package supports a range of system configurations, from atomistic solid surfaces to coarse-grained lattice$-$gas models, with energies evaluated using classical interatomic potentials or lattice Hamiltonians. Both atomistic and lattice systems accommodate single- or multi-component mixtures with flexibly definable surface and lattice geometries. Implemented sampling algorithms include nested sampling, Wang$-$Landau sampling, Metropolis Monte Carlo, and, for tractable lattice systems, exact enumeration. Leveraging Julia's type hierarchies and multiple dispatch, FreeBird.jl provides a modular interface that allows seamless integration of system definitions, energy evaluators, and sampling schemes. Designed for flexibility, extensibility, and performance, FreeBird.jl offers a versatile framework for exploring the thermodynamics of interfacial phenomena.</description>

      <title>Colored Sandpile</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10403</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10403v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: After the introduction of sandpile model a number of different variants have been studied. In most of
  these models sand particles are indistinguishable. Here we have painted the sand particles using a
  few distinct colors, and restrict them to move in linear trajectories only along their assigned lattice axes,
  one axis reserved for one color. Different colored particles interact among themselves through the
  toppling of unstable sand columns. Consequently, the avalanches or in general the self-organization
  processes in the sandpile has no overall preferred direction, though the individual particles
  execute directed motion. For such non-abelian colored sandpiles the steady states are found to be
  different and also the avalanche size distributions. This sandpile so defined has a non-trivial spatial
  structure and belongs to a different universality class of sandpile models. Dynamics of a granular heap
  with grains of different colors and properties may be described using this sandpile.</description>

      <title>Variational boundary based tensor network renormalization group</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10418</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10418v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a real-space renormalization group algorithm for accurately coarse-graining two-dimensional tensor networks. The central innovation of our method lies in utilizing variational boundary tensors as a globally optimized environment for the entire system. Based on this optimized environment, we construct renormalization projectors that significantly enhance accuracy. By leveraging the canonical form of tensors, our algorithm maintains the same computational complexity as the original tensor renormalization group (TRG) method, yet achieves higher accuracy than existing approaches that do not incorporate entanglement filtering. Our work offers a practical pathway for extending TRG methods to higher dimensions while keeping computational costs manageable.</description>

      <title>Jamming of active particles in narrow pores: Implications for ratchet effect and diffusion coefficient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10483</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10483v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the behavior of colloidal active particles interacting via steric repulsion in various quasi-1D geometries. We mainly focus on active particles with high P\'eclet number. We discuss 3 phenomena closely tied to those systems: motility-induced phase separation (or dynamical freezing), ratchet effect (which takes place if the geometry has broken spatial symmetry), and the enhanced diffusion coefficient. We study those particles using numerical simulations employing an ASEP-like model. Besides direct numerical simulations we study the model by mean-field approximation and by solving the coarse-grained hydrodynamic equations.</description>

      <title>Fractal depth-first search paths in statistical physics models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10502v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fractal properties of depth-first search (DFS) paths in critical configurations of statistical physics models, including the two-dimensional $O(n)$ loop model for various $n$, and bond percolation in dimensions $d = 2$ to $6$. In the $O(n)$ loop model, the fractal dimension of the DFS path consistently matches that of the external perimeter, suggesting DFS as a convenient alternative for probing interface geometry. For bond percolation, the DFS path exhibits nontrivial fractal scaling across all studied dimensions, even in $d &gt; 2$ where the external perimeter is not well defined. Interestingly, when DFS is applied to the full lattice without any dilution or criticality, the path is still fractal in two dimensions, with a dimension close to $7/4$, but becomes space-filling in higher dimensions. Our results demonstrate that DFS offers a robust and broadly applicable geometric probe for exploring critical phenomena beyond traditional observables.</description>

      <title>Moment closure through spectral expansion in open stochastic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The derivation of dynamical laws for general observables (or moments) from the master equation for the probability distribution remains a challenging problem in statistical physics. Here, we present an alternative formulation of the general spectral expansion, which clarifies the connection between the relaxation dynamics of arbitrary moments and the intrinsic time scales of the system. Within this framework, we address the moment-closure problem in a way that streamline the conventional treatment of open systems. The effectiveness of the theory is illustrated by deriving analytical expressions for two representative cases: spectral amplification in stochastic resonance and the moment dynamics of a non-Gaussian system, namely the Bessel process with constant drift. We also identify a direct relationship between our theory and the Koopman operator approach. Finally, we apply our approach to the nonlinear and out-of-equilibrium mean-field description of interacting excitatory and inhibitory populations.</description>

      <title>Random Permutation Circuits are Quantum Chaotic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Random permutation circuits were recently introduced as minimal models for local many-body dynamics that can be interpreted both as classical and quantum. Standard indicators of chaos such as damage spreading, show that these systems exhibit sensitivity to initial conditions in the classical setting. Here, we address their quantum chaoticity by studying the time evolution of local operator entanglement (LOE). We show that the behaviour of LOE in random permutation circuits depends on the dimension of the local configuration space q. When q = 2, i.e. the circuits act on qubits, random permutations are Clifford and the LOE of any local operator is bounded by a constant, indicating that they are not truly chaotic. On the other hand, when the dimension of the local configuration space exceeds two, the LOE grows linearly in time. We prove this in the limit of large dimensions and present numerical evidence that a three-dimensional local configuration space is sufficient for a linear growth of LOE. Our findings highlight that quantum chaos can be produced by essentially classical dynamics. Moreover, we show that LOE can be defined also in the classical realm and put it forward as a universal indicator chaos, both quantum and classical.</description>

      <title>Run-and-Tumble Escape in Pursuit-Evasion Dynamics of Intelligent Active Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.10727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The pursuit-evasion game is studied for two adversarial active agents, modelled as a deterministic self-steering pursuer and a stochastic, cognitive evader. The pursuer chases the evader by reorienting its propulsion direction with limited maneuverability, while the evader escapes by executing sharp, unpredictable turns, whose timing and direction the pursuer cannot anticipate. To make the target responsive and agile when the threat level is high, the tumbling frequency is set to increase with decreasing distance from the pursuer; furthermore, the range of preferred tumbling directions is varied. Numerical simulations of such a pursuit-target pair in two spatial dimensions reveal two important scenarios. For dominant pursuers, the evader is compelled to adopt a high-risk strategy that allows the pursuer to approach closely before the evader executes a potentially game-changing backward maneuver to pull away from the pursuer. Otherwise, a strategy where the evader tumbles forward with continuous slight adjustments of the propulsion direction can significantly increase the capture time by preventing the pursuer from aligning with the target propulsion direction, while maintaining the persistence of the target motion. Our results can guide the design of bioinspired robotic systems with efficient evasion capabilities.</description>

      <title>Defining classical and quantum chaos through adiabatic transformations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01927</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.01927v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a formalism which defines chaos in both quantum and classical systems in an equivalent manner by means of \textit{adiabatic transformations}. The complexity of adiabatic transformations which preserve classical time-averaged trajectories (quantum eigenstates) in response to Hamiltonian deformations serves as a measure of chaos. This complexity is quantified by the (properly regularized) fidelity susceptibility. Physically this measure quantifies long time instabilities of physical observables due to small changes in the Hamiltonian of the system. Our exposition clearly showcases the common structures underlying quantum and classical chaos and allows us to distinguish integrable, chaotic but non-thermalizing, and ergodic/mixing regimes. We apply the fidelity susceptibility to a model of two coupled spins and demonstrate that it successfully predicts the universal onset of chaos, both for finite spin $S$ and in the classical limit $S\to\infty$. Interestingly, we find that finite $S$ effects are anomalously large close to integrability.</description>

      <title>Evaluation of the probability current in the stochastic path integral formalism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14004v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The probability current is a vital quantity in the Fokker-Planck description of stochastic processes. It characterizes non-equilibrium stationary states and appears in linear response calculations. We recover and review the probability current in the Onsager-Machlup functional approach to Markov processes by deriving a self-contained expression in general non-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relations using field theoretical methods. The derived formulas hold for non-constant drift and diffusion tensors and are explicitly evaluated in an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with non-reciprocal interactions specified as a harmonically bound particle in shear flow. Our work clarifies the concept of the probability current -- familiar from the Fokker-Planck equation -- in the path integral approach.</description>

      <title>Symmetries, Conservation Laws and Entanglement in Non-Hermitian Fermionic Lattices</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.08557v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Non-Hermitian quantum many-body systems feature steady-state entanglement transitions driven by the competition between unitary dynamics and dissipation. In this work, we reveal the fundamental role of conservation laws in shaping this competition. Focusing on translation-invariant non-interacting fermionic models with U(1) symmetry, we present a theoretical framework to understand the structure of the steady-state of these models and their entanglement content based on two ingredients: the nature of the spectrum of the non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and the constraints imposed on the steady-state single-particle occupation by the conserved quantities. These emerge from an interplay between Hamiltonian symmetries and initial state, due to the non-linearity of measurement back-action. For models with complex energy spectrum, we show that the steady state is obtained by filling single-particle right eigenstates with the largest imaginary part of the eigenvalue. As a result, one can have partially filled or fully filled bands in the steady-state, leading to an entanglement entropy undergoing a filling-driven transition between critical sub volume scaling and area-law, similar to ground-state problems. Conversely, when the spectrum is fully real, we provide evidence that local observables can be captured using a diagonal ensemble, and the entanglement entropy exhibits a volume-law scaling independently on the initial state, akin to unitary dynamics. We illustrate these principles in the Hatano-Nelson model with periodic boundary conditions and the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, uncovering a rich interplay between the single-particle spectrum and conservation laws in determining the steady-state structure and the entanglement transitions. These conclusions are supported by exact analytical calculations and numerical calculations relying on the Faber polynomial method.</description>

      <title>Critical Behavior Analysis of Pure Dipolar Triangular Lattice via Equilibrium and Non-Equilibrium Monte Carlo Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.04282v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Magnetic thin films and 2D arrays of magnetic nanoparticles exhibit unique physical properties that make them valuable for a wide range of technological applications. In such systems, dipolar interactions play a crucial role in determining their physical behavior. However, due to the anisotropic and long-range nature of dipolar interactions, conventional Monte Carlo (MC) methods face challenges in investigating these systems near criticality. In this study, we examine the critical behavior of a triangular lattice of XY dipoles using the optimized Tomita MC algorithm tailored for dipolar interactions. We employ two independent computational approaches to estimate the critical temperature and exponents: equilibrium MC simulations with histogram reweighting and the non-equilibrium relaxation method. Notably, both approaches demonstrate that this XY dipolar system might be in a new universality class very close to the 2D Ising universality class.</description>

      <title>Beyond the Electric Dipole Approximation: Electric and Magnetic Multipole Contributions Reveal Biaxial Water Structure from SFG Spectra at the Air-Water Interface</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.19856v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The interpretation of sum-frequency generation (SFG) spectra has been severely limited by the absence of quantitative theoretical predictions of higher-order multipole contributions. The previously unknown magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole contributions are determined by bulk properties but appear in all experimental SFG spectra, obscuring the connection between measured spectra and interfacial structure. We present the simulation-based framework that predicts the full set of multipole spectral contributions. This framework also yields depth-resolved spectra, enabling the precise localization of spectroscopic features. Applied to the air-water interface, our approach achieves quantitative agreement with experimental spectra for different polarization combinations in both the bending and stretching regions. Higher-order multipole contributions are crucial for correctly interpreting SFG spectra: in the bending band, the electric dipole and the magnetic dipole contributions have similar intensities, and the electric quadrupole contribution is significantly larger. In the OH-stretch region, the electric quadrupole contribution is found to be responsible for the mysterious shoulder at 3600 cm$^{-1}$. Crucially, subtracting the quadrupole and magnetic contributions isolates the second-order electric dipole susceptibility, which is a quantitative probe for interfacial orientational anisotropy. This electric-dipole susceptibility reveals a pronounced biaxial ordering of water at the air-water interface. By resolving a fundamental limitation of the interpretation of SFG spectroscopy, our framework allows for the detailed extraction of interfacial water ordering from SFG spectra.</description>

      <title>Certified algorithms for equilibrium states of local quantum Hamiltonians</title>

Abstract: Predicting observables in equilibrium states is a central yet notoriously hard question in quantum many-body systems. In the physically relevant thermodynamic limit, certain mathematical formulations of this task have even been shown to result in undecidable problems. Using a finite-size scaling of algorithms devised for finite systems often fails due to the lack of certified convergence bounds for this limit. In this work, we design certified algorithms for computing expectation values of observables in the equilibrium states of local quantum Hamiltonians, both at zero and positive temperature. Importantly, our algorithms output rigorous lower and upper bounds on these values. This allows us to show that expectation values of local observables can be approximated in finite time, contrasting related undecidability results. When the Hamiltonian is commuting on a 2-dimensional lattice, we prove fast convergence of the hierarchy at high temperature and as a result for a desired precision $\varepsilon$, local observables can be approximated by a convex optimization program of quasi-polynomial size in $1/\varepsilon$.</description>

      <title>Open system dynamics from fundamental Lagrangian</title>

Abstract: Lagrangians can differ by a total derivative without altering the equations of motion, thus encoding the same physics. This is in general true both classically and quantum mechanically. We show, however, that in the context of open quantum systems, two Lagrangians that differ by a total derivative can lead to different physical predictions. We then discuss the criterion that allows one to choose between such Lagrangians. Further, starting from the appropriate QED Lagrangian, we derive the master equation for the non-relativistic electron interacting with thermal photons upto second order in the interactions. This case study lends further phenomenological support to our proposed criterion.</description>

      <title>Minimal mechanism for flocking in phoretically interacting active particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07050</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07050v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Collective motion as a flock is a widely observed phenomenon in active matter systems. We report a flocking transition mechanism in a system of chemically interacting active colloidal particles sustained purely by chemo-repulsive torques at low to medium densities. The basic requirements to maintain the polar liquid flock are excluded volume repulsions and deterministic long-ranged net repulsive torques. The mechanism we report requires that the time scale individual colloids move a unit length to be dominant with respect to the time they deterministically sense chemicals. This can be equivalently interpreted as pair colloids sliding a minimal unit length before deterministically rotating due to chemical interactions. Switching on the translational repulsive forces renders the flock a crystalline structure. We complement these results with an analysis of a continuum hydrodynamic model, with the transition corresponding to destabilization of the flocking state.</description>

      <title>Efficient mutual magic and magic capacity with matrix product states</title>

Abstract: Stabilizer R\'enyi entropies (SREs) probe the non-stabilizerness (or magic) of many-body systems and quantum computers. Here, we introduce the mutual von-Neumann SRE and magic capacity, which can be efficiently computed in time $O(N\chi^3)$ for matrix product states (MPSs) of bond dimension $\chi$. We find that mutual SRE characterizes the critical point of ground states of the transverse-field Ising model, independently of the chosen local basis. Then, we relate the magic capacity to the anti-flatness of the Pauli spectrum, which quantifies the complexity of computing SREs. The magic capacity characterizes transitions in the ground state of the Heisenberg and Ising model, randomness of Clifford+T circuits, and distinguishes typical and atypical states. Finally, we make progress on numerical techniques: we design two improved Monte-Carlo algorithms to compute the mutual $2$-SRE, overcoming limitations of previous approaches based on local update. We also give improved statevector simulation methods for Bell sampling and SREs with $O(8^{N/2})$ time and $O(2^N)$ memory, which we demonstrate for $24$ qubits. Our work uncovers improved approaches to study the complexity of quantum many-body systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent Bifurcations in Quantum Circuit Stability from Hidden Parameter Statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.00484v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The compression of quantum circuits is a foundational challenge for near-term quantum computing, yet the principles governing circuit stability remain poorly understood. We investigate this problem through a large-scale numerical analysis of 300 structurally-uniform circuits across 10, 12, and 14 qubits. Despite their macroscopic uniformity, we find that each ensemble universally bifurcates into distinct robust and fragile classes. We solve the puzzle of this emergent bifurcation, demonstrating that its origin is not structural, but is instead encoded in the statistical properties of the gate rotation parameters. Fragile circuits consistently exhibit a universal signature of ``statistical brittleness,'' characterized by low parameter variability and a scarcity of small-angle gates. We uncover the underlying physical mechanism for this phenomenon: Paradoxical Importance where smaller-angle gates are counter-intuitively more critical to the circuit's function, an effect most pronounced in fragile circuits. This reliance on fine-tuning explains why statistically brittle circuits are uniquely vulnerable to failure under compression. These findings establish a new framework for engineering resilient quantum algorithms, shifting the focus from macroscopic structure to the microscopic statistical properties of a circuit's parameters.</description>

      <title>Measurement-Based Quantum Diffusion Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08799</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08799v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce measurement-based quantum diffusion models that bridge classical and quantum diffusion theory through randomized weak measurements. The measurement-based approach naturally generates stochastic quantum trajectories while preserving purity at the trajectory level and inducing depolarization at the ensemble level. We address two quantum state generation problems: trajectory-level recovery of pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery of mixed states. For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score matching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the reverse process. For ensemble-average recovery, we introduce local Petz recovery maps for states with finite correlation length and classical shadow reconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error bounds. Our framework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations of reverse Fokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum recovery channels and classical stochastic reversals. This work enables new approaches to quantum state generation with potential applications in quantum information science.</description>
