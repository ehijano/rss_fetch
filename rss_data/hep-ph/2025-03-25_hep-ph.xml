      <title>Evaluating the faithfulness of PDF uncertainties in the presence of inconsistent data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We critically assess the robustness of uncertainties on parton distribution functions (PDFs) determined using neural networks from global sets of experimental data collected from multiple experiments. We view the determination of PDFs as an inverse problem, and we study the way the neural network model tackles it when inconsistencies between input datasets are present. We use a closure test approach, in which the regression model is applied to artificial data produced from a known underlying truth, to which the output of the model can be compared and its accuracy can be assessed in a statistically reliable way. We explore various phenomenologically relevant scenarios in which inconsistencies arise due to incorrect estimation of correlated systematic uncertainties. We show that the neural network generally corrects for the inconsistency except in cases of extreme uncertainty underestimation. When the inconsistency is not corrected, we propose and validate a procedure to detect inconsistencies.</description>

      <title>Three-loop large-$N_c$ virtual corrections to $gg\to HH$ in the forward limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17449v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute the three-loop form factors for $gg\to HH$ in the limit of vanishing transverse momentum of the Higgs boson which provides a reasonable approximation of the cross section. In our calculations we adopt the large-$N_c$ limit, which already includes non-trivial non-planar Feynman diagrams. We discuss the results for top quark masses in the pole and $\overline{\rm MS}$ schemes and show that the scheme dependence is significantly reduced at next-to-next-to-leading order.</description>

      <title>Probing the general axion-nucleon interaction in water Cherenkov experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider an axion flux on Earth consistent with emission from the Supernova explosion SN 1987A. Using Chiral Perturbation Theory augmented with an axion, we calculate the energy spectrum of $a + N \to N + \gamma$ as well as $a + N \to N + \pi^0$, where $N$ denotes a nucleon in a water tank, such as the one planned for the Hyper-Kamiokande neutrino detection facility. Our calculations assume the most general axion-quark interactions, with couplings constrained either solely by experimental data, or by specific theory scenarios.
  We find that even for the QCD axion -- whose interaction strength with matter is at its weakest as compared with axion-like particles -- the expected \v{C}herenkov-light spectrum from neutrino-nucleon interactions is modified in a potentially detectable way. Furthermore, detectability appears significantly more promising for the $N + \pi^0$ final state, as its spectrum peaks an order of magnitude higher and at energies twice as large compared to the $N + \gamma$ counterpart. Given the rarity of SN events where both the neutrino and the hypothetical axion burst are detectable, we emphasize the importance of identifying additional mechanisms that could enhance such signals.</description>

      <title>Higgs-portal vector dark matter at a low reheating temperature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17621v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study vector dark matter (DM) production with Higgs-portal type interactions in the scenarios with a low reheating temperature which can be realized by a prolonged decay of the inflaton after inflation. We take the reheating temperature to be large enough to match the observations in Standard Cosmology such as Big Bang Nucleosynthesis but small enough below the DM mass for the DM production. We analyze the impact of the model parameters including the extra gauge coupling and the reheating temperature on the DM relic density, collider bounds and DM direct and indirect detection experiments. Our results reveal a strong correlation between the DM mass ($M_{W_D}$) and the reheating temperature ($T_R$) with ratio of around $T_R/M_{W_D} \sim 0.1$ to obtain correct DM density for detectable interaction strength. The decay processes are generally subdominant for the DM production but they can be important when kinematically allowed and the DM mass is close to half of the Higgses mass. The DM production with DM masses below 100 GeV is driven primarily by the scatterings of the SM fermions and Higgses decay whereas the case with higher DM masses is achieved mainly due to the Higgses scatterings. The enhanced coupling for the strong freeze-in in our framework enables potential detection prospects in direct and indirect detections and collider experiments. The parameter space of the model has already been explored partly by the current direct detection experiments and it can be explored further by future experiments such as Darwin. On the other hand, the indirect detection experiments in the current and near future are not sensitive enough to test our model.</description>

      <title>High-precise determination of critical exponents in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17642</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17642v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The precise determination of critical exponents is crucial for understanding the properties of strongly interacting matter under extreme conditions. These exponents are fundamentally linked to the system's behavior near the critical end point (CEP), making precise localization of the CEP essential. However, precisely identifying the CEP within the framework of AdS/CFT correspondence presents considerable challenges. In this study, we explore critical phenomena and critical exponents within a holographic QCD model. We achieve high-precision calculations of the CEP's position and dynamically analyze the behavior of the critical exponent as it approaches the CEP using limiting methods. Our results indicate that linear fitting is only appropriate in regions very close to the CEP. Furthermore, we find that although the values of the critical exponents vary when approaching the CEP from different directions, they ultimately converge to a single fixed value, revealing a universal behavior among these exponents. Our research underscores the importance of precisely determining the CEP, selecting the fitting region, and considering the direction of the approach when predicting critical exponents. These findings establish a vital benchmark for identifying critical phenomena and their associated exponents.</description>

      <title>Lam-Tung relation breaking effects and weak dipole moments at lepton colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17663</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17663v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breaking of the Lam-Tung relation in the Drell-Yan process at the LHC exhibits a long-standing tension with the Standard Model (SM) prediction at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ accuracy. This tension could be explained by weak dipole interactions of leptons and quarks, associated with the $Z$-boson within the framework of the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). In this paper, we propose to cross-check these weak dipole interactions by measuring the violation effects of the Lam-Tung relation at future lepton colliders through the processes $e^+e^- \to Z\gamma \to \ell\bar{\ell}\gamma$ and $e^+e^- \to Z\gamma \to q\bar{q}\gamma$. By considering different decay modes of the $Z$-boson, these channels exhibit distinct sensitivities to various dipole operators, providing a way to disentangle their individual effects. Additionally, the high flavor-tagging efficiencies at lepton colliders could provide strong constraints on the dipole interactions of heavy quarks, such as $b$ and $c$ quarks, which are challenging to probe in the Drell-Yan process at the LHC due to the suppression of parton distribution functions.</description>

      <title>The $\eta_c$ leading-twist distribution amplitude and the $B_c \to \eta_c\ell\bar\nu_\ell$ semi-leptonic decays using the QCD Sum Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17957v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the semi-leptonic decays $B_c \to \eta_c\ell\bar\nu_\ell$ by using the QCD sum rules within the framework of Standard Model (SM) and discuss the possibility of searching for signatures of New Physics (NP) beyond the SM. We first derive the $\xi$-moments $\langle\xi_{2;\eta_c}^{n}\rangle$ of the leading-twist distribution amplitude $\phi_{2;\eta_c}$ for $\eta_c$-meson by using QCD sum rules within the background field theory. Considering contributions from the vacuum condensates up to dimension-six, the first two non-zero $\xi$-moments at the scale of $4$ GeV are found to be $\langle\xi_{2;\eta_c}^{2}\rangle = 0.103^{+0.009}_{-0.009}$ and $\langle\xi_{2;\eta_c}^{4}\rangle = 0.031^{+0.003}_{-0.003}$. Using these moments, we fix the Gegenbauer expansion series of $\phi_{2;\eta_c}$ and apply it to calculate the $B_c \to \eta_c$ transition form factors (TFFs) by using the QCD light-cone sum rules. We then extrapolate those TFFs to physically allowable $q^2$-range via a simplified series expansion, and we obtain $R_{\eta_c}|_{\rm SM} = 0.308^{+0.084}_{-0.062}$. Furthermore, we explore the potential impacts of various new physics scenarios on $R_{\eta_c}$. Especially, we calculate the forward-backward asymmetry $\mathcal{A}_{\rm FB}({q^2})$, the convexity parameter $\mathcal{C}_F^\tau ({q^2})$, and the longitudinal and transverse polarizations $\mathcal{P}_L ({q^2})$ and $\mathcal{P}_T ({q^2})$ for $B_c \to \eta_c$ transitions within both the SM and two types of NP scenarios, respectively. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of $B_c$-meson semi-leptonic decays and provide insights into the search of NP beyond the SM.</description>

      <title>Search for doubly charmed dibaryons in baryon-baryon scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18014</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18014v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We perform a systematical investigation of the doubly charmed dibaryon system with quantum numbers $IJ=01$, and strangeness numbers $S=0$, $-2$ and $-4$ in the framework of the chiral quark model. Two resonance states with strangeness numbers $S=-2$ is obtained in the $\Lambda\Omega_{cc}$ scattering channel, which are $\Xi_{cc}^{\ast}\Xi$ with resonance mass 5081 MeV and decay width 0.3 MeV, and the $\Xi_{c}\Xi_{c}^{\ast}$ state with the mass 5213 MeV and decay width 19.8 MeV, respectively. These two predicted charmed dibaryon candidates are worth searching for experimentally. Besides, we would like to emphasize that the multi-channel coupling calculation is important to confirm the existence of multiquark states. The coupling can shift the energy of the resonance, give the width to the resonance and even destroy the resonance. Therefore, to provide the necessary information for experiments to search for exotic hadron states, the coupling calculation between the bound channels and open channels is indispensable.</description>

      <title>Chiral Anomaly Cancellation and Neutral Triple Gauge Boson Vertices in the SM EFT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate the cancellation of chiral anomalies in the Standard Model Effective Field Theory (SM EFT), achieved through by a consistent choice of loop momentum routing in triangle diagrams with dimension-6 operator insertions. By enforcing gauge invariance and Bose symmetry, we show that Goldstone boson contributions cancel anomalies arising from massive gauge boson vertices, preserving the consistency of the SM EFT. We compute neutral triple gauge boson vertices at one loop, revealing dominant contributions from dimension-6 operators at all energies below the EFT cutoff. A UV-complete anomaly-free model with a heavy vector-like electron validates our approach, illustrating how heavy fermion decoupling generates SM EFT operators while maintaining anomaly cancellation. Our results highlight the phenomenological relevance of these vertices for probing new physics at colliders, particularly through dimension-6 effects that scale as the inverse of the centre of mass energy squared, 1/s, offering a viable pathway for experimental detection.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Spin-1 resonances at the LH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18105</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18105v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin-1 resonances are among the states predicted by composite Higgs models and one expects them the have masses in the range of a few TeV. We focus here on models based on an underlying gauge-fermion description which predict QCD-coloured vector and axial-vector states as well as states charged under the electroweak gauge groups. The former can come as triplet, sextet and octet representation depending on the model details. All models considered have a colour octet vector state in common which can be singly produced at hadron colliders as it mixes with the gluon. We summarize here their LHC phenomenology and comment also on aspects relevant for future colliders.</description>

      <title>New physics from atmosphere: light sgoldstino case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a supersymmetric model with low scale supersymmetry breaking light sgoldstinos can appear in decays of mesons abundantly produced in atmospheric showers. We obtain bounds on parameter space of such a scenario from the Super-Kamiokande atmospheric neutrino oscillation data and estimate future sensitivity of the Hyper-Kamiokande project. We find that the bounds from the Super-Kamiokande results are weaker than constraints from existing searches by other experiments while the Hyper-Kamiokande detector can probe a still allowed part of the model parameter space.</description>

      <title>Dynamical dark energy from an ultralight axion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Collaboration presented evidence that the equation of state $w$ of the dark energy is varying, or $w \simeq -0.948$ if it is constant. In either case, the dark energy cannot be due to a cosmological constant alone. Here we introduce an ultralight axion (or axion-like particle) with mass $m_\phi \simeq 2 \times 10^{-33}$ eV that has properties that can explain the new $w$ measurement. In particular, $w\ge -1$ in this model, ruling out the $w &lt; -1$ region allowed by the DES data.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Waves from Resonant Transitions of Tidally Perturbed Gravitational Atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Light bosons can form gravitational atoms (GA) around spinning black holes through the superradiance process. Considering the black hole to be part of a binary system,the tidal potential of the companion periodically perturbs the GA such that an atomic transition occurs between two of its energy eigenstates. The resonant transition is modeled by the Landau-Zener system,where the orbital frequency of the companion determines the relevant transition. In this work, we study a novel gravitational wave signal originating directly from the atomic transition of the GA in a binary system. We derive the analytical formulae of both the strain waveform and frequency spectrum of the signal. We further present the GA-binary systems that can have a large signal-to-noise ratio in LISA's frequency band. Finally, we discuss the implications of detection of the signal:inferring model parameters,including the boson mass and black hole spin,and computing the phase shift and Doppler shift of the gravitational wave signal for equal mass binaries.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This article summarizes the main ideas behind creating an open database proposed for use in the exploration of generalized parton distributions (GPDs). This lightweight database is well suited for GPD phenomenology and is designed to store both experimental and lattice-QCD data. It can also aid in benchmarking GPD-related developments, such as GPD models. The database utilizes a new data format based on the YAML serialization language, enabling the storage of essential information for modern analyses, such as replica values. It includes interfaces for both Python and C++, allowing straightforward integration with analysis codes.</description>

      <title>Scalable architecture for dark photon searches: Superconducting-qubit proof of principle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The dark photon is a well-motivated candidate of dark matter due to its potential to open the window of new physics beyond the Standard Model. A fundamental mass-range-sensitivity dilemma is always haunting the dark photon searching experiments: The resonant haloscopes have excellent sensitivity but are narrowband, and vice versa for the non-resonant ones. A scalable architecture integrating numerous resonant haloscopes will be a desirable solution to this dilemma. However, even the concept of scalable searching remains rarely explored, due to the size limitation of conventional haloscopes imposed by the dark photon wavelength. Here we propose and demonstrate a novel architecture using superconducting qubits as sub-wavelength haloscope units. By virtue of the scalability of superconducting qubits, it is possible to integrate multiple qubits with different frequencies on a chip-scale device. Furthermore, the frequencies of the qubits can be tuned to extend the searching mass range. Thus, our architectures allow for searching for dark photons in a broad mass range with high sensitivity. As a proof-of-principle experiment, we designed and fabricated a three-qubit chip and successfully demonstrated a scalable dark-photon searching. Our work established constraints on dark photons in the mass range of 15.632 $\mu$eV$\sim$15.638 $\mu$eV, 15.838 $\mu$eV$\sim$15.845 $\mu$eV, and 16.463 $\mu$eV$\sim$16.468 $\mu$eV, simultaneously, and the constraints are much more stringent than the cosmology constraints. Our work can be scaled up in the future to boost the scrutiny of new physics and extended to search for more dark matter candidates, including dark photons, axions and axion-like particles.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Monopoles and Exotic States in $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18321v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the Pati-Salam gauge symmetry $SU(4)_c \times SU(2)_L \times SU(2)_R$ (4-2-2, for short), the observed quarks and leptons of each family reside in the bi-fundamental representations $(4,2,1)$ and $({\bar 4},1,2)$. There exist, however, the fundamental representations $(4,1,1)$, $(1,2,1)$ and $(1,1,2)$ and their hermitian conjugates, which show the presence, in principle, of yet to be discovered color triplets that carry electric charge $\pm{e/6}$, and color singlet particles with charges of $\pm{e/2}$. These Standard Model charges are in full accord with the fact that the 4-2-2 model predicts the presence of a topologically stable finite energy magnetic monopole that carries two quanta of Dirac magnetic charge, i.e., $4 \pi/e$, as well as color magnetic charge that is screened beyond the quark confinement scale. The 4-2-2 model therefore predicts the existence of exotic baryons, mesons and leptons that carry fractional ($\pm{e/2}$) electric charges. Since their origin lies in the fundamental representations of 4-2-2, these exotic particles may turn out to be relatively light, in the TeV mass range or so. The 4-2-2 magnetic monopole mass depends on the 4-2-2 symmetry breaking scale which may be as low as a few TeV.</description>

      <title>Finite-temperature effects on the threshold cusps in $\pi\pi$ and $D\bar{D}^{\ast}$ scatterings from relativistic heavy-ion collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate how the temperature influences the threshold cusps in meson-meson scatterings, i.e., $\pi\pi$ and $D\bar{D}^\ast$ (or $D^{\ast}\bar{D}$) scatterings, using the production rates and propagators obtained at finite temperature. The lineshape of production rate of $\pi\pi$ at different temperatures demonstrates that the cusp structure in $\pi\pi$ scattering is mildly enhanced as the temperature increases. As for the $\pi\pi$ propagator, which includes the isospin symmetry breaking, its lineshape displays a unique plateau-like structure and this structure will also be enhanced as the temperature increases. For comparison, the lineshape of the $D\bar{D}^\ast$ propagator including the isospin symmetry breaking is also investigated at different temperatures. As the temperature increases, its lineshape shows a similar plateau-like structure but with some different properties when the temperature modifications to the masses and widths of $D$ and $\bar{D}^\ast$ are considered.</description>

      <title>Non-perturbative suppression of the Chiral Magnetic Effect in Quark Gluon Plasma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18404</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper the non-perturbative suppression of the Chiral Magnetic Effect (CME) is investigated in the deconfined region of the QCD phase diagram (as a model for Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) emerging in Heavy Ion Collisions (HIC)), using the Kubo formula to calculate a linear response to the chiral imbalance, and the Field Correlator Method to address the strong interaction in QCD. The estimate suggests that CME is severely suppressed in most of the QCD phase diagram, except within a narrow strip at baryon densities above nuclear and temperatures just above the deconfinement transition. The result suggests refining the conditions under which the CME might be observable -- prioritizing the conditions at lower energy RHIC-BES, SPS and upcoming FAIR, NICA, J-PARC-HI, which supposedly produce high baryon density QGP, over the higher energy RHIC and LHC, which produce high temperature QGP.</description>

      <title>Isotropic cosmic birefringence from string axion domain walls without cosmic strings, and DESI results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18417</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18417v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) DR6 results showed a preference for isotropic cosmic birefringence, which is consistent with the previous analyses using the Planck and WMAP data. Independently, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) DR2 results further support that dark energy is evolving over the history of the universe, enhancing the possibility of new physics in the late-time universe. In this paper, we propose that if domain walls associated with the string axion are formed, the isotropic cosmic birefringence can be explained naturally. Interestingly, avoiding the domain wall problem, the domain wall formation is predicted to be much later than the epoch of recombination. Compared with the previous proposal of kilobyte cosmic birefringence, where domain wall formation occurs before recombination, the predicted rotation angle, $\beta \approx 0.21 c_\gamma$ deg with the anomaly coefficient $c_\gamma \approx 1$, does not suffer from the ambiguity of the population bias. The prediction is in excellent agreement with the ACT (and combined) data regarding cosmic birefringence. This scenario can be probed from the anisotropic birefringence for the photons emitted well after the recombination and the gravitational waves. In addition, the late-time dynamics of the axion contributes to the dark energy component, and we also study the relation to the DESI results.</description>

      <title>Future Collider Measurements for Cosmic Ray Induced Air Shower Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The identification of gamma-ray induced air showers with Cherenkov telescopes suffers from contamination with a specific class of cosmic ray induced air showers. The predictions for this background show strong discrepancies between the available event generators. In this study, we identify collision events of cosmic rays with atmospheric nuclei in which a large fraction of the original beam energy is transmitted to the electromagnetic part of the shower as the main source for this background. Consequently, we define a pseudorapidity region of interest for hadron collider experiments that corresponds to this background, taking into account the center-of-mass energy. This region of interest is compared with the available datasets and the pseudorapidity coverage of the detectors that recorded it. We find that the LHCf and RHICf detectors are the only ones covering substantial parts of this region of interest and suggest a measurement of the energy spectra of reconstructed neutral pions to be made with this data. Such results could serve as valuable constraints for a future parameter tuning of the event generators to improve the background estimation uncertainties for gamma-ray induced air shower identification.</description>

      <title>Dark Matter and Collider Phenomenology in Radiative Type-III Seesaw Model with Two Inert Doublets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18566v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate a minimal Type-III scotogenic model featuring two inert scalar doublets and a hyperchargeless triplet fermion. The scalar sector, in addition to the Standard Model Higgs, includes a rich spectrum of dark scalars comprising two CP-even, two CP-odd, and two charged states. This framework gives rise to two viable dark matter candidates: the lightest CP-even dark scalar and the neutral component of the triplet fermion. We perform a comprehensive analysis of both dark matter scenarios, carefully examining their viability under the umbrella of theoretical consistency conditions and experimental constraints. Beyond the conventional collider signatures anticipated in the Type-III scotogenic model with a single inert doublet, our extended framework predicts distinctive and novel signatures.</description>

      <title>Mixed CP Violation and Natural Alignment in 2HDMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18588v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new form of CP violation (CPV) that can be realised in Two-Higgs Doublet Models (2HDMs) and was studied recently in [1]. By examining the vacuum manifold of a generic (convex) 2HDM potential, we identify scenarios that exhibit Mixed Spontaneous and Explicit CP Violation (MCPV), in which at least two non-degenerate CP-violating local minima coexist. We illustrate how this identification is achieved at the tree level by determining the magnitude and phase of a novel complex parameter, which we call $r_{\rm CP}$. Since explicit CP Violation vanishes in 2HDMs where SM Higgs alignment is enforced through global continuous symmetries, we investigate how to maximise CPV in such scenarios by introducing soft or explicit breaking of the relevant symmetries. In doing so, we derive upper bounds on key CP-violating parameters that characterise misalignment with the SM, subject to constraints from the non-observation of the electron electric dipole moment. Finally, we delineate the region of the CP-violating parameter space in such constrained 2HDMs that can be further tested at the CERN Large Hadron Collider.</description>

      <title>Constraints on $\Delta L=2$ Vector Bosons with Tree Couplings to SM Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate phenomenological implications of vector bosons $V$ transforming as (1, 2, -3/2) under the standard model (SM) product gauge group $SU(3)_C$, $SU(2)_L$ and $U(1)_Y$. These vector bosons can couple to two SM leptons at tree-level forming dimension-4 operators. These operators dictate $V$ to have two units of global lepton number, $\Delta L = 2$. The operators generated conserve the global lepton number but can violate generational lepton numbers. We study constraints on the couplings $Y$ of $V$ to SM particles using tree-level processes such as $l_\alpha^{-} \to l_\beta^{+} l_\rho^{-} l_\sigma^{-}$, muonium and antimuonium oscillation, neutrino trident scattering, $e^- e^+ \to l^- l^+$, and also one-loop level processes such as the anomalous $g-2$ of a charged lepton and $l_i \to l_j \gamma$. Strong constraints are obtained from $l_\alpha^{-} \to l_\beta^{+} l_\rho^{-} l_\sigma^{-}$ with $\left|Y_{e e} Y^{*}_{\mu e}\right| &lt; 3.29 \times 10^{-11}\left(m_{V}/ \mathrm{GeV}\right)^{2},\left|Y_{e e} Y^{*}_{e \mu}\right| &lt; 3.29 \times 10^{-11}\left(m_{V}/ \mathrm{GeV}\right)^{2}$ and from $l_i \to l_j \gamma$ with $ \left|Y_{\tau e}Y_{\mu\tau}^{*}\right|&lt;3.46\times10^{-12}(m_{V}/ \mathrm{GeV})^2, \left|Y_{e \tau}Y_{\tau \mu}^{*}\right|&lt;3.46\times10^{-12}\left(m_{V}/ \mathrm{GeV}\right)^2$, respectively. The constraints obtained from other processes considered are much weaker.</description>

      <title>Analysis of three-body hadronic $D$-meson decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Motivated by recent experimental advances in three-body hadronic $D$ decays from BESIII, we present a systematic analysis of $D_{(s)} \to P_1 (V \to) P_2 P_3 $ decay processes, where $V$ denotes vector resonances ($\rho, K^*, \omega$, $\phi$) and $P_{1,2,3}$ are light pseudoscalar mesons ($\pi,K, \eta^{(\prime)}$). Using the factorization-assisted topological-amplitude (FAT) approach we calculate the intermediate subprocesses $D_{(s)} \to P_1 V$, incorporating relativistic Breit-Wigner distributions to model the subsequent $V \to P_2 P_3$ strong decays. By comprehensively including all relevant resonances ($\rho, K^*, \omega, \phi$), we calculate branching fractions for these decay modes as well as the Breit-Wigner-tail effects in $D_{(s)} \to P_1 (\omega \to) KK$ processes. Our framework comprehensively incorporates both factorizable and nonfactorizable contributions, significantly improving theoretical predictions in the nonperturbative regime where conventional methods face challenges due to the limited mass scale of charm mesons. The FAT approach yields results in good agreement with experimental data, demonstrating its effectiveness in capturing nonfactorizable contributions with improved precision. Our predictions for yet-unobserved decay modes, particularly those with branching fractions in the order of $10^{-4}$ to $10^{-3}$, are expected to be tested in future high-precision experiments at BESIII and LHCb.</description>

      <title>QCD sum rules study on weak decays $\Omega_c^0\to\Omega^- (\pi^+, \rho^+, l^+\nu_l)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18628</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18628v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the weak decays of the charmed baryon $\Omega_c^0$ to the $\Omega^-$ baryon within the framework of QCD sum rules. A three-point correlation function is defined for calculating eight form factors governing the $\Omega_c^0 \to \Omega^-$ transition. The cutting rules are employed to extract the double imaginary parts of the correlation functions, enabling their expression in the form of dispersive integrals. These form factors are then used to determine the branching fractions for the hadronic decays $\Omega_c^0 \to \Omega^- \pi^+$ and $\Omega_c^0 \to \Omega^- \rho^+$, as well as the semi-leptonic decay $\Omega_c^0 \to \Omega^- \ell^+ \nu_\ell$. Our results are compared with existing theoretical predictions and experimental data, providing a comprehensive analysis of $\Omega_c^0$ decays and offering valuable insights into the dynamics of charmed baryon decays.</description>

      <title>No-scale Brans-Dicke Gravity -- ultralight scalar boson &amp; heavy inflaton</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18648</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18648v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It is very much intriguing if the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is not a fundamental parameter. The Brans-Dicke gravity is nothing but the theory where the Planck scale $M_{\rm{Pl}}$ is indeed an illusional parameter. The theory predicts a massless scalar boson whose exchanges between matters induce unwanted long range forces. We solve this problem imposing there is no dimensionful parameter in the theory, even at the quantum level. We further extend the theory by including a $R^2$ term and a non-minimal coupling of the Standard Model Higgs to gravity, as their coefficients are dimensionless. This extension provides a heavy inflaton field that is consistent with all cosmological observations, with a potential very similar to that of the Starobinsky model. The inflaton necessarily decays into the massless scalar bosons, resulting in a non-negligible amount of dark radiation in the present universe. We demonstrate that the inflation model yields a sufficiently high reheating temperature for successful leptogenesis, and we also discuss a possible candidate for dark matter.</description>

      <title>Probing Pion Valence Quark Distribution with Beam-charge Asymmetry of Pion-induced $J/\psi$ Production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider the beam-charge asymmetry of the $J/\psi$ production cross sections in $\pi^-$- versus $\pi^+$-induced reactions on proton or nuclear targets. We show that the $J/\psi$ production cross section difference between $\pi^-$ and $\pi^+$ beams impinging on a proton target has a positive sign with a magnitude proportional to the product of pion's valence quark distribution, $V_\pi$, and proton's up and down valence quark distribution difference, $u^V - d^V$. The existing $J/\psi$ production data for $\pi^- + p$ and $\pi^+ + p$ at 39.5 and 200 GeV/c are consistent with this expectation and the theoretical calculation. We also examine the beam-charge dependence for pion-induced $J/\psi$ production cross sections measured on the neutron-rich tungsten target, and find good agreement between data and theory. This study suggests that the beam-charge asymmetry of pion-induced $J/\psi$ production from a proton target is a viable method to access the valence quark distributions of the pion.</description>

      <title>Higher Axion Strings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18707v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the minimal requirements to obtain axion strings for axions with exponentially good quality. These ingredients appear in theories where an axion coming from a higher-form gauge field mixes with the phase of a complex scalar field in a situation that resembles higher-groups. The resulting axion is perturbatively massless and inherits a high-quality shift symmetry from the global higher-form symmetry while being compatible with a post-inflationary axion scenario. Due to differences and resemblances with both, extra-dimensional and field theory axions, we call this field the higher axion. To this end, we study a toy model on a 5-dimensional manifold with boundary. The boundary hosts the complex scalar that provides axion strings through standard mechanisms. In addition, we study how these scenarios may arise in heterotic string theory and type II string compactifications.</description>

      <title>Femtoscopy correlation functions and hadron-hadron scattering amplitudes in presence of Coulomb potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18710</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18710v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work addresses the incorporation of Coulomb interactions into femtoscopy correlation functions (CFs) used to probe hadron interactions. Combining strong contact potentials with Coulomb effects, the derived scattering amplitudes and wave functions are used to compute CFs, accounting for both interactions coherently. Next, we analyze the nature of the corrections due to the finite range of the strong interaction, closely linked to off-shell effects, and propose an approximate method to account for them. We show how these corrections turn out to be essential to accurately extract the strong hadron-hadron scattering amplitudes from CF data. We compare the obtained expressions for the CFs with those reported in previous theoretical frameworks. Also, using proton-proton systems as a case study, we obtain a good comparison of our results with previous realistic theoretical calculations and with accurate recent data from the ALICE experiment. The framework enables precise CF calculations without numerical solution of the Schr\"odinger equation, offering a practical tool for femtoscopy analyses involving charged hadrons. In addition, the scheme allows for an easy connection with scattering amplitudes obtained from Effective Field Theories.</description>

      <title>A detailed study on the prospects for a $\mathrm{t\overline{t}}$ threshold scan in $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18713</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18713v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A scan of the beam energy across the top quark pair ($\mathrm{t\overline{t}}$) production threshold is part of the program of future Higgs, top, and electroweak factory projects. In this paper, we provide projections for the achievable precision in the top quark mass ($m_\mathrm{t}$), width ($\Gamma_\mathrm{t}$), and Yukawa coupling ($y_\mathrm{t}$) at the electron-positron ($\mathrm{e^+e^-}$) stage of the Future Circular Collider (FCC-ee). The study includes a detailed assessment of parametric and systematic uncertainties, as well as a rigorous estimate of the effect of point-to-point correlations. We project that $m_\mathrm{t}$ and $\Gamma_\mathrm{t}$ can be determined with an experimental precision of about 6.8 and 11.5 MeV, respectively, when $m_\mathrm{t}$ is defined in the potential-subtracted (PS) scheme. The impact of theoretical uncertainties due to missing higher orders is found to be of about 35 (25) MeV on $m_\mathrm{t}$ ($\Gamma_\mathrm{t}$) at N$^3$LO in non-relativistic QCD. Therefore, improvements in the theoretical accuracy, which is an active area of development, are key to match the achievable experimental precision at a future $\mathrm{e^+e^-}$ collider. Finally, we explore the prospects for a measurement of $y_\mathrm{t}$ at FCC-ee via a dedicated run above the $\mathrm{t\overline{t}}$ production threshold.</description>

      <title>Superheavy Supersymmetric Dark Matter for the origin of KM3NeT Ultra-High Energy signal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an explanation for the recently reported ultra-high-energy neutrino signal at KM3NeT, which lacks an identifiable astrophysical source. While decaying dark matter in the Galactic Center is a natural candidate, the observed arrival direction strongly suggests an extragalactic origin. We introduce a multicomponent dark matter scenario in which the components are part of a supermultiplet, with supersymmetry ensuring a nearly degenerate mass spectrum among the fields. This setup allows a heavy component to decay into a lighter one, producing a boosted neutrino spectrum with energy $E_\nu \sim 100$ PeV, determined by the mass difference. The heavy-to-light decay occurs at a cosmological redshift of $z \sim \text{a few}$ or higher, leading to an isotropic directional distribution of the signal.</description>

      <title>Gravitational form factor of the kaon in holographic QCD</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gravitational form factor (GFF) of the kaon is investigated in a bottom-up holographic QCD model, in which the strange quark mass breaks the SU(3) flavor symmetry. The probe energy ($Q^2$) dependence of the kaon GFF is explicitly shown and compared to that of the pion. It is presented that our result shows the $1/Q^2$ behavior in the high energy region, which is consistent with the perturbative QCD prediction. The gravitational radius of the kaon is also calculated, and it is found that the result is quite close to that of the pion but slightly smaller.</description>

      <title>QCD corrections for subleading powers in $1/m_b$ for the nonleptonic $b\rightarrow c\bar c s$ transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18775</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18775v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute next-to-leading order QCD corrections to the $1/m_b^2$ terms of the Heavy Quark Expansion for the contribution to inclusive nonleptonic bottom hadron decays induced by the charged-current operators mediating the transitions $b \to c \bar c q$ ($q = s,d$). Their contributions to lifetimes are Cabibbo favoured and have large Wilson coefficents, but have not been computed before, since the presence of two heavy quarks in the final state makes this calcuation technically demanding. It finally adds the last missing piece of the full NLO terms at $1/m_b^2$ in the heavy quark expansion of $B$-hadron lifetimes. We obtain analytical results with full dependence on the final-state charm quark mass, which we provide in the supplemental file "coefbccs.m".</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18776v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that experiments designed to capture low energy neutrinos, like PTOLEMY are sensitive to the specific neutrino model. In particular, they might show a signature of the condensed flavor vacuum, featured in the flavor Fock space model, and allow to test the hypothesis according to which a possible dark matter component is determined by neutrino mixing.</description>

      <title>Warm Inflation with the Standard Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show for the first time that warm inflation is feasible with Standard Model (SM) gauge interactions alone. Our model consists of a minimal extension of the SM by a single scalar inflaton field with an axion-like coupling to gluons and a monomial potential. The effects of light fermions, which were previously argued to render warm inflation with the SM impossible, are alleviated by Hubble dilution of their chiral chemical potentials. Our model only features one adjustable combination of parameters and accommodates all inflationary observables. We briefly discuss implications for axion experiments, dark matter, and the strong CP-problem.</description>

      <title>Higher-dimensional operators at finite-temperature affect gravitational-wave predictions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the effect of higher-dimensional marginal operators on the thermodynamics of cosmological phase transitions. Focusing on the Abelian Higgs model, we systematically match these operators, which arise at higher orders in the underlying high-temperature expansion of thermal effective field theory, and use field redefinitions to construct a complete, minimal, and gauge-invariant operator basis. We argue that for strong transitions, temporal gauge modes, which enhance the transition strength, should be treated on equal footing with spatial gauge modes in perturbation theory. Marginal operators are found to weaken the transition strength and induce significant uncertainties for strong transitions. For even stronger transitions that could potentially produce a gravitational wave background detectable by LISA, the validity of the high temperature expansion is uncertain, which may impact the applicability of effective theory techniques, including their use in non-perturbative lattice studies.</description>

      <title>Chiral Vortical Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17441</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17441v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the collective modes of chiral matter described by the second-order chiral hydrodynamics, noticing that chiral shear waves (CSWs) may become unstable for momenta above a characteristic scale. In the absence of sufficient dissipation, this instability emerges within the hydrodynamic regime, depending on the interplay between shear viscosity and the anomalous vortical contribution to the stress-energy tensor at second order in hydrodynamic expansion. We show that this instability generates helical flows and name it the {\it chiral vortical instability} (CVI). Alongside the chiral plasma and magnetovortical instabilities, CVI tends to transfer initial microscopic chirality into macroscopic helicities, which combine into a generalized axial charge. We further find that an elementary static Gromeka-Arnold-Beltrami-Childress flow, corresponding to a CSW at a specific momentum, solves the full nonlinear equations of second-order chiral hydrodynamics, whereas global rotation of a chiral medium is not a solution. This observation supports the relevance of CVI beyond the hydrodynamic regime. Finally, we briefly note that CVI may have multiple phenomenological implications across various systems, including QCD matter produced in heavy-ion collisions and primordial plasma in the early Universe.</description>

      <title>Every Nearby Energetic Pulsar Is Surrounded by a Region of Inhibited Diffusion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The H.E.S.S. telescope has recently detected the total electron-plus-positron ($e^+e^-$) flux up to 40 TeV, finding it to be a featureless and steeply-falling power-law above 1 TeV. This result is in stark tension with standard one-zone models of pulsar $e^+e^-$ injection and diffusion, which predict a hard-spectrum signal above $\sim$10 TeV. We model the local pulsar population, and find 20 sources that would each $individually$ overproduce the H.E.S.S. $e^+e^-$ flux in a one-zone diffusion model. We conclude that $every$ energetic pulsar younger than $\sim$500 kyr must be surrounded by a region of inhibited diffusion ($e.g.$, a supernova remnant, pulsar wind nebula, or TeV halo) that prevents the transport of these $e^+e^-$ to Earth. Because the high-electron density in these regions produces bright synchrotron and inverse-Compton emission, we conclude that all nearby pulsars are detectable as (potentially unassociated) radio, x-ray or $\gamma$-ray sources.</description>

      <title>Cross section Measurements for $^{12}$C$(K^-, K^+\Xi^-)$ and $^{12}$C$(K^-, K^+\Lambda\Lambda)$ Reactions at 1.8 GeV$/c$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17614v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a measurement of the production of $\Xi^-$ and $\Lambda\Lambda$ in the $^{12}$C$(K^-, K^+)$ reaction at an incident beam momentum of 1.8 GeV/$\mathit{c}$, based on high-statistics data from J-PARC E42. The cross section for the $^{12}$C$(K^-, K^+\Xi^-)$ reaction, compared to the inclusive $^{12}$C$(K^-, K^+)$ reaction cross section, indicates that the $\Xi^-$ escaping probability peaks at 65\% in the energy region of $E_\Xi=100$ to 150 MeV above the $\Xi^-$ emission threshold. A classical approach using eikonal approximation shows that the total cross sections for $\Xi^-$ inelastic scattering ranges between 43 mb and 23 mb in the $\Xi^-$ momentum range from 0.4 to 0.6 GeV/c. Furthermore, based on the relative cross section for the $^{12}$C$(K^-, K^+\Lambda\Lambda)$ reaction, the total cross section for $\Xi^-p\to\Lambda\Lambda$ is estimated in the same approach to vary between 2.6 mb and 1.1 mb in the momentum range of 0.40 to 0.65 GeV/c. Specifically, a cross section of 1.1 mb in the momentum range of 0.5 to 0.6 GeV/c imposes a constraint on the upper bound of the decay width of the $\Xi^-$ particle in infinite nuclear matter, revealing $\Gamma_\Xi&lt; \sim 0.7$ MeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17635v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We provide a study of the effects of the Effective Field Theory (EFT) generalisation of stochastic inflation on the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) in a model-independent single-field context. We demonstrate how the scalar perturbations' Infra-Red (IR) contributions and the emerging Fokker-Planck equation driving the probability distribution characterise the Langevin equations for the ``soft" modes in the quasi-de Sitter background. Both the classical-drift and quantum-diffusion-dominated regimes undergo a specific analysis of the distribution function using the stochastic-$\delta N$ formalism, which helps us to evade a no-go theorem on the PBH mass. Using the EFT-induced alterations, we evaluate the local non-Gaussian parameters in the drift-dominated limit.</description>

      <title>Measurements of the branching fractions of $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Sigma^{+}K_{S}^{0}$, $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{0}\pi^{+}$, and $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{0}K^{+}$ at Belle and Belle II</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17643v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using 983.0 $\rm{fb}^{-1}$ and 427.9 $\rm{fb}^{-1}$ data samples collected with the Belle and Belle II detectors at the KEKB and SuperKEKB asymmetric energy $e^+e^-$ colliders, respectively, we present studies of the Cabibbo-favored $\Xi_c^+$ decays ${\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Sigma^{+}K_{S}^{0}}$ and $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{0}\pi^{+}$, and the singly Cabibbo-suppressed decay $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{0}K^{+}$. The ratios of branching fractions of ${\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Sigma^{+}K_{S}^{0}}$ and $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{0}K^{+}$ relative to that of $\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}$ are measured for the first time, while the ratio ${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{+})/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^{+}) $ is also determined and improved by an order of magnitude in precision. The measured branching fraction ratios are $\frac{\cal{B}(\Xi_{c}^{+} \to \Sigma^{+}K_{S}^{0})}{\cal{B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^+)}= 0.067 \pm 0.007 \pm 0.003$, $\frac{\cal{B}(\Xi_c^{+} \to \Xi^{0}\pi^{+})}{\cal{B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^+)} = 0.248 \pm 0.005 \pm 0.009$, $\frac{\cal{B}(\Xi_c^{+} \to \Xi^{0}K^{+})}{\cal{B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to \Xi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^+)} = 0.017 \pm 0.003 \pm 0.001$. Additionally, the ratio ${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{0}K^{+})/{\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{+})$ is measured to be $ 0.068 \pm 0.010 \pm 0.004$. Here, the first and second uncertainties are statistical and systematic, respectively. Multiplying the ratios by the branching fraction of the normalization mode, ${\mathcal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{-}\pi^{+}\pi^+)= (2.9\pm 1.3)\%$, we obtain the following absolute branching fractions ${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Sigma^{+}K^{0}_{S}) = (0.194 \pm 0.021 \pm 0.009 \pm 0.087 )%$, ${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{0}\pi^{+}) = (0.719 \pm 0.014 \pm 0.024 \pm 0.322 )%$, ${\cal B}(\Xi_{c}^{+}\to\Xi^{0}K^{+}) = (0.049 \pm 0.007 \pm 0.002 \pm 0.022 )%$.</description>

      <title>The Large Hadron electron Collider as a bridge project for CERN</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17727v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The LHeC is the project for delivering electron-nucleon collisions at CERN using the HL-LHC beams. An Energy Recovery Linac in racetrack configuration will provide 50 GeV electrons to achieve centre-of-mass energies around 1 TeV/nucleon and instantaneous luminosities around $10^{34}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. The LHeC program elaborated in the CDR of 2021 included a phase with concurrent operation of electron-hadron and hadron-hadron collisions, followed by a standalone phase of electron-hadron collisions only. In view of the current HL-LHC schedule, in this paper we have examined the possibilities of a program after the regular HL-LHC program with only electron-proton operation. In this operation mode, the LHeC would serve as an impactful bridge project between major colliders at CERN. The standalone physics program comprises electroweak, Higgs, top-quark, BSM and strong-interaction physics. In addition, it empowers the physics analyses at the HL-LHC by retrofitting measurements and searches with significantly more precise knowledge of the proton structure and $\alpha_s$. The accelerator technology deployed in the Energy Recovery Linac for the LHeC is a major stepping-stone for the performance, cost reduction and training for future colliders. The capital investments in the LHeC electron accelerator can be reused in a cost-efficient way as the injector for the FCC-ee. Finally, data from the LHeC are essential to enable the physics potential of any new high-energy hadron collider. The operational plan of 6 years easily fits in the period between two major colliders at CERN. Similar to the LHeC empowering the HL-LHC physics program, the FCC-eh would be an impactful addition to the FCC physics program.</description>

      <title>Strongly Coupled Sectors in Inflation: Gapless Theories and Unparticles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17840</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.17840v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We compute correlation functions of the primordial density perturbations when they couple to a gapless, strongly coupled sector of spectator fields -- ``unparticles" -- during inflation. We first derive a four-point function of conformally coupled scalars for all kinematic configurations in de Sitter, which exchanges an unparticle at tree-level, by performing direct integration using the Mellin-Barnes method. To obtain inflationary bispectra and trispectra, we apply weight-shifting operators to the conformally coupled scalar correlator. We show that the correlators solve differential equations determined by the additional symmetries enjoyed by the unparticle propagator. Based on these differential equations, we are able to discuss the spinning-unparticle exchanges, focusing on two possible cases where the currents or the stress tensor of unparticles are coupled to inflatons, with the help of spin-raising operators. Finally, we study the phenomenology of the resulting shape functions. Depending on the value of the unparticle scaling dimension, we classify three characteristic shapes for the inflationary bispectra, including near-equilateral, near-orthogonal, and a novel shape which appears when the scaling dimensions are close to half-integers. More generally, we find that the leading order squeezed limits are insufficient to conclusively determine the detection of a light particle or unparticle. Only the full shapes of bispectra and trispectra can break this degeneracy.</description>

      <title>Charge-dependent nucleon-nucleon interaction at N$^3$LO in nuclear lattice effective field theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18017</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18017v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The nuclear lattice effective field theory (NLEFT) is an efficient tool for solving nuclear many-body problems, which takes high-fidelity lattice chiral interactions as input and computes nuclear low-energy observables via quantum Monte Carlo techniques. In this work, we present the first next-to-next-to-next-to-leading order (N$^3$LO) chiral forces on the lattice with the isospin-breaking effects fully taken into account. We focus on both the charge-independence breaking (CIB) and charge-symmetry breaking (CSB) effects. Specifically, we include the isospin-breaking effect from the mass difference between the charged and neutral pions in the one-pion-exchange potential (OPEP), the Coulomb force for the $pp$ interaction and the contribution of two additional charge-dependent contact operators. We also explicitly incorporate the two-pion-exchange potentials which was mostly neglected in previous NLEFT calculations. With these improvements, we are able to accurately reproduce the $np$ and $pp$ scattering phase shifts up to relative momentum $p \sim 200$ MeV as well as the deuteron properties. The construction of these charge-dependent lattice nuclear forces establishes a solid foundation for future high-precision nuclear ab initio calculations within the NLEFT framework.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic states of fast neutrino-flavor conversions in the three-flavor framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There has been growing evidence that mu and tau neutrinos are noticeably different due to the emergence of muons in core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) and binary neutron star mergers (BNSMs). Recent theoretical studies also suggest that all flavors of neutrinos and antineutrinos inevitably experience some flavor mixing instabilities including fast neutrino flavor conversions (FFC), which corresponds to one of the collective neutrino oscillations powered by neutrino self-interactions. This represents a need for quantum kinetic treatment in the numerical modeling of neutrino dynamics, which is, however, a formidable computational challenge. In this paper, we present an approximate method to predict asymptotic states of FFC without solving a quantum kinetic equation under a three-flavor framework, in which mu and tau neutrino distributions are not necessarily identical to each other. The approximate method is developed based on a Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) relaxation time prescription, capable of capturing essential features of mixing competitions among three different flavor-coherent states. Our proposed scheme is computationally inexpensive and easy to implement in any classical neutrino transport scheme.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Wave Signatures of Primordial Black Hole Reheating in Upcoming Interferometry Missions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18207v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the prospects of detecting a stochastic gravitational wave (GW) background from the primordial black hole (PBH) reheating epoch. If PBHs form during a non-standard cosmological phase prior to the radiation-dominated era, they can dominate the energy density of the Universe before evaporating via Hawking radiation. Such PBHs can generate induced GWs that may fall within the detectable range of future interferometry missions: (i) through isocurvature perturbations arising from the inhomogeneous spatial distribution of PBHs, and (ii) through the amplification of adiabatic perturbations triggered by the abrupt transition from PBH domination to radiation domination. We assess the detection prospects of such GW spectra using the signal-to-noise ratio, Fisher forecast analysis, and Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis with mock data from LISA and ET. Our findings reveal that ET exhibits superior sensitivity to both isocurvature- and adiabatic-induced GWs, covering a wide PBH mass range of $M_{\rm in} \in (0.5-4\times 10^7)$ g. However, we find that the relative uncertainties associated with the parameter of the isocurvature source are quite high. LISA, by contrast, is mostly sensitive to the adiabatic source, with $M_{\rm in} \in (2\times10^4-5\times 10^8)$ g. The combined effect of adiabatic and isocurvature sources on ET and LISA provides a multi-stage window into the post-inflationary Universe by constraining PBH mass, energy fraction, and the background equation of state.</description>

      <title>Future Opportunities with Lepton-Hadron Collisions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.18208v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deep Inelastic lepton-hadron Scattering (DIS) is a cornerstone of particle physics discovery and the precision measurement of the structure of matter. This document surveys the international DIS landscape, exploring current and future opportunities to continue this rich heritage, leading to new understandings and enabling discoveries.
  Of immediate relevance to the future of the field in Europe, the Large Hadron electron Collider (LHeC) offers an impactful bridge between the end of the HL-LHC and the beginning of the next CERN flagship project, both in terms of technology development and new scientific exploration from Higgs physics to the structure of the proton. More generally, the facilities described here cover energies from a few GeV to multiple TeV and address a wide range of topics, with unique sensitivity to Quantum Chromodynamics and hadron structure at their core. Additionally, they enhance the science programmes at hadron-hadron colliders.
  The fixed-target CEBAF programme at JLab probes nucleon and light ion structure at large x in novel ways, while high energy neutrino DIS is enabled at the FASER and SND@LHC experiments by the intense LHC beams. The Electron Ion Collider (EIC) is on course for deployment at Brookhaven in the early 2030s. Its science includes a 3-dimensional mapping of hadrons, leading to a thorough understanding of the mechanisms behind proton mass and spin. Adding the LHeC provides a Europe-based lepton-hadron frontier, including a complementary Higgs, top and electroweak programme to the HL-LHC, together with precise determinations of proton and nuclear structure in a kinematic range that improves HL-LHC sensitivities. In the longer term, plasma wakefield acceleration and the FCC offer possible major steps forward in centre-of-mass energy, extending into a low parton momentum-fraction domain where new strong interaction discoveries are guaranteed.</description>

      <title>New Tests on Lorentz Invariance Violation Using Energy-Resolved Polarimetry of Gamma-Ray Bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18277</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18277v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the manifestations of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) is vacuum birefringence, which leads to an energy-dependent rotation of the polarization plane of linearly polarized photons arising from an astrophysical source. Here we use the energy-resolved polarization measurements in the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission of five bright gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) to constrain this vacuum birefringent effect. Our results show that at the 95\% confidence level, the birefringent parameter $\eta$ characterizing the broken degree of Lorentz invariance can be constrained to be $|\eta|&lt;\mathcal{O}(10^{-15}-10^{-16})$, which represent an improvement of at least eight orders of magnitude over existing limits from multi-band optical polarization observations. Moreover, our constraints are competitive with previous best bounds from the single $\gamma$-ray polarimetry of other GRBs. We emphasize that, thanks to the adoption of the energy-resolved polarimetric data set, our results on $\eta$ are statistically more robust. Future polarization measurements of GRBs at higher energies and larger distances would further improve LIV limits through the birefringent effect.</description>

      <title>Second order fluctuations of conserved charges in external magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a first-principles lattice QCD investigation of second-order fluctuations of and correlations among conserved charges -- baryon number (B), electric charge (Q), and strangeness (S) -- in the presence of external magnetic fields. Our study employs lattice simulations of (2+1)-flavor QCD with physical pion masses using highly improved staggered fermions (HISQ) on $48^3 \times 12$ and $32^3 \times 8$ lattices, covering a wide range of magnetic field strengths up to $eB \simeq 0.8$ GeV$ ^2$. We identify clear signals of magnetic field-induced modifications to these fluctuations and correlations, with the baryon-electric charge correlation, $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$, exhibiting particularly strong sensitivity to the magnetic field. To bridge theoretical predictions with experimental observables, we implement systematic kinematic cuts that emulate detector acceptances of the STAR and ALICE experiments within the hadron resonance gas (HRG) model and construct proxy observables for fluctuations measurable in heavy-ion collision experiments. Our findings highlight $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$ as a promising ``magnetometer" for probing the presence of magnetic fields in QCD matter. Furthermore, we explore experimentally relevant ratios involving $\chi^{\rm BQ}_{11}$, demonstrating their potential in mitigating volume effects and enhancing sensitivity to magnetic fields in collision environments. Additionally, we assess the limitations of the HRG model at strong magnetic fields, revealing deviations that indicate nontrivial modifications to hadronic degrees of freedom. These results offer new insights into the interplay between thermal and magnetic effects in the QCD phase diagram and provide experimentally relevant guidance for the detection of magnetic fields in heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>First Computation of Entanglement Dynamics in the SYK Model on Quantum Computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18580</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18580v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, fundamental to quantum chaos, many-body physics, and holographic duality, features random all-to-all quartic or higher-order interactions, exhibiting both maximal chaos and exact solvability--yet its entanglement entropy has remained challenging and never been measured on a real quantum device. We overcome this limitation by presenting the first measurement of entanglement entropy growth under the SYK Hamiltonian using IBM's superconducting quantum computer. We implement an optimized version of swap-based many-body interference protocol, alleviating the challenges posed by IBM's limited qubit connectivity. Additionally, to reduce the statistical uncertainty in the randomized measurement protocol, we expand the unitary ensemble, which increases the volume of quantum circuits that are difficult to execute on current quantum computers. We tackle this challenge for the first time by parallelizing these quantum circuits through quantum multi-programming--establishing a foundation for how tailored innovations reveal complex quantum dynamics within current hardware constraints.</description>

Abstract: We study the effect of finite spin quark density on the chiral and deconfinement thermal transitions using numerical simulations of lattice QCD with two dynamical light quarks. The finite spin density is introduced by the quark spin potential in the canonical formulation of the spin operator. We show that both chiral and deconfinement temperatures are decreasing functions of the spin potential. We determine the parabolic curvatures of transition temperatures in a limit of physical quark masses.</description>

      <title>Relativistic $^3$He light-front wave function</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18788</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18788v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The relativistic light-front (LF) wave function of $^3$He is determined by the three-body LF equation for the Faddeev components in the momentum space. As an interaction, we take the one-meson exchange kernels, without the potential approximation. Within the explicitly covariant formulation of LF dynamics, we calculate the full relativistic $^3$He LF wave function, comprising 32 spin-isospin components. In the non-relativistic domain, five of these components dominate and closely resemble their non-relativistic counterparts. Relativistic effects manifest themselves in deviations in relativistic domain of these components from the non-relativistic ones and in appearance of new components.</description>

      <title>Generalized relativistic second-order dissipative hydrodynamics: coupling different rank tensors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we extend the formalism of second-order relativistic dissipative hydrodynamics, developed previously using Zubarev's non-equilibrium statistical operator formalism. By employing a second-order expansion of the statistical operator in terms of hydrodynamic gradients, we demonstrate that new second-order terms emerge due to the coupling of two-point quantum correlators between tensors of differing ranks, evaluated at distinct space-time points. Such terms arise because the presence of the acceleration vector in the system allows Curie's theorem, which governs symmetry constraints, to be extended for constructing invariants from tensors of different ranks evaluated at distinct space-time points. The new terms are identified in the context of a complete set of second-order equations governing the shear-stress tensor, bulk-viscous pressure, and charge-diffusion currents for a generic quantum system characterized by the energy-momentum tensor and multiple conserved charges. Additionally, we identify the transport coefficients associated with these new terms and derive the Kubo formulas expressing the second-order transport coefficients through two- and three-point correlation functions.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Cosmic Birefringence and DESI Data with Evolving Axion in $\Lambda$CDM</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.18924v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent cosmological observations have revealed growing tensions with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model, including indications of isotropic cosmic birefringence and deviations from $w = -1$ in the dark energy equation of state, as suggested by DESI and supernova measurements. In this paper, we point out that such deviations can arise even from a subdominant energy density component. We then propose a unified framework based on a dynamical axion field that simultaneously accounts for both anomalies, providing a simple and natural extension of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model. In our scenario, the axion field with $2H_0\lesssim m\lesssim 6H_0$, where $H_0$ is the current Hubble constant, induces a nonzero rotation of the CMB polarization plane and modifies the present-day dark energy equation of state. This framework accommodates recent observational data with natural parameter choices, even for a string axion with a decay constant of order $10^{17}\,$GeV.</description>

      <title>Jet Suppression and Azimuthal Anisotropy from RHIC to LHC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07869v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Azimuthal anisotropies of high-$p_T$ particles produced in heavy-ion collisions are understood as an effect of a geometrical selection bias. Particles oriented in the direction in which the QCD medium formed in these collisions is shorter, suffer less energy loss, and thus, are over-represented in the final ensemble compared to those oriented in the direction in which the medium is longer. In this work we present the first semi-analytical predictions, including propagation through a realistic, hydrodynamical background, of the azimuthal anisotropies for jets, obtaining a quantitative agreement with available experimental data as function of the jet $p_T$, its cone size $R$ and the collisions centrality. Jets are multi-partonic, extended objects and their energy loss is sensitive to substructure fluctuations. This is determined by the physics of color coherence that relates to the ability of the medium to resolve those partonic fluctuations. Namely, color dipoles whose angle is smaller than a critical angle, $\theta_c$, are not resolved by the medium and they effectively act as a coherent source of energy loss. We find that jet azimuthal anisotropies have a specially strong dependence on coherence physics due to the marked length-dependence of $\theta_c$. By combining our predictions for the collision systems and center of mass energies studied at RHIC and the LHC, covering a wide range of typical values of $\theta_c$, we show that the relative size of jet azimuthal anisotropies for jets with different cone-sizes $R$ follow a universal trend that indicates a transition from a coherent regime of jet quenching to a decoherent regime. These results suggest a way forward to reveal the role played by the physics of jet color decoherence in probing deconfined QCD matter.</description>

Abstract: Electromagnetic fields surrounding pulsars may source coherent ultralight axion signals at the known rotational frequencies of the neutron stars, which can be detected by laboratory experiments (e.g., pulsarscopes). As a promising case study, we model axion emission from the well-studied Crab pulsar, which would yield a prominent signal at $f \approx 29.6$ Hz regardless of whether the axion contributes to the dark matter abundance. We estimate the relevant sensitivity of future axion dark matter detection experiments such as DMRadio-GUT, Dark SRF, and CASPEr, assuming different magnetosphere models to bracket the uncertainty in astrophysical modeling. For example, depending on final experimental parameters, the Dark SRF experiment could probe axions with any mass $m_a \ll 10^{-13}$ eV down to $g_{a\gamma\gamma} \sim 3 \times 10^{-13}$ GeV$^{-1}$ with one year of data and assuming the vacuum magnetosphere model. These projected sensitivities may be degraded depending on the extent to which the magnetosphere is screened by charge-filled plasma. The promise of pulsar-sourced axions as a clean target for direct detection experiments motivates dedicated simulations of axion production in pulsar magnetospheres.</description>

      <title>Final-state rescattering mechanism of double-charm baryon decays: $\mathcal{B}_{cc}\to\mathcal{B}_{c}P$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.09511</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.09511v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we examine the non-leptonic weak decays of doubly charmed baryons, denoted as ${\cal B}_{cc}\to{\cal B}_{c}P$, where ${\cal B}_{cc}$ represents the doubly charmed baryons, specifically $(\Xi_{cc}^{++},\Xi_{cc}^{+},\Omega_{cc}^{+})$. The notation ${\cal B}_{c}$ denotes the singly charmed baryons, specifically $({\cal B}_{\bar{3}},{\cal B}_{6})$, while $P$ signifies the light pseudoscalar. These terms are pertinent to the non-leptonic decay modes under discussion. While the short-distance contributions can be precisely estimated through theoretical calculations, addressing the long-distance contributions for final-state-interaction effects presents a significant challenge. In order to address this issue, we utilize the rescattering mechanism of final state interaction effects to compute the long-distance contributions. We initially derive the entire hadronic loop contributions for these two-body nonleptonic decays of doubly charmed baryons. In subsequent analyses, we are able to calculate relative strong phases. As a result, we can provide predictions for their decay asymmetry parameters and CP violations. Furthermore, we employ experimental data from the LHCb collaboration, specifically the ratio \(Br(\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{\prime+}\pi^{+})/Br(\Xi_{cc}^{++}\to\Xi_{c}^{+}\pi^{+})=(1.41\pm0.17\pm0.10)\), to ascertain the model parameters \(\eta=0.9\pm0.2\). Consequently, we present the predictions of branching ratios and decay asymmetry parameters for 67 distinct decay processes and $CP$ violations for the singly Cabibbo suppressed channels. This not only strengthens the validity of our theoretical predictions, but also provides a more comprehensive theoretical framework for the future identification of other doubly charmed baryons.</description>

      <title>Phenomenological Study of Lepton Flavor Violation in Z Boson Decays with Constrained MSSM Extended by Type-II Seesaw Model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.12992v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we study the lepton flavor violation (LFV) of Z boson decays in the framework of the constrained minimal supersymmetric standard model (CMSSM) extended by the type-II seesaw model. The branching ratios of $Z\longrightarrow l_i l_j$ decays are calculated in this model. Here, $l_i$ and $l_j$ are different flavor charged leptons. After fitting to the experimental mass limits of the neutrino and supersymmetric particles, we have found that the branching ratios for LFV decays of Z boson are in the order of $6 \times {10}^{-10}$ for $e \mu$ channel and of $1 \times {10}^{-9}$ for both $\tau \mu$ and $\tau e$ decay channels. Considering recent experimental constraints on $l_{i}\rightarrow l_{j} \gamma$ decays, the branching ratios for LFV decays of Z boson get an additional suppression of $10^{-8}$ for $e \mu$ channel and of $10^{-3}$ for both $\tau \mu$ and $\tau e$ decay channels. The branching ratios theoretical predictions are several orders below the recent experimental limits for both scenarios, which give a very low probability to observe the LFV decays of Z boson in the future experiments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.20706v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-Higgs boson interactions with massive gauge bosons are known to be tell-tale probes of the vacuum manifold of electroweak symmetry breaking. Phenomenologically, a precise determination of these parameters is hampered through increasingly rare processes at the presently available energy frontier provided by the Large Hadron Collider. Contact interactions of three Higgs bosons with the $W$ and $Z$ bosons seem currently well out of experimental reach due to an irrelevant SM production cross section. From a theoretical perspective, in perturbative extensions of the SM such interactions are suppressed by weak loops and further diluted in a priori sensitive processes like weak boson fusion (WBF) when they admit a dimension-six Standard Model Effective Field Theory description. In this work, we identify scenarios that can indeed lead to large, and perhaps even observable modifications of WBF triple Higgs production most directly parametrised by Higgs Effective Field Theory. We critically analyse these enhancements at the LHC and future colliders from the perspective of unitarity and demonstrate the radiative stability of such analyses under QCD corrections at hadron colliders. Taking into account the restrictions from unitarity, we finally study the expected sensitivity to the electroweak triple Higgs production within HEFT, considering $HHVV$ and $HHHVV$ effective couplings, at both future hadron and lepton colliders. Particularly, we present numerical predictions for LHC, FCC, CLIC and muon colliders.</description>

Abstract: Utilizing a helical magnet profile to enhance axion-photon conversion showed great promise in laboratory searches for high axion masses. We extend the mechanism, known as the axion-magnetic resonance (AMR), from laser experiments to axion helioscopes and demonstrate its potential in covering QCD axion parameter space. Specifically, we apply AMR to the CAST experiment legacy, make projections for the upcoming IAXO experiment, and assess its implications for both axion-like particles and QCD axions. We observe considerable improvement in the experiment's sensitivity reach in all cases.</description>

      <title>Phenomenology of Electroweak Portal Dark Showers: High Energy Direct Probes and Low Energy Complementarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.13304v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenology of a dark QCD sector interacting with the Standard Model (SM) via the electroweak (EW) portals. The portal interactions allow SM bosons, such as $Z$ and $h$, or additional bosons that mix with them, to decay into dark quarks, producing dark showers. The light dark mesons are expected to be long-lived particles (LLPs), as their decays back to the SM states through the EW-portal interactions typically have macroscopic decay lengths. We focus on dark shower events initiated by various bosons at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). The most prominent signal is the displaced decay of GeV-scale dark pions as LLPs. Current limits on dark shower signals at LHC detectors are recast from public data in a model-independent manner. Future limits in the high-luminosity phase and proposed auxiliary detectors are also projected. Additionally, we study the flavor-changing neutral current (FCNC) $B$ decays into dark pions, obtaining both current and projected constraints at the LHC and other facilities. These constraints can be combined for specific models, which are illustrated in two EW-portal benchmarks: one with the heavy doublet fermion mediation and another with the $Z^\prime$ mediator including a mass mixing. The collider reach shows significant potential to probe the parameter space unconstrained by EW precision tests, highlighting the necessity of dedicated LLP search strategies and facilities.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.09019v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We employ the Zubarev approach of the non-equilibrium statistical operator to investigate the enhancement of the low-$p_T$ region of pion spectra, introducing an effective pion chemical potential to describe the overpopulation of low-energy pion states. We test a corresponding freeze-out approach by analyzing the transverse-momentum spectra of identified particles measured recently with high precision by the ALICE Collaboration in Pb+Pb collisions at CERN LHC. A blast-wave model and a blast-wave-based particle generator, coupled to a hadronic transport model, are utilized. Bayesian inference methods are applied to extract the most probable sets of thermodynamic parameters at the chemical freeze-out hypersurface. Both models for the overpopulated pion states, the hadronic transport model and the thermal model with a nonzero pion chemical potential, provide a satisfactory description of the observed pion spectra. However, both approaches contain approximations which can be improved within a systematic nonequilibrium approach. We demonstrate that the introduction of a nonequilibrium pion chemical potential offers an efficient alternative to the conventional explanation of the low-$p_T$ enhancement, typically attributed to resonance decays with subsequent thermalization. A similar discussion holds also for the kaon spectra.</description>

      <title>Attenuation of Boosted Dark Matter in Two Component Dark Matter Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.17727v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Boosted dark matter constitutes a small fraction of the total dark matter in the Universe, with mass ranging from eV to MeV and often exhibiting (semi)relativistic velocity. Hence the likelihood of detecting boosted dark matter in Earth-based direct detection experiments is relatively high. There is more than one explanation for the origin of the boosted dark matter including the two-component dark matter models where the heavier dark matter species(dominant) annihilates to nearly monoenergetic light dark matter particles (subdominant) in the galactic halo. If the dominant dark matter species is heavier (MeV-GeV), the subdominant light dark matter achieves (semi)relativistic velocity or {\it boost}. These boosted dark matter particles suffer from scattering with electrons and nuclei while crossing the atmosphere and the Earth's crust before reaching underground experiments and hence the kinetic energy of the dark matter is attenuated. In the two-component dark matter framework, we examine how the boost of the dark matter influences the attenuation of kinetic energy across a broad spectrum of dark matter masses. We perform a detailed study at various DM-electron and DM-nucleus cross sections including the effect of nuclear form factor and elastic and inelastic scattering (for large kinetic energy). For a 10 MeV boosted dark matter with boost $\sim$ 10-100, the effect of DM-electron scattering is found to be severe than the DM-nucleus scattering (with form factor) if DM-nucleon scattering cross section is $10^{-29}$cm$^2$. We also show how the peak position of the boosted dark matter flux shifts due to the attenuation of its kinetic energy.</description>

      <title>Analytic decay width of the Higgs boson to massive bottom quarks at order $\alpha_s^3$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.07493v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Higgs boson decay into bottom quarks is the dominant decay channel contributing to its total decay width, which can be used to measure the bottom quark Yukawa coupling and mass. This decay width has been computed up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^4)$ for the process induced by the bottom quark Yukawa coupling, assuming massless final states, and the corresponding corrections beyond $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$ are found to be less than $0.2\%$. We present an analytical result for the decay into massive bottom quarks at $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ that includes the contribution from the top quark Yukawa coupling induced process. We have made use of the optical theorem, canonical differential equations and the regular basis in the calculation and expressed the result in terms of multiple polylogarithms and elliptic functions. We propose a systematic and unified procedure to derive the $\epsilon$-factorized differential equation for the three-loop kite integral family, which includes the three-loop banana integrals as a sub-sector. We find that the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^3)$ corrections increase the decay width, relative to the result up to $\mathcal{O}(\alpha_s^2)$, by $1\%$ due to the large logarithms $\log^i (m_H^2/m_b^2)$ with $ 1\le i \le 4 $ in the small bottom quark mass limit. The coefficient of the double logarithms is proportional to $C_A-C_F$, which is the typical color structure in the resummation of soft quark contributions at subleading power.</description>

We first calculate the effective potential for axions at finite baryon density and zero temperature including the effects of a first order chiral phase transition. Using the equation of state for quark matter with axions and a hadronic matter equation of state in the ambit of a relativistic mean field theory in quantum hadrodynamics, we discuss the hadron-quark phase transition. Inclusion of axions reduces the critical density for chiral transition. We use a Gibbs construct for the hadron-quark phase transition satisfying the constraints of beta equilibrium and charge neutrality as appropriate for the neutron star matter. The equation of state so obtained is used to investigate the structure of hybrid neutron stars. It is found that with the presence of axions, it is possible to have stable hybrid neutron stars having an inner core of quark matter both in pure quark matter phase as well as in a mixed phase with hyperonic matter along with a outer core of hyperonic matter and is in agreement with modern astrophysical constraints. We also discuss the properties of non-radial oscillations of such hybrid neutron stars. It is observed that the quadrupolar fundamental modes ($f$-modes) for such hybrid neutron stars get substantial enhancements both due to a larger quark core in the presence of axions and from the hyperons as compared to a canonical nucleonic neutron stars.</description>

Abstract: Large-scale neutrino detectors currently under construction will have the unique ability to probe the annihilation of low-mass thermal-relic dark matter to neutrinos. This represents an essential test of the thermal freezeout paradigm. This raises the question: what viable UV-complete models are there in which dark matter annihilates dominantly to neutrinos? We discuss models that fulfill this criteria, and are invariant under the Standard Model gauge group, for both scalar and fermionic dark matter. Specifically, we construct new models in which annihilation via the $s$-channel exchange of a scalar or pseudoscalar mediator achieves the correct relic density. In these models, dark matter is stabilised by an exact or a softly-broken lepton-number symmetry. The parameter space of such models will be probed, almost entirely, by the combination of JUNO, Hyper-Kamiokande and CMB-S4.</description>

      <title>Shedding light on the intrinsic transversal momentum distributions of pion and kaon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05941v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose to introduce the intrinsic transversal momentum distribution functions (iTMDs), in conjunction with the light-cone distribution amplitudes (LCDAs), to elucidate the probability amplitude of encountering a meson state wherein the partons swiftly traverse along the longitudinal axis while gently oscillating in the transversal plane. The primary motivation stems from the oversight of soft transverse dynamics within the $k_T$ factorization formalism of an exclusive QCD process, which confines perturbative QCD (pQCD) predictions to scenarios involving large momentum transfers. We meticulously investigate the $\pi$ and $K$ electromagnetic form factors using the iTMDs-improved pQCD calculation at next-to-leading order. By analyzing data in the timelike physical regions, we obtain the transversal-size parameters $\beta_\pi^2 = 0.51 \pm 0.04$ GeV$^{-2}$ and $\beta_K^2 = 0.30 \pm 0.05$ GeV$^2$. We then extract the chiral mass of pion to be $m_0^\pi(1 \, {\rm GeV}) = 1.84 \pm 0.07$ GeV and explain the precise measurements of kaon form factor in the perturbative timelike region. As a remarkable byproduct, we found that the incorporation of iTMDs improves the pQCD predictions for electromagnetic form factors, extending the applicable range to a few GeV$^2$. This improvement allows for direct comparison with existing measurements and lattice QCD evaluations.</description>

      <title>Probing a diffuse flux of axion-like particles from galactic supernovae with neutrino water Cherenkov detectors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.09595v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this article, we claim that axion-like particles (ALPs) with MeV masses can be produced with semi-relativistic velocities in core-collapse supernovae (SNe), generating a diffuse galactic flux. We show that these ALPs can be detected in neutrino water Cherenkov detectors via $a \, p \rightarrow p \, \gamma$ interactions. Using Super-Kamiokande data, we derive new constraints on the ALP parameter space, excluding a region spanning more than one order of magnitude in the ALP-proton coupling above cooling bounds for ALP masses in the range of $1-80$ MeV and ALP-proton couplings between $8\times10^{-6}-2\times10^{-4}$. We show that the future Hyper-Kamiokande will be able to probe couplings as small as $2.5\times10^{-6}$, fully closing the allowed region above SN 1987A cooling bounds.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Correction to the Magnetic Moment of the Charged Lepton</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.07610v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The general Hamiltonian expression, up to the first-order relativistic correction, was derived by breaking the four-component Dirac equation into the two-component Dirac-Pauli equation. This Hamiltonian incorporates the first-order relativistic correction to the electromagnetic interaction with the spin and orbital magnetic moments of the charged lepton, distinguishing it from other generic Hamiltonians. Notably, our Hamiltonian is applicable to scenarios involving non-uniform magnetic fields, providing a more general framework for describing relativistic effects. Using this generalized Hamiltonian, we calculated the first-order relativistic adjustment to the Land\'e \( g \)-factor (or equivalently, the magnetic moment) for hydrogen-like atoms in the presence of an external magnetic field. Our results provide a novel expression for the relativistic correction of order \(\alpha^2\) to the \( g \) factor, which explicitly depends on the azimuthal quantum number as \( m^2_j \) and reduces to the well-known Breit result for specific states. Both quantum field theory (QFT) and relativistic corrections contribute to the \( g \) factor of hydrogen-like ions. The QFT contribution is intrinsic, while the relativistic correction depends on the particle's kinematics and external electromagnetic field. For highly charged ions with \( Z \approx \sqrt{1/\alpha} \), relativistic effects become comparable to QFT corrections and play a significant role.</description>

Abstract: We consider a generic class of effective quantum field theories with arbitrary gauge groups and scalar matter fields. In such theories, we derive the one-loop Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) for the physical dimension-six operators. The present paper is the first one in a series that is going to cover theories with spin-$\frac12$ matter fields, too, including the phenomenologically most relevant SMEFT and LEFT cases. Our present approach provides tools for deriving the yet unknown two-loop RGEs in the SMEFT.</description>

      <title>Baryon Construction with $\eta^\prime$ Meson Field</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.18159v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the low-energy regime, baryons with $N_f \geq 2$ have long been constructed as skyrmions or through bag models, but such constructions for $N_f = 1$ are hindered by the trivial topological structure of the meson field. Recent proposals suggest that one-flavor baryons can instead be interpreted as quantum Hall droplets on the $\eta'$ domain wall, providing a potential link to quark--hadron continuity at high density. In retrospect, the qualitative or semi-qualitative construction of one-flavor baryons on the $\eta'$ domain wall reveals that these baryons can be described as quantum Hall droplets, resembling topological solitons akin to skyrmions. Using an effective theory on the $\eta'$ domain wall, which is conjectured to be the Chern--Simons--Higgs theory, it is discussed that its vortex solution with unit baryon numbers naturally has a spin of $N_c/2$, and thus can be interpreted as a baryon or multi-baryon structure. The particle--vortex duality suggests that quarks carry a fractional topological charge of $1/N_c$ and obey fractional statistics. In terms of chiral bag models, confinement can be attributed to the monopoles confined within the bag, and the vector meson fields on the bag surface are essential for ensuring the correct baryon number in the chiral bag framework, thereby providing deeper insights into baryons as non-trivial topological structures of the meson field. In this paper, we review the progress in this development, with a special focus on the $\eta^\prime$ domain wall dynamics. Naive extensions to $N_f \geq 2$ are also discussed.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.04456v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Several detection strategies for wave-like dark matter make use of gradients in the dark matter field, e.g. searches for spin-dependent derivative interactions in CASPEr-wind or experiments looking for oscillating forces. These gradients are usually suppressed by the local dark matter velocity $\sim 10^{-3}$. In this note we investigate how these gradients are modified in the presence of additional quadratic interactions of the dark matter field with ordinary matter. In this case the dark matter density and field are modified in the vicinity of Earth, affecting the detection sensitivity due to the change in the local field value at the Earth's surface but also due to the gradient of the field profile itself. We also use this opportunity to present results on the expected field profiles in presence of a non-vanishing relative velocity of the dark matter with respect to Earth. We also comment how this ameliorates the divergences that appear for certain attractive coupling values.</description>

      <title>QCD analysis of $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors and the $\vert V_{ub} \vert$ extraction from $B_{l4}$ decays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.07333v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The decays of $B_{l4}$ offer an independent method for determining the CKM matrix element $\vert V_{ub} \vert$, with a QCD analysis of the underlying $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors serving as a crucial component in this process. We present a comprehensive QCD analysis of the $B \to \pi\pi$ form factors within the framework of light-cone sum rules, employing two-pion light-cone distribution amplitudes ($2\pi$DAs). For the first time, the twist-three distribution amplitudes are explicitly defined, and their contributions are systematically calculated. Leveraging the recently measured partial decay fractions of $B^+ \to \pi^+\pi^- l^+ \nu_l$ by the Belle detector, we obtain $\vert V_{ub} \vert = \left( 4.27 \pm 0.49\vert_{\rm data} \pm 0.55\vert_{\rm LCSRs} \right) \times 10^{-3}$ within the dominant region of the $\rho$ resonance. We clarify that the relatively small value of $\vert V_{ub} \vert$ extracted from $B \to \rho l \nu$, when compared to the golden channel $B \to \pi l\nu$, arises due to the finite width and nonresonant effects. We anticipate future measurements of purely isovector and isoscalar $B_{l4}$ decays, which will aid in reducing uncertainties by enhancing our understanding of the $\pi\pi$ phase shifts in the $2\pi$DAs through heavy flavor decays.</description>

      <title>Study of $1^{--}$ P wave charmoniumlike and bottomoniumlike tetraquark spectroscopy</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.00552v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The masses of $1^{--}$ P-wave charmonium-like and bottomonium-like tetraquark states are calculated in a constituent quark model (CQM) where the Cornell-like potential and Breit-Fermi interaction are employed. All model parameters were imported from previous work, and predetermined by studying the low-lying conventional S- and P-wave light, charmed, bottom, charmonium, and bottomonium meson mass spectra. The decay widths of $1^{--}$ P-wave tetraquark states are calculated for possible two-body strong decay channels within the rearrangement mechanism, including $\omega \chi_{cJ}$, $\eta J/\psi$, and $\rho J/\psi$ for charmonium-like tetraquarks, and $\omega \chi_{bJ}$ for bottomonium-like tetraquarks. The tetraquark theoretical results are compared with the selected exotic states, also known as Y states, and tentative assignments are suggested. This study suggests that $\psi(4230)$, $\psi(4360)$, $\psi(4660)$, and $\Upsilon$(10753) may be P-wave tetraquark states and that multiple states might exist around 4.23 GeV and 4.36 GeV.</description>

      <title>Identified hadron production at hadron colliders in NNLO QCD</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.11489v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work we calculate for the first time the next-to-next-to leading order (NNLO) QCD corrections to identified hadron production at hadron colliders. The inclusion of the NNLO correction has an important impact on all observables considered in this work. Higher order corrections reduce scale uncertainty and in almost all cases are moderate. Overall, good perturbative convergence is observed across kinematics and observables. The uncertainty due to missing higher orders is relatively small and, in many cases, smaller than the experimental uncertainty. The largest source of theoretical uncertainty at present is from the knowledge of the non-perturbative parton-to-hadron fragmentation functions (FF), which dwarfs the scale uncertainty in most kinematic ranges. The inclusion of NNLO corrections demonstrates the precision studies potential of this class of observables. To fully realize this potential, however, a new generation of improved fragmentation functions may be needed. The results of the present work will enable global fits of FF with NNLO precision.</description>

      <title>Pseudo-Goldstone Dark Matter from Primordial Black Holes: Gravitational Wave Signatures and Implications for KM3-230213A Event at KM3NeT</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.14332v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In many well-motivated new physics models, the pseudo-Nambu-Goldstone boson (pNGB) from U(1) symmetry breaking emerges as a promising dark matter candidate. Its coupling, suppressed by the symmetry breaking scale, prevents thermal equilibrium in the early Universe for high scale symmetry breaking. Thus, pNGB dark matter is predominantly produced via non-thermal mechanisms, such as the freeze-in process through a new portal coupling. In this work, we explore a novel mechanism for the production of pNGB dark matter even with feeble Higgs portal coupling-arising from Hawking radiation or superradiance of primordial black holes. We systematically investigate the production of light and heavy pNGB dark matter, both for Schwarzschild and Kerr black holes. We also discuss its potential gravitational wave signatures from domain wall collapse, density perturbations, and Hawking radiation. If the ultraviolet (UV) model is considered, the recent $\mathcal{O}$(100) PeV neutrino event KM3-230213A at KM3NeT can be naturally explained.</description>

      <title>Probing Hadron-quark Transition Through Binary Neutron Star Merger</title>

Abstract: The cores of massive neutron stars offer a unique environment for the nuclear matter at intermediate density in the universe. The global characteristics of a neutron star, as well as the gravitational waves emitted from the mergers of two neutron stars, offer valuable insights into dense nuclear matter. In this paper, we comprehensively investigate the effect of the potential hadron-quark transition on the properties of neutron stars and the signals of the gravitational waves stemming from the merger of binary neutron stars, including waveforms, frequency evolutions as well as the spectrum curves, utilizing the equations of state constructed from the Maxwell ansatz, Gibbs ansatz and, the crossover scenario. We explicitly construct the equations of state in such a way that they converge at low and high densities therefore the differences are only from the scenarios of the transitions and the locations -- or the parameters in the equation of state. Using such constructed equations of state, we simulate the signals of the gravitational wave (GW) and analyze their differences due to locations of the transition, the scenarios of the transition, and the masses of the component stars. We find that (1) in both the Maxwell ansatz and Gibbs ansatz, GW signals are sensitive to the location and the latent heat of the phase transition, (2) in the post-merger phase, the frequency of GW increases with the evolution in Maxwell type transition but is stable in the other two types of transitions and, (3) the amount of radiated energy is the biggest in Gibbs construction (GC) type transition and the smallest in the crossover construction (CC) type transition. By combining our findings with the expected detection of gravitational waves around $(2$-$4)$ kHz from binary neutron star mergers and their associated electromagnetic signals, we expect to uncover some key characteristics of dense nuclear matter.</description>

      <title>$\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM cosmology from a type-II minimally modified gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.07716v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We have successfully integrated $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM, a promising model for alleviating cosmological tensions, into a theoretical framework by endowing it with a specific Lagrangian from the VCDM model, a type-II minimally modified gravity. In this theory, we demonstrate that an auxiliary scalar field with a linear potential induces an effective cosmological constant, enabling the realization of an abrupt mirror AdS-dS transition in the late universe through a piecewise linear potential. To eliminate the sudden singularity in this setup and ensure stable transitions, we smooth out this potential. Realized within the VCDM theory, the $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM model facilitates two types of rapid smooth mirror AdS-dS transitions: (i) the agitated transition, associated with a smooth jump in the potential, where $\Lambda_{\rm s}$, and consequently $H$, exhibits a bump around the transition's midpoint; and (ii) the quiescent transition, associated with a smooth change in the slope of the potential, where $\Lambda_{\rm s}$ transitions gracefully. These transitions are likely to leave distinct imprints on the background and perturbation dynamics, potentially allowing the observational data to distinguish between them. This novel theoretical framework propels $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM into a fully predictive model capable of exploring the evolution of the Universe including the late-time AdS-dS transition epoch, and extends the applicability of the model. We believe further research is crucial in establishing $\Lambda_{\rm s}$CDM as a leading candidate or guide for a new concordance cosmological model.</description>

      <title>Universality of pseudo-Goldstone damping near critical points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03503v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems, in particular its critical dynamics near phase transitions, have been always on the cutting edge of studies in diverse fields of physics, e.g., high energy physics, condensed matter, holography, etc. In this work, we investigate the critical damping of collective modes associated with spontaneous breaking of approximate symmetries, which are called pseudo-Goldstone modes, in strongly correlated systems. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh field theory, we find a universal pseudo-Goldstone damping via the critical O($N$) model that has never been found before by other approaches. Different from the conventional damping found in holography and hydrodynamics, the new one is controlled by critical fluctuations, hence is invisible in mean-field systems or strongly correlated systems with classical gravity duals. Since the critical damping depends solely on the universalities of the critical point, irrespective of the microscopic details, our conclusion should be applicable to a wide class of interacting systems.</description>

      <title>First Search for High-Energy Neutrino Emission from Galaxy Mergers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06539</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06539v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The exact sources of high-energy neutrinos detected by the IceCube neutrino observatory still remain a mystery. For the first time, this work explores the hypothesis that galaxy mergers may serve as sources for these high-energy neutrinos. Galaxy mergers can host very high-energy hadronic and photohadronic processes, which may produce very high-energy neutrinos. We perform an unbinned maximum-likelihood-ratio analysis utilizing the galaxy merger data from six catalogs and 10 years of public IceCube muon-track data to quantify any correlation between these mergers and neutrino events. First, we perform the single source search analysis, which reveals that none of the considered galaxy mergers exhibit a statistically significant correlation with high-energy neutrino events detected by IceCube. Furthermore, we conduct a stacking analysis with three different weighting schemes to understand if these galaxy mergers can contribute significantly to the diffuse flux of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos detected by IceCube. We find that upper limits (at $95\%$ CL) of the all flavor high-energy neutrino flux, associated with galaxy mergers considered in this study, at $100$ TeV with spectral index $\Gamma=-2$ are $1.11\times 10^{-18}$, $3.69 \times 10^{-19}$ and $1.02 \times 10^{-18}$ $\rm GeV^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}\,sr^{-1}$ for the three weighting schemes. This work shows that these selected galaxy mergers do not contribute significantly to the IceCube detected high energy neutrino flux. We hope that in the near future with more data, the search for neutrinos from galaxy mergers can either discover their neutrino production or impose more stringent constraints on the production mechanism of high-energy neutrinos within galaxy mergers.</description>

      <title>Nanohertz gravitational waves from a quasar-based supermassive black hole binary population model as dark sirens</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.00609v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently, several pulsar timing array (PTA) projects have detected evidence of the existence of a stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB) in the nanohertz frequency band, providing confidence in detecting individual supermassive black hole binaries (SMBHBs) in the future. Nanohertz GWs emitted by inspiraling SMBHBs encode the luminosity distances of SMBHBs. They can serve as dark sirens to explore the cosmic expansion history via a statistical method to obtain the redshift information of GW sources' host galaxies using galaxy catalogs. The theoretical analysis of the dark siren method relies on the modeling of the population of SMBHBs. Using a population model consistent with the latest SGWB observations is essential, as the SGWB provides significant information about the distribution of SMBHBs. In this work, we employ a quasar-based model, which can self-consistently account for the SGWB amplitude, to estimate the population of SMBHBs. We constrain the Hubble constant using the mock GW data from different detection cases of PTAs in the future. Our results show that a PTA consisting of 100 pulsars with a white noise level of 20 ns could measure the Hubble constant with a precision close to $1\%$ over a 10-year observation period, and a PTA with 200 pulsars may achieve this goal over a 5-year observation period. The results indicate that modeling the SMBHB population significantly influences the analysis of dark sirens, and SMBHB dark sirens have the potential to be developed as a valuable cosmological probe.</description>

      <title>Exploring neutrino interactions in light of present and upcoming galaxy surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.03712</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.03712v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the standard cosmological framework, neutrinos begin to free-stream after the weak interaction phase ends in the early universe, at a temperature of approximately $T \sim 1 \, {\rm MeV}$. However, the onset of neutrino free-streaming can be delayed if additional interactions occur in the early universe, leaving imprints on both the cosmic microwave background (CMB) angular power spectra and the large-scale structure (LSS) matter power spectra. We present a thorough analysis of early universe neutrino interactions with a fairly generalized parameterization of the interaction rates as a power law in neutrino temperature. In this (6+2) parameter scenario, we constrain the cosmological parameters along with the free-streaming redshift and the sum of the neutrino mass in presence of such interactions, with the help of full shape (FS) galaxy power spectra from BOSS Data Release 12. Our analysis reveals that a combined dataset of FS along with CMB and BAO offers improved constraints on the free-streaming redshift from present data, comparable to the forecast results from future CMB-S4 data. Additionally, we investigate the prospects of future galaxy surveys by forecasting on Euclid mission in combination with Planck and CMB-S4, and find significant improvement on both the free-streaming redshift and the sum of the neutrino mass than the existing constraints as well as than CMB-S4 alone.</description>

Abstract: We present a procedure for handling asymmetric errors. Many results in particle physics are presented as values with different positive and negative errors, and there is no consistent procedure for handling them. We consider the difference between errors quoted using pdfs and using likelihoods, and the difference between the rms spread of a measurement and the 68\% central confidence region. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the possibilities, and software tools to enable their use.</description>

      <title>Clear skies ahead: characterizing atmospheric gravity gradient noise for vertical atom interferometers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.05379v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Terrestrial long-baseline atom interferometer experiments are emerging as powerful tools for probing new fundamental physics, including searches for dark matter and gravitational waves. In the frequency range relevant to these signals, gravity gradient noise (GGN) poses a significant challenge. While previous studies for vertical instruments have focused on GGN induced by seismic waves, atmospheric fluctuations in pressure and temperature also lead to variations in local gravity. In this work, we advance the understanding of atmospheric GGN in vertical atom interferometers, formulating a robust characterization of its impact. We evaluate the effectiveness of underground placement of atom interferometers as a passive noise mitigation strategy. Additionally, we empirically derive global high- and low-noise models for atmospheric pressure GGN and estimate an analogous range for atmospheric temperature GGN. To highlight the variability of temperature-induced noise, we compare data from three prospective experimental sites. Our findings establish atmospheric GGN as comparable to seismic noise in its impact and underscore the importance of including these effects in site selection and active noise monitoring for future experiments.</description>

      <title>Double Exponents in $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Cosmology</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.19324v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recently proposed $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ invariant $\alpha$-attractor models have plateau potentials with respect to the inflaton and axion fields. The slope of the potential in the inflaton direction is exponentially suppressed at large values of the inflaton field, but the slope of the potential in the axion direction is double-exponentially suppressed. Therefore, the axion field remains nearly massless and practically does not change during inflation. The inflationary trajectory in such models is stable with respect to quantum fluctuations of the axion field. We show that isocurvature perturbations do not feed into the curvature perturbations during inflation, and discuss the possibility of such transfer at the post-inflationary stage.</description>

      <title>Page Time of Primordial Black Holes in the Standard Model and Beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04430</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.04430v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Page time marks the moment when the von Neumann entropy of the emitted Hawking radiation equals the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy of an evaporating black hole, which is assumed to quantify its degrees of freedom as seen from the outside. Beyond this point, from unitarity we would expect that the entropy of the radiation begins to decrease, ensuring that information is eventually recovered. In this work, we investigate the dependence of the Page time on black hole properties and the particle content of nature. Specifically, we analyze its sensitivity to the Standard Model (SM) and potential Beyond-the-SM degrees of freedom, incorporating the effects of particle masses. We find that a Schwarzschild primordial black hole (PBH) with an initial mass of $6.23\times 10^{14}~{\rm g}$ would have a Page time equal to the age of the Universe, assuming emission of SM particles only. We further explore the impact of a non-negligible PBH angular momentum, finding that light spin-2 particles are predominantly emitted before the Page time. Specifically, for initial angular momenta values exceeding $a_\star &gt; 0.5$, approximately $70\%$ of the total graviton emission occurs prior to the Page time for PBHs with an initial mass $M_{\rm BH} \lesssim 10^{10}~{\rm g}$. Finally, we discuss the implications for PBH phenomenology, particularly regarding potential constraints from $\Delta N_{\rm eff}$ measurements.</description>

      <title>Fine-tuning machine-learned particle-flow reconstruction for new detector geometries in future colliders</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00131</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00131v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate transfer learning capabilities in a machine-learned algorithm trained for particle-flow reconstruction in high energy particle colliders. This paper presents a cross-detector fine-tuning study, where we initially pre-train the model on a large full simulation dataset from one detector design, and subsequently fine-tune the model on a sample with a different collider and detector design. Specifically, we use the Compact Linear Collider detector (CLICdet) model for the initial training set, and demonstrate successful knowledge transfer to the CLIC-like detector (CLD) proposed for the Future Circular Collider in electron-positron mode (FCC-ee). We show that with an order of magnitude less samples from the second dataset, we can achieve the same performance as a costly training from scratch, across particle-level and event-level performance metrics, including jet and missing transverse momentum resolution. Furthermore, we find that the fine-tuned model achieves comparable performance to the traditional rule-based particle-flow approach on event-level metrics after training on 100,000 CLD events, whereas a model trained from scratch requires at least 1 million CLD events to achieve similar reconstruction performance. To our knowledge, this represents the first full-simulation cross-detector transfer learning study for particle-flow reconstruction. These findings offer valuable insights towards building large foundation models that can be fine-tuned across different detector designs and geometries, helping to accelerate the development cycle for new detectors and opening the door to rapid detector design and optimization using machine learning.</description>

      <title>Renormalising the Field-Space Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09785v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of one-loop quantum corrections in scalar effective field theories from a geometric viewpoint, emphasizing the role of field-space curvature and its renormalisation. By treating the scalar fields as coordinates on a Riemannian manifold, we exploit field redefinition invariance to maintain manifest coordinate independence of physical observables. Focusing on the non-linear sigma model (NLSM) and \(\phi^4\) theory, we demonstrate how loop corrections induce momentum- and scale-dependent shifts in the curvature of the field-space manifold. These corrections can be elegantly captured through the recently proposed geometry-kinematics duality, which generalizes the colour-kinematics duality in gauge theories to curved field-space backgrounds. Our results highlight a universal structure emerging in the contractions of Riemann tensors that contribute to renormalisation of the field-space curvature. In particular, we find explicit expressions and a universal structure for the running curvature and Ricci scalar in simple models, illustrating how quantum effects reshape the underlying geometry. This geometric formulation unifies a broad class of scalar EFTs, providing insight into the interplay of curvature, scattering amplitudes, and renormalisation.</description>

      <title>Modified gravity constraints with Planck ISW-lensing bispectrum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09893</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.09893v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present updated constraints on modified gravity by including the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect from CMB lensing-CMB temperature cross-correlations, based on the latest Planck PR4 maps. Utilizing the Effective Field Theory of dark energy approach and adopting the $w_0w_a$CDM background cosmological model, we find that including the CMB ISW lensing cross-correlations tighten constraints on the modified gravity parameters by approximately $20\%$, reducing the viable parameter space by $40-80\%$. We derive constraints from Planck CMB, Planck and ACT CMB lensing, DESI DR1 BAO, CMB ISW-lensing, and type Ia supernovae (SN Ia) data. The constraints on the EFT parameters controlling the kinetic braiding and non-minimal coupling are consistent with General Relativity (GR) at the $95\%$ CL. In the $w_0$-$w_a$ parameter space, our results imply a crossing of the phantom divide, $w=-1$. The modified gravity model shows a mild preference over $\Lambda$CDM at the $1.8\sigma$, $2.6\sigma$ and $3.2\sigma$ levels for the combinations with Pantheon+, Union3 and DESY5 supernova datasets. We find that using the latest $\texttt{HiLLiPoP}+\texttt{LoLLiPoP}$ likelihoods alleviates the departure of modified gravity parameters from the GR-values compared to results using {\it Planck} 2018 data. This paper underlines the importance of the ISW lensing probe in constraining late-time modifications of gravity.</description>

Abstract: Recently, the KM3NeT Collaboration announced the detection of a 220 PeV neutrino from the celestial coordinates RA=94.3\degree~ and Dec=-7.8\degree~ on 13 February 2023 at 01:16:47 UTC \cite{KM3NeT:2025npi}. The source for this extra-ordinary cosmic neutrino, designated KM3-230213A, is not identified yet but there has been speculation that it might be associated with a gamma-ray burst GRB~090401B \cite{Amelino-Camelia:2025lqn}. The purpose of this report is to search the association of this 220 PeV neutrino with potential GRB sources from a more general consideration of Lorentz invariance violation (LV) without predefined LV scale. We try to associate this extra-ordinary neutrino with potential GRBs within angular separation of 1\degree, 3\degree~ and 5\degree~ respectively and the results are listed in Table 1. We find the constraints $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.3\times 10^{18}$~GeV for subluminal LV violation and $E_{\rm{LV}}\leq 5.6\times 10^{19}$~GeV for superluminal LV violation if KM3-230213A is a GRB neutrino.</description>
