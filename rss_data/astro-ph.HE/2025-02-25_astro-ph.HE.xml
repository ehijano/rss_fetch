      <title>The Galactic Magnetic Field and UHECR Deflections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15876v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) experience deflections as they traverse the Galactic magnetic field (GMF), which must be accounted for when tracing them back to their sources. After briefly summarizing our results on uncertainties in cosmic-ray deflections from the UF23 ensemble of GMF models (Unger &amp; Farrar, 2024), we report a new preliminary fit of the GMF including foreground emission from the Local Bubble. This fit uses the analytic model of Pelgrims et al. (2024) for the magnetic field in the thick shell Galactic bubbles. We also discuss how variations in toroidal halo field modeling account for the key differences between the Jansson &amp; Farrar (2012) GMF model and the UF23 ensemble.
  We also extend our previous analysis of the origin of the highest-energy "Amaterasu" event observed by the Telescope Array to include the four highest-energy events detected by the Pierre Auger Observatory. Amaterasu and PAO070114 are the UHECR events with the smallest localization uncertainties of 4.7% and 2.4%, respectively. Neither of their back-tracked directions aligns with any compelling candidate for a continuous UHECR accelerator. This strengthens the evidence that at least a fraction of the highest energy events originate from transient sources.</description>

      <title>Physics motivated models of pulsar X-ray hotspots: off-center dipole configurations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15881</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15881v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, it was proposed that an off-center dipole magnetic configuration, together with a non-trivial temperature profile, may be the best model to explain the X-ray light curve of PSR J0030+0451 observed by the Neutron Star Interior Composition Explorer (\emph{NICER}). Using a theoretical model for the electric current density in a force-free pulsar magnetosphere, we compute from first principles the distribution of electric current over the polar cap associated with an off-center magnetic dipole. We then use a simple prescription to compute the resulting temperature distribution, which allows us to derive the observed X-ray light curve. We investigate the role of the volumetric return current region in the polar cap and find that although it does not make a big difference in an aligned dipole case, the difference can be bigger in the case of an off-center dipole. Finally, we apply Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) fitting to the X-ray light curves of pulsars PSR J0030+0451 and PSR J0437--4715 with and without the volumetric return current, and find that our model can reasonably recover the observed X-ray light curves.</description>

      <title>Modeling the emission lines from r-process elements in Supernova nebulae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15896v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The origin of heavy r-process elements in the universe is still a matter of great debate, with a confirmed scenario being neutron star (NS) mergers. Additional relevant sites could be specific classes of events, such as gamma-ray burst (GRB) Supernovae (SNe), where a central engine could push neutron-rich material outwards, contributing to the ejecta of the massive exploding star. Here, we investigate our ability to infer the production of heavy elements in such scenarios, on the basis of the observed nebular emission. We solve the steady-state ionization, level population, and thermal balance, for optically thin ejecta in non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE), in order to explore the role of heavy elements in cooling the gas, and their imprint in the emergent spectrum a few hundreds days post-explosion. We find that heavy elements would be relevant in the cooling process of the nebula only if they account for at least $\sim1\%$ of the total ejected mass, at the typical kinetic temperatures of a few thousands K. However, even in the absence of such amount, a few $0.1\%$ of the total ejected mass could be instead sufficient to leave a detectable imprint around $\sim1-10~\mathrm{\mu m}$. This wavelength range, which would be relatively clean from features due to light elements, would be instead robustly populated by lines from heavy elements arising from forbidden transitions in their atomic fine structures. Hence, the new generation of telescopes, represented by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), will most likely allow for their detection.</description>

      <title>Modeling the shadow of Sgr A* through an eclipsing black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) observations of Sgr A* resolved the photon ring at the galactic centre, revealing a diameter of $51.8~\mu \text{as}$. The ring-like structure is consistent with that of a Kerr black hole. However, the source of the high bright regions in the image and the time variability remain an open question. Besides the plasma properties and emission models, the spacetime geometry also holds an important role. We present an image depicting the bright hot spots consistent with Sgr A* observations at a wavelength $ \lambda $ = 1.3mm. The image is the result of an eclipsing Schwarzschild black hole situated along the line of sight between the galactic centre and Earth. The separation from both, primary (Sgr A*) and secondary (eclipsing) black holes is $10233\, {\rm AU}$. The central supermassive black hole located at the centre of the galaxy has an observational mass of $4.14\times10^6\,M_{\odot}$ and the secondary eclipsing black hole has an inferred mass of $1035\,M_{\odot}$.</description>

      <title>Multiwavelength Variability Analysis of the Blazar PKS 0727-11: A $\sim$168 Days Quasi-periodic Oscillation in Gamma-ray</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16110v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed variability analysis of the multiwavelength light curves for the flat-spectrum radio quasar PKS 0727-11. Using the generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram, we identified a possible quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) of $\sim$ 168.6 days (persisted for 6 cycles, with a significance of $3.8\sigma$) in the gamma-ray light curve during the flare period (MJD 54687-55738). It is the first time that periodic variations have been detected in this source, and further supported by other methods: weighted wavelet $z$-transform, phase dispersion minimization, REDFIT, autoregressive integrated moving average model, and structure function analysis. Cross-correlation analysis shows that there is a strong correlation between multi-band light variations, indicating that gamma-ray and radio flares may originate from the same disturbance, and the distance between the emission regions of gamma-ray and radio flares is calculated based on the time lag. We demonstrate that QPO arising from the non-ballistic helical jet motion driven by the orbital motion in a supermassive binary black hole is a plausible physical explanation. In this scenario, the estimated mass of the primary black hole is $M\sim3.66\times10^8-5.79\times10^{9}M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray burst plateaus within the framework of black hole spin-down</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we investigate observational correlations between the properties of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) across the gamma, X-ray, and optical bands during the prompt and plateau phases of their light curves (LCs). Our analysis includes all GRBs with known redshifts detected by the Neil Gehrels {\it Swift} Observatory ({\it Swift}) and the {\it Fermi} Gamma-ray Space Telescope ({\it Fermi}), as well as ground-based optical telescopes. We identify a tight correlation with the $R^2$ coefficient of $\sim 0.89$ for the three-dimensional Dainotti relation between the luminosity at the end of the plateau, its duration measured by {\it Swift}, and the peak luminosity measured by {\it Fermi} in the 10-1000 keV band. When accounting for redshift evolution, we achieve very small intrinsic scatter $\sigma_{int}=0.25\pm0.04$ ($\sim 43\%$ reduction compared to the previous results). Additionally, we explore correlations involving the optical luminosity at the end of the plateau, yielding promising results. We investigate the clustering of different classes of GRBs in the investigated parameter space and discuss its impact on the correlations. Finally, we discuss the theory supporting the evidence of the plateau emission. We present a new paradigm for the GRB plateau: energy extraction from a quickly rotating black hole via spin-down by a magnetically arrested disk. We compare this model with observations and explain multiple observed features. We predict the plateau luminosity - time anti-correlation and discuss the cosmological evolution within this proposed model. Furthermore, within this new model, we discuss the possible physical origin of the clustering of long and short GRBs in the parameter space of plateau luminosity - time - prompt luminosity.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Cosmic-ray Energy Based on Observations of Nearby Galaxy Clusters by LHAASO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxy clusters act as reservoirs of high-energy cosmic rays (CRs). As CRs propagate through the intracluster medium, they generate diffuse $\gamma$-rays detectable by arrays such as LHAASO. These $\gamma$-rays result from proton-proton ($pp$) collisions of very high-energy cosmic rays (VHECRs) or inverse Compton (IC) scattering of positron-electron pairs created by $p\gamma$ interactions of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). We analyzed diffuse $\gamma$-ray emission from the Coma, Perseus, and Virgo clusters using LHAASO data. Diffuse emission was modeled as a disk of radius $R_{500}$ for each cluster while accounting for point sources. No significant diffuse emission was detected, yielding 95\% confidence level (C.L.) upper limits on the $\gamma$-ray flux: for WCDA (1-25~TeV) and KM2A ($&gt;25$~TeV), less than $(49.4, 13.7, 54.0)$ and $(1.34, 1.14, 0.40) \times 10^{-14}$~ph~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$ for Coma, Perseus, and Virgo, respectively. The $\gamma$-ray upper limits can be used to derive model-independent constraints on the integral energy of CRp above 10~TeV (corresponding to the LHAASO observational range $&gt;1$~TeV under the $pp$ scenario) to be less than $(1.96, 0.59, 0.08) \times 10^{61}$~erg. The absence of detectable annuli/ring-like structures, indicative of cluster accretion or merging shocks, imposes further constraints on models in which the UHECRs are accelerated in the merging shocks of galaxy clusters.</description>

      <title>Hyper-active repeating fast radio bursts from rotation modulated starquakes on magnetars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16626</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16626v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The non-detection of periodicity related to rotation challenges the magnetar model for fast radio bursts (FRBs). Moreover, a bimodal distribution of the burst waiting times is widely observed in hyper-active FRBs, a significant deviation from the exponential distribution expected from stationary Poisson processes. By combining the epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) earthquake model and the rotating vector model (RVM) involving the rotation of the magnetar and orientations of the spin and magnetic axes, we find that starquake events modulated by the rotation of FRB-emitting magnetar can explain the bimodal distribution of FRB waiting times, as well as the non-detection of periodicity in active repeating FRBs. We analyze data from multiple FRB sources, demonstrating that differences in waiting time distributions and observed energies can be explained by varying parameters related to magnetar properties and starquake dynamics. Our results suggest that rotation-modulated starquakes on magnetars can possibly be a unified source for FRBs. Notably, we find that active repeaters tend to have small magnetic inclination angles in order to hide their periodicity. We also show that our model can reproduce the waiting time distribution of a pulsar phase of the galactic magnetar SGR J1935+2154 with a larger inclination angle than the active repeaters, which could explain the detection of spin period and the relatively low observed energy for FRBs from the magnetar. The spin periods of active repeaters are not well constrained, but most likely fall in the valley region between the two peaks of the waiting time distributions.</description>

      <title>Feasibility of Dark Matter in Neutron Stars: A Quantitative Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis investigates the impact of dark matter on neutron star properties, focusing on mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Using two-fluid and single-fluid models, dark matter is incorporated into the equation of state (EOS) via a Relativistic Mean Field (RMF) approach. The study finds that increasing dark matter content reduces the maximum mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Bayesian inference, supported by LIGO-Virgo gravitational wave data and NICER mass-radius measurements, refines these models. Despite dark matter's influence, the semi-universal C-Love relation remains valid. Machine learning techniques effectively classify dark matter-admixed neutron stars. The thesis also explores a sigma-cut potential in the EOS, which stiffens the EOS at high densities, favoring larger radii and lower f-mode frequencies. The study of non-radial oscillations, particularly f- and p-modes, highlights their sensitivity to neutron star composition and EOS. These findings enhance our understanding of neutron star interiors and dark matter's role, emphasizing the need for further observational and theoretical advancements.</description>

      <title>Stochastic description of UHECR interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16760</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16760v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photointeractions of ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) in astro-physical scenarios are in general of stochastic nature and are often modeled with Monte Carlo methods to obtain the form of the distributions resulting from a sequence of interactions. These distributions are non trivial because the products resulting from each interaction as well as the number and distances covered by the secondary nuclear species are all random. In this work, a stochastic approach based on the theory of matrix exponential distributions is employed to describe the cascade distributions analytically and illustrate their potential for tracing the individual history of UHECRs, including inside the source. This analytic description has the advantage of better precision and considerably reduced computational cost in contrast to Monte Carlo codes, while requiring the same inputs: the interaction rates, the multiplicity, and the energy distributions of secondaries from a single interaction. The description of the composition evolution from in-source to extragalactic propagation (currently performed in separate simulations in the literature) is achieved here as a continuous distribution, using a gamma-ray burst scenario inspired by the event GRB170817A. Finally, the potential for locating a source based on the reconstructed UHECR origin employing this description is discussed under simplified general assumptions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16791v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the potential bias in the identification of fast radio burst (FRB) host galaxies due to radio localisation uncertainty. Using a sample of FRBs localised to typically 0.5'' by the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), we artificially increase the localisation uncertainty up to 10'', and re-run the Probabalistic Association of Transients to their Hosts (PATH) algorithm to determine the most likely host galaxy. We do not find evidence of a significant change in identified hosts until the localisation precision is worsened to 2'' or greater.</description>

      <title>Effect of thermal conduction on accretion shocks in relativistic magnetized flows around rotating black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16829</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16829v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the effects of thermal conduction on relativistic, magnetized, viscous, advective accretion flows around rotating black holes considering bremsstrahlung and synchrotron cooling processes. Assuming the toroidal component of magnetic fields as the dominant one, we self-consistently solve the steady-state fluid equations to derive the global transonic accretion solutions for a black hole of spin $a_{\rm k}$. Depending on the model parameters, the magnetized accretion flow undergoes shock transitions and shock-induced global accretion solutions persist over a wide range of model parameters including the conduction parameter ($\Upsilon_{\rm s}$), plasma-$\beta$, and viscosity parameter ($\alpha_{\rm B}$). We find that the shock properties -- such as shock radius ($r_{\rm s}$), compression ratio ($R$), and shock strength ($S$) -- are regulated by $\Upsilon_{\rm s}$, plasma $\beta$, and $\alpha_{\rm B}$. Furthermore, we compute the critical conduction parameter ($\Upsilon_{\rm s}^{\rm cri}$), a threshold beyond which shock formation ceases to exist, and investigate its dependence on plasma-$\beta$ and $\alpha_{\rm B}$ for both weakly rotating ($a_{\rm k} \rightarrow 0$) and rapidly rotating ($a_{\rm k} \rightarrow 1$) black holes. Finally, we examine the spectral energy distribution (SED) of the accretion disc and observe that increased thermal conduction and magnetic field strength lead to more luminous emission spectra from black hole sources.</description>

      <title>Ultra-High-Energy Cosmic Rays from Active Galactic Nuclei Jets: The Role of Supermassive Black Hole Growth and Accretion States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16873</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16873v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Jets emanating from active galactic nuclei (AGN) represent some of the most formidable particle accelerators in the universe, thereby emerging as viable candidates responsible for the detection of ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs). If AGN jets indeed serve as origins of UHECRs, then the diffuse flux of these cosmic rays would be dependent on the power and duty cycle of these jets, which are inherently connected to the nature of black hole accretion flows. In this article, we present our cosmological semi-analytic framework, JET(Jets from Early Times), designed to trace the evolution of jetted AGN populations. This framework serves as a valuable tool for predictive analyses of cosmic ray energy density and, potentially, neutrino energy density. By using JET, we model the formation and evolution of galaxies and supermassive black holes (SMBHs) from z = 20 to z = 1, incorporating jet formation and feedback mechanisms and distinguishing between various accretion states determined by the SMBH Eddington ratios. The implications of different SMBH growth models on predicting cosmic ray flux are investigated. We provide illustrative examples demonstrating how the associated diffuse UHECR fluxes at the source may vary in relation to the jet production efficiencies and the selected SMBH growth model, linking cosmological models of SMBH growth with astroparticle backgrounds.</description>

      <title>Overall Ultra-high Energy Neutrino Emission from GRBs during Jet Expansion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16946v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The ultra-relativistic jet released in gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) is expected to produce ultra-high-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs), prompt gamma-ray emission and hence prompt high-energy neutrinos by photopion interactions. In this work, we calculate the time-integrated neutrino spectrum during the expansion of jets by taking into account the time evolution of cosmic ray and secondary spectra and neutrino production. We numerically solve the continuity equations for nucleons, pions, and muons for their spectral evolution. Since pion and muon damping weakens as the jet expands, the neutrino production at large radii at high energies may dominate that around the jet energy dissipation radius. Compared with the usually adopted approaches that only consider neutrino production around the energy dissipation radius, the overall UHE neutrino fluence integrated over time can be significantly larger, and the flavor fraction of electron neutrinos as function of neutrino energy is different at UHE, due to neutrino production at radii much larger than the energy dissipation radius. The faster magnetic field decay leads to larger UHE neutrino fluence, and the UHE neutrino spectra is weakly dependent on the energy dissipation radius and the jet Lorentz factor. Observations of prompt EeV neutrinos from GRBs by the next-generation neutrino telescopes, e.g., GRAND and IceCube-Gen2, will test the hypothesis of GRBs as UHECR sources and probe the physics of GRB jets.</description>

      <title>High Energy Jet Emission from GRS 1758-258 &amp; 1E 1740.7-2942 with INTEGRAL?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16952</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16952v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942 are two long-known persistent black hole binaries in the Galactic Center region. Using INTEGRAL's extensive monitoring of the Galactic Center and Bulge, we studied their temporal and spectral evolutions in the 30-610 keV energy range from March 2003 through April 2022 with the IBIS/ISGRI gamma-ray telescope. Our analyses found that the sources typically had Comptonized spectra, though not always with the same parameters. The spectral states with more than 8 Ms of observation time show deviations from a Comptonized spectrum above ~200 keV or a "hard tail" that extends up to at least 600 keV. The origin of this component remains debated with the most popular scenarios being synchrotron emission from the jet or Comptonization in a hybrid thermal/non-thermal plasma. Anyway, the GRS 1758-258 and 1E 1740.7-2942 spectra are acceptably described by CompTT+po (jet) and Eqpair (hybrid Comptonization) scenarios. To differentiate between the two scenarios, we calculated the Spearman correlation coefficient comparing 30-50 keV count rates with those in higher energy bands (50-100, 100-300, and 300-600 keV). The count rates below 300 keV are strongly correlated, indicating those photons arise from the same physical process. Above 300 keV the count rates are either anti-correlated or not correlated with the 30-50 keV count rates for GRS 1758-258, which suggests that the photons originate from a different physical process. For 1E 1740.7-2942, the level of correlation is unclear due to scatter in the data points. However, the 300-600 keV count rates are consistent with a constant value. This disfavors the hybrid Comptonization scenario for both sources.</description>

      <title>Observe Gamma-Rays and Neutrinos Associated with Ultra-High Energy Cosmic Rays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16959v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: IceCube measures a diffuse neutrino flux comparable to the Waxman-Bahcall bound, which suggests the possibility that the ultra-high energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) have a common origin with diffuse high energy neutrinos. We propose high energy gamma-ray and/or neutrino observations toward the arrival directions of UHECRs to search for the sources and test this possibility. We calculate the detection probability of gamma-ray/neutrino sources, and find that the average probability per UHECR of &gt;10 EeV is $\sim$10% if the sensitivity of the gamma-ray or neutrino telescope is $\sim$10$^{-12}$ erg cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and the source number density is $\sim$10$^{-5}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. Future gamma-ray and neutrino observations toward UHECRs, e.g., by LHAASO-WCDA, CTA, IceCube/Gen2, are encouraged to constrain the density of UHECR sources or even identify the sources of UHECRs.</description>

      <title>The origin of the very-high-energy radiation along the jet of Centaurus A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17152</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17152v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: As the closest known active galactic nucleus, Centaurus A (Cen A) provides a rich environment for astrophysical exploration. It has been observed across wavelengths from radio to gamma rays, and indications of ongoing particle acceleration have been found on different scales. Recent measurements of very-high-energy (VHE) gamma-rays ($&gt;240$ GeV) by the HESS observatory have inferred the presence of ultra-relativistic electrons along Cen A's jet, yet the underlying acceleration mechanism remains uncertain. Various authors have proposed that jet substructures, known as knots, may serve as efficient particle accelerators. In this study, we investigate the hypothesis that knots are the particle acceleration sites along Cen A's jets. We focus on stationary knots, and assume that they result from interactions between the jet and the stellar winds of powerful stars. By combining relativistic hydrodynamic simulations and shock acceleration theory with the radio and X-ray data, we compare theoretical predictions with morphological and spectral data from different knots. We estimate the maximum electron energy and the resulting VHE gamma-ray emission. Our findings suggest that electrons accelerated at the knots are responsible for the gamma-ray spectrum detected in the VHE band.</description>

      <title>Ultralight Dark Matter Statistics for Pulsar Timing Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15874v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fluctuations in ultralight dark matter produce significant metric perturbations, which may be detected by monitoring the arrival times of light from millisecond pulsars. While searches using this technique are already underway, they do not consistently account for the statistical properties of the dark matter field. The statistics of this field depend on the velocity dispersion of dark matter and, consequently, its coherence length. In the mass range relevant for pulsar timing arrays, the coherence length is comparable to separations between pulsars, making it crucial to incorporate its effects into the analysis. This work presents a consistent statistical method for gravitational direct detection of ultralight dark matter. Our key result is the derivation of the two-point function of the metric fluctuations, which we apply to pulsar timing and discuss its implementation in future searches.</description>

      <title>Exact Nonlinear Decomposition of Ideal-MHD Waves Using Eigenenergies III: Gravity, Generalized Inhomogeneous Quasi-linear PDEs, Mode Conversion, and Numerical Implementation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16010v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Precise tracking and measurement of the energy carried by the individual magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) modes has important implications and utility in astrophysical and laboratory plasmas. Previously, this was only achievable in limited linear MHD cases in the $\beta \ll 1$ or $\beta \gg 1$ regimes. In a series of papers, of which this is the third, we introduced the Eigenenergy Decomposition Method (EEDM) and derived exact analytical expressions for the modal energy components--called eigenenergies--of nonlinear 3D disturbances governed by the homogeneous ideal-MHD equations. Here, we extend the method to inhomogeneous ideal-MHD by introducing a source term accounting for gravity, and provide detailed guidelines for applying the decomposition scheme to any general inhomogeneous quasi-linear PDEs that possess a globally conserved quantity, beyond the realm of MHD. Furthermore, we show that the eigenenergies can be used to locate and measure nonlinear mode conversions, which is an additional feature of the method. Finally, we provide well-categorized context for the application of the method to simulations and discuss the possible numerical inaccuracies that may inevitably arise due to discretization. This paper provides a more mature description of the method and its interpretation, and is recommended as the starting point for readers unfamiliar with the method.</description>

      <title>Characterizing Continuous Gravitational Waves from Supermassive Black Hole Binaries in Realistic Pulsar Timing Array Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pulsar timing arrays recently found evidence for a gravitational wave background (GWB), likely the stochastic overlap of GWs from many supermassive black hole binaries. Anticipating a continuous gravitational wave (CW) detection from a single binary soon to follow, we examine how well current Bayesian methods can detect CWs and characterize their binary properties by modeling the response of the NANOGrav 15-year pulsar timing array to simulated binary populations. We run Markov Chain Monte Carlo searches for CWs in these datasets and compare them to quicker detection statistics including the optimal signal-to-noise ratio, matched filter detection statistic, and reduced log-likelihood ratio between the signal and noise models calculated at the injected parameters. The latter is the best proxy for Bayesian detection fractions, corresponding to a 50% detection fraction (by Bayes factors &gt;10 favoring a CW detection over noise-only model) at a signal-to-noise ratio of 4.6. Source confusion between the GWB and a CW, or between multiple CWs, can cause false detections and unexpected dismissals. 53% of realistic binary populations consistent with the recently observed GWB have successful CW detections. 82% of these CWs are in the 4th or 5th frequency bin of the 16.03 yr dataset (6.9 nHz and 10.8 nHz), with 95 percentile regions spanning 4nHz-12nHz frequencies, $7-20\times10^9 M_\odot$ chirp masses, 60Mpc-8Gpc luminosity distances, and 18-13,000 sq. deg 68% confidence localization areas. These successful detections often poorly recover the chirp mass, with only 29% identifying the chirp mass accurately to within 1 dex with a 68% posterior width also narrower than 1 dex.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16059v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery and characterization of ZTF J0112+5827, a new magnetic cataclysmic variable with an orbital period of 80.9 minutes. ROSAT observations revealed X-ray emission with an average flux of $(68.4 \pm 15.7) \times 10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ (0.1--2.4 keV). The ZTF light curves show ellipsoidal-like variability in the $g$ band and two prominent humps at phases $\sim$0.0 and $\sim$0.7 in $i$ and $r$ bands. Spectroscopic observations with the Palomar 200-inch telescope revealed cyclotron emission features and strong He II and Balmer emission lines. Doppler tomography shows clear accretion streams with line-of-sight velocities of $\sim$500 km s$^{-1}$, but no accretion disk. Analysis of cyclotron harmonics indicates a magnetic field strength of $38.7^{+1.3}_{-1.1}$ MG, confirming ZTF J0112+5827 as a polar system containing a strongly magnetic white dwarf.</description>

      <title>Influence of dark matter on the structure of strange quark stars in one-fluid model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16317v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work studies the influence of scalar dark matter on the structural properties of strange quark stars (SQS) within a one-fluid framework, considering Yukawa interactions between dark matter and quark matter. Contributions from perturbative QCD, Yukawa interaction between scalar dark matter and quarks, and Bose-Einstein condensation of dark matter are included in the model. We first determine the allowable range of Yukawa interaction coupling by imposing the stability condition for strange quark matter (SQM). Using this range, we derive the equation of state (EOS) for different fractions of dark matter within the total pressure of SQS. These fractions are constrained by the tidal deformability limit from GW170817. The presence of dark matter alters the EOS, leading to changes in the mass-radius relationship, tidal deformability, and stability of SQS. We demonstrate that increasing the mass of dark matter softens the EOS, whereas higher fractions of dark matter lead to stiffer EOSs. We also explore the reasons behind this behavior. Our EOSs not only describe massive objects, such as PSR J0952-0607 and PSR J2215+5135, but also satisfy the tidal deformability constraint from GW170817. These results reveal that incorporating dark matter modifies the EOS, enabling the support of higher stellar masses while maintaining consistency with observational data.</description>

      <title>Electron-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instability in magnetized shear flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electron-scale Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities (ESKHI) are found in several astrophysical scenarios. Naturally ESKHI is subject to a background magnetic field, but an analytical dispersion relation and an accurate growth rate of ESKHI under this circumstance are long absent, as former MHD derivations are not applicable in the relativistic regime. We present a generalized dispersion relation of ESKHI in relativistic magnetized shear flows, with few assumptions. ESKHI linear growth rates in certain cases are numerically calculated. We conclude that the presence of an external magnetic field decreases the maximum instability growth rate in most cases, but can slightly increase it when the shear velocity is sufficiently high. Also, the external magnetic field results in a larger cutoff wavenumber of the unstable band and increases the wavenumber of the most unstable mode. PIC simulations are carried out to verify our conclusions, where we also observe the suppressing of kinetic DC magnetic field generation, resulting from electron gyration induced by the external magnetic field.</description>

      <title>Optical appearance of a boson star with soliton potential</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16623v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we conduct an in-depth investigation into the optical images of boson stars with the solitonic potential. In the context of a celestial source and a thin accretion disk, the optical characteristics of the soliton boson star have been derived. Considering the influence of the initial scalar field $\psi_0$ and a larger coupling parameter $\alpha$ (the weak coupling case), the optical images of boson stars primarily exhibit direct and lensed images. The results demonstrate that variations in $\psi_0$ and $\alpha$ influence the image size, whereas the observer's inclination angle $\theta$ has a substantial impact on the image shape. In contrast, when the coupling parameter $\alpha$ is small (the strong coupling case), a sub-annular structure emerges within the Einstein ring for a spherically symmetric light source. In the presence of a thin accretion disk, higher-order gravitational lensing images emerge, indicating that photons are capable of orbiting the equatorial plane of the boson star multiple times. We also analyze how the effective potential and redshift factor depend on the parameters $\psi_0$, $\alpha$, and $\theta$. The results indicate that at smaller values of $\theta$, gravitational redshift is the dominant effect, resulting in an optical image featuring a bright ring surrounding a comparatively dim central region. At larger values of $\theta$, the Doppler effect becomes more pronounced, resulting in a substantial brightness disparity between the left and right sides of the optical image. These findings offer robust theoretical underpinnings for differentiating solitonic boson stars from black holes via high-resolution astronomical observations.</description>

Abstract: We summarize our recent achievements in the description of neutrino oscillations in various gravitational fields. After the short review of the previous studies of neutrinos in gravitational fields, we consider the neutrinos propagation and oscillations in two gravitational backgrounds. First, we discuss neutrino spin oscillations in their gravitational scattering off a supermassive black hole surrounded by a thick magnetized accretion disk. Second, we study neutrino flavor oscillations in stochastic gravitational waves. We also consider applications of the obtained results for oscillations of astrophysical neutrinos.</description>

      <title>TESSELLATE: Piecing Together the Variable Sky With TESS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.16905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present TESSELLATE, a dedicated pipeline for performing an untargeted search documenting all variable phenomena captured by the TESS space telescope. Building on the TESSreduce difference imaging pipeline, TESSELLATE extracts calibrated and reduced photometric data for every full frame image in the TESS archive. Using this data, we systematically identify transient, variable and non-sidereal signals across timescales ranging from minutes to weeks. The high cadence and wide field of view of TESS enables us to conduct a comprehensive search of the entire sky to a depth of ~17 $m_i$. Based on the volumetric rates for known fast transients, we expect there to be numerous Fast Blue Optical Transients and Gamma Ray Burst afterglows present in the existing TESS dataset. Beyond transients, TESSELLATE can also identify new variable stars and exoplanet candidates, and recover known asteroids. We classify events using machine learning techniques and the work of citizen scientists via the Zooniverse Cosmic Cataclysms project. Finally, we introduce the TESSELLATE Sky Survey: a complete, open catalog of the variable sky observed by TESS.</description>

      <title>Resolving spatial and temporal shock structures using LOFAR observations of type II radio bursts</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.16934v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Collisionless shocks are one of the most powerful particle accelerators in the Universe. In the heliosphere, type II solar radio bursts are signatures of electrons accelerated by collisionless shocks launched at the Sun. Spectral observations of these bursts show a variety of fine structures often composing multiple type II lanes. The origin of these lanes and structures is not well understood and has been attributed to the inhomogeneous environment around the propagating shock. Here, we aim to determine the large-scale local structures near a coronal shock wave using high-resolution radio imaging observations of a complex type II radio burst observed on 3 October 2023. By using inteferometric imaging from the Low Frequency Array (LOFAR), combined with extreme ultraviolet observations, we investigate the origin of multiple type II lanes at low frequencies (30--80~MHz) relative to the propagating shock wave. We identify at least three radio sources at metric wavelengths corresponding to a multi-lane type II burst. The type II burst sources propagate outwards with a shock driven by a coronal mass ejection. We find a double radio source that exhibits increasing separation over time, consistent with the expansion rate of the global coronal shock. This suggests that the overall shock expansion is nearly self-similar, with acceleration hotspots forming at various times and splitting at a rate proportional to the shock's expansion. Our results show the importance of increased spatial resolution in determining either the small-scale spatial properties in coronal shocks or the structuring of the ambient medium. Possible shock corrugations or structuring of the upstream plasma at the scale of 10$^5$~km can act as hotspots for the acceleration of suprathermal electrons.</description>

      <title>Accretion bursts in young intermediate-mass stars make planet formation challenging</title>

Abstract: We investigate the occurrence of accretion bursts, dust accumulation, and the prospects for planetesimal formation in a gravitationally unstable magnetized protoplanetary disk with globally suppressed but episodically triggered magnetorotational instability (MRI), particularly in young intermediate-mass stars (YIMSs) but with a brief comparison to low-mass counterparts. We use numerical magnetohydrodynamics simulations in the thin-disk limit (FEOSAD code) to model the formation and long-term evolution of a gravitationally unstable magnetized protoplanetary disk, including dust dynamics and growth, since the collapse of a massive slowly-rotating prestellar cloud core. Massive gas concentrations and dust rings form within the inner disk region owing to the radially varying efficiency of mass transport by gravitational instability (GI). These rings are initially susceptible to streaming instability (SI). However, gradual warming of the dust rings, thanks to high opacity and GI-induced influx of matter increases the gas temperature above a threshold for the MRI to develop via thermal ionization of alkaline metals. The ensuing MRI bursts destroy the dust rings, making planetesimal formation via SI problematic. In the later evolution phase, when the burst activity starts to diminish, SI becomes inefficient because of growing dust drift velocity and more extended inner dead zone, both acting to reduce the dust concentration below the threshold for SI to develop. Low-mass objects appear to be less affected by these adverse effects. Our results suggest that disks around young intermediate-mass stars may be challenging environments for planetesimal formation via SI. This may explain the dearth of planets around stars with $M_\ast &gt; 3.0 \,$$M_\odot$.</description>

      <title>Double progenitor origin of the S-star cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17165</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The origin of the cluster of S-stars located in the Galactic Centre is tied to the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, but exactly how is still debated. In this paper, we investigate whether the Hills mechanism can simultaneously reproduce both the S-star cluster's properties and the observed number of hypervelocity stars. To do so, we forward-model the capture and disruption of binary stars originating from the nuclear star cluster (NSC) and the clockwise disk (CWD). We find that the ratio of evolved to main-sequence S-stars is highly sensitive to the origin of the binaries, and that neither the injection of binaries from the CWD nor from the NSC exclusively can reproduce all observations. However, when considering the injection of binaries from both locations, we are able to reproduce all the observations simultaneously, including the number of observed hypervelocity stars, the evolutionary stage of the S-stars, their luminosity function and the distribution of their semi-major axes. The implications of our findings include that ~90% of hypervelocity stars ejected over the past ~10 Myr should originate from the CWD, that the main-sequence S-stars originated in the CWD, and that the evolved S-stars originated in an old stellar population such as the NSC.</description>

      <title>Accounting for the Known Unkown: A Parametric Framework to Incorporate Systematic Waveform Errors in Gravitational-Wave Parameter Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17400</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17400v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Parameter Estimation (PE) for Gravitational Waves (GW) merger events relies on a waveform model calibrated using numerical simulations. Within the Bayesian framework, this waveform model represents the GW signal produced during the merger and is crucial for estimating the likelihood function. However, these waveform models may possess systematic errors that can differ across the parameter space. Addressing these errors in the current data analysis pipeline is an active area of research. This work presents a framework for accounting for uncertainties in waveform modeling. We introduce two parametrizations, relative and absolute errors in the phase of the waveform, to modify the base waveform model, which can account for uncertainties. When the waveform errors are known, those error budgets can be used as a prior distribution in the Bayesian framework. We also show that conservative priors can be used to quantify uncertainties in waveform modeling without any knowledge of waveform error budgets. By conducting zero-noise injections and recoveries, we demonstrate through PE results that even 1-2% of errors in relative phase to the actual waveform model can introduce biases in the recovered parameters. These biases can be corrected when we account for waveform uncertainties within the PE framework. By injecting a series of precessing waveform models and using the nonspinning model for recovery, we show that our method can account for the missing physics by making the posterior samples broad enough to account for bias. We also present a Python package that is easily integrated with the publicly available GW analysis tool PyCBC and can be used to do PE with the parametrization presented in this paper.</description>

      <title>Mapping Parameter Correlations in Spinning Binary Black Hole Mergers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.17402v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The spins of black holes in binaries measured with gravitational waves provide insights about the formation, evolution, and dynamics of these systems. The imprint of spin in the inspiral, where the black holes are well-separated, is understood through analytic equations for the binary dynamics. During the merger phase, the binary dynamics can only be studied with numerical relativity simulations. Though such simulations provide an exact solution (to within numerical error), the imprint of the full six spin degrees of freedom on the signal is not transparent. In the absence of analytic expressions for the merger, here we propose a waveform-based approach. Leveraging a neural network to efficiently calculate mismatches between waveforms, we identify regions in the parameter space of spins and mass ratio that result in low mismatches and thus similar waveforms. We map these regions with a Gaussian fit, thus identifying correlations between the mass ratio and spins and quantifying their strength. For low-mass, inspiral-dominated systems, we recover the known physical imprint: larger aligned spins are correlated with more equal masses as they have opposite effects on the inspiral length. For high-mass, merger-dominated signals, a qualitatively similar correlation is present, though its shape is altered and strength decreases with increasing total mass. Correlations between in-plane spins and mass ratio follow a similar trend, with their shape and strength altered as the mass increases. Waveform-based correlation mapping can motivate effective spin parameters and reveal the imprint of spins on signals for which no simple analytic descriptions exist.</description>

      <title>Mind the gap: addressing data gaps and assessing noise mismodeling in LISA</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.17426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the sheer complexity of the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) space mission, data gaps arising from instrumental irregularities and/or scheduled maintenance are unavoidable. Focusing on merger-dominated massive black hole binary signals, we test the appropriateness of the Whittle-likelihood on gapped data in a variety of cases. From first principles, we derive the likelihood valid for gapped data in both the time and frequency domains. Cheap-to-evaluate proxies to p-p plots are derived based on a Fisher-based formalism, and verified through Bayesian techniques. Our tools allow to predict the altered variance in the parameter estimates that arises from noise mismodeling, as well as the information loss represented by the broadening of the posteriors. The result of noise mismodeling with gaps is sensitive to the characteristics of the noise model, with strong low-frequency (red) noise and strong high-frequency (blue) noise giving statistically significant fluctuations in recovered parameters. We demonstrate that the introduction of a tapering window reduces statistical inconsistency errors, at the cost of less precise parameter estimates. We also show that the assumption of independence between inter-gap segments appears to be a fair approximation even if the data set is inherently coherent. However, if one instead assumes fictitious correlations in the data stream, when the data segments are actually independent, then the resultant parameter recoveries could be inconsistent with the true parameters. The theoretical and numerical practices that are presented in this work could readily be incorporated into global-fit pipelines operating on gapped data.</description>

      <title>The brightest GRB ever detected: GRB 221009A as a highly luminous event at z = 0.151</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.07891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.07891v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context: The extreme luminosity of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) makes them powerful beacons for studies of the distant Universe. The most luminous bursts are typically detected at moderate/high redshift, where the volume for seeing such rare events is maximized and the star-formation activity is greater than at z = 0. For distant events, not all observations are feasible, such as at TeV energies.
  Aims: Here we present a spectroscopic redshift measurement for the exceptional GRB 221009A, the brightest GRB observed to date with emission extending well into the TeV regime.
  Methods: We used the X-shooter spectrograph at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) to obtain simultaneous optical to near-IR spectroscopy of the burst afterglow 0.5 days after the explosion.
  Results: The spectra exhibit both absorption and emission lines from material in a host galaxy at z = 0.151. Thus GRB 221009A was a relatively nearby burst with a luminosity distance of 745 Mpc. Its host galaxy properties (star-formation rate and metallicity) are consistent with those of LGRB hosts at low redshift. This redshift measurement yields information on the energy of the burst. The inferred isotropic energy release, $E_{\rm iso} &gt; 5 \times 10^{54}$ erg, lies at the high end of the distribution, making GRB 221009A one of the nearest and also most energetic GRBs observed to date. We estimate that such a combination (nearby as well as intrinsically bright) occurs between once every few decades to once per millennium.</description>

      <title>Efficient micromirror confinement of sub-TeV cosmic rays in galaxy clusters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2311.01497v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cosmic rays (CRs) play a pivotal role in shaping the thermal and dynamical properties of astrophysical environments, such as galaxies and galaxy clusters. Recent observations suggest a stronger confinement of CRs in certain astrophysical systems than predicted by current CR-transport theories. Here, we show that the incorporation of microscale physics into CR-transport models can account for this enhanced CR confinement. We develop a theoretical description of the effect of magnetic microscale fluctuations originating from the mirror instability on macroscopic CR diffusion. We confirm our theory with large-dynamical-range simulations of CR transport in the intracluster medium (ICM) of galaxy clusters and kinetic simulations of CR transport in micromirror fields. We conclude that sub-TeV CR confinement in the ICM is far more effective than previously anticipated on the basis of Galactic-transport extrapolations. The transformative impact of micromirrors on CR diffusion provides insights into how microphysics can reciprocally affect macroscopic dynamics and observable structures across a range of astrophysical scales.</description>

Abstract: Using publicly available gamma-rays data from the Fermi satellite and the Fermitools package, we constructed 867-day light curves of Sagittarius A* to search for potential periodicities from 2008 to 2024. By applying statistical and computational inference methods, we used periodograms, a window function, unsupervised machine learning (K-Means), the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, noise colour analysis, and phase-folding techniques. Additionally, the datasets were fitted with a Jacobi elliptical function using a likelihood approach. In total, 1,463,040 minutes were analysed. This analysis revealed a significant period of enhanced activity lasting ~78 minutes, followed by a quiescent phase of about ~18 minutes, resulting in a total quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO) of around 96 minutes.</description>

      <title>A new bump in the night: evidence of a new feature in the binary black hole mass distribution at $70~M_{\odot}$ from gravitational-wave observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02460</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.02460v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We analyze the confident binary black hole (BBH) detections from the third Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog (GWTC-3) with an alternative mass population model in order to capture features in the mass distribution beyond the Powerlaw + Peak model. We find that the peak of a second power law characterizes the $\sim 30-35~ M_\odot$ bump, such that the data marginally prefers a mixture of two power laws for the mass distribution of binary components over a Powerlaw + Peak model with a Bayes Factor $\log_{10}\mathcal{B}$ of 0.24. This result may imply that the $\sim 30-35~ M_\odot$ feature represents the onset of a second population of BBH mergers (e.g. from a dynamical formation channel) rather than a specific mass feature over a broader distribution. When an additional Gaussian bump is allowed within our power law mixture model, we find a new feature in the BH mass spectrum at $\sim65-70~M_\odot$ ($\log_{10}\mathcal{B}$ = 0.29 compared to Powerlaw + Peak). This new feature may be consistent with hierarchical mergers, and constitute $\sim3\%$ of the BBH population. This model also recovers a maximum mass of $58^{+32}_{-14}~M_\odot$ for the second power law, consistent with the onset of a pair-instability supernova mass gap.</description>

      <title>New JWST redshifts for the host galaxies of CDF-S XT1 and XT2: understanding their nature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10015v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: CDF-S XT1 and XT2 are considered two canonical extragalactic fast X-ray transients (FXTs). In this work, we report new constraints on both FXTs, based on recent JWST NIRCam and MIRI photometry, as well as NIRspec spectroscopy for CDF-S XT2 that allow us to improve our understanding of their distances, energetics, and host galaxy properties compared to the pre-JWST era. We use the available HST and JWST archival data to determine the host properties and constrain the energetics of each FXT based on spectral energy distribution (SED) photometric fitting. The host of CDF-S XT1 is now constrained to lie at $z$=2.76, implying a host absolute magnitude $M_R=-19.14$~mag, stellar mass $M_{*}=$1.8e8~$M_\odot$, and star formation rate SFR$=0.62 M_\odot$/yr. These properties lie at the upper end of previous estimates, leaving CDF-S XT1 with a peak X-ray luminosity of 2.8e47 erg/s. We argue that the best progenitor scenario for XT1 is a low-luminosity gamma-ray burst (GRB), although we do not fully rule out a proto-magnetar association or a jetted tidal disruption event involving a white dwarf and an intermediate-massive black hole. In the case of CDF-S XT2, JWST imaging reveals a new highly obscured component of the host galaxy, previously missed in HST images, while NIRspec spectroscopy securely places the host at $z$=3.4598. The new redshift implies a host with $M_R=-21.76$~mag, $M_*=5.5e10 M_\odot$, SFR=160~$M_\odot$/yr, and FXT $L_{X,peak}=1.4e47$~erg/s. The revised energetics, similarity to X-ray flash event light curves, small host offset, and high host SFR favor a low-luminosity collapsar progenitor for CDF-S XT2. Although a magnetar model is not ruled out, it appears improbable. While these HST and JWST observations shed light on the host galaxies of XT1 and XT2, and by extension, on the nature of FXTs, a unique explanation for both sources remains elusive.</description>

      <title>SN 2023adsy -- a normal Type Ia Supernova at z=2.9, discovered by JWST</title>

Abstract: Supernovae (SNe) discovered in high-redshift (z &gt; 2) galaxies by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) provide a unique opportunity to extend the Hubble-diagram beyond z~1.5 and constrain the cosmic Star Formation Rate in the early Universe. SN~2023adsy, a Type Ia supernova discovered by JWST at z=2.9, was found to be a peculiar event, being extremely red and faint, but showing very similar rest-frame light curve decline rate to the majority of low-redshift SNe Ia. We examine whether the red color and faint peak magnitude could also be explained by significant reddening/extinction due to dust within the host galaxy. We use the light curve fitter SALT3-NIR with templates extended to the near-infrared, to re-fit the published NIRCam photometry, assuming a "normal" SN Ia and Milky-Way dust extinction law. NIRCam photometry of the host galaxy taken before the SN discovery is also examined by comparing its Spectral Energy Distribution with galaxy templates. The NIRCam photometry can be fit reasonably well with a slowly declining, but otherwise "normal" SN Ia template suffering significant reddening ($E(B-V)_{host} \gtrsim 0.5$ mag). Photometry of the host galaxy suggests a blue, star-forming galaxy, where the presence of significant amount of dust cannot be ruled out. Comparison of the inferred luminosity distance with the prediction of the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology on the Hubble-diagram suggests no significant evolution of the SN Ia peak luminosity at z&gt;2 redshifts. It is also shown that the discovery of a single SN Ia between 2 &lt; z &lt; 3 within the area of the JADES survey during 1 year is consistent with the current estimates for the SN Ia rates at such redshifts.</description>

Abstract: Recent observations have challenged the long-held opinion that the duration of gamma-ray burst (GRB) prompt emission is determined by the activity epochs of the central engine. Specifically, the observations of GRB 230307A have revealed a different scenario in which the duration of the prompt emission is predominantly governed by the energy dissipation process following a brief initial energy injection from the central engine. In this paper, we explore a mechanism where the energy injection from the central engine initially causes turbulence in a small region and radiates locally. This turbulence then propagates to more distant regions and radiates. Consequently, the emission regions form concentric rings that extend outward. Using an idealized toy model, we show that such a mechanism, initiated by a pulsed energy injection, can produce a prompt emission light curve resembling a single broad pulse exhibiting the typical softer-wider/softer-later feature. Under some parameters, the main characteristics of the GRB 230307A spectra and light curves can be reproduced by the toy model.</description>

      <title>Fast dynamic ejecta in neutron star mergers</title>

Abstract: The ejection of neutron-rich matter is one of the most important consequences of a neutron star merger. While the bulk of the matter is ejected at fast, but non-relativistic velocities ($\sim0.2c$), a small amount of mildly relativistic dynamic ejecta have been seen in a number of numerical simulations. Such ejecta can have far reaching observational consequences ranging from the shock breakout burst of gamma-rays promptly after the merger, to an early ($\sim 1$ hour post-merger) blue kilonova precursor signal, to synchrotron emission years after the merger ("kilonova afterglow"). These all potentially carry the imprint of the binary system parameters and the equation of state. By analyzing Lagrangian simulations in full General Relativity, performed with the code SPHINCS_BSSN, we identify two ejection mechanisms for fast ejecta: i) about 30\% of the ejecta with {$v&gt; 0.4c$} are "sprayed out" from the shear interface between the merging stars and escape along the orbital plane and ii) the remaining $\sim$ 70\% of the fast ejecta result from the central object "bouncing back" after strong, general-relativistic compression. This "bounce component" is ejected in a rather isotropic way and reaches larger velocities (by $\sim0.1c$) so that its faster parts can catch up with and shock slower parts of the spray ejecta. Even for a case that promptly collapses to a black hole, we find fast ejecta with similar properties to the non-collapsing case, while slower matter parts are swallowed by the forming black hole. We discuss observational implications of these fast ejecta, including shock breakout and kilonova afterglow.</description>

      <title>Searching for New Physics in Ultradense Environment: a Review on Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars</title>

Abstract: Neutron Stars (NSs), among the densest objects in the Universe, are exceptional laboratories for investigating Dark Matter (DM) properties. Recent theoretical and observational developments have heightened interest in exploring the impact of DM on NS structure, giving rise to the concept of Dark Matter Admixed Neutron Stars (DANSs). This review examines how NSs can accumulate DM over time, potentially altering their fundamental properties. We explore leading models describing DM behavior within NSs, focusing on the effects of both bosonic and fermionic candidates on key features such as mass, radius, and tidal deformability. Additionally, we review how DM can modify the cooling and heating processes, trigger the formation of a black hole, and impact Gravitational Waves (GWs) emissions from binary systems. By synthesizing recent research, this work highlights how DANSs might produce observable signatures, offering new opportunities to probe DM properties through astrophysical phenomena.</description>

      <title>RTFAST-Spectra: Emulation of X-ray reverberation mapping for active galactic nuclei</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.10131v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Bayesian analysis has begun to be more widely adopted in X-ray spectroscopy, but it has largely been constrained to relatively simple physical models due to limitations in X-ray modelling software and computation time. As a result, Bayesian analysis of numerical models with high physics complexity have remained out of reach. This is a challenge, for example when modelling the X-ray emission of accreting black hole X-ray binaries, where the slow model computations severely limit explorations of parameter space and may bias the inference of astrophysical parameters. Here, we present RTFAST-Spectra: a neural network emulator that acts as a drop in replacement for the spectral portion of the black hole X-ray reverberation model RTDIST. This is the first emulator for the reltrans model suite and the first emulator for a state-of-the-art x-ray reflection model incorporating relativistic effects with 17 physically meaningful model parameters. We use Principal Component Analysis to create a light-weight neural network that is able to preserve correlations between complex atomic lines and simple continuum, enabling consistent modelling of key parameters of scientific interest. We achieve a $\mathcal{O}(10^2)$ times speed up over the original model in the most conservative conditions with $\mathcal{O}(1\%)$ precision over all 17 free parameters in the original numerical model, taking full posterior fits from months to hours. We employ Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling to show how we can better explore the posteriors of model parameters in simulated data and discuss the complexities in interpreting the model when fitting real data.</description>

      <title>AT 2020nov: Evidence for Disk Reprocessing in a Rare Tidal Disruption Event</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12991v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a detailed analysis of AT 2020nov, a tidal disruption event (TDE) in the center of its host galaxy, located at a redshift of $z = 0.083$. AT 2020nov exhibits unique features, including double-peaked Balmer emission lines, a broad UV/optical flare, and a peak log luminosity in the extreme ultra-violet (EUV) estimated at $\sim$$45.66^{+0.10}_{-0.33} \; \mathrm{erg} \, \mathrm{s^{-1}}$. A late-time X-ray flare was also observed, reaching an absorbed luminosity of $1.67 \times 10^{43} \; \mathrm{erg} \, \mathrm{s^{-1}}$ approximately 300 days after the UV/optical peak. Multi-wavelength coverage, spanning optical, UV, X-ray, and mid-infrared (MIR) bands, reveals a complex spectral energy distribution (SED) that includes MIR flaring indicative of dust echoes, suggesting a dust covering fraction consistent with typical TDEs. Spectral modeling indicates the presence of an extended, quiescent disk around the central supermassive black hole (SMBH) with a radius of $\sim$$5.06^{+0.59}_{-0.77} \times 10^4 \; \mathrm{R_g}$. The multi-component SED model, which includes a significant EUV component, suggests that the primary emission from the TDE is reprocessed by this extended disk, producing the observed optical and MIR features. The lack of strong AGN signatures in the host galaxy, combined with the quiescent disk structure, highlights AT 2020nov as a rare example of a TDE occurring in a galaxy with a dormant but extended pre-existing accretion structure.</description>

      <title>Compton Scattering of Thermal Disk Radiation with Black Hole Disk Winds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.01532v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Galactic black hole (BH) X-ray binaries are known to exhibit episodic outbursts, during which accretion and spectral mode distinctively transition between low/hard and high/soft state. X-ray observations during high/soft state occasionally reveal a pronounced presence of a powerful disk wind in these systems. However, it is unexplored to date how such winds may influence disk emission in that regime. In this work, we consider an observational implication by Compton scattering of thermal disk radiation due to accretion disk winds by performing multi-dimensional Monte Carlo simulations in the context of a stratified wind of large solid angle launched over a large radial extent of the disk. Compton-scattered thermal disk spectrum is computed for a different wind property; i.e. wind density and its radial gradient. We find that the intrinsic disk radiation can be significantly down-scattered by winds of moderate-to-high density to the extent that the transmitted spectrum can substantially deviate from the conventional multi-color-disk emission in a tangible way. % by factor of up to 70\%. We thus claim that the conventional treatment of spectral hardening in the disk atmosphere may be insufficient to fully account for the observed disk continuum in the presence of strong wind scattering. It is suggested that the effect of scattering process (by $f_w$) should be incorporated to accurately evaluate an intrinsic disk spectrum besides the conventional hardening (color correction) factor (by $f_c$). We argue that BH spin measurements using thermal continuum-fitting in transient XRBs may well be mildly (if not significantly) altered by such spectral "contamination".</description>

      <title>The ubiquity of variable radio emission and spin-down rates in pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.03500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.03500v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Pulsars are often lauded for their (relative) rotational and radio emission stability over long time scales. However, long-term observing programmes are identifying an increasing number of pulsars that deviate from this preconceived notion. Using Gaussian process regression and Bayesian inference techniques, we investigated the emission and rotational stability of 259 radio pulsars that have been monitored using Murriyang, the Parkes 64 m radio telescope, over the past three decades. We found 238 pulsars that display significant variability in their spin-down rates, 52 of which also exhibit changes in profile shape. Including 23 known state-switching pulsars, this represents the largest catalogue of variable pulsars identified to date and indicates that these behaviours are ubiquitous among the wider population. The intensity of spin-down fluctuations positively scales with increasing pulsar spin-down rate, with only a marginal dependence on spin-frequency. This may have substantial implications for ongoing searches for gravitational waves in the ensemble timing of millisecond pulsars. We also discuss challenges in explaining the physical origins of quasi-periodic and transient profile/spin-down variations detected among a subset of our pulsars.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Nuclear Equation of State of neutron star via high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillation in short gamma-ray bursts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10034v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The determination of the equation of state (EOS) of a neutron star (NS) and its maximum mass is very important for understanding the formation and properties of NSs under extreme conditions, but they remain open questions. Short-duration gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) are believed to originate from the merger of binary NSs or giant flares (GFs) of soft gamma repeaters (SGRs). Recently, the high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) have been claimed to be identified from two short GRBs (GRB 931101B and GRB 910711). In this paper, we propose that the observed high-frequency QPOs in these two short GRBs result from torsional oscillations in the GFs of SGRs associated with cold NSs, or from radial oscillations of hypermassive NSs as the hot remnants of binary NS mergers, and then to constrain the EOS of NSs. For torsional oscillations, the six selected EOSs (TM1, NL3, APR, SLy4, DDME2, and GM1) of NSs suitable for the zero-temperature condition exhibit significant overlap in mass ranges, suggesting that we cannot constrain the EOS of NSs. For radial oscillations, the six selected EOSs (IUF, TM1, TMA, FSG, BHBLp, and NL3) of NSs suitable for the high-temperature condition cannot be ruled out when redshift is considered. However, it is found that the EOS can only be constrained if the redshift and temperature of the remnant can be measured.</description>

      <title>Discovery of a Pulsar Wind Nebula Candidate Associated with the Galactic PeVatron 1LHAASO J0343+5254u</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.15431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The astronomical origin of the most energetic galactic cosmic rays and gamma rays is still uncertain. X-ray followup of candidate "PeVatrons", systems producing cosmic rays with energies exceeding 1 PeV, can constrain their spatial origin, identify likely counterparts, and test particle emission models. Using 120 ks of XMM-Newton observations, we report the discovery of a candidate pulsar wind nebula, a possible counterpart for the LHAASO PeVatron J0343+5254u. This extended source has a power law X-ray spectrum with spectral index of 1.9 - softer at greater distance from the center - and asymmetric spatial extension out to 2'. We conduct leptonic modeling of the X-ray and gamma ray radiation from this complex system, showing that a fully leptonic model with elevated IR photon fields can explain the multiwavelength emission from this source, similar to other VHE pulsar wind nebulae; excess gamma ray emissivity not explained by a leptonic model may be due to hadronic interactions in nearby molecular cloud regions, which might also produce detectable astroparticle flux.</description>

      <title>Ultra-high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission associated with the tail of a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15447v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of an unidentified point-like ultra-high-energy (UHE) $\gamma$-ray source, designated as 1LHAASO J1740+0948u, situated in the vicinity of the middle-aged pulsar PSR J1740+1000. The detection significance reached 17.1$\sigma$ (9.4$\sigma$) above 25$\,$TeV (100$\,$TeV). The source energy spectrum extended up to 300$\,$TeV, which was well fitted by a log-parabola function with $N0 = (1.93\pm0.23) \times 10^{-16} \rm{TeV^{-1}\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-2}}$, $\alpha = 2.14\pm0.27$, and $\beta = 1.20\pm0.41$ at E0 = 30$\,$TeV. The associated pulsar, PSR J1740+1000, resides at a high galactic latitude and powers a bow-shock pulsar wind nebula (BSPWN) with an extended X-ray tail. The best-fit position of the gamma-ray source appeared to be shifted by $0.2^{\circ}$ with respect to the pulsar position. As the (i) currently identified pulsar halos do not demonstrate such offsets, and (ii) centroid of the gamma-ray emission is approximately located at the extension of the X-ray tail, we speculate that the UHE $\gamma$-ray emission may originate from re-accelerated electron/positron pairs that are advected away in the bow-shock tail.</description>

      <title>Gravitational Raman Scattering in Effective Field Theory: a Scalar Tidal Matching at $\mathcal{O}(G^3)$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08752</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.08752v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a framework to compute amplitudes for the gravitational analog of the Raman process, a quasi-elastic scattering of waves off compact objects, in worldline effective field theory (EFT). As an example, we calculate third post-Minkowskian (PM) order ($\mathcal{O}(G^3)$), or two-loop, phase shifts for the scattering of a massless scalar field including all tidal effects and dissipation. Our calculation unveils two sources of the classical renormalization-group flow of dynamical Love numbers: a universal running independent of the nature of the compact object, and a running self-induced by tides. Restricting to the black hole case, we find that our EFT phase shifts agree exactly with those from general relativity, provided that the relevant static Love numbers are set to zero. In addition, we carry out a complete matching of the leading scalar dynamical Love number required to renormalize a universal short scale divergence in the S-wave. Our results pave the way for systematic calculations of gravitational Raman scattering at higher PM orders.</description>

      <title>An upper limit to the lifetime of stellar remnants from gravitational pair production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14734</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14734v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Black holes are assumed to decay via Hawking radiation. Recently we found evidence that spacetime curvature alone without the need for an event horizon leads to black hole evaporation. Here we investigate the evaporation rate and decay time of a non-rotating star of constant density due to spacetime curvature-induced pair production and apply this to compact stellar remnants such as neutron stars and white dwarfs. We calculate the creation of virtual pairs of massless scalar particles in spherically symmetric asymptotically flat curved spacetimes. This calculation is based on covariant perturbation theory with the quantum field representing, e.g.,\ gravitons or photons. We find that in this picture the evaporation timescale, $\tau$, of massive objects scales with the average mass density, $\rho$, as $\tau\propto\rho^{-3/2}$. The maximum age of neutron stars, $\tau\sim 10^{68}\,\text{yr}$, is comparable to that of low-mass stellar black holes. White dwarfs, supermassive black holes, and dark matter supercluster halos evaporate on longer, but also finite timescales. Neutron stars and white dwarfs decay similarly to black holes, ending in an explosive event when they become unstable. This sets a general upper limit for the lifetime of matter in the universe, which in general is much longer than the Hubble--Lema\^itre time, although primordial objects with densities above $\rho_\text{max} \approx 3\times 10^{53}\,\text{g/}\text{cm}^3$ should have dissolved by now. As a consequence, fossil stellar remnants from a previous universe could be present in our current universe only if the recurrence time of star forming universes is smaller than about $\sim 10^{68}\,\text{years}$.</description>

      <title>CP violation in cold dense quark matter and axion effects on the non-radial oscillations of neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17828</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.17828v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Charge-conjugation and parity violation in strong interaction for cold dense quark matter is studied with axions of quantum chromodynamic within the three flavor Nambu--Jona-Lasinio model that includes the coupling of axions to quarks. We first calculate the effective potential for axions at finite baryon density and zero temperature including the effects of a first order chiral phase transition. Using the equation of state for quark matter with axions and a hadronic matter equation of state in the ambit of a relativistic mean field theory in quantum hadrodynamics, we discuss the hadron-quark phase transition. Inclusion of axions reduces the critical density for chiral transition. We use a Gibbs construct for the hadron-quark phase transition satisfying the constraints of beta equilibrium and charge neutrality as appropriate for the neutron star matter. The equation of state so obtained is used to investigate the structure of hybrid neutron stars. It is found that with the presence of axions, it is possible to have stable hybrid neutron stars having an inner core of quark matter both in pure quark matter phase as well as in a mixed phase with hyperonic matter along with a outer core of hyperonic matter and is in agreement with modern astrophysical constraints. We also discuss the properties of non-radial oscillations of such hybrid neutron stars. It is observed that the quadrupolar fundamental modes ($f$-modes) for such hybrid neutron stars get substantial enhancements both due to a larger quark core in the presence of axions and from the hyperons as compared to a canonical nucleonic neutron stars.</description>

      <title>Probing Loop Quantum Gravity via Kerr Black Hole and EHT Results</title>

Abstract: Recently, a study on shadow of quantum Schwarzschild black hole appeared in [Ye et al., Phys.Lett. B 851, 138566, (2024)] for a fixed value of Barbero-Immirzi parameter $\gamma$. Following this approach, we considered its rotating counterpart being a deformed Kerr metric in Loop Quantum Gravity and studied its deviation from Kerr black hole for a fixed value of $\gamma$. We proved a theorem describing the location of unstable circular null orbits for all metrics of this kind. The deviation between the shadows of the quantum Kerr and Kerr black holes has also been studied, and parameters are constrained by comparison with the EHT results for M87* and Sgr A* to precisely probe the quantity of deviation due to quantum correction. Lastly, we immersed the deformed Kerr black hole in an inhomogeneous plasma and studied its impact on the shadow size. We found that the unstable null orbits for the quantum black hole are always smaller than the unstable null orbits for Kerr black hole. The quantum correction allows the deformed Kerr black hole to mimic Sgr A* with a higher probability than the Kerr black hole. However, the quantum-corrected Kerr black hole barely mimics M87*. The plasma reduces the size of black hole shadow and the plasma parameter in the case II is more sensitive than that in case I.</description>

      <title>Can wormholes mirror the quasi-normal mode spectrum of Schwarzschild black holes?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12646v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Wormholes are exotic compact objects characterized by the absence of essential singularities and horizons, acting as slender bridges linking two distinct regions of spacetime. Despite their theoretical significance, they remain however undetected, possibly due to their ability to closely mimic the observational properties of black holes. This study explores whether a static and spherically symmetric wormhole within General Relativity can reproduce the quasi-normal mode spectrum of a Schwarzschild black hole under scalar, electromagnetic, and axial gravitational perturbations, both individually and in combination. To address this, we reformulate the wormhole metric components using a near-throat parametrization. Our analysis concentrates on the fundamental mode and first overtone, estimated via the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin method. By employing a customized minimization strategy, we demonstrate that within a specific region of the parameter space, a wormhole can successfully replicate a subset of the black hole quasi-normal mode spectrum.</description>
