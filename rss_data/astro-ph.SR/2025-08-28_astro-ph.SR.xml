      <title>Optical Spectroscopy of the Most Compact Accreting Binary Harboring a Magnetic White Dwarf and a Hydrogen-rich Donor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Accreting white dwarfs in close binary systems, commonly known as cataclysmic variables (CVs), with orbital periods below the canonical period minimum ($\approx$ 80 minutes) are rare. Such short periods can only be reached if the donor star in the CV is either significantly evolved before initiating mass transfer to the white dwarf (WD) or metal-poor. We present optical photometry and spectroscopy of Gaia19bxc, a high-amplitude variable identified as a polar CV with an exceptionally short orbital period of 64.42 minutes - well below the canonical CV period minimum. High-speed photometry confirms persistent double-peaked variability consistent with cyclotron beaming, thus indicating the presence of a magnetic WD. Phase-resolved Keck/LRIS spectroscopy reveals strong hydrogen and helium emission lines but no donor features, indicating the accretor is a magnetic WD and the donor is hydrogen-rich, but cold and faint. The absence of a detectable donor and the low inferred temperature ($\lesssim$ 3500 K) disfavor an evolved donor scenario. Instead, the short period and the system's halo-like kinematics suggest Gaia19bxc may be the first known metal-poor polar. Because metal-poor donors are more compact than solar-metallicity donors of the same mass, they can reach shorter minimum periods. Gaia19bxc is one of only a handful of known metal-poor CVs below the canonical period minimum and has the shortest period of any such magnetic system discovered to date.</description>

      <title>Atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances of young stars with APOGEE. I. Orion star-forming region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive atmospheric parameters and chemical abundances in young G-, K-, and M-type stars (temperatures between 6500 and 3100 K) using infrared APOGEE-2 spectra. Atmospheric parameters were determined for 548 young stars in the Orion complex (Orion A, B, OB1, and $\lambda$ Ori) using the TONALLI code. For 340 slow rotators v sini $\leq$ 30 km s$^{-1}$), we derived C, Mg, Si, K, Ti, and Fe abundances using 19 atomic lines, MARCS model atmospheres, and BACCHUS. To mitigate the impact of circumstellar material, we excluded stars with infrared excess identified via 2MASS and WISE photometry. We find sub-solar [X/H] abundance ratios, consistent across elements and among all four groups, suggesting a chemically homogeneous Orion complex. We computed [$\alpha$/Fe] from [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], and [Ti/Fe], obtaining a median of $-0.14 \pm 0.04$, about 0.10 dex lower than the value for nearby main-sequence stars ($-0.04 \pm 0.04$) at similar [Fe/H]. This result aligns with predictions from Galactic chemical evolution models. Furthermore, the median [C/H] abundance we derived for Orion agrees with previous estimations based on the analysis of the ionized gas of the Orion nebula. This work sets the stage for extending the analysis to stars with circumstellar material and higher rotational velocities, which will not only improve our understanding of Orion, but also provide critical insight into the formation and evolution of young stars, as well as the chemical evolution of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>The Close Binary Properties of Massive Stars across Different Environments within the LMC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20319</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20319v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We analyze 4,859 O-stars in the OGLE-III photometric survey of the LMC, including 415 eclipsing binaries (EBs). After accounting for the geometrical probability of eclipses, the period distribution of O-type binaries across $P$ = 2.5-200 days follows a power-law $f_{\rm logP}$ $\propto$ (logP)$^{\Pi}$ with $\Pi$ = $-$0.34$\pm$0.06, which is skewed toward shorter periods compared to Opik's law ($\Pi$ = 0). We divide our O-stars into seven environments based on their clustering with B-stars and other O-stars. The EB fraction of O-stars in young clusters is 10.2%$\pm$0.6%, which matches the 10.8%$\pm$2.1% for O-stars in young Milky Way clusters. O-stars in old clusters exhibit a lower EB fraction of 5.5%$\pm$0.9% due to the effects of binary evolution. O-stars in young dense clusters, young sparse associations, and even low-mass clusters that formed in situ in the field have similar EB fractions. This uniformity suggests that the formation of close massive binaries depends on small-scale gas physics, e.g., fragmentation and migration within protostellar disks, whereas N-body interactions that scale with cluster density do not affect the close binary properties of massive stars that remain in clusters. Conversely, ejected O-stars in the field exhibit a lower close binary fraction. The EB fractions of field walkaways (projected velocities $v_{\rm proj}$ $&lt;$ 24.5 km s$^{-1}$) and field runaways ($v_{\rm proj}$ $&gt;$ 24.5 km s$^{-1}$) are 7.3%$\pm$1.0% and 4.7%$\pm$1.0%, respectively. These values suggest that most field O-stars were dynamically ejected via N-body interactions from their birth clusters, whereas field O-stars that formed in situ or were kicked from supernova explosions in binaries contribute 17% and $&lt;$28%, respectively, to the field population.</description>

      <title>The frequency-independent radio luminosity -- period relation of RS CVn stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20393</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20393v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Radio emissions from RS CVn objects exhibit distinct characteristics at low and high frequencies, widely attributed to differing radiation mechanisms. The disparate processes of high-frequency gyrosynchrotron and low-frequency electron cyclotron maser emissions have traditionally suggested an absence of correlation in their radio luminosities. Our study presents a frequency-independent linear correlation between radio luminosity ($L_R$) and orbital/rotational periods ($P$) in RS CVn binaries. Analyzing the Sydney Radio Star Catalogue (SRSC) data, we derived orbital periods for 42 of 60 RS CVn sources using TESS light curves, revealing a strong positive correlation (PCC = 0.698, $P$ = 3.95e-7) between $\log_{10}L_R$ and $\log_{10}P$. This correlation remains across frequencies from 144-3000 MHz, showing uniform luminosity behavior. By combining light curve analysis with stellar mass-radius-luminosity relationships, we calculated parameters like binary mass, primary/secondary mass, Rossby number, and binary separation for eight RS CVn systems. The results show a notable correlation between radio luminosity and binary mass, primary mass, and separation (PCC = 0.663, 0.663, 0.719), with separation showing the strongest correlation. This suggests the radio emission may largely originate from the binary components' interaction, challenging existing models of RS CVn radio emission mechanisms and offering insights into the individual versus collective origins of these emissions.</description>

      <title>COCONUT: A time-evolving coronal model with an energy decomposition strategy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20423</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20423v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an energy decomposition method to improve the numerical stability of time-evolving magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) coronal models, enabling them to resolve the stronger magnetic field during solar maxima without significantly filtering out small-scale structures from the observed magnetograms.We advance the decomposed energy that excludes the magnetic energy, instead of the total energy, in time. It avoids the operation of subtracting a large magnetic energy from the total energy to obtain a very small thermal pressure in low-beta regions, thereby improving the numerical stability of MHD models. We implemented this method in COCONUT and validated the model by performing a time-evolving coronal simulation during Carrington Rotation (CR) 2296, a solar maximum CR. We also compare quasi-steady-state simulation results during the solar minimum and the increasing phase, calculated using both versions of COCONUT adopting the decomposed energy equation and the traditional full energy equation to further validate the reliability of the energy decomposition method. The simulation results show that the energy decomposition method yields results nearly identical to those of the traditional full energy equation during solar minimum, while significantly enhancing COCONUT's ability to simulate coronal evolution under strong magnetic fields, even those exceeding 100 Gauss. This method is well suited for performing quasi-realistic time-evolving coronal simulations around solar maxima without excessively filtering out the observed strong magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>A tale of three cataclysmic variables with distinct superhumps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20438v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the TESS observations of CRTS J110014.7+131552, SDSS J093537.46+161950.8, and [PK2008] HalphaJ130559. Among them, a superoutburst is observed in CRTS J110014.7+131552 which is associated with the precursor outburst, where prominent superhumps are observed during maximum of the outburst with a mean period of 0.06786(1) d. We have observed variations in the superhump period, along with changes in the shape of the light curve profile and the amplitude of the superhumps during different phases of the outburst, indicating disc-radius variation as well as periodically variable dissipation at the accretion stream's bright spot. The data on SDSS J093537.46+161950.8 reveal previously unknown variations modulated with periods 0.06584(2) d and 2.36(2) d, related to the positive superhump and the disc-precession periods, respectively, which can reasonably be interpreted as a result of the prograde rotation of an eccentric accretion disc. Despite its short orbital period, the lack of outburst activity, along with its stable long-term brightness, discovery spectrum, and absolute magnitude suggests that the object might not be an SU UMa type dwarf nova. Instead, it may belong to the group of high mass-transfer CVs below the period gap, either to a rare class of nova-like variables or to the class of high-luminosity IPs, a subclass of magnetic CVs. For [PK2008] HalphaJ130559, a new average orbital period of 0.15092(1) d has been identified. Additionally, this system displays previously undetected average periods of 0.14517(3) d and 3.83(1) d, which can be provisionally identified as negative superhump and disc-precession periods, respectively. If the identified simultaneous signals do indeed reflect negative superhump and disc-precession period variations then their origin may be associated with the retrograde precession of a tilted disc and its interaction with the secondary stream.</description>

      <title>Potassium abundances in extremely metal poor stars: Implications for nucleosynthesis in the final stages of massive star evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20484</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20484v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a potassium (K) abundance analysis in extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars based on high-resolution ($R\sim 60000$) spectra obtained with the High Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope, covering the K I resonance lines at 766 and 769 nm. One-dimensional local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) abundances of K and other elements, including Na, Mg, Ca, Ti, Cr, and Ni, were derived using spectral synthesis. Non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) corrections were applied to the K abundances by interpolating a precomputed grid of corrections based on stellar parameters and the LTE K abundance. We detected K I lines in seven stars with [Fe/H]$&lt; -3.0$ and derived upper limits for other stars in the same metallicity regime, making this sample well-suited for investigating the nucleosynthesis origins of K in the early universe. We found that the [K/Fe] and [K/Ca] ratios of the seven stars are enhanced relative to the solar value, with a scatter of approximately 0.1 dex, as small as the typical measurement uncertainty. Under the assumption that each star formed from gas purely enriched by a single or a few massive stars' supernovae, the small scatter in [K/Fe] and [K/Ca], contrasted with the $\sim$0.7 dex scatter in [Na/Mg] ratios (after NLTE correction), suggests that the production of K in massive stars or their supernovae is independent of the processes that drive Na/Mg variation. These findings demonstrate that K abundances in EMP stars, and their correlations with other elemental abundances, can serve as sensitive tracers of the physical mechanisms governing the final evolutionary stages of massive stars and their supernova explosions.</description>

      <title>Asteroseismology of HD 23734, HD 68703, and HD 73345 using K2-TESS Space-based Photometry and High-resolution Spectroscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a comprehensive study of three stars, HD 23734, HD 68703, and HD 73345, which were previously observed as chemically peculiar candidates within the Nainital-Cape survey and reported as null results for the pulsational variability. Frequency analyses of \ktwo\ and \tess\ time-series photometric data reveal the co-existence of rotational modulation and pulsation. We use the spectrum synthesis technique to determine fundamental parameters and chemical composition, which shows that all the three stars are likely to be chemically normal. The evolutionary status of the target stars corresponds to the main-sequence phases and places them within the $\delta$ Scuti instability strip of the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. The line profile variability is observed in all three stars, especially intriguing in HD\,68703 and a typical signature of the non-radial pulsation, demands further detailed examination. Using \tess\ photometry, we identified the radial modes of orders $n$=3 and 4 for HD\,23734, $n$=1, 3, and 4 for HD\,68703, and $n$=3,4 and 5 for HD\,73345. In addition to the presence of pulsation and rotation, HD\,73345 exhibits a steady increase in radial velocity that we interpret as the star being likely to be part of a long-period binary system. Finally, we propose an extended campaign aimed for the in-depth spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric study of selected pulsating stars monitored under the Nainital-Cape survey project.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20681v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using \tess\ short-cadence (120\,s) SAP flux, we identified a rotational frequency of 0.09655\,$\mathrm{d}^{-1}$ ($P_\mathrm{rot}=10.35733$\,d). Wavelet analysis reveals that while the amplitudes of the harmonic components vary over time, the strength of the primary rotational frequency remains stable. A SED analysis of multi-band photometric data yields an effective temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff}$) of {11,750\,K.} %MDPI: Comma added for five digits in the whole text, please check.
  High-resolution spectroscopic observations covering wavelengthrange 4500--7000\,\AA\ provide refined estimates of \teff\, =\, 13,814\, $\pm$\, 400\,K, \logg\,=\, 4.09\, $\pm$\, 0.08\,dex, and \vsini\, =\, 16 $\pm$ 1\,\kms. Abundance analysis shows solar-like composition of O\,\textsc{ii}, Mg\,\textsc{ii}, S\,\textsc{ii}, and Ca\,\textsc{ii}, while helium is under-abundant by 0.62\,dex. Rare earth elements (REEs) exhibit over-abundances of up to 5.2\,dex, classifying the star as an Ap/Bp-type star. AL\,Col has a radius of $R = 3.74\,\pm\,0.48{\rm R_{\odot}}$, with its H--R diagram position estimating a mass of $M = 4.2\,\pm\,0.2{\rm M_{\odot}}$ and an age of $0.12\,\pm\,0.01$ Gyr, indicating that the star has slightly evolved from the main sequence. The \tess\ light curves were modeled using a three-evolving-spot configuration, suggesting the presence of differential rotation. This star is a promising candidate for future investigations of magnetic field diagnostics and the vertical stratification of chemical elements in its atmosphere.</description>

      <title>Chemical abundances and doppler imaging of the Ap Si/He-wk star HD 100357</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the results of time-resolved photometry, abundance analysis and Doppler imaging of an Ap star, HD 100357. The {\it TESS} photometry revealed rotational modulation with a period of 1.6279247 days. Upon inspecting the residuals after removing the rotational period and its harmonics, we found additional frequencies around 15.8054 d$^{-1}$ which we later confirmed with ground-based observations as originating from a nearby star. Using high-resolution spectroscopy, we identified HD 100357 as an Ap Si/He-wk star exhibiting rotational modulation caused by surface abundance spots. The stellar parameters of HD 100357 were determined as $T_{\rm eff}$ = 11,850 K, $\log g$ = 4.57, $\upsilon\sin i$ = 60 km\,s$^{-1}$, and an inclination angle $i$ = 72$^{\circ}$. The detailed abundance analysis revealed strongly overabundant stratified silicon, an overabundance of iron-peak elements and rare earth elements combined with remarkably deficient helium. Mapping of Fe and Cr abundances revealed the existence of ring-shaped regions with a lower concentration of the elements. Their geometry might reflect the orientation of the hypothetical magnetic field of the star, oriented $\sim$90$^{\circ}$ to the rotational axis. HD 100357, with its strong chemical peculiarities and indications of possible magnetic fields, represents an interesting candidate for follow-up spectropolarimetric observations aimed at investigating its magnetic field topology and stellar activity.</description>

      <title>Looking for Signs of Unresolved Binarity in the Continuum of LAMOST Stellar Spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20802v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We describe an attempt to derive the binarity rate of samples of 166 A-, F-, G-, and K-type stars from LAMOST DR5 and 1000 randomly selected presumably single stars from Gaia DR3 catalogs. To this end, we compared continua of the observed spectra with the continua of synthetic spectra in the 3700 to 9097 Angstrom range. The latter spectra were reduced to the LAMOST set of wavelengths, while the former ones were smoothed. Next, we searched for every observed star the nearest synthetic spectrum using a four-parameter representation - effective temperature, gravity, [Fe/H], and a range of interstellar absorption values. However, rms deviations of observed spectra from synthetic ones appeared to be not sufficient to claim that any of the stars is a binary. We conclude that comparison of the intensity of pairs of spectral lines remains the best way to detect binarity.</description>

      <title>Modeling of AR 12760 with GX Simulator and Evidence for the Extended Transition Region in Peripheral Active Region Loops</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In order to understand solar atmospheric heating it is important to test heating models against spatially resolved data from solar active regions. Here we model a small active region, AR~12760 observed on 2020 April 28, with the GX Simulator package by fitting the EUV intensities in wavebands observed by Solar Dynamics Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly. We assume the temporally and spatially averaged heating rate along a loop has a power-law dependence on loop length, $L$ and average magnetic field strength along the loop, $B_{avg}$. We find that the best fit heating model for the 211~\AA\ band is $&lt;\!\!Q\!\!&gt;\approx 7\times 10^{-3} (B_{avg}/{100 \mbox{G}})^{1.5}(L/{10^9\mbox{cm}})^{-1}$ erg cm$^{-3}$ s$^{-1}$ but that there is a range of parameters that give qualitatively reasonable fits, which we conclude is due to a correlation between $B_{avg}$ and $L$. In addition, we find that the models of the bands including cooler emission (131 and 171~\AA) greatly underestimate the extent of the emission in the legs of the longer loops at the peripheries of the active region that are the strongest contributors of the emission in those bands. We conclude that this is because the modeling assumes that all transition region emission is confined to the loop foot points, but in reality the upper transition region of longer loops extends significantly farther into the loop. It is important to consider this aspect of the transition region in future efforts to model EUV emission.</description>

      <title>The power of binaries on stripped-envelope supernovae across metallicity: uniform progenitor parameter space and persistently low ejecta masses, but subtype diversity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21042</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21042v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stripped-envelope supernovae (SESNe) originate from massive stars that lose their envelopes through binary interactions or stellar winds. The connection between SESN subtypes and their progenitors remains poorly understood, as does the influence of initial mass, binarity, explodability, and metallicity on their evolutionary pathways, relative rates, ejecta masses, and progenitor ages. Here, we investigate these properties across a wide metallicity range (0.01-2 $Z_{\odot}$) using POSYDON, a state-of-the-art population synthesis code that incorporates detailed single- and binary-star model grids. We find that the common-envelope channel contributes less than 6% of SESNe, since unstable mass transfer is found less frequent than previously thought and rarely leads to CE survival when envelope binding energies are computed from detailed stellar models. The secondary channel accounts for less than 11%, while the vast majority of SESNe originate from primary stars in binaries undergoing stable mass-transfer episodes. These interactions maintain a largely metallicity-independent SESN parameter space, making the overall SESN rate almost insensitive to metallicity. In contrast, subtype fractions exhibit strong metallicity dependence, though their exact values remain affected by classification thresholds. The age distributions and therefore the progenitor masses of different SESN types also vary significantly with metallicity, revealing metallicity-dependent trends that can be tested observationally. Predicted SESN ejecta masses remain nearly constant across metallicity, in contrast to single-star models, and fall within observed ranges. Future transient surveys, combined with statistical environmental studies that constrain metallicity dependence, will provide decisive tests of these predictions and of the dominant role of binary interactions in shaping SESNe.</description>

      <title>VIPER: A high-resolution multimode fiber-fed VIPA spectrograph concept for characterizing exoplanet atmospheric escape</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An increasing number of applications in exoplanetary science require spectrographs with high resolution and high throughput without the need for a broad spectral range. Examples include the search for biosignatures through the detection of the oxygen A-band at 760 nm, and the study of atmospheric escape through the helium 1083 nm triplet. These applications align well with the capabilities of a spectrograph based on a Virtually Imaged Phased Array (VIPA), a high-throughput dispersive element that is essentially a modified Fabry-Perot etalon. We are developing VIPER, a high-resolution, narrowband, multimode fiber-fed VIPA spectrograph specifically designed to observe the helium 1083 nm triplet absorption line in the atmospheres of gaseous exoplanets. VIPER will achieve a resolving power of 300,000 over a wavelength range of 25 nm, and will be cross-dispersed by an echelle grating. VIPER is intended for operation on the 1.5 m Tillinghast Telescope and potentially on the 6.5 m MMT, both located at the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory (FLWO) on Mount Hopkins, Arizona, USA. In this paper, we present VIPER's instrument requirements, derived from the primary science goal of detecting anisotropic atmospheric escape from exoplanets. We discuss the design methodology for VIPA-based spectrographs aimed at maximizing throughput and diffraction efficiency, and we derive a wave-optics-based end-to-end model of the spectrograph to simulate the intensity distribution at the detector. We present an optical design for VIPER and highlight the potential of VIPA-based spectrographs for advancing exoplanetary science.</description>

      <title>Do White Dwarfs Sample Water-Rich Planetary Material?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Polluted white dwarfs offer a unique way to directly probe the compositions of exoplanetary bodies. We examine the water content of accreted material using the oxygen abundances of 51 highly polluted white dwarfs. Within this sample, we present new abundances for three H-dominated atmosphere white dwarfs that showed promise for accreting water-rich material. Throughout, we explore the impact of the observed phase and lifetime of accretion disks on the inferred elemental abundances of the parent bodies that pollute each white dwarf. Our results indicate that white dwarfs sample a range of dry to water-rich material, with median uncertainties in water mass fractions of $\approx$15\%. Amongst the He-dominated white dwarfs, 35/39 water abundances are consistent with corresponding H abundances. While for any individual white dwarf it may be ambiguous as to whether or not water is present in the accreted parent body, when considered as a population the prevalence of water-rich bodies is statistically robust. The population as a whole has a median water mass fraction of $\approx$25\%, and enforcing chondritic parent body compositions, we find that 31/51 WDs are likely to have non-zero water concentrations. This conclusion is different from a similar previous analysis of white dwarf pollution and we discuss reasons why this might be the case. Pollution in H-dominated white dwarfs continues to be more water-poor than in their He-dominated cousins, although the sample size of H-dominated white dwarfs remains small and the two samples still suffer a disjunction in the range of host star temperatures being probed.</description>

      <title>Dynamical tide modified Roche limit in eccentric, asynchronous binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20183</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20183v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Roche limit, or the threshold separation within which a celestial object (the donor) M cannot remain in a stable configuration due to a companion's tidal field, has been well established when M is in hydrostatic equilibrium and has synchronous rotation in a circular orbit. However, limited analyses exist considering corrections to the Roche limit due to hydrodynamical effects. We fill in the gap by providing a general theoretical framework involving nonlinear hydrodynamics. We consider both exact nonlinear equations derived from an affine model describing incompressible ellipsoids and series-expanded ones that can be calculated for realistic stars and planets. Our formulation addresses the Roche problem in generic orbits and synchronization levels of M, and fully accounts for the history-dependent hydrodynamical effects. We show that as the orbital eccentricity increases, fluid instability is more likely to develop at the pericenter due to the increased dynamical tide that accumulates over multiple orbits. When M moves in a highly eccentric orbit (with eccentricity around 0.9) and the damping of the fluid is small, the threshold pericenter separation at which mass loss from M can occur can be at least 30% higher than the value predicted for a circular orbit with hydrostatic equilibrium. If only a single passage is considered, however, the threshold separation is 20% smaller than the static limit. The nonlinear interaction at each pericenter passage can also trigger a chaotic fluid evolution inside M even with moderate eccentricities, complementing previous studies of chaotic tides caused by random propagation phases. Our work has broad implications for interacting binaries in eccentric orbits, including migrating gaseous exoplanets, repeated partial tidal disruption events, and more.</description>

      <title>The impact of pre-main sequence stellar luminosity on giant planet formation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Luminosities of pre-main sequence stars evolve during the protoplanetary disc lifetime. This has a significant impact on the heating of their surrounding protoplanetary disks, the natal environments of planets. Moreover, stars of different masses evolve differently. However, this is rarely accounted for in planet formation models. We carry out pebble-driven core accretion planet formation modelling with focus on the impact of pre-main sequence stellar luminosity evolution on giant planet formation around host stars in the range of $1{-}2.4\ \rm M_{\odot}$. We find that giant planet formation is sensitive to the evolution of stellar luminosity, specifically the locations and times at which giant planet formation can occur depend on it. High stellar luminosity causes an increase in the scale height of the gas and pebbles, which may decrease the efficiency of pebble accretion, making it more challenging to form giant planets. This has important consequences for the composition of these giant planets, stressing the need to incorporate such aspects into planet formation models.</description>

      <title>On the Regulation of the Solar Wind Helium Abundance by the Hydrogen Compressibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20391</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20391v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditionally, fast solar wind is considered to originate in solar source regions that are continuously open to the heliosphere and slow wind originates in regions that are intermittently open to it. In fast wind, the gradient of the solar wind helium abundance ($A_\mathrm{He}$) with increasing solar wind speed ($v_\mathrm{sw}$) is $\sim0$ and $A_\mathrm{He}$ is fixed at $\sim50\%$ of the photospheric value. In slow wind, this gradient is large, $A_\mathrm{He}$ is highly variable, and it doesn't exceed this $\sim50\%$ value. Although the normalized cross helicity in fast wind typically approaches 1, this is not universally true and Alterman &amp; D'Amicis (2025) show that $\nabla_{v_\mathrm{sw}} \! A_\mathrm{He}$ in fast wind unexpectedly increases with decreasing $\left|\sigma_c\right|$. We show that these large gradients are due to the presence of compressive fluctuations. Accounting for the solar wind's compressibility ($\left|\delta n/n\right|$), there are two subsets of enhanced $A_\mathrm{He}$ in excess of typical fast wind values. The subset with a large compressibility is likely from neither continuously nor intermittently open sources. The portion of the solar wind speed distribution over which these fluctuations are most significant corresponds to the range of Alfv\'en wave-poor solar wind from continuously open source regions, which is likely analogous to the Alfv\'enic slow wind. Mapping the results of this work to Alterman &amp; D'Amicis (2025) and vice versa shows that, in any given $\left|\delta n/n\right|$ quantile, $\left|\sigma_c\right| \lesssim 0.65$, an upper bound on non-Alfv\'enic cross helicity. Similarly, $\left|\delta n/n\right| \lesssim 0.15$ in any given $\left|\sigma_c\right|$ quantile, is an upper bound on incompressible fluctuations. We conclude that $\left|\delta n/n\right|$ is essential for characterizing the solar wind helium abundance and possibly regulating it.</description>

      <title>High-resolution models of the vertical shear instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: (abridged) Context: The vertical shear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism to generate turbulence and transport angular momentum in protoplanetary discs. While most recent work has focused on adding more complex physics, the saturation properties of the instability in radially extended discs and its convergence as a function of resolution are still largely unknown. We tackle the question of VSI saturation and associated turbulence using radially extended fully 3D global disc models at very high resolution so as to capture both the largest VSI scales and the small-scale turbulent cascade. We use the GPU-accelerated code Idefix to achieve resolutions of up to 200 points per scale height in the 3 spatial directions, with a full 2pi azimuthal extent and disc aspect ratio H/R=0.1.
  Results: We demonstrate that large-scale transport properties are converged with 100 points per scale height, leading to a Shakura-Sunyaev alpha=1.3e-3. Inner boundary condition artifacts propagate deep inside the computational domain, leading to reduced alpha in these regions. The large-scale corrugation wave zones identified in 2D models survive in 3D, albeit with less coherence. Our models show no sign of long-lived zonal flows, pressure bumps or vortices, in contrast to lower-resolution simulations. Finally, we show that the turbulent cascade resulting from VSI saturation can be interpreted in the framework of critically balanced rotating turbulence.
  Conclusion: The VSI leads to vigorous turbulence in protoplanetary discs, associated with outward angular momentum transport but without any significant long-lived features that could enhance planet formation. The innermost regions of VSI simulations are always polluted by boundary-condition artifacts affecting the first VSI wave train, so radially extended domains should be used in a more systematic manner.</description>

      <title>Modelling magnetic star-planet interaction in the iconic M dwarfs Proxima Centauri, YZ Ceti and GJ 1151</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20891</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20891v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The unambiguous detection of magnetic star-planet interaction (SPI) via radio observations would provide a novel method for detecting exoplanets and probing their magnetic fields. Although direct radio detection of sub-Jovian planets is hindered by the low frequencies involved, models of sub-Alfv\'enic SPI predict that Earth-like planets in close-in orbits around M dwarfs may induce detectable emission. Here, we revisit the modelling of the expected radio emission from magnetic star-planet interaction in the iconic M-dwarf systems Proxima Centauri, YZ Ceti, and GJ 1151, where claims of SPI-related radio detections have been made. For this, we use SIRIO (Star-planet Interaction and Radio Induced Observations), a public Python code that models radio emission from sub-Alfv\'enic SPI. We benchmark SIRIO results against those paradigmatic systems, whose SPI modeling has been previously discussed in the literature. Our results support previous findings that Proxima b, YZ Cet b, and the putative planet GJ 1151 b are most likely in the sub-Alfv\'enic regime (assuming a hybrid PFSS geometry), so SPI should be at work in all of them. We find that the Alfv\'en wing model generally predicts a very low level of radio emission, while if magnetic reconnection takes place, prospects for detection are significantly better. We also find that free-free absorption may play a relevant role, in particular in YZ Ceti. Our SIRIO code can also be used to evaluate the feasibility of radio proposals aimed at detecting SPI, and to constrain the stellar wind mass-loss rate or planetary magnetic field.</description>

      <title>HST Deep Upper Limits Rule Out a Surviving Massive Binary Companion to the Type Ic Supernova 2012fh</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21027</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.21027v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current explanations of the mass-loss mechanism for stripped-envelope supernovae remain divided between single and binary progenitor systems. Here we obtain deep ultraviolet (UV) imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) of the Type Ic SN 2012fh to search for the presence of a surviving companion star to the progenitor. We synthesize these observations with archival HST imaging, ground-based spectroscopy, and previous analyses from the literature to provide three independent constraints on the progenitor system. We fit the color-magnitude diagram of the surrounding population to constrain the most likely age of the system to be $&lt;20$ Myr. Analysis of spectra of SN 2012fh provide an estimate of the He core mass of the progenitor star, $&gt;5.6$ M$_{\odot}$. We analyze deep HST images at the precise location after the SN faded to constrain the luminosity of any remaining main-sequence binary companion to be $\log(L/L_{\odot}) \lesssim 3.35$. Combining observational constraints with current binary population synthesis models excludes the presence of a faint stellar companion to SN 2012fh at the $\lesssim10\%$ level. The progenitor was therefore either effectively isolated at the time of explosion or orbited by a black-hole companion. The latter scenario dominates if we only consider models that produce successful supernovae.</description>

      <title>Magnetorotational instability in a solar near-surface mean-field dynamo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16849v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We address the question whether the magnetorotational instability (MRI) can operate in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun and how it affects the interaction with the dynamo process. Using hydromagnetic mean-field simulations of $\alpha\Omega$-type dynamos in rotating shearing-periodic boxes, we show that for negative shear, the MRI can operate above a certain critical shear parameter. This parameter scales inversely with the equipartition magnetic field strength above which $\alpha$ quenching set in. Like the usual $\Omega$ effect, the MRI produces toroidal magnetic field when the field is sufficiently strong. The work done by the Lorentz force is positive, so the magnetic field drives kinetic energy and not the other way around, as in a turbulent dynamo. This results in strong kinetic energy production and dissipation, which tends to go at the expense of the magnetic energy. In view of the application to the solar NSSL, we conclude that the turbulent magnetic diffusivity may be too large for the MRI to be excited and that therefore only the standard $\Omega$ effect is expected to operate.</description>

Abstract: We present three-dimensional radiative transfer calculations for the ejecta from a neutron star merger that include line-by-line opacities for tens of millions of bound-bound transitions, composition from an r-process nuclear network, and time-dependent thermalization of decay products from individual $\alpha$ and $\beta^-$ decay reactions. In contrast to expansion opacities and other wavelength-binned treatments, a line-by-line treatment enables us include fluorescence effects and associate spectral features with the emitting and absorbing lines of individual elements. We find variations in the synthetic observables with both the polar and azimuthal viewing angles. The spectra exhibit blended features with strong interactions by Ce III, Sr II, Y II, and Zr II that vary with time and viewing direction. We demonstrate the importance of wavelength-calibration of atomic data using a model with calibrated Sr, Y, and Zr data, and find major differences in the resulting spectra, including a better agreement with AT2017gfo. The synthetic spectra for near-polar inclination show a feature at around 8000 A, similar to AT2017gfo. However, they evolve on a more rapid timescale, likely due to the low ejecta mass (0.005 M$_\odot$) as we take into account only the early ejecta. The comparatively featureless spectra for equatorial observers gives a tentative prediction that future observations of edge-on kilonovae will appear substantially different from AT2017gfo. We also show that 1D models obtained by spherically averaging the 3D ejecta lead to dramatically different direction-integrated luminosities and spectra compared to full 3D calculations.</description>

      <title>Neutron Star with Dark Matter Admixture: A Candidate for Bridging the Mass Gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17188</link>

Abstract: Neutron stars, white dwarfs and black holes are the after death remnants of massive stars. However, according to the most recent observations, the neutron stars maximum mass is between $2.0-2.5 M_{\odot}$ while black holes of less than 5 $M_{\odot}$ has not yet been observed. The region between the most massive neutron star and the least massive black hole is called the mass-gap. If indeed its existence is confirmed by future observations, that indicates a gap in our understanding which seeks for explanation. In addition, the existence of compact objects within the mass-gap should also be supported with the help of possible new theoretical scenarios. In this study, we propose a possible explanation for the existence of compact objects within the mass-gap region. Specifically, we propose that the mass-gap region could be bridged by the existence of a hybrid compact object, composed of hadronic and self interacting and non-annihilating fermionic dark matter, considering that the interaction between these two fluids it is only gravitational. Fundamental questions about how these objects form and how they can be detected are also addressed.</description>

      <title>The DECam MAGIC Survey: A Wide-field Photometric Metallicity Study of the Sculptor Dwarf Spheroidal Galaxy</title>

Abstract: The metallicity distribution function and internal chemical variations of a galaxy are fundamental to understand its formation and assembly history. In this work, we analyze photometric metallicities for 3883 stars over seven half-light radii ($\rm r_h$) in the Sculptor dwarf spheroidal (Scl dSph) galaxy, using new narrow-band imaging data from the Mapping the Ancient Galaxy in CaHK (MAGIC) survey conducted with the Dark Energy Camera (DECam) at the 4-m Blanco Telescope. This work demonstrates the scientific potential of MAGIC using the Scl dSph galaxy, one of the most well-studied satellites of the Milky Way. Our sample ranges from $\rm [Fe/H] \approx - 4.0$ to $\rm [Fe/H] \approx - 0.6$, includes six new extremely metal-poor candidates ($\rm [Fe/H] \leq -3.0$), and is almost three times larger than the largest spectroscopic metallicity dataset in the Scl dSph. Our spatially unbiased sample of metallicities provides a more accurate representation of the metallicity distribution function, revealing a more metal-rich peak than observed in the most recent spectroscopic sample. It also reveals a break in the metallicity gradient, with a strong change in the slope: from $-3.26 \pm 0.18 \rm \ dex/deg$ for stars inside $\sim 1\ \rm r_h$ to $-0.55 \pm 0.26 \rm \ dex/deg$ for the outer part of the Scl dSph. Our study demonstrates that combining photometric metallicity analysis with the wide field of view of DECam offers an efficient and unbiased approach for studying the stellar populations of dwarf galaxies in the Local Group.</description>
