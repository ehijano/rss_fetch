      <title>Revisiting entropies: formal properties and connections between Boltzmann-Gibbs, Tsallis and R\'enyi</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18926</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18926v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The aim of the present paper is to present a careful and accessible discussion of the formal aspects of Boltzmann-Gibbs and Tsallis entropies. We begin with a brief overview of Boltzmann-Gibbs entropy, highlighting its main properties and the uniqueness theorems formulated by Shannon and Khinchin. Once these foundational results are established, we introduce the framework of nonadditive statistical mechanics, defining Tsallis entropy, discussing its properties and uniqueness theorem, and contrasting it with the results from additive statistical mechanics. We also show that, in an appropriate limit, the Boltzmann-Gibbs results are recovered. The article concludes with a brief discussion of R\'enyi entropy and its connections to the previously defined entropic forms.</description>

      <title>Loop Charges and Fragmentation in Pairwise Difference Conserving Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.18992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we introduce a broad class of circuits, or quantum cellular automata, which we call 'pairwise-difference-conserving circuits' (PDC). These models are characterized by local gates that preserve the pairwise difference of local operators (e.g. particle number). Such circuits can be de- fined on arbitrary graphs in arbitrary dimensions for both quantum and classical degrees of freedom. A key consequence of the PDC construction is the emergence of an extensive set of loop charges associated with closed walks of even length on the graph. These charges exhibit a one-dimensional character reminiscent of 1-form symmetries and lead to strong Hilbert-space fragmentation. As a case study, we analyze a quasi one-dimensional ladder geometry, where we characterize all dynam- ically disconnected sectors by the loop-charge symmetries, providing a complete decomposition of the Hilbert space. For the ladder geometry, we observe clear signatures of nonergodic dynamics even within the largest symmetry sector.</description>

      <title>Lattice-reflection symmetry in tensor-network renormalization group with entanglement filtering in two and three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19428v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tensor-network renormalization group (TNRG) is an efficient real-space renormalization group method for studying the criticality in both classical and quantum lattice systems. Exploiting symmetries of a system in a TNRG algorithm can simplify the implementation of the algorithm and can help produce correct tensor RG flows. Although a general framework for considering a global on-site symmetry has been established, it is still unclear how to incorporate a lattice symmetry like rotation or reflection in TNRG. As a first step for lattice symmetries, we propose a method to incorporate the lattice-reflection symmetry in the context of a TNRG with entanglement filtering in both two and three dimensions (2D and 3D). To achieve this, we write down a general definition of lattice-reflection symmetry in tensor-network language. Then, we introduce a transposition trick for exploiting and imposing the lattice-reflection symmetry in two basic TNRG operators: projective truncations and entanglement filtering. Using the transposition trick, the detailed algorithms of the TNRG map in both 2D and 3D are laid out, where the lattice-reflection symmetry is preserved and imposed. Finally, we demonstrate how to construct the linearization of the TNRG maps in a given lattice-reflection sector, with the help of which it becomes possible to extract scaling dimensions in each sector separately. Our work paves the way for understanding the lattice-rotation symmetry in TNRG.</description>

      <title>Monte Carlo study of the $O(2)$-invariant $\phi^4$ theory with a cubic perturbation in three dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19473</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19473v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the $2$-component $\phi^4$ model on the simple cubic lattice in the presence of a cubic, or equivalently, a $\mathbb{D}_4$ invariant perturbation. To this end, we perform Monte Carlo simulations in conjunction with a finite size scaling analysis of the data. We follow previous work on the $3$-component case. We study the RG flow from the decoupled Ising fixed point into the $O(2)$-invariant one and towards the fluctuation induced first order transition. To this end we study the behavior of phenomenological couplings. At the $O(2)$-invariant fixed point we obtain the estimate $Y_4=-0.1118(10)$ of the RG-exponent of the perturbation. Note that the small modulus of $Y_4$ means that the RG flow is slow. Hence, in order to interpret experiments or Monte Carlo simulations of lattice models, which are effectively described by the $\phi^4$ model with a cubic term, we have to consider the RG flow beyond the neighborhood of the fixed points.</description>

      <title>Time crystalline solitons and their stochastic dynamics in a driven-dissipative \phi^4 model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19587v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Periodical driven systems provide unique opportunities to investigate the dynamics of topological structures far from equilibrium. In this paper, we report a time-crystalline soliton (TCS) state in a driven-dissipative $\phi^4$ model. This state exhibits spontaneous breaking of discrete time-translational symmetry alongside spatial soliton behavior. During time evolution, the soliton pattern periodically oscillates between kink and anti-kink configurations. We further study TCS dynamics under noise, demonstrating that soliton random walk can induce a dynamical transition between two distinct $Z_2$ symmetry-breaking time-crystalline phases in time domain. Finally, we examine the annihilation of two spatially separated TCSs under noise. Importantly, in contrast to the confined behavior of time-crystalline monopoles reported in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 056502 (2023)], the dynamics of time-crystalline solitons is deconfined despite the nonequilibrium nature of our model: the statistically averaged annihilation time scales as a power law with the solitons' initial separation.</description>

      <title>Stochastic dynamics of quasiparticles in the hard rod gas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional gas of hard rods, one of the simplest examples of an interacting integrable model. It is well known that the hydrodynamics of such integrable models can be understood by viewing the system as a gas of quasiparticles. Here, we explore the dynamics of individual quasiparticles for a variety of initial conditions of the background gas. The mean, variance, and two-time correlations are computed exactly and lead to a picture of quasiparticles as drifting Brownian particles. For the case of a homogeneous background, we show that the motion of two tagged quasiparticles is strongly correlated, and they move like a rigid rod at late times. Apart from a microscopic derivation based on the mapping to point particles, we provide an alternate derivation which emphasizes that quasiparticle fluctuations are related to initial phase-space fluctuations, which are carried over in time by Euler scale dynamics. For the homogeneous state, we use the Brownian motion picture to develop a Dean-Kawasaki-type fluctuating hydrodynamic theory, formally having the same structure as that derived recently by Ferrari and Olla. We discuss differences with existing proposals on the hydrodynamics of hard rods and some puzzles.</description>

      <title>A Class of Markovian Self-Reinforcing Processes with Power-Law Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19034</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solar flares, email exchanges, and many natural or social systems exhibit bursty dynamics, with periods of intense activity separated by long inactivity. These patterns often follow power- law distributions in inter-event intervals or event rates. Existing models typically capture only one of these features and rely on non-local memory, which complicates analysis and mechanistic interpretation. We introduce a novel self-reinforcing point process whose event rates are governed by local, Markovian nonlinear dynamics and post-event resets. The model generates power-law tails for both inter-event intervals and event rates over a broad range of exponents observed empirically across natural and human phenomena. Compared to non-local models such as Hawkes processes, our approach is mechanistically simpler, highly analytically tractable, and also easier to simulate. We provide methods for model fitting and validation, establishing this framework as a versatile foundation for the study of bursty phenomena.</description>

      <title>Towards a Quintic Ginzburg-Landau Description of the $(2,7)$ Minimal Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19085v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We discuss dimensional continuation of the massless scalar field theory with the $i\phi^5$ interaction term. It preserves the so-called $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, which acts by $\phi\rightarrow -\phi$ accompanied by $i\rightarrow -i$. Below its upper critical dimension $10/3$, this theory has interacting infrared fixed points. We argue that the fixed point in $d=2$ describes the non-unitary minimal conformal model $M(2,7)$. We identify the operators $\phi$ and $\phi^2$ with the Virasoro primaries $\phi_{1,2}$ and $\phi_{1,3}$, respectively, and $i\phi^3$ with a quasi-primary operator, which is a Virasoro descendant of $\phi_{1,3}$. Our identifications appear to be consistent with the operator product expansions and with considerations based on integrability. Using constrained Pad\'e extrapolations, we provide estimates of the critical exponents in $d=3$. We also comment on possible lattice descriptions of $M(2,7)$ and discuss RG flows to and from this CFT. Finally, we conjecture that the minimal models $M(2, 2n+1)$ are described by the massless scalar field theories with the $i\phi^{2n-1}$ interaction terms.</description>

      <title>Belief propagation for finite networks using a symmetry-breaking source node</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19231v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Belief Propagation (BP) is an efficient message-passing algorithm widely used for inference in graphical models and for solving various problems in statistical physics. However, BP often yields inaccurate estimates of order parameters and their susceptibilities in finite systems, particularly in sparse networks with few loops. Here, we show for both percolation and Ising models that fixing the state of a single well-connected "source" node to break global symmetry substantially improves inference accuracy and captures finite-size effects across a broad range of networks, especially tree-like ones, at no additional computational cost.</description>

      <title>Decoherence of a dissipative Brownian charged magneto-anharmonic oscillator: an information theoretic approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the decoherence of an anisotropic anharmonic oscillator in a magnetic field, coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators at high and low temperatures. We solve the anharmonic oscillator problem using perturbative techniques and derive the non-Markovian master equation in the weak coupling limit. The anharmonicity parameter {\alpha} enhances decoherence due to the deconfining effect of anharmonicity. The oscillatory nature of the time evolution of heating function indicates information backflow. The von-Neumann entropy is also calculated for the system, which increases with {\alpha}, consistent with the deconfining effect noted in the decoherence analysis. We have also proposed a cold ion experimental set up for testing our theoretical predictions. The study is of relevance to the domain of quantum technology where decoherence significantly affects the performance of a quantum computer.</description>

      <title>Krylov Complexity Under Hamiltonian Deformations and Toda Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19436v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum dynamics of a complex system can be efficiently described in Krylov space, the minimal subspace in which the dynamics unfolds. We apply the Krylov subspace method for Hamiltonian deformations, which provides a systematic way of constructing solvable models from known instances. In doing so, we relate the evolution of deformed and undeformed theories and investigate their complexity. For a certain class of deformations, the resulting Krylov subspace is unchanged, and we observe time evolutions with a reorganized basis. The tridiagonal form of the generator in the Krylov space is maintained, and we obtain generalized Toda equations as a function of the deformation parameters. The imaginary-time-like evolutions can be described by real-time unitary ones. As possible applications, we discuss coherent Gibbs states for thermodynamic systems, for which we analyze the survival probability, spread complexity, Krylov entropy, and associated time-averaged quantities. We further discuss the statistical properties of random matrices and supersymmetric systems for quadratic deformations.</description>

      <title>Absence of measurement- and unraveling-induced entanglement transitions in continuously monitored one-dimensional free fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19459v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Continuous monitoring of one-dimensional free fermionic systems can generate phenomena reminiscent of quantum criticality, such as logarithmic entanglement growth, algebraic correlations, and emergent conformal invariance, but in a nonequilibrium setting. However, whether these signatures reflect a genuine phase of nonequilibrium quantum matter or persist only over finite length scales is an active area of research. We address this question in a free fermionic chain subject to continuous monitoring of lattice-site occupations. An unraveling phase $\varphi$ interpolates between measurement schemes, corresponding to different stochastic unravelings of the same Lindblad master equation: For $\varphi = 0$, measurements disentangle lattice sites, while for $\varphi = \pi/2$ they act as unitary random noise, yielding volume-law steady-state entanglement. Using replica Keldysh field theory, we obtain a nonlinear sigma model describing the long-wavelength physics. This analysis shows that for $0 \leq \varphi &lt; \pi/2$, entanglement ultimately obeys an area law, but only beyond the exponentially large scale $\ln(l_{\varphi,*}) \sim J/[\gamma \cos(\varphi)]$, where $J$ is the hopping amplitude and $\gamma$ the measurement rate. Resolving $l_{\varphi, *}$ in numerical simulations is difficult for $\gamma/J \to 0$ or $\varphi \to \pi/2$. However, the theory also predicts that critical-like behavior appears below a crossover scale that grows only algebraically in $J/\gamma$, making it numerically accessible. Our simulations confirm these predictions, establishing the absence of measurement- or unraveling-induced entanglement transitions in this model.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19503v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Harnessing the intrinsic dynamics of physical systems for information processing opens new avenues for computation embodied in matter. Using simulations of a model system, we show that assemblies of DNA tiles capable of self-organizing into multiple target structures can perform basic computational tasks analogous to those of finite-state automata when equipped with programmable non-reciprocal interactions that drive controlled dynamical transitions between these structures. By establishing design rules for multifarious self-assembly while budgeting the energy input required to drive these non-equilibrium transitions, we demonstrate that these systems can execute a wide variety of tasks including counting, computing modulo functions, and recognizing specific input patterns. This framework integrates memory, sensing, and actuation within a single physical platform, paving the way toward energy-efficient physical computation embedded in materials ranging from DNA and enzymes to proteins and colloids.</description>

      <title>Fock space fragmentation in quenches of disordered interacting fermions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19510</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.19510v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Hilbert space fragmentation, as it is currently investigated, primarily originates from specific kinematic constraints or emergent conservation laws in many-body systems with translation invariance. It leads to non-ergodic dynamics and possible breakdown of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Here, we demonstrate that also in disordered systems, such as the XXZ model with random on-site fields, fragmentation appears as a natural concept offering fresh perspectives, for example, on many-body delocalization (MBdL). Specifically, we split the Fock-space into subspaces, potential-energy shells, which contain the accessible phase space for the relaxation of a quenched initial state. In this construction, dynamical observables reflect properties of the shell geometry, e.g., the drastic sample-to-sample fluctuations observed in the weak disorder regime, $W&lt;W_c$, represent fluctuations of the mass of the shell. Upon crossing over from weak to strong disorder, $W&gt;W_c$, the potential-energy shell decays into fragments; we argue that, unlike percolation, fragmentation is a strong-coupling scenario with turn-around flow: $W_c(L)$ diverges with increasing system size. We conjecture that the slowing down of the relaxation dynamics reported in traditional MBdL studies is (essentially) a manifestation of Fock-space fragmentation introduced here.</description>

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are central to both practical applications and the development of optimization methods. While classical and quantum algorithms have been refined over decades, machine learning-assisted approaches are comparatively recent and have not yet consistently outperformed simple, state-of-the-art classical methods. Here, we focus on a class of Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems, specifically the challenge of finding minimum energy configurations in three-dimensional Ising spin glasses. We use a Global Annealing Monte Carlo algorithm that integrates standard local moves with global moves proposed via machine learning. We show that local moves play a crucial role in achieving optimal performance. Benchmarking against Simulated Annealing and Population Annealing, we demonstrate that Global Annealing not only surpasses the performance of Simulated Annealing but also exhibits greater robustness than Population Annealing, maintaining effectiveness across problem hardness and system size without hyperparameter tuning. These results provide, to our knowledge, the first clear and robust evidence that a machine learning-assisted optimization method can exceed the capabilities of classical state-of-the-art techniques in a combinatorial optimization setting.</description>

      <title>Krylov space dynamics of ergodic and dynamically frozen Floquet systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.19824v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In isolated quantum many-body systems periodically driven in time, the asymptotic dynamics at late times can exhibit distinct behavior such as thermalization or dynamical freezing. Understanding the properties of and the convergence towards infinite-time (nonequilibrium) steady states however remains a challenging endeavor. We propose a physically motivated Krylov space perspective on Floquet thermalization which offers a natural framework to study rates of convergence towards steady states and, simultaneously, an efficient numerical algorithm to evaluate infinite-time averages of observables within the diagonal ensemble. The effectiveness of our algorithm is demonstrated by applying it to the periodically driven mixed-field Ising model, reaching system sizes of up to 30 spins. Our method successfully resolves the transition between the ergodic and dynamically frozen phases and provides insight into the nature of the Floquet eigenstates across the phase diagram. Furthermore, we show that the long-time behavior is encoded within the localization properties of the Ritz vectors under the Floquet evolution, providing an accurate diagnostic of ergodicity.</description>

      <title>Universal distributions of overlaps from generic dynamics in quantum many-body systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10057v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the distribution of overlaps with the computational basis of a quantum state generated under generic quantum many-body chaotic dynamics, without conserved quantities, for a finite time $t$. We argue that, scaling time logarithmically with the system size $t \propto \log L$, the overlap distribution converges to a universal form in the thermodynamic limit, forming a one-parameter family that generalizes the celebrated Porter-Thomas distribution. The form of the overlap distribution only depends on the spatial dimensionality and, remarkably, on the boundary conditions. This picture is justified in general by a mapping to Ginibre ensemble of random matrices and corroborated by the exact solution of a random quantum circuit. Our results derive from an analysis of arbitrary overlap moments, enabling the reconstruction of the distribution. Our predictions also apply to Floquet circuits, i.e., in the presence of mild quenched disorder. Finally, numerical simulations of two distinct random circuits show excellent agreement, thereby demonstrating universality.</description>

      <title>Scalable Boltzmann Generators for equilibrium sampling of large-scale materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25486v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The use of generative models to sample equilibrium distributions of many-body systems, as first demonstrated by Boltzmann Generators, has attracted substantial interest due to their ability to produce unbiased and uncorrelated samples in `one shot'. Despite their promise and impressive results across the natural sciences, scaling these models to large systems remains a major challenge. In this work, we introduce a Boltzmann Generator architecture that addresses this scalability bottleneck with a focus on applications in materials science. We leverage augmented coupling flows in combination with graph neural networks to base the generation process on local environmental information, while allowing for energy-based training and fast inference. Compared to previous architectures, our model trains significantly faster, requires far less computational resources, and achieves superior sampling efficiencies. Crucially, the architecture is transferable to larger system sizes, which allows for the efficient sampling of materials with simulation cells of unprecedented size. We demonstrate the potential of our approach by applying it to several materials systems, including Lennard-Jones crystals, ice phases of mW water, and the phase diagram of silicon, for system sizes well above one thousand atoms. The trained Boltzmann Generators produce highly accurate equilibrium ensembles for various crystal structures, as well as Helmholtz and Gibbs free energies across a range of system sizes, able to reach scales where finite-size effects become negligible.</description>

      <title>The Wishart--Rosenzweig--Porter random matrix ensemble</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.15764v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In recent years the Rosenzweig--Porter (RP) ensemble, obtained by adding a diagonal matrix with independent and identically distributed elements to a Gaussian random matrix, has been widely used as a minimal model for the emergence of fractal eigenstates in complex many-body systems. A key open question concerns the robustness of its phase diagram when the assumption of independent and uncorrelated entries is relaxed -- an assumption that simplifies its analysis, but is generally violated in realistic quantum systems. In this work, we take a first step in this direction by considering a deformed Wishart (rather than Gaussian) random matrix, which we dub the ``Wishart--RP'' ensemble. Using perturbation theory, as well as the cavity and replica methods and the Dyson Brownian motion approach, we characterize its phase diagram and localization properties. Remarkably, we show that the level compressibility, which quantifies spectral correlations in the fractal phase, coincides with that of the Gaussian RP model, thereby extending the universality conjectured in [SciPost Phys. 14, 110 (2023)] beyond the fully uncorrelated setting. We confirm our results with numerical tests.</description>

      <title>Symmetry restoration and quantum Mpemba effect in many-body localization systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.07750v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics of quantum many-body systems has attracted increasing attention owing to a variety of intriguing phenomena absent in equilibrium physics. A prominent example is the quantum Mpemba effect, where subsystem symmetry is restored more rapidly under a symmetric quench from a more asymmetric initial state. In this work, we investigate symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect in many-body localized systems for a range of initial states. We show that symmetry can still be restored in the many-body localization regime without approaching thermal equilibrium. Moreover, we demonstrate that the quantum Mpemba effect emerges universally for any tilted product state, in contrast to chaotic systems where its occurrence depends sensitively on the choice of the initial state. We further provide a theoretical analysis of symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect using an effective model for many-body localization. Overall, this paper fills an important gap in establishing a unified understanding of symmetry restoration and the quantum Mpemba effect in generic many-body systems, and it advances our understanding of many-body localization.</description>

      <title>Universal Freezing Transitions of Dipole-Conserving Chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.10321v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of a universal phase diagram of quantum chains with range-$k$ interactions subject to the conservation of a total charge and its dipole moment. These systems exhibit "freezing" transitions between strongly and weakly Hilbert-space-fragmented phases as the charge filling $\nu$ is varied. We show that these continuous phase transitions occur at a critical charge filling of $\nu_c=(k-2)^{-1}$ independently of the on-site Hilbert space dimension $d$. To this end, we analytically prove that, for any $d$, any state with $\nu&lt;\nu_c$ hosts a finite density of sites belonging to "blockages", which we define as subregions of the chain across which transport of charge and dipole moment cannot occur. Some blockages arise from sequences of frozen sites, i.e. sites with an unchanging on-site charge, while others do not involve frozen sites at all. We prove that the presence of blockages implies strong fragmentation of typical symmetry sectors into Krylov subspaces, each of which forms an exponentially vanishing fraction of the total sector. By studying the distribution of blockages we analytically characterise how typical states are subdivided into dynamically disconnected local "active bubbles", and prove that typical eigenstates at these charge fillings exhibit area-law entanglement entropy, while there exist rare eigenstates featuring non-area-law scaling. We also numerically show that for $\nu&gt;\nu_c$ and arbitrary $d$, typical symmetry sectors are weakly fragmented, with their dominant Krylov sectors constituted of states that are free of blockages. We analytically derive some critical exponents characterising the transition and numerically determine the density of blockages at $\nu=\nu_c$, with clear implications for transport at the critical point. Finally, we investigate the properties of special-case models for which no phase transitions occur.</description>

      <title>Deep Boundary Perturbations at a Quantum Critical Point</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.12793v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we explore an unconventional class of problems in the study of (quantum) critical phenomena, termed ''deep boundary criticality''. Traditionally, critical systems are analyzed with two types of perturbations: those uniformly distributed throughout the bulk, which can significantly alter the bulk criticality by triggering a nontrivial bulk renormalization group flow, and those confined to a boundary or subdimensional defect, which affect only the boundary or defect condition. Here, we go beyond this paradigm by studying quantum critical systems with boundary perturbations that decay algebraically (following a power law) into the bulk. By continuously varying the decay exponent, such perturbations can transition between having no effect on the bulk and strongly influencing bulk behavior. We investigate this regime using two prototypical models based on (1+1)D massless Dirac fermions. Through a combination of analytical and numerical approaches, we uncover exotic scaling laws in simple observables and observe qualitative changes in model behavior as the decay exponent varies.</description>

      <title>Fast, Modular, and Differentiable Framework for Machine Learning-Enhanced Molecular Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.20541v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present an end-to-end differentiable molecular simulation framework (DIMOS) for molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations. DIMOS easily integrates machine-learning-based interatomic potentials and implements classical force fields including an efficient implementation of particle-mesh Ewald. Thanks to its modularity, both classical and machine-learning-based approaches can be easily combined into a hybrid description of the system (ML/MM). By supporting key molecular dynamics features such as efficient neighborlists and constraint algorithms for larger time steps, the framework makes steps in bridging the gap between hand-optimized simulation engines and the flexibility of a \verb|PyTorch| implementation. We show that due to improved linear instead of quadratic scaling as function of system size DIMOS is able to obtain speed-up factors of up to $170\times$ for classical force field simulations against another fully differentiable simulation framework. The advantage of differentiability is demonstrated by an end-to-end optimization of the proposal distribution in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation based on Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). Using these optimized simulation parameters a $3\times$ acceleration is observed in comparison to ad-hoc chosen simulation parameters. The code is available at https://github.com/nec-research/DIMOS.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the Performances of Autonomous Quantum Refrigerators via Two-Photon Transitions</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.00102v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Conventional autonomous quantum refrigerators rely on uncorrelated heat exchange between the working system and baths via two-body interactions enabled by single-photon transitions and positive-temperature work baths, inherently limiting their cooling performance. Here, we introduce distinct qutrit refrigerators that exploit correlated heat transfer via two-photon transitions with the hot and cold baths, yielding a genuine enhancement in performance over conventional qutrit refrigerators that employ uncorrelated heat transfer. These refrigerators achieve at least a twofold enhancement in cooling power and reliability compared to conventional counterparts. Moreover, we show that cooling power and reliability can be further enhanced simultaneously by several folds, even surpassing existing cooling limits, by utilizing a synthetic negative-temperature work bath. Such refrigerators can be realized by combining correlated heat transfer and synthetic work baths, which consist of a four-level system coupled to hot and cold baths and two conventional work baths via two independent two-photon transitions. Here, the composition of two work baths effectively creates a synthetic negative-temperature work bath under suitable parameter choices. Additionally, our autonomous refrigerators with negative temperature baths significantly outperform previously studied autonomous and non-autonomous refrigerators in terms of cooling ability without requiring any additional energy resources, as they cool the cold bath to much lower temperature, which is forbidden for others refrigerators. Our results demonstrate that correlated heat transfers and baths with negative temperatures can yield thermodynamic advantages in quantum devices. Finally, we discuss the experimental feasibility of the proposed refrigerators across various existing platforms.</description>

Abstract: Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSC) -- which include skeletal stem cells -- are a promising tool in regenerative medicine. However, their heterogeneous and unpredictable in vivo behaviour remains a critical barrier preventing the development of standardized therapeutic approaches for skeletal tissue regeneration. Several studies have attempted to identify in vitro features that could correlate with the in vivo differentiation properties, yet the mechanisms ruling BMSC heterogeneity remain poorly understood. Here, using time-lapse imaging, we lineage-trace 32 single-cell-derived BMSC colonies through seven generations. We observe significant inter-colony and intra-colony heterogeneity in lineage topology (determined by the number of senescent or apoptotic cells) and in replicative kinetics (measured from proliferating cells only). Interestingly, topology and kinetics result strongly correlated, suggesting the existence of regulatory factors linking the non-dividing/apoptotic subpopulations with proliferating cells. Furthermore, BMSCs display highly synchronized cell cycles during early generations, indicating stage-specific regulatory mechanisms through which cells influence each other. By employing a non-interacting population growth model, we demonstrate that the observed synchronisation cannot be explained by an uncorrelated branching process; instead, cell-to-cell correlation of division times must exist. Our findings reveal fundamental mechanisms governing BMSC heterogeneity and growth dynamics that may inform strategies to control their regenerative potential.</description>

      <title>Asymmetric Effects Underlying Dynamic Heterogeneity in Miscible Blends of Poly(methyl methacrylate) with Poly(ethylene oxide)</title>

Abstract: The emergence of spatially variable local dynamics, or dynamic heterogeneity, is common in multicomponent polymer systems. Although often attributed to differences in the intrinsic dynamics of each component, the molecular origin of their coupling and its dependencies remain unclear. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations of polyethylene oxide (PEO)/poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) blends, across the full range of compositions and multiple thermal regimes, to characterize local fluctuations and sub-chain relaxations for both PEO and PMMA. By constructing probability distributions of local composition and computing entropic measures, we connect nanoscale heterogeneity to differences in mobility between PEO and PMMA, extending beyond mean-field treatments. While PMMA segmental fluctuations in blends broadly align with $T_\text{g}$-equivalent neat PMMA systems, PEO exhibits enhanced mobility correlated with increased free volume and broader, more diverse local compositions upon blending. Rouse-mode analysis, used to probe relaxation dynamics over different length scales, shows that PEO relaxation approaches neat-like behavior in PEO-rich domains, whereas PMMA relaxation accelerates uniformly across all mode numbers. Given the local mobility enhancement of PMMA by PEO, this uniform shift suggests a nanoscale facilitation process that extends PEO's influence beyond its immediate environment. These findings link the statistics of local compositional heterogeneity to dynamic asymmetry across length scales, provide physical insight into the behavior of this archetypal blend system, and establish a framework for analyzing dynamic coupling in others.</description>

Abstract: The study of rare events is one of the major challenges in atomistic simulations, and several enhanced sampling methods towards its solution have been proposed. Recently, it has been suggested that the use of the committor, which provides a precise formal description of rare events, could be of use in this context. We have recently followed up on this suggestion and proposed a committor-based method that promotes frequent transitions between the metastable states of the system and allows extensive sampling of the process transition state ensemble. One of the strengths of our approach is being self-consistent and semi-automatic, exploiting a variational criterion to iteratively optimize a neural-network-based parametrization of the committor, which uses a set of physical descriptors as input. Here, we further automate this procedure by combining our previous method with the expressive power of graph neural networks, which can directly process atomic coordinates rather than descriptors. Besides applications on benchmark systems, we highlight the advantages of a graph-based approach in describing the role of solvent molecules in systems, such as ion pair dissociation or ligand binding.</description>

Abstract: The boundary between classically simulable and computationally superior quantum systems is fundamental to identifying true quantum advantage. We investigate this within the framework of quantum reservoir computing by introducing a tunable $N$-qubit random circuit model, where a fraction $p$ of Clifford gates are probabilistically substituted with nonstabilizing conditional-$\hat{T}$ gates. We establish a direct correspondence between the reservoir's performance on temporal processing tasks and its entanglement spectrum statistics and long-range nonstabilizer resource content. To assess scalability, we study the scaling of the anti-flatness of states in the large-$N$ limit at a fixed circuit depth ratio $d/N \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$. This is taken as a witness to concentration of measures, a known impediment to learning in thermalizing systems. We demonstrate that the learnability and scalability of the reservoir can be continuously controlled by the parameter $p$, allowing us to navigate from classically tractable to maximally expressive quantum dynamics. These architecture-agnostic results offer a general strategy for designing powerful and trainable quantum machine learning systems and clarify the physical resources underpinning quantum computational advantage.</description>
