      <title>RareCollab -- An Agentic System Diagnosing Mendelian Disorders with Integrated Phenotypic and Molecular Evidence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04058</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.04058v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Millions of children worldwide are affected by severe rare Mendelian disorders, yet exome and genome sequencing still fail to provide a definitive molecular diagnosis for a large fraction of patients, prolonging the diagnostic odyssey. Bridging this gap increasingly requires transitioning from DNA-only interpretation to multi-modal diagnostic reasoning that combines genomic data, transcriptomic sequencing (RNA-seq), and phenotype information; however, computational frameworks that coherently integrate these signals remain limited. Here we present RareCollab, an agentic diagnostic framework that pairs a stable quantitative Diagnostic Engine with Large Language Model (LLM)-based specialist modules that produce high-resolution, interpretable assessments from transcriptomic signals, phenotypes, variant databases, and the literature to prioritize potential diagnostic variants. In a rigorously curated benchmark of Undiagnosed Diseases Network (UDN) patients with paired genomic and transcriptomic data, RareCollab achieved 77% top-5 diagnostic accuracy and improved top-1 to top-5 accuracy by ~20% over widely used variant-prioritization approaches. RareCollab illustrates how modular artificial intelligence (AI) can operationalize multi-modal evidence for accurate, scalable rare disease diagnosis, offering a promising path toward reducing the diagnostic odyssey for affected families.</description>

      <title>Processing-in-memory for genomics workloads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.00597v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Low-cost, high-throughput DNA and RNA sequencing (HTS) data is the backbone of the life sciences. Genome sequencing is now becoming a part of Predictive, Preventive, Personalized, and Participatory (termed 'P4') medicine. All genomic data are currently processed in energy-hungry computer clusters and centers, necessitating data transfer, consuming substantial energy, and wasting valuable time. Therefore, there is a need for fast, energy-efficient, and cost-efficient technologies that enable genomics research without requiring data centers and cloud platforms. We recently launched the BioPIM Project to leverage emerging processing-in-memory (PIM) technologies to enable energy- and cost-efficient analysis of bioinformatics workloads. The BioPIM Project focuses on co-designing algorithms and data structures commonly used in genomics with several PIM architectures to achieve the highest cost, energy, and time savings.</description>

      <title>Intrinsic Limits of Read Trimming in Single-Stranded Bisulfite Sequencing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19002</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.19002v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Single-stranded whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (ssWGBS) enables DNA methylation profiling in low-input and highly fragmented samples, including cell-free DNA, but introduces stochastic enzymatic artifacts that complicate preprocessing and downstream interpretation. In post-bisulfite library construction, Adaptase-mediated tailing blurs the boundary between biological sequence and synthetic additions, rendering read trimming a persistent source of variability across analytical pipelines. We show that this variability reflects an intrinsic limit of per-read boundary inference rather than an algorithmic shortcoming: boundary localization is fundamentally asymmetric between paired-end reads, with Read 2 exhibiting kinetically structured artifacts that support constrained read-level inference, while apparent contamination in Read 1 arises conditionally from geometry-driven read-through events and is not well-defined at the single-read level. Even within Read 2, bisulfite-induced compositional degeneracy creates an indistinguishable regime in which genomic and synthetic origins share support under the same observable sequence evidence, implying a strictly positive Bayes error under any deterministic per-read decision rule and placing a fundamental limit on per-read boundary fidelity. By explicitly characterizing these limits, we reframe read trimming in ssWGBS as a constrained inference problem and introduce a conservative framework that operates only where supported by observable evidence (including short-range nucleotide texture), exposes interpretable trade-offs between genomic retention and residual artifact risk, and avoids forced resolution where boundaries are intrinsically unresolvable. Together, these results clarify why fixed trimming heuristics persist in practice and provide a principled foundation for uncertainty-aware preprocessing in ssWGBS.</description>
