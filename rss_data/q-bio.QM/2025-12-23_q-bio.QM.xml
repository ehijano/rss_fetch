      <title>easyplater: The easy way to generate microplate designs deconvolved from multivariate clinical data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17988</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17988v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Microplate-based 'omic studies of large clinical cohorts can massively accelerate biomedical research, but experimental power and veracity may be negatively impacted when plate positional effects confound clinical variables of interest. Plate designs must therefore deconvolve this technical and biological variation, and several computational approaches now exist to achieve this. However, even the most advanced of these methods requires too much user intervention to ensure designs adhere to spatial constraints. Here, we aim to significantly reduce researcher-hours spent in plate design with three innovations: First, we propose a weighted, multivariate plate design score that uses a novel metric of spatial autocorrelation to reward designs where similar samples are in distal wells, and which also incorporates penalties for local, variable-wise homogeneous regions; Next, we use a network-based approach to identify clinically similar samples, and then generate an initial plate design randomized under the constraint that similar samples are allocated to distal wells; Lastly, we propose a novel method to quickly search plate-design space for an improvement on the initial design, as measured by the plate design score. We have implemented this method in easyplater, an R package for generating 96-well plate designs which takes sample clinical data and user-assigned clinical variable weights as input, and outputs the most deconvolved plate design it finds in CSV, XLSX, and HTML formats. Overall, easyplater reduces the need for user intervention in plate design, outperforms currently available methods, and is an important advancement as large, well-phenotyped cohorts become available for high-throughput 'omic studies and numbers of plates and clinical variables increase.</description>

      <title>Greater than the Sum of Its Parts: Building Substructure into Protein Encoding Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Protein representation learning has advanced rapidly with the scale-up of sequence and structure supervision, but most models still encode proteins either as per-residue token sequences or as single global embeddings. This overlooks a defining property of protein organization: proteins are built from recurrent, evolutionarily conserved substructures that concentrate biochemical activity and mediate core molecular functions. Although substructures such as domains and functional sites are systematically cataloged, they are rarely used as training signals or representation units in protein models. We introduce Magneton, an environment for developing substructure-aware protein models. Magneton provides (1) a dataset of 530,601 proteins annotated with over 1.7 million substructures spanning 13,075 types, (2) a training framework for incorporating substructures into existing protein models, and (3) a benchmark suite of 13 tasks probing representations at the residue, substructural, and protein levels. Using Magneton, we develop substructure-tuning, a supervised fine-tuning method that distills substructural knowledge into pretrained protein models. Across state-of-the-art sequence- and structure-based models, substructure-tuning improves function prediction, yields more consistent representations of substructure types never observed during tuning, and shows that substructural supervision provides information that is complementary to global structure inputs. The Magneton environment, datasets, and substructure-tuned models are all openly available (https://github.com/rcalef/magneton/).</description>

      <title>Standardized Evaluation of Automatic Methods for Perivascular Spaces Segmentation in MRI -- MICCAI 2024 Challenge Results</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18197v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Perivascular spaces (PVS), when abnormally enlarged and visible in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) structural sequences, are important imaging markers of cerebral small vessel disease and potential indicators of neurodegenerative conditions. Despite their clinical significance, automatic enlarged PVS (EPVS) segmentation remains challenging due to their small size, variable morphology, similarity with other pathological features, and limited annotated datasets. This paper presents the EPVS Challenge organized at MICCAI 2024, which aims to advance the development of automated algorithms for EPVS segmentation across multi-site data. We provided a diverse dataset comprising 100 training, 50 validation, and 50 testing scans collected from multiple international sites (UK, Singapore, and China) with varying MRI protocols and demographics. All annotations followed the STRIVE protocol to ensure standardized ground truth and covered the full brain parenchyma. Seven teams completed the full challenge, implementing various deep learning approaches primarily based on U-Net architectures with innovations in multi-modal processing, ensemble strategies, and transformer-based components. Performance was evaluated using dice similarity coefficient, absolute volume difference, recall, and precision metrics. The winning method employed MedNeXt architecture with a dual 2D/3D strategy for handling varying slice thicknesses. The top solutions showed relatively good performance on test data from seen datasets, but significant degradation of performance was observed on the previously unseen Shanghai cohort, highlighting cross-site generalization challenges due to domain shift. This challenge establishes an important benchmark for EPVS segmentation methods and underscores the need for the continued development of robust algorithms that can generalize in diverse clinical settings.</description>

      <title>Machine Learning of Temperature-dependent Chemical Kinetics Using Parallel Droplet Microreactors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19416v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature is a fundamental regulator of chemical and biochemical kinetics, yet capturing nonlinear thermal effects directly from experimental data remains a major challenge due to limited throughput and model flexibility. Recent advances in machine learning have enabled flexible modeling beyond conventional physical laws, but most existing strategies remain confined to surrogate models of end-point yields rather than full kinetic dynamics. Consequently, an end-to-end framework that unifies systematic kinetic data acquisition with machine learning based modeling has been lacking. In this paper, we present a unified framework that integrates droplet microfluidics with machine learning for the systematic analysis of temperature-dependent reaction kinetics. The platform is specifically designed to enable stable immobilization and long-term time-lapse imaging of thousands of droplets under dynamic thermal gradients. This configuration yields massively parallel time-resolved datasets across diverse temperature conditions that capture transient kinetics and provides particularly suitable inputs for training machine-learning models of reaction dynamics. Leveraging these datasets, we train Neural ODE models, which embed neural networks within differential equations to flexibly represent nonlinear temperature dependencies beyond conventional formulations. We demonstrate accurate prediction of enzymatic kinetics across diverse thermal environments, highlighting the robustness and versatility of the approach. Our framework bridges high-throughput experimental data acquisition with data-driven modeling, establishing a versatile foundation for enhanced predictive ability and rational analysis and design of temperature-sensitive biochemical processes.</description>

      <title>Automated Pollen Recognition in Optical and Holographic Microscopy Images</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08589v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the application of deep learning to improve and automate pollen grain detection and classification in both optical and holographic microscopy images, with a particular focus on veterinary cytology use cases. We used YOLOv8s for object detection and MobileNetV3L for the classification task, evaluating their performance across imaging modalities. The models achieved 91.3% mAP50 for detection and 97% overall accuracy for classification on optical images, whereas the initial performance on greyscale holographic images was substantially lower. We addressed the performance gap issue through dataset expansion using automated labeling and bounding box area enlargement. These techniques, applied to holographic images, improved detection performance from 2.49% to 13.3% mAP50 and classification performance from 42% to 54%. Our work demonstrates that, at least for image classification tasks, it is possible to pair deep learning techniques with cost-effective lensless digital holographic microscopy devices.</description>

      <title>CytoDINO: Risk-Aware and Biologically-Informed Adaptation of DINOv3 for Bone Marrow Cytomorphology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17930</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17930v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bone marrow cell cytomorphology analysis is critical for the diagnosis of hematological malignancies but remains a labor-intensive process subject to significant inter-observer variability. While recent foundation models have shown promise in computational pathology, they often require extensive computational resources and fail to account for the asymmetric risks associated with clinical misdiagnosis. We introduce CytoDINO, a framework that achieves state-of-the-art performance on the Munich Leukemia Laboratory (MLL) dataset by fine-tuning DINOv3 using Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA). Our primary contribution is a novel Hierarchical Focal Loss with Critical Penalties, which encodes biological relationships between cell lineages and explicitly penalizes clinically dangerous misclassifications (e.g., classifying blasts as normal cells). CytoDINO achieves an 88.2% weighted F1 score and 76.5% macro F1 on a held-out test set of 21 cell classes. By utilizing parameter-efficient fine-tuning with only 8% trainable parameters on a single NVIDIA RTX 5080, we demonstrate that consumer-grade hardware can match specialized infrastructure. Furthermore, confidence-based selective prediction yields 99.5% accuracy on 67% of samples, suggesting a viable pathway for clinical deployment where high-uncertainty cases are flagged for expert review</description>

      <title>Markovian Promoter Models: A Mechanistic Alternative to Hill Functions in Gene Regulatory Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18442</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18442v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gene regulatory networks are typically modeled using ordinary differential equations (ODEs) with phenomenological Hill functions to represent transcriptional regulation. While computationally efficient, Hill functions lack mechanistic grounding and cannot capture stochastic promoter dynamics. We present a hybrid Markovian-ODE framework that explicitly models discrete promoter states while maintaining computational tractability. Our approach tracks individual transcription factor binding events as a continuous-time Markov chain, coupled with deterministic ODEs for molecular concentrations. We validate this framework on seven gene regulatory systems spanning basic to advanced complexity: the GAL system, repressilator, Goodwin oscillator, toggle switch, incoherent feed-forward loop, p53-Mdm2 oscillator, and NF-$\kappa$B pathway. Comparison with stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) ground truth demonstrates that Markovian promoter models achieve similar accuracy to full stochastic simulations while being 10-100$\times$ faster. Our framework provides a mechanistic foundation for gene regulation modeling and enables investigation of promoter-level stochasticity in complex regulatory networks.</description>

      <title>Out-of-Distribution Detection in Molecular Complexes via Diffusion Models for Irregular Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18454v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Predictive machine learning models generally excel on in-distribution data, but their performance degrades on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. Reliable deployment therefore requires robust OOD detection, yet this is particularly challenging for irregular 3D graphs that combine continuous geometry with categorical identities and are unordered by construction. Here, we present a probabilistic OOD detection framework for complex 3D graph data built on a diffusion model that learns a density of the training distribution in a fully unsupervised manner. A key ingredient we introduce is a unified continuous diffusion over both 3D coordinates and discrete features: categorical identities are embedded in a continuous space and trained with cross-entropy, while the corresponding diffusion score is obtained analytically via posterior-mean interpolation from predicted class probabilities. This yields a single self-consistent probability-flow ODE (PF-ODE) that produces per-sample log-likelihoods, providing a principled typicality score for distribution shift. We validate the approach on protein-ligand complexes and construct strict OOD datasets by withholding entire protein families from training. PF-ODE likelihoods identify held-out families as OOD and correlate strongly with prediction errors of an independent binding-affinity model (GEMS), enabling a priori reliability estimates on new complexes. Beyond scalar likelihoods, we show that multi-scale PF-ODE trajectory statistics - including path tortuosity, flow stiffness, and vector-field instability - provide complementary OOD information. Modeling the joint distribution of these trajectory features yields a practical, high-sensitivity detector that improves separation over likelihood-only baselines, offering a label-free OOD quantification workflow for geometric deep learning.</description>

      <title>Persistence diagrams as morphological signatures of cells: A method to measure and compare cells within a population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.20644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.20644v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Cell biologists study in parallel the morphology of cells with the regulation mechanisms that modify this morphology. Such studies are complicated by the inherent heterogeneity present in the cell population. It remains difficult to define the morphology of a cell with parameters that can quantify this heterogeneity, leaving the cell biologist to rely on manual inspection of cell images. We propose an alternative to this manual inspection that is based on topological data analysis. We characterise the shape of a cell by its contour and nucleus. We build a filtering of the edges defining the contour using a radial distance function initiated from the nucleus. This filtering is then used to construct a persistence diagram that serves as a signature of the cell shape. Two cells can then be compared by computing the Wasserstein distance between their persistence diagrams. Given a cell population, we then compute a distance matrix that includes all pairwise distances between its members. We analyse this distance matrix using hierarchical clustering with different linkage schemes and define a purity score that quantifies consistency between those different schemes, which can then be used to assess homogeneity within the cell population. We illustrate and validate our approach to identify sub-populations in human mesenchymal stem cell populations.</description>

Abstract: Trajectory inference is used to order single-cell omics data along a path that reflects a continuous transition between cells. This approach is useful for studying processes like cell differentiation, where a stem cell matures into a specialized cell type, or investigating state changes in pathological conditions. In the current article, we provide a general introduction to trajectory inference, explaining the concepts and assumptions underlying the different methods. We then briefly discuss the strengths and weaknesses of different trajectory inference methods. We also describe best practices for using trajectory inference, such as how to validate the results and how to interpret them in the context of biological knowledge. Finally, the article highlights some applications of trajectory inference in single-cell omics research. These applications include studying cell differentiation, development, and disease.</description>

      <title>Algebraic approaches for the decomposition of reaction networks and the determination of existence and number of steady states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.01179v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Chemical reaction network theory provides powerful tools for rigorously understanding chemical reactions and the dynamical systems and differential equations that represent them. A frequent issue with mathematical analyses of these networks is the reliance on explicit parameter values which in many cases cannot be determined experimentally. This can make analyzing a dynamical system infeasible, particularly when the size of the system is large. One approach is to analyze subnetworks of the full network and use the results for a full analysis.
  Our focus is on the equilibria of reaction networks. Gr\"obner basis computation is a useful approach for solving the polynomial equations which correspond to equilibria of a dynamical system. We identify a class of networks for which Gr\"obner basis computations of subnetworks can be used to reconstruct the more expensive Gr\"obner basis computation of the whole network. We compliment this result with tools to determine if a steady state can exist, and if so, how many.</description>

      <title>Discrete Heat Kernels on Simplicial Complexes and Its Application to Functional Brain Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.16908v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Networks constitute fundamental organizational structures across biological systems, although conventional graph-theoretic analyses capture exclusively pairwise interactions, thereby omitting the intricate higher-order relationships that characterize network complexity. This work proposes a unified framework for heat kernel smoothing on simplicial complexes, extending classical signal processing methodologies from vertices and edges to cycles and higher-dimensional structures. Through Hodge Laplacian, a discrete heat kernel on a finite simplicial complex $\mathcal{K}$ is constructed to smooth signals on $k$-simplices via the boundary operator $\partial_k$. Computationally efficient sparse algorithms for constructing boundary operators are developed to implement linear diffusion processes on $k$-simplices. The methodology generalizes heat kernel smoothing to $k$-simplices, utilizing boundary structure to localize topological features while maintaining homological invariance. Simulation studies demonstrate qualitative signal enhancement across vertex and edge domains following diffusion processes. Application to parcellated human brain functional connectivity networks reveals that simplex-space smoothing attenuates spurious connections while amplifying coherent anatomical architectures, establishing practical significance for computational neuroscience applications.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.04628v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Discovering new drug molecules is a pivotal yet challenging process due to the near-infinitely large chemical space and notorious demands on time and resources. Numerous generative models have recently been introduced to accelerate the drug discovery process, but their progression to experimental validation remains limited, largely due to a lack of consideration for synthetic accessibility in practical settings. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that is capable of generating new chemical structures while ensuring synthetic accessibility. Specifically, we introduce a postfix notation of synthetic pathways to represent molecules in chemical space. Then, we design a transformer-based model to translate molecular graphs into postfix notations of synthesis. We highlight the model's ability to: (a) perform bottom-up synthesis planning more accurately, (b) generate structurally similar, synthesizable analogs for unsynthesizable molecules proposed by generative models with their properties preserved, and (c) explore the local synthesizable chemical space around hit molecules.</description>

Abstract: Correlative computational microscopy can accelerate imaging and modeling of cellular dynamics by relaxing trade-offs inherent to dynamic imaging. Existing computational microscopy frameworks are either specialized or overly generic, limiting use to fixed configurations or domain experts. We introduce WaveOrder, a generalist wave-optical framework for imaging the architectural order of biomolecules. WaveOrder reconstructs diverse specimen properties from multi-channel acquisitions, with or without fluorescence. It provides a unified representation of linear optical properties and differentiable physics-based image formation models spanning widefield, confocal, light-sheet, and oblique label-free geometries. WaveOrder uses physics-informed ML to auto-tune model parameters and solve blind shift-variant restoration problems. This open-source, PyTorch-based framework enables scalable quantitative imaging across scales from organelles to adult zebrafish, and improves restoration of cellular structures in high-throughput experiments. We validate WaveOrder on diverse imaging applications, demonstrating its ability to recover biomolecular structure beyond the limits of existing approaches.</description>

      <title>Separating water content from network dynamics in cell nuclei with Brillouin microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17362</link>

Abstract: Probing forces, deformations and generally speaking the mechanical properties of cells is the hallmark of mechanobiology. In the last two decades many techniques have been developed to this end that are largely based on deforming the cells and measuring the reaction force. In cells, an alternative approach has been implemented mid 2010's, based on Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) that produces a spectrum that can be interpreted as the response of the sample to an infinitesimal uniaxial compression at picosecond timescales. In all of these measurements, the response of the cell is quantified with a colloquial "stiffness" that encompasses both the contribution of load-bearing structures and volume changes, much to confusion. To clarify the interpretation of the hypersonic data obtained from BLS spectra, we vary the relative volume fraction of intracellular water and solid network by applying osmotic compressions to single cells. In the nucleus, we observe a non-linear increase in the sound velocity and attenuation with increasing osmotic pressure that we fit to a poroelastic model, providing an estimate of the friction coefficient between the water phase and the network. By comparing BLS data to volume measurements, our approach demonstrates clearly that BLS shift alone is mostly sensitive to water content while the additional analysis of the linewidth allows identifying the contribution of the biopolymer-based network dynamics in living cells.</description>

      <title>Weakly Supervised Segmentation and Classification of Alpha-Synuclein Aggregates in Brightfield Midbrain Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16268</link>

Abstract: Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with the accumulation of misfolded alpha-synuclein aggregates, forming Lewy bodies and neuritic shape used for pathology diagnostics. Automatic analysis of immunohistochemistry histopathological images with Deep Learning provides a promising tool for better understanding the spatial organization of these aggregates. In this study, we develop an automated image processing pipeline to segment and classify these aggregates in whole-slide images (WSIs) of midbrain tissue from PD and incidental Lewy Body Disease (iLBD) cases based on weakly supervised segmentation, robust to immunohistochemical labelling variability, with a ResNet50 classifier. Our approach allows to differentiate between major aggregate morphologies, including Lewy bodies and neurites with a balanced accuracy of $80\%$. This framework paves the way for large-scale characterization of the spatial distribution and heterogeneity of alpha-synuclein aggregates in brightfield immunohistochemical tissue, and for investigating their poorly understood relationships with surrounding cells such as microglia and astrocytes.</description>
