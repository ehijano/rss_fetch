      <title>The gig economy during an epidemic: coupling disease transmission with labour market dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The gig economy has grown significantly in recent years, driven by the emergence of various facilitating platforms. Triggering substantial shifts to labour markets across the world, the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this growth. To understand the crucial role of such an epidemic on the dynamics of labour markets of both formal and gig economies, we develop and investigate a model that couples disease transmission and a search and match framework of unemployment. We find that epidemics increase gig economy employment at the expense of formal economy employment, and can increase the total long term unemployment. In the short run, large sharp fluctuations in labour market tightness and unemployment can occur, while in the long run, employment is reduced under an endemic disease equilibrium. We analyze a public policies that increase unemployment benefits or provide benefits to gig workers to mitigate these effects, and evaluate their trade-offs in mitigating disease burden and labour market disruptions.</description>

      <title>Ambiguous Persuasion with Prior Ambiguity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18603</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18603v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cheng (2025) establishes that in a persuasion game where both the sender and the receiver have Maxmin Expected Utility (MEU) preferences, the sender never strictly benefits from using ambiguous communication strategies over standard (non-ambiguous) ones. This note extends the analysis to environments with prior ambiguity, i.e., pre-existing ambiguity about the payoff-relevant state, and shows that, in the binary state and binary action case, the same no-gain result continues to hold.</description>

      <title>Using Machine Learning to Generate, Clarify, and Improve Economic Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Machine learning algorithms can now outperform classic economic models in predicting quantities ranging from bargaining outcomes, to choice under uncertainty, to an individual's future jobs and wages. Yet this predictive accuracy comes at a cost: most machine learning algorithms function as black boxes, offering little insight into \emph{why} outcomes occur. This article asks whether machine learning can guide the development of new economic theories.
  Economic models serve an important purpose beyond prediction -- they uncover the general mechanisms behind observed behaviors. A model that identifies the causal pathways of economic development is more valuable than one that merely predicts which countries will escape poverty, because it enables policymakers to encourage that development in countries where it might not have happened otherwise. Similarly, a model that predicts imperfectly across many domains can be more valuable than one that is highly accurate in a specific domain, since the former allows insights and data obtained from one setting to inform decisions and policy in another.
  Applying machine learning algorithms off-the-shelf is unlikely to yield such models. But recent work shows that, when reconceived with the aims of an economic modeler in mind, machine learning methods can improve both prediction and understanding. These approaches range from adversarially training algorithms to expose the limits of existing models, to imposing economic theory as a constraint on algorithmic search. Advances in large language models complement these strategies and open new research directions.</description>

      <title>Binary Self-Selective Voting Rules</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15265</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15265v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel binary stability property for voting rules-called binary self-selectivity-by which a society considering whether to replace its voting rule using itself in pairwise elections will choose not to do so. In Theorem 1, we show that a neutral voting rule is binary self-selective if and only if it is universally self-selective. We then use this equivalence to show, in Corollary 1, that under the unrestricted strict preference domain, a unanimous and neutral voting rule is binary self-selective if and only if it is dictatorial. In Theorem 2 and Corollary 2, we show that whenever there is a strong Condorcet winner; a unanimous, neutral and anonymous voting rule is binary self-selective (or universally self-selective) if and only if it is the Condorcet voting rule.</description>

      <title>Consistent Opponent Modeling of Static Opponents in Imperfect-Information Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.17671v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of agents in multi-agent environments is to maximize total reward against the opposing agents that are encountered. Following a game-theoretic solution concept, such as Nash equilibrium, may obtain a strong performance in some settings; however, such approaches fail to capitalize on historical and observed data from repeated interactions against our opponents. Opponent modeling algorithms integrate machine learning techniques to exploit suboptimal opponents utilizing available data; however, the effectiveness of such approaches in imperfect-information games to date is quite limited. We show that existing opponent modeling approaches fail to satisfy a simple desirable property even against static opponents drawn from a known prior distribution; namely, they do not guarantee that the model approaches the opponent's true strategy even in the limit as the number of game iterations approaches infinity. We develop a new algorithm that is able to achieve this property and runs efficiently by solving a convex minimization problem based on the sequence-form game representation using projected gradient descent. The algorithm is guaranteed to efficiently converge to the opponent's true strategy given observations from gameplay and possibly additional historical data if it is available.</description>
