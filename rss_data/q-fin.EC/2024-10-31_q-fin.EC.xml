      <title>The Heterogeneous Effects of Active Labour Market Policies in Switzerland</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23322</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23322v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Active labour market policies are widely used by the Swiss government, enrolling more than half of unemployed individuals. This paper analyses whether the Swiss programmes increase future employment and earnings of the unemployed by using causal machine learning methods and leveraging an administrative dataset that captures the population of unemployed and their labour market histories. The findings indicate a small positive average effect on employment and earnings three years after starting a specific Temporary Wage Subsidy programme. In contrast, we find negative effects for Basic Courses, such as job application training, on both outcomes three years after starting the programme. We find no significant effect for Employment Programmes which are conducted outside the regular labour market and Training Courses, such as language and computer courses. The programmes are most effective for individuals with lower education levels and with a migration background from non-EU countries. Last, shallow policy trees provide practical guidance on how the allocation of individuals to programmes could be optimised.</description>

      <title>Job Loss and Political Entry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supply of politicians affects the quality of democratic institutions. Yet, little is known about how economic trade-offs motivate individuals to enter political life. This paper investigates how experiencing a job loss affects individuals' decision to join politics and studies the consequences of layoffs for the selection of politicians. Using administrative data on the universe of formal employees, party members, and local political candidates in Brazil, and relying on mass layoffs for causal identification, we show that job loss increases the probability of joining a political party and running for local office. Moreover, we document that layoff-induced candidates are positively selected in various competence measures, suggesting that economic shocks may improve the quality of politicians. Heterogeneity analyses reveal a more pronounced increase in candidacies for laid-off individuals with higher financial incentives from office holding and larger predicted income losses. In addition, we find that being eligible for unemployment benefits after job loss also increases party memberships and candidacies. These results are consistent with the reduction in private-sector opportunity costs and the increased time resources explaining the rise in political entry.</description>

      <title>The museum pass problem with consortia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23923</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23923v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we extend the museum pass problem to incorporate the market structure. To be more precise, we consider that museums are organized into several pass programs or consortia. Within this framework, we propose four allocation mechanisms based on the market structure and the principles of proportionality and egalitarianism. All these mechanisms satisfy different reasonable properties related to fairness and stability which serve to axiomatically characterize them.</description>
