      <title>A No-Go Theorem of Analytical Mechanics for the Second Law Violation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17007v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We follow the Boltzmann-Clausius-Maxwell (BCM) proposal to solve a long-standing problem of identifying the underlying cause of the second law (SL) of spontaneous irreversibility, a stochastic universal principle, as the mechanical equilibrium (stable or unstable) principle (Mec-EQ-P) of analytical mechanics of an isolated nonequilibrium system of any size. The principle leads to nonnegative system intrinsic (SI) microwork and SI-average macrowork dW during any spontaneous process. In conjuction with the first law, Mec-EQ-P leads to a generalized second law (GSL) dQ=dW&gt;0, where dQ=TdS is the purely stochastic SI-macroheat that corresponds to dS&gt;0 for T&gt;0 and dS&lt;0 for T&lt;0, where T is the temperature. The GSL supercedes the conventional SL formulation that is valid only for a macroscopic system for positive temperatures temperatures, but reformulates it to dS&lt;0 for negative temperatures. It is quite surprising that GSL is not only a direct consequence of intertwined mechanical and stochastic macroquantities through the first law but also remains valid for any arbitrary irreversible process in a system of any size as an identity for positive and negative temperatures. It also becomes a no-go theorem for GSL-violation unless we abandon Mec-EQ-P of analytical mechanics used in the BCM proposal, which will be catastrophic for theoretical physics. In addition, Mec-EQ-P also provides new insights into the roles of spontaneity, nonspontaneity, negative temperatures, instability, and the significance of dS&lt;0 due to nonspontaneity and inserting internal constraints.</description>

      <title>Exactly solvable non-unitary time evolution in quantum critical systems I: Effect of complex spacetime metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17059</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17059v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this series of works, we study exactly solvable non-unitary time evolutions in one-dimensional quantum critical systems ranging from quantum quenches to time-dependent drivings. In this part I, we are motivated by the recent works of Kontsevich and Segal [1] and Witten [2] on allowable complex spacetime metrics in quantum field theories. In general, such complex spacetime metrics will lead to non-unitary time evolutions. In this work, we study the universal features of such non-unitary time evolutions based on exactly solvable setups. Various physical quantities including entanglement Hamiltonian and entanglement spectrum, entanglement entropy, and energy density at an arbitrary time can be exactly solved. Due to the damping effect introduced by the complex time, the excitations in the initial state are gradually damped out in time. The non-equilibrium dynamics exhibits universal features that are qualitatively different from the case of real-time evolutions. For instance, for an infinite system after a global quench, the entanglement entropy of the semi-infinite subsystem will grow logarithmically in time, in contrast to the linear growth in a real-time evolution. Moreover, we study numerically the time-dependent driven quantum critical systems with allowable complex spacetime metrics. It is found that the competition between driving and damping leads to a steady state with an interesting entanglement structure.</description>

      <title>Iso-BAE Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We discover a family of local deformations that leave part of the spectrum intact for strongly interacting and exactly solvable quantum many-body systems. Since the deformation preserves the Bethe Ansatz equations (BAE), it is dubbed as the iso-BAE flow. Although all theories on the flow share the same BAE, the spectra are different. Part of the spectrum remains intact along the whole flow. Such states are protected by an emergent symmetry. The rest of the spectrum change continuously along the flow and are doubly degenerate for even length spin chains. For odd length chains, the deformed spectrum also comprises doubly degenerate pairs apart from the sector with magnon number $(L+1)/2$, where $L$ is the length of the spin chain. We discuss the iso-BAE flow for ${\rm XXX}_{1/2}$ model in detail and show that the iso-BAE flows exist for more general models including $q$-deformed XXZ as well as higher spin ${\rm XXX}_{s}$ spin chains.</description>

      <title>Environment-Mediated Long-Ranged Correlations in Many-Body System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantum states in complex aggregates are unavoidably affected by environmental effects, which typically cannot be accurately modeled by simple Markovian processes. As system sizes scale up, nonperturbative simulation become thus unavoidable but they are extremely challenging due to the intimate interplay of intrinsic many-body interaction and time-retarded feedback from environmental degrees of freedom. In this work, we utilize the recently developed Quantum Dissipation with Minimally Extended State Space (QD-MESS) approach to address reservoir induced long-ranged temporal correlations in finite size Ising-type spin chains. For thermal reservoirs with ohmic and subohmic spectral density we simulate the quantum time evolution from finite to zero temperature. The competition between thermal fluctuations, quantum fluctuations, and anti-/ferromagnetic interactions reveal a rich pattern of dynamical phases including dissipative induced phase transitions and spatiotemporal correlations.</description>

      <title>Logarithmic and power-law entropies from convexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17411</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17411v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In an attempt to understand the origin and robustness of the Boltzmann/Gibbs/Shannon entropic functional, we adopt a geometric approach and discuss the implications of the Johnson-Lindenstrauss lemma and of Dvoretzky's theorem on convex bodies for the choice of this functional form. We contrast these results with a more recent result on flowers of balls, which may be interpreted as suggesting the use of power-law entropies for some systems.</description>

      <title>Exact results on the dynamics of the stochastic Floquet-East model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17464</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17464v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a stochastic generalisation of the classical deterministic Floquet-East model, a discrete circuit with the same kinetic constraint as the East model of glasses. We prove exactly that, in the limit of long time and large size, this model has a large deviation phase transition between active and inactive dynamical phases. We also compute the finite time and size scaling of general space-time fluctuations, which for the case of inactive regions gives rise to dynamical hydrophobicity. We also discuss how, through the Trotter limit, these exact results also hold for the continuous-time East model, thus proving long-standing observations in kinetically constrained models. Our results here illustrate the applicability of exact tensor network methods for solving problems in many-body stochastic systems.</description>

      <title>Percolation renormalization group analysis of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ lattice gauge theories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The analytical study of confinement in lattice gauge theories (LGTs) remains a difficult task to this day. Taking a geometric perspective on confinement, we develop a real-space renormalization group (RG) formalism for $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs using percolation probability as a confinement order parameter. The RG flow we analyze is constituted by both the percolation probability and the coupling parameters. We consider a classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT in two dimensions, with matter and thermal fluctuations, and analytically derive the confinement phase diagram. We find good agreement with numerical and exact benchmark results and confirm that a finite matter density enforces confinement at $T&lt;\infty$ in the model we consider. Our RG scheme enables future analytical studies of $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs with matter and quantum fluctuations and beyond.</description>

      <title>Anisotropic Brownian particles under resetting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study analytically the dynamics of an anisotropic particle subjected to different stochastic resetting schemes in two dimensions. The Brownian motion of shape-asymmetric particles in two dimensions results in anisotropic diffusion at short times, while the late-time transport is isotropic due to rotational diffusion. We show that the presence of orientational resetting promotes the anisotropy to late times. When the spatial (i.e. translational) degrees of freedom are reset, we find that a non-trivial spatial probability distribution emerges in the steady state that is determined by the initial orientation, particle asymmetry and the resetting rate. When only spatial degrees of freedom are reset while the orientational degree of freedom is allowed to evolve freely, the steady state is independent of the particle asymmetry. When only particle orientation is reset, the late-time probability density is given by a Gaussian with an effective diffusion tensor, including off-diagonal terms, determined by the resetting rate. Generally, the coupling between the translational and rotational degrees of freedom, when combined with stochastic resetting, gives rise to unique behaviour at late times not present in the case of symmetric particles. Considering recent developments in experimental implementations of resetting, our results can be useful for the control of asymmetric colloids, for example in self-assembly processes.</description>

      <title>Ranking nodes in bipartite systems with a non-linear iterative map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17572</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17572v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper introduces a method based on a non-linear iterative map to evaluate node relevance in bipartite networks. By tuning a single parameter gamma, the method captures different concepts of node importance, including established measures like degree centrality, eigenvector centrality and the fitness-complexity ranking used in economics. The algorithm's flexibility allows for efficient ranking optimization tailored to specific tasks. As an illustrative example, we apply this method to ecological mutualistic networks, where ranking quality can be assessed by the extinction area - the rate at which the system collapses when species are removed in a certain order. The map with the optimal gamma value, which is dataset-specific, surpasses existing ranking methods on this task. Additionally, our method excels in evaluating nestedness, another crucial structural property of ecological systems, requiring specific node rankings. The final part of the paper explores the theoretical aspects of the map, revealing a phase transition at a critical $\gamma$ value dependent on the data structure that can be characterized analytically for random networks. Near the critical point, the map exhibits unique features and a distinctive triangular packing pattern of the adjacency matrix.</description>

      <title>Extreme Diffusion Measures Statistical Fluctuations of the Environment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17733v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider many-particle diffusion in one spatial dimension modeled as Random Walks in a Random Environment (RWRE). A shared short-range space-time random environment determines the jump distributions that drive the motion of the particles. We determine universal power-laws for the environment's contribution to the variance of the extreme first passage time and extreme location. We show that the prefactors rely upon a single extreme diffusion coefficient that is equal to the ensemble variance of the local drift imposed on particles by the random environment. This coefficient should be contrasted with the Einstein diffusion coefficient, which determines the prefactor in the power-law describing the variance of a single diffusing particle and is equal to the jump variance in the ensemble averaged random environment. Thus a measurement of the behavior of extremes in many-particle diffusion yields an otherwise difficult to measure statistical property of the fluctuations of the generally hidden environment in which that diffusion occurs. We verify our theory and the universal behavior numerically over many RWRE models and system sizes.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.16763v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a tensor renormalization group simulation of non-Abelian gauge theory in three dimensions using a formulation based on the `armillary sphere.' In this formulation, matrix indices are completely traced out, eliminating the degeneracy in the singular value spectrum of the initial tensor. We demonstrate the usefulness of this technique by computing the average plaquette at zero temperature and the Polyakov loop susceptibility at finite temperatures for 2+1D SU(2) and SU(3) gauge theories. The deconfinement transition is identified for both gauge groups, with the SU(2) case being consistent with previous Monte Carlo results.</description>

      <title>A CFT dual for evaporating black holes: boundary continuous matrix product states</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17021v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor network states, especially Matrix Product States (MPS), are crucial tools for studying how particles in large quantum systems are entangled with each other. MPS are particularly effective for modeling systems in one-dimensional space. Their continuous version, known as continuous Matrix Product States (cMPS), extends this approach to more complex quantum field theories that describe systems with an infinite number of interacting particles. This paper introduces a novel extension, boundary continuous Matrix Product States (BCMPS), which incorporate boundary states from conformal field theory (CFT). We construct BCMPS and explore their potential holographic duals, linking them to black hole microstates with end-of-the-world branes in AdS/CFT. This connection hints at a deeper relationship between tensor networks and spacetime geometry, potentially offering new insights into the interplay between quantum information and gravity.</description>

      <title>Quantum Geometry and Entanglement in Two-dimensional Insulators: A View from the Corner Charge Fluctuation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Measuring bipartite fluctuations of a conserved charge, such as the particle number, within a finite region is a powerful approach to characterizing quantum systems. When the measured region has sharp corners, the bipartite fluctuation receives an additional contribution known to exhibit universal angle-dependence in 2D isotropic and uniform systems. Here we establish that the corner charge fluctuation reveals universal information even for generic $\textit{lattice}$ systems of non-interacting electrons. We first prove that universal angle-dependence can be recovered in the $\textit{small-angle}$ limit for proper partitions of the lattice, from which the integrated Fubini-Study quantum metric can be extracted. A model of a compact obstructed atomic insulator is introduced to illustrate this effect analytically. Numerical verification is presented for various Chern insulator models, demonstrating the experimental relevance of the corner charge fluctuation in a finite-size quantum simulator as a probe of quantum geometry. Last but not least, we highlight a remarkable connection between quantum geometry and quantum information through the lens of corner entanglement entropies.</description>

      <title>Generalized Gibbs ensembles in weakly interacting dissipative systems and digital quantum computers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17033</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17033v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Digital quantum computers promise to solve important and challenging problems in many-body quantum physics. However, at least for the superconducting platforms, their current limitation is the noise level. It thus seems more reasonable to presently use them to model dissipative systems, where platforms' native noise is not that crucial. Here, we propose using a digital quantum computer to showcase the activation of integrability by realizing exotic generalized Gibbs ensembles in weakly dissipative integrable systems. Dissipation is realized by coupling system's qubits to periodically reset ancilla ones, like in the protocol recently used to realize dissipative cooling. We derive the effective equations of motion for trotterized dynamics and contrast such a setup to the usual Lindblad continuous evolution. For simplicity, we consider and compare different approaches to calculating steady-states of non-interacting integrable systems weakly coupled to baths, where thermodynamic results can be obtained via a generalized scattering theory between the Bogoliubov quasiparticles. Corresponding quantum computer implementation would illuminate the possibilities of realizing similar exotic states in nearly integrable quantum materials.</description>

      <title>Quantum fingerprints of self-organization in spin chains coupled to a Kuramoto model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17062v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Floquet theory is a widely used framework to describe the dynamics of periodically-driven quantum systems. The usual set up to describe such kind of systems is to consider the effect of an external control with a definite period in time that can act either globally or locally on the system of interest. However, besides the periodicity, there is no classical correlation or other well defined structures in the drive. In this work, we consider drives that exhibit self-organization phenomena reaching periodic steady states with emergent symmetries. To substantiate our results, we consider two examples of a one-dimensional quantum spin chains in a transverse field coupled to a classical Kuramoto model. In the case of all-to-tall coupling, the Kuramoto model drives the Ising chain into a time-periodic steady state with an emergent translational symmetry. For a Kuramoto model in a Zig-zag lattice, the XX spin chain is trimerized and the dynamics exhibit topological behavior that can be exploited to perform topological pumping. Our results can be experimentally implemented in near-term quantum devices in digital and analog platforms.</description>

      <title>Nonextensivity and temperature fluctuations of the Higgs boson production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17075</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17075v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We determine the temperature fluctuations associated with the Higgs boson $p_T$ spectrum through the derivation of the string tension distribution corresponding to the QCD-based Hagedorn function, frequently used to fit the transverse momentum distribution (TMD). The identified string tension fluctuations are heavy tailed, behaving similarly to the $q$-Gaussian distribution. After the convolution with the Schwinger mechanism, both approaches correctly describe the entire TMD. This approach is the onset for the nonthermal description of the particle production in ultrarelativistic pp collisions. By analyzing the data of pp collisions at $\sqrt{s} =13$ TeV, we found that the average temperature associated with the Higgs boson differential cross section is around 85 times greater than the estimated value for the charged particle TMD. Our results show that the Higgs boson production exhibits the largest deviation from the thermal description.</description>

      <title>Annealing-based approach to solving partial differential equations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17364v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Solving partial differential equations using an annealing-based approach is based on solving generalized eigenvalue problems. When a partial differential equation is discretized, it leads to a system of linear equations (SLE). Solving an SLE can be expressed as a general eigenvalue problem, which can be converted into an optimization problem with the objective function being a generalized Rayleigh quotient. The proposed algorithm allows the computation of eigenvectors at arbitrary precision without increasing the number of variables using an Ising machine. Simple examples solved using this method and theoretical analysis provide a guideline for appropriate parameter settings.</description>

      <title>Characterising transport in a quantum gas by measuring Drude weights</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.17569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transport properties play a crucial role in defining materials as insulators, metals, or superconductors. A fundamental parameter in this regard is the Drude weight, which quantify the ballistic transport of charge carriers. In this work, we measure the Drude weights of an ultracold gas of interacting bosonic atoms confined to one dimension, characterising the induced atomic and energy currents in response to perturbations with an external potential. We induce currents through two distinct experimental protocols; by applying a constant force to the gas, and by joining two subsystems prepared in different equilibrium states. By virtue of integrability, dynamics of the system is governed by ballistically propagating, long-lived quasi-particle excitations, whereby Drude weights almost fully characterise large-scale transport. Indeed, our results align with predictions from a recently developed hydrodynamic theory, demonstrating almost fully dissipationless transport, even at finite temperatures and interactions. These findings not only provide experimental validation of the hydrodynamic predictions but also offer methodologies applicable to various condensed matter systems, facilitating further studies on the transport properties of strongly correlated quantum matter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2103.02626v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The many-body physics at quantum phase transitions shows a subtle interplay between quantum and thermal fluctuations, emerging in the low-temperature limit. In this review, we first give a pedagogical introduction to the equilibrium behavior of systems in that context, whose scaling framework is essentially developed by exploiting the quantum-to-classical mapping and the renormalization-group theory of critical phenomena at continuous phase transitions. Then we specialize to protocols entailing the out-of-equilibrium quantum dynamics, such as instantaneous quenches and slow passages across quantum transitions. These are mostly discussed within dynamic scaling frameworks, obtained by appropriately extending the equilibrium scaling laws. We review phenomena at first-order quantum transitions as well, whose peculiar scaling behaviors are characterized by an extreme sensitivity to the boundary conditions, giving rise to exponentials or power laws for the same bulk system. In the last part, we cover aspects related to the effects of dissipative interactions with an environment, through suitable generalizations of the dynamic scaling at quantum transitions. The presentation is limited to issues related to, and controlled by, the quantum transition developed by closed many-body systems, treating the dissipation as a perturbation of the critical regimes, as for the temperature at the zero-temperature quantum transition. We focus on the physical conditions giving rise to a nontrivial interplay between critical modes and various dissipative mechanisms, generally realized when the involved mechanism excites only the low-energy modes of the quantum transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2306.17479v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a loop optimization algorithm based on nuclear norm regularization for tensor network. The key ingredient of this scheme is to introduce a rank penalty term proposed in the context of data processing. Compared to standard variational periodic matrix product states method, this algorithm can circumvent the local minima related to short-ranged correlation in a simpler fashion. We demonstrate its performance when used as a part of the tensor network renormalization algorithms [S. Yang, Z.-C. Gu, and X.-G. Wen, Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 110504 (2017)] for the critical 2D Ising model. The scale invariance of the renormalized tensors is attained with higher accuracy while the higher parts of the scaling dimension spectrum are obtained in a more stable fashion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.05257v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We studied the nonequilibrium dynamics of a cycling three-state Potts model using simulations and theory. This model can be tuned from thermal-equilibrium to far-from-equilibrium conditions. At low cycling energy, the homogeneous dominant state cycles via nucleation and growth, while spiral waves are formed at high energy. For large systems, a discontinuous transition occurs from these cyclic homogeneous phases to spiral waves, while the opposite transition is absent. Conversely, these two modes can coexist for small systems. The waves can be reproduced by a continuum theory, and the transition can be understood from the competition between nucleation and growth.</description>

      <title>Entropy Production by Underdamped Langevin Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12305</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12305v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Entropy production (EP) is a central quantity in nonequilibrium physics as it monitors energy dissipation, irreversibility, and free energy differences during thermodynamic transformations. Estimating EP, however, is challenging both theoretically and experimentally due to limited access to the system dynamics. For overdamped Langevin dynamics and Markov jump processes it was recently proposed that, from thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TUR), short-time cumulant currents can be used to estimate EP without knowledge of the dynamics. Yet, estimation of EP in underdamped Langevin systems remains an active challenge. To address this, we derive a modified TUR that relates the statistics of two specific novel currents -- one cumulant current and one stochastic current -- to a system's EP. These two distinct but related currents are used to constrain EP in the modified TUR. One highlight is that there always exists a family of currents such that the uncertainty relations saturate, even for long-time averages and in nonsteady-state scenarios. Another is that our method only requires limited knowledge of the dynamics -- specifically, the damping-coefficient to mass ratio and the diffusion constant. This uncertainty relation allows estimating EP for both overdamped and underdamped Langevin dynamics. We validate the method numerically, through applications to several underdamped systems, to underscore the flexibility in obtaining EP in nonequilibrium Langevin systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.15561v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate fluctuations in the average speed or current of a self-interacting diffusion (SID) on a ring, mimicking the non-Markovian behaviour of an agent influenced by its own path. We derive the SID's phase diagram, showing a delocalisation-localisation phase transition from self-repelling to self-attracting. Current fluctuations are analysed using: (i) an adiabatic approximation, where the system reaches its stationary distribution before developing current fluctuations, and (ii) an original extension of level 2.5 large deviations for Markov processes. The latter, combined with perturbation theory, provides an upper bound to current fluctuations, which is tight in the self-repelling region, while the former approximates current fluctuations well in all regimes. Both methods accurately estimate the asymptotic variance and suggests a phase transition at the onset of the localised regime.</description>

Abstract: The development of turbulence closure models, parametrizing the influence of small non-resolved scales on the dynamics of large resolved ones, is an outstanding theoretical challenge with vast applicative relevance. We present a closure, based on deep recurrent neural networks, that quantitatively reproduces, within statistical errors, Eulerian and Lagrangian structure functions and the intermittent statistics of the energy cascade, including those of subgrid fluxes. To achieve high-order statistical accuracy, and thus a stringent statistical test, we employ shell models of turbulence. Our results encourage the development of similar approaches for 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence.</description>

      <title>Decoding general error correcting codes and the role of complementarity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2210.06661v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Among various classes of quantum error correcting codes (QECCs), non-stabilizer codes have rich properties and are of theoretical and practical interest. Decoding non-stabilizer codes is, however, a highly non-trivial task. In this paper, we show that a decoding circuit for Calderbank-Shor-Stean (CSS) codes can be straightforwardly extended to that for a general QECC. In the extension, instead of the classical decoders of the linear classical codes that define the CSS code, we use decoding measurements of a pair of classical-quantum (CQ) codes associated with the QECC to be decoded.The decoding error depends on the errors of the two decoding measurements and the degree of complementarity of the CQ codes.We then demonstrate the power of the decoding circuit in a toy model of the black hole information paradox, in which we improve decoding errors over previous approaches and further show that the black hole dynamics may be an optimal encoder for quantum information but a poor encoder for classical information.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.03844v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study one-dimensional hybrid quantum circuits perturbed by quenched quasiperiodic (QP) modulations across the measurement-induced phase transition (MIPT). Considering non-Pisot QP structures, characterized by unbounded fluctuations, allows us to tune the wandering exponent $\beta$ to exceed the Luck bound $\nu \ge 1/(1-\beta)$ for the stability of the MIPT, where $\nu=1.28(2)$. Via robust numerical simulations of random Clifford circuits interleaved with local projective measurements, we find that sufficiently large QP structural fluctuations destabilize the MIPT and induce a flow to a broad family of critical dynamical phase transitions of the infinite QP type that is governed by the wandering exponent, $\beta$. We numerically determine the associated critical properties, including the correlation length exponent consistent with saturating the Luck bound, and a universal activated dynamical scaling with activation exponent $\psi \cong \beta$, finding excellent agreement with the conclusions of real space renormalization group calculations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.19880v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a numerical quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) method for simulating the 3D phase transition on the recently proposed fuzzy sphere [Phys. Rev. X 13, 021009 (2023)]. By introducing an additional $SU(2)$ layer degree of freedom, we reformulate the model into a form suitable for sign-problem-free QMC simulation. From the finite-size-scaling, we show that this QMC-friendly model undergoes a quantum phase transition belonging to the 3D Ising universality class, and at the critical point we compute the scaling dimensions from the state-operator correspondence, which largely agrees with the prediction from the conformal field theory. These results pave the way to construct sign-problem-free models for QMC simulations on the fuzzy sphere, which could advance the future study on more sophisticated criticalities.</description>

Abstract: This work challenges the conventional notion that in spacetime dimension higher than one, a supersymmetric Lagrangian invariably consists of purely bosonic terms, purely fermionic terms, as well as boson-fermion mixing terms. By recasting a relativistic Lagrangian in terms of its non-relativistic and ultra-relativistic sectors, we reveal that an ultra-relativistic (Carrollian) supersymmetric Lagrangian can exist without a purely bosonic contribution. Based on this result, we demonstrate a link between higher-dimensional Carrollian and (0+1)-dimensional quantum mechanical models, yielding higher-order extensions of supersymmetric SYK models in which purely bosonic higher order terms are absent. Given that supersymmetry plays an essential role in improving the quantum behavior and solubility, our findings may lead to interesting applications in non-AdS holography.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2401.02018v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By circumventing the difficulty of obtaining exact string state solutions to Bethe ansatz equations, we devise a truncated string state space approach for investigating spin dynamics in a nonintegrable spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ Heisenberg chain subjected to a staggered field at various magnetizations. The obtained dynamical spectra reveal a series of elastic peaks at integer multiples of the ordering wave vector $Q$, indicating the presence of multi-$Q$ Bethe string states within the ground state. The spectrum exhibits a separation between different string continua as the strength of the staggered field increases at low magnetization, reflecting the confinement of the Bethe strings. This approach provides a unified string-state-based framework for understanding spin dynamics in low-dimensional nonintegrable Heisenberg models, which has a successful application to observations across various phases of the quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet $\rm YbAlO_3$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.06597v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a free-fermion chain undergoing dephasing, described by two different random-measurement protocols (unravelings): a quantum-state-diffusion and a quantum-jump one. Both protocols keep the state in a Slater-determinant form, allowing to address quite large system sizes. We find a bifurcation in the distribution of the measurement operators along the quantum trajectories, that's to say, there is a point where the shape of this distribution changes from unimodal to bimodal. The value of the measurement strength where this phenomenon occurs is similar for the two unravelings, but the distributions and the transition have different properties reflecting the symmetries of the two measurement protocols. We also consider the scaling with the system size of the inverse participation ratio of the Slater-determinant components and find a power-law scaling that marks a multifractal behaviour, in both unravelings and for any nonvanishing measurement strength.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.07149v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Exploiting analogies between the precessing quantum spin system and the charge-monopole system, we construct Bloch hyper-spheres with $\it{exact}$ spherical symmetries in arbitrary dimensions. Such Bloch hyper-spheres are realized as a collection of the orbits of a precessing quantum spin. The geometry of Bloch hyper-spheres is exactly equal to the quantum Nambu geometry of higher dimensional fuzzy spheres. The stabilizer group symmetry of the Bloch hyper-sphere necessarily introduces degenerate spin-coherent states, giving rise to the Wilczek-Zee geometric phase of non-Abelian monopoles associated with the hyper-sphere holonomy. The degenerate spin-coherent states induce matrix-valued quantum geometric tensors. While the minimal spin Bloch hyper-spheres exhibit similar properties in even and odd dimensions, their large spin counterparts differ qualitatively depending on the parity of the dimensions. Exact correspondences between spin-coherent states and monopole harmonics in higher dimensions are established. We also investigate density matrices described by Bloch hyper-balls and elucidate their corresponding statistical and geometric properties, such as von Neumann entropies and Bures quantum metrics.</description>

Abstract: Efficient characterization of higher dimensional many-body physical states presents significant challenges. In this paper, we propose a new class of Project Entangled Pair State (PEPS) that incorporates two isometric conditions. This new class facilitates the efficient calculation of general local observables and certain two-point correlation functions, which have been previously shown to be intractable for general PEPS, or PEPS with only a single isometric constraint. Despite incorporating two isometric conditions, our class preserves the rich physical structure while enhancing the analytical capabilities. It features a large set of tunable parameters, with only a subleading correction compared to that of general PEPS. Furthermore, we analytically demonstrate that this class can encode universal quantum computations and can represent a transition from topological to trivial order.</description>

      <title>A quantum annealing approach to the minimum distance problem of quantum codes</title>

Abstract: Quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs) is at the heart of fault-tolerant quantum computing. As the size of quantum platforms is expected to grow, one of the open questions is to design new optimal codes of ever-increasing size. A related challenge is to ``certify'' the quality of a given code by evaluating its minimum distance, a quantity characterizing code's capacity to preserve quantum information. This problem is known to be NP-hard. Here we propose to harness the power of contemporary quantum platforms to address this question, and in this way help design quantum platforms of the future. Namely, we introduce an approach to compute the minimum distance of quantum stabilizer codes by reformulating the problem as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem and leveraging established QUBO algorithms and heuristics as well as quantum annealing (QA) to address the latter. The reformulation as a QUBO introduces only a logarithmic multiplicative overhead in the required number of variables. We demonstrate practical viability of our method by comparing the performance of purely classical algorithms with the D-Wave Advantage 4.1 quantum annealer as well as hybrid quantum-classical algorithm Qbsolv. We found that the hybrid approach demonstrates competitive performance, on par with the best available classical algorithms to solve QUBO. In a practical sense, the QUBO-based approach is currently lagging behind the best deterministic minimal distance algorithms, however this advantage may disappear as the size of the platforms grows.</description>

      <title>Math behind everyday life: on emergence of "black days" and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.19459v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In our daily lives, we encounter numerous independent events, each occurring with varying probabilities over time. This letter delves into the scientific background behind the inhomogeneous distribution of these events over time, often resulting in what we refer to as "black days", where multiple events seem to converge at once. In the first part of the work we performed an analysis involving $D$ independent periodic and random sequences of events. Employing the Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) technique, we observed a clustering of sequences of events on a 2D manifold ${\cal M}$ at some large $D_{cr}$, which we interpret as the manifestation of "black days" and which occurs in a narrow interval around $D_{cr}$. We found that increasing the number of sequences within rather wide interval below $D_{cr}$ leads to a plateau in the clustering on ${\cal M}$. In the second part of the work we examined in detail clustering patterns of independently distributed $N$ points within the corners of a $D$-dimensional cube when $1\ll N&lt;D$. Our findings revealed that a transition to a single-component cluster occurs at a critical dimensionality, $D_{cr}$, via a nearly third-order phase transition. Finally, we have addressed the question "How the infinite-dimensional space could look like?" Considering the eigenvalue problem for the hyperspherical Laplacian $\nabla^2_D$ in the limit $D\to\infty$, we conjectured about the topology of a target space representing the hyperspherical layer.</description>

      <title>Non-Unitary Quantum Many-Body Dynamics using the Faber Polynomial Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10135v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Efficient numerical methods are still lacking to probe the unconventional dynamics of quantum many-body systems under non-unitary evolution. In this work, we use Faber polynomials to numerically simulate both the dynamics of non-Hermitian systems and the quantum jumps unravelling of the Lindblad dynamics. We apply the method to the non-interacting and interacting Hatano-Nelson models evolving from two different setups: i) a N\'eel state, and ii) a domain wall. In the first case, we study how interactions preserve the initial magnetic order against the skin effect. In the second example, we present numerical evidence of the existence of an effective hydrodynamic description for the domain-wall melting problem in the non-interacting limit. Additionally, we investigate both the conditional and unconditional dynamics of the quantum jump unravelling in two quantum spin chains, which exhibit either the non-Hermitian or the Liouvillian skin effect. This numerical method inherently generalises the well-established method based on Chebyshev polynomials to accommodate non-Hermitian scenarios.</description>

      <title>Rate of epidemic spreading on complex networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.15449</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.15449v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The initial phase of an epidemic is often characterised by an exponential increase in the number of infected individuals. In a well-mixed population, this exponential increase is controlled by the basic reproduction number R0 and the distribution of times between consecutive infection along an infection chain. However, real populations are characterised by a complex network of interactions, and are thus far from being well mixed. Here, we derive an expression for the rate of exponential spread of an epidemic on a complex network. We find that this rate is affected by the degree distribution, the network assortativity, and the level of clustering. Our result holds for a broad range of networks, apart from networks with very broad degree distribution, where no clear exponential regime is present. The theory presented in this paper bridges the gap between classic epidemiology and the theory of complex network, with broad implications for model inference and policy making.</description>
