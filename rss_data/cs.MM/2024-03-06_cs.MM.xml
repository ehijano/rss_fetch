      <title>Optimizing Mobile-Friendly Viewport Prediction for Live 360-Degree Video Streaming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02693v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viewport prediction is the crucial task for adaptive 360-degree video streaming, as the bitrate control algorithms usually require the knowledge of the user's viewing portions of the frames. Various methods are studied and adopted for viewport prediction from less accurate statistic tools to highly calibrated deep neural networks. Conventionally, it is difficult to implement sophisticated deep learning methods on mobile devices, which have limited computation capability. In this work, we propose an advanced learning-based viewport prediction approach and carefully design it to introduce minimal transmission and computation overhead for mobile terminals. We also propose a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) based saliency prediction network trainer, which provides a few-sample fast training solution to obtain the prediction model by utilizing the information from the past models. We further discuss how to integrate this mobile-friendly viewport prediction (MFVP) approach into a typical 360-degree video live streaming system by formulating and solving the bitrate adaptation problem. Extensive experiment results show that our prediction approach can work in real-time for live video streaming and can achieve higher accuracies compared to other existing prediction methods on mobile end, which, together with our bitrate adaptation algorithm, significantly improves the streaming QoE from various aspects. We observe the accuracy of MFVP is 8.1$\%$ to 28.7$\%$ higher than other algorithms and achieves 3.73$\%$ to 14.96$\%$ higher average quality level and 49.6$\%$ to 74.97$\%$ less quality level change than other algorithms.</description>

      <title>MMoFusion: Multi-modal Co-Speech Motion Generation with Diffusion Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02905</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02905v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The body movements accompanying speech aid speakers in expressing their ideas. Co-speech motion generation is one of the important approaches for synthesizing realistic avatars. Due to the intricate correspondence between speech and motion, generating realistic and diverse motion is a challenging task. In this paper, we propose MMoFusion, a Multi-modal co-speech Motion generation framework based on the diffusion model to ensure both the authenticity and diversity of generated motion. We propose a progressive fusion strategy to enhance the interaction of inter-modal and intra-modal, efficiently integrating multi-modal information. Specifically, we employ a masked style matrix based on emotion and identity information to control the generation of different motion styles. Temporal modeling of speech and motion is partitioned into style-guided specific feature encoding and shared feature encoding, aiming to learn both inter-modal and intra-modal features. Besides, we propose a geometric loss to enforce the joints' velocity and acceleration coherence among frames. Our framework generates vivid, diverse, and style-controllable motion of arbitrary length through inputting speech and editing identity and emotion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms current co-speech motion generation methods including upper body and challenging full body.</description>

      <title>SNIFFER: Multimodal Large Language Model for Explainable Out-of-Context Misinformation Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03170v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Misinformation is a prevalent societal issue due to its potential high risks. Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, where authentic images are repurposed with false text, is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments, which is essential for debunking misinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich knowledge and innate capability for visual reasoning and explanation generation, they still lack sophistication in understanding and discovering the subtle crossmodal differences. In this paper, we introduce SNIFFER, a novel multimodal large language model specifically engineered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation. SNIFFER employs two-stage instruction tuning on InstructBLIP. The first stage refines the model's concept alignment of generic objects with news-domain entities and the second stage leverages language-only GPT-4 generated OOC-specific instruction data to fine-tune the model's discriminatory powers. Enhanced by external tools and retrieval, SNIFFER not only detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external knowledge for contextual verification. Our experiments show that SNIFFER surpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. SNIFFER also provides accurate and persuasive explanations as validated by quantitative and human evaluations.</description>

      <title>Enhancing Generalization in Medical Visual Question Answering Tasks via Gradient-Guided Model Perturbation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Leveraging pre-trained visual language models has become a widely adopted approach for improving performance in downstream visual question answering (VQA) applications. However, in the specialized field of medical VQA, the scarcity of available data poses a significant barrier to achieving reliable model generalization. Numerous methods have been proposed to enhance model generalization, addressing the issue from data-centric and model-centric perspectives. Data augmentation techniques are commonly employed to enrich the dataset, while various regularization approaches aim to prevent model overfitting, especially when training on limited data samples. In this paper, we introduce a method that incorporates gradient-guided parameter perturbations to the visual encoder of the multimodality model during both pre-training and fine-tuning phases, to improve model generalization for downstream medical VQA tasks. The small perturbation is adaptively generated by aligning with the direction of the moving average gradient in the optimization landscape, which is opposite to the directions of the optimizer's historical updates. It is subsequently injected into the model's visual encoder. The results show that, even with a significantly smaller pre-training image caption dataset, our approach achieves competitive outcomes on both VQA-RAD and SLAKE datasets.</description>

      <title>Cross Pseudo-Labeling for Semi-Supervised Audio-Visual Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03095</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03095v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Source Localization (AVSL) is the task of identifying specific sounding objects in the scene given audio cues. In our work, we focus on semi-supervised AVSL with pseudo-labeling. To address the issues with vanilla hard pseudo-labels including bias accumulation, noise sensitivity, and instability, we propose a novel method named Cross Pseudo-Labeling (XPL), wherein two models learn from each other with the cross-refine mechanism to avoid bias accumulation. We equip XPL with two effective components. Firstly, the soft pseudo-labels with sharpening and pseudo-label exponential moving average mechanisms enable models to achieve gradual self-improvement and ensure stable training. Secondly, the curriculum data selection module adaptively selects pseudo-labels with high quality during training to mitigate potential bias. Experimental results demonstrate that XPL significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while effectively mitigating confirmation bias and ensuring training stability.</description>

      <title>Dual Mean-Teacher: An Unbiased Semi-Supervised Framework for Audio-Visual Source Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03145v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Source Localization (AVSL) aims to locate sounding objects within video frames given the paired audio clips. Existing methods predominantly rely on self-supervised contrastive learning of audio-visual correspondence. Without any bounding-box annotations, they struggle to achieve precise localization, especially for small objects, and suffer from blurry boundaries and false positives. Moreover, the naive semi-supervised method is poor in fully leveraging the information of abundant unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework for AVSL, namely Dual Mean-Teacher (DMT), comprising two teacher-student structures to circumvent the confirmation bias issue. Specifically, two teachers, pre-trained on limited labeled data, are employed to filter out noisy samples via the consensus between their predictions, and then generate high-quality pseudo-labels by intersecting their confidence maps. The sufficient utilization of both labeled and unlabeled data and the proposed unbiased framework enable DMT to outperform current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, with CIoU of 90.4% and 48.8% on Flickr-SoundNet and VGG-Sound Source, obtaining 8.9%, 9.6% and 4.6%, 6.4% improvements over self- and semi-supervised methods respectively, given only 3% positional-annotations. We also extend our framework to some existing AVSL methods and consistently boost their performance.</description>

      <title>Memories are One-to-Many Mapping Alleviators in Talking Face Generation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.05005</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.05005v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Talking face generation aims at generating photo-realistic video portraits of a target person driven by input audio. Due to its nature of one-to-many mapping from the input audio to the output video (e.g., one speech content may have multiple feasible visual appearances), learning a deterministic mapping like previous works brings ambiguity during training, and thus causes inferior visual results. Although this one-to-many mapping could be alleviated in part by a two-stage framework (i.e., an audio-to-expression model followed by a neural-rendering model), it is still insufficient since the prediction is produced without enough information (e.g., emotions, wrinkles, etc.). In this paper, we propose MemFace to complement the missing information with an implicit memory and an explicit memory that follow the sense of the two stages respectively. More specifically, the implicit memory is employed in the audio-to-expression model to capture high-level semantics in the audio-expression shared space, while the explicit memory is employed in the neural-rendering model to help synthesize pixel-level details. Our experimental results show that our proposed MemFace surpasses all the state-of-the-art results across multiple scenarios consistently and significantly.</description>

      <title>M$^{2}$UGen: Multi-modal Music Understanding and Generation with the Power of Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.11255</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.11255v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The current landscape of research leveraging large language models (LLMs) is experiencing a surge. Many works harness the powerful reasoning capabilities of these models to comprehend various modalities, such as text, speech, images, videos, etc. They also utilize LLMs to understand human intention and generate desired outputs like images, videos, and music. However, research that combines both understanding and generation using LLMs is still limited and in its nascent stage. To address this gap, we introduce a Multi-modal Music Understanding and Generation (M$^{2}$UGen) framework that integrates LLM's abilities to comprehend and generate music for different modalities. The M$^{2}$UGen framework is purpose-built to unlock creative potential from diverse sources of inspiration, encompassing music, image, and video through the use of pretrained MERT, ViT, and ViViT models, respectively. To enable music generation, we explore the use of AudioLDM 2 and MusicGen. Bridging multi-modal understanding and music generation is accomplished through the integration of the LLaMA 2 model. Furthermore, we make use of the MU-LLaMA model to generate extensive datasets that support text/image/video-to-music generation, facilitating the training of our M$^{2}$UGen framework. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our proposed framework. The experimental results demonstrate that our model achieves or surpasses the performance of the current state-of-the-art models.</description>
