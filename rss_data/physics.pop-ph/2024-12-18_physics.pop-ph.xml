      <title>Hawking for beginners</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Stephen Hawkings most important scientific contribution was his theoretical discovery that black holes aint so black, since they emit thermal radiation as if they were hot bodies with an absolute temperature known as the Hawking temperature. Although this year marks half a century since Hawking made his discovery, it remains unknown to the vast majority of people. In his popular books, Hawking explains the significance of his discovery in a simple way, using the so-called vacuum quantum fluctuations. The aim of this work is to bring Hawking's discovery to the widest possible audience, especially physics teachers. To do this, we will develop a derivation of the Hawking temperature that fairly faithfully translates Hawking's quantum fluctuation model into the mathematical language used by a typical physics teacher, whether in training or in practice.</description>

      <title>Quantum Teleportation Game -- A fun way to play and learn single qubit teleportation protocol</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12120</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12120v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how the quantum teleportation protocol of a single qubit can be understood by designing a simple game that can be played by three participants: Alice, Bob, and *Quantum God*.</description>

      <title>Antimatter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12128v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article we concisely explain: what antimatter is, its differentiation between primordial and secondary, how it is produced, where it can be found, the experiments carried out at CERN to create and analyze antiatoms, the problem of the matter-antimatter asymmetry, and the medical and technological applications of antimatter in our society.</description>

      <title>A New Method to Derive an Empirical Lower Limit on the Mass Density of a UFO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12142v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: I derive a lower limit on the mass of an Unidentified Flying Object (UFO) based on measurements of its speed and acceleration, as well as the infrared luminosity of the airglow around it. If the object's radial velocity can be neglected, the mass limit is independent of distance. Measuring the distance and angular size of the object allows to infer its minimum mass density. The Galileo Project will be collecting the necessary data on millions of objects in the sky over the coming year.</description>

      <title>Quandoom -- DOOM as a quantum circuit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12162</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.12162v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Since the early 2000s there has existed the meme that "DOOM can run on anything". Whether it be an ATM or a calculator, someone at some point has recompiled DOOM to run on it. Now the quantum computer finally joins the list. More specifically, this project represents the first level of DOOM loosely rewritten using Hadamards and Toffolis which, despite being a universal gate set, has been designed in such a way that it's classically simulable, able to reach 10-20 frames per second on a laptop. The circuit uses 72,376 total qubits and at least 80 million gates, thus it may have use as a benchmark for quantum simulation software.</description>
