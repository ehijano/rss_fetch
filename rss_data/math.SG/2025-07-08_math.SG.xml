      <title>Hilbert manifold structures on path spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In Floer theory one has to deal with two-level manifolds like for instance the space of $W^{2,2}$ loops and the space of $W^{1,2}$ loops. Gradient flow lines in Floer theory are then trajectories in a two-level manifold. Inspired by our endeavor to find a general setup to construct Floer homology we therefore address in this paper the question if the space of paths on a two-level manifold has itself the structure of a Hilbert manifold. In view of the two topologies on a two-level manifold it is unclear how to define the exponential map on a general two-level manifold. We therefore study a different approach how to define charts on path spaces of two-level manifolds. To make this approach work we need an additional structure on a two-level manifold which we refer to as tameness. We introduce the notion of tame maps and show that the composition of tame is tame again. Therefore it makes sense to introduce the notion of a tame two-level manifold. The main result of this paper shows that the path spaces on tame two-level manifolds have the structure of a Hilbert manifold.</description>

      <title>Degenerate symplectic fixed points and Gromov-Witten invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04191</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04191v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we establish a connection between Gromov-Witten invariants and the number of degenerate fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on a closed rational symplectic manifold via deformed Hamiltonian spectral invariants. We prove a new cuplength estimate, in particular including Arnol'd conjecture over complex numbers, for fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on closed rational symplectic manifolds admitting nonzero Gromov-Witten invariants with two point insertions. We extend Schwarz's quantum cuplength to the notion of deformed quantum cuplength for symplectic periods and employ it to estimate the number of fixed points of Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms on monotone symplectic manifolds with nonzero mixed Gromov-Witten invariants. We generalize Givental's symplectic fixed point theorem for toric manifolds to closed rational symplectic manifolds admitting nonzero Gromov-Witten invariants with fixed marked points and one point insertion.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04897v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By analogy with Weinstein's neighbourhood theorem, we prove a uniqueness result for symplectic neighbourhoods of a large family of stratified subspaces. This result generalizes existing constructions, e.g., in the search for exotic Lagrangians. Along the way, we prove a strong version of Moser's trick and a (non-symplectic) tubular neighbourhood theorem for these stratified subspaces.</description>

      <title>A variational approach to time-dependent planar two-center Stark-Zeeman systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study periodic orbits in a time-dependent two-center Stark-Zeeman system, which models the motion of a charged particle attracted by two fixed Coulomb centers and subject to external magnetic and time-dependent electric fields. A motivating example is provided by the bicircular restricted four-body problem which investigates the motion of a massless particle, influenced by the Newtonian gravitational attraction of the earth, moon and periodically moving sun. Due to singularities at the Coulomb centers, standard local variational approaches fail. To overcome this, we employ the Birkhoff regularization map and construct a non-local regularized action functional on a blown-up loop space, following a recent method due to Barutello-Ortega-Vernizi \cite{BOV21}. We show that the critical points of this regularized action functional satisfy a certain second-order delay differential equation and correspond to periodic solutions of the original system, including collisions. Additionally, we examine the symmetric structure of the regularized functional.</description>

      <title>Cable links of uniformly thick knot types</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.03185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study Legendrian realizations of cable links of knot types that are uniformly thick but not Legendrian simple, extending prior work of Dalton, the second author, and Traynor. This leads to new phenomena, such as Legendrian links that are smoothly isotopic and component-wise Legendrian isotopic, but are not Legendrian isotopic. In our study, we establish new results for cable links whose cable slope is sufficiently negative. We will also show how to classify Legendrian knots in (most) negative cables of twist knots. This is done by introducing a new technique to the study of cables based on Legendrian surgeries.</description>

      <title>Billiards and Hofer's Geometry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.04767v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a link between billiards in convex plane domains and Hofer's geometry, an area of symplectic topology. For smooth strictly convex billiard tables, we prove that the Hofer distance between the corresponding billiard ball maps admits an upper bound in terms of a simple geometric distance between the tables. We use this result to show that the billiard ball map of a convex polygon lies in the completion, with respect to Hofer's metric, of the group of smooth area-preserving maps of the annulus. Finally, we discuss related connections to dynamics and pose several open problems.</description>

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to present a fully algebraic formalism for the construction and reduction of $L_\infty$-algebras of observables inspired by multisymplectic geometry, using Gerstenhaber algebras, BV-modules, and the constraint triple formalism.

      <title>Floer homotopy theory for monotone Lagrangians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17431</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.17431v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We circumvent one of the roadblocks in associating Floer homotopy types to monotone Lagrangians, namely the curvature phenomena occurring in high dimensions. Given $N \ge 3$ and $R$ a connective $\mathbb E_1$-ring spectrum, there is a notion of an $N$-truncated, $R$-oriented flow category, to which we associate a module prospectrum over the Postnikov truncation $\tau_{\le N - 3}R$. This endows ordinary Floer cohomology with an action of the Steenrod algebra over $\tau_{\le N-3}R$, and also induces certain generalized cohomology theories. We give sufficient conditions for a closed embedded monotone Lagrangian to admit such well-defined invariants for $N = N_\mu$ the minimal Maslov number, and $R = MU$ complex bordism. Finally, we formulate Oh-Pozniak type spectral sequences for these invariants, and show that in the case of $\mathbb{RP}^n \subset \mathbb{CP}^n$ they provide further restrictions on the topology of clean intersections with a Hamiltonian isotopy, not detected by ordinary Floer (co)homology.</description>

      <title>Equidistributed Closed Geodesics on Closed Finsler and Riemannian Surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2206.15152v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we establish the existence of an equidistributed sequence of nondegenerate closed geodesics for generic Finsler, symmetric Finsler and Riemannian metrics on every closed surface. The proof relies on the volume property of embedded contact homology, established by Cristofaro-Gardiner, Hutchings and Ramos, along with specific local variational constructions and transversality arguments. Our approach is motivated by Irie's equidistribution result in [19] for three-dimensional Reeb flows and the analogous result presented by Marques, Neves and Song [27] for embedded minimal hypersurfaces.</description>

      <title>Mapping Cone Connections and their Yang-Mills Functional</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01508</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01508v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: For a given closed two-form, we introduce the cone Yang-Mills functional which is a Yang-Mills-type functional for a pair $(A,B)$, a connection one-form $A$ and a scalar $B$ taking value in the adjoint representation of a Lie group. The functional arises naturally from dimensionally reducing the Yang-Mills functional over the fiber of a circle bundle with the two-form being the Euler class. We write down the Euler-Lagrange equations of the functional and present some of the properties of its critical solutions, especially in comparison with Yang-Mills solutions. We show that a special class of three-dimensional solutions satisfy a duality condition which generalizes the Bogomolny monopole equations. Moreover, we analyze the zero solutions of the cone Yang-Mills functional and give an algebraic classification characterizing principal bundles that carry such cone-flat solutions when the two-form is non-degenerate.</description>

Abstract: Let $\omega$ be a Kahler form on $M$, which is a torus $T^4$, a $K3$ surface or an Enriques surface, let $M\#n\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2}$ be $n-$point Kahler blowup of $M$. Suppose that $\kappa=[\omega]$ satisfies certain irrationality condition. Applying techniques related to deformation of complex objects, we extend the guage-theoretic invariant on closed Kahler suraces developed by Kronheimer\cite{Kronheimer1998} and Smirnov\cite{Smirnov2022}\cite{Smirnov2023}. As a result, we show that even dimensional higher homotopy groups of $\Symp(M\#n\overline{\mathbb{CP}^2},\omega)$ are infinitely generated.</description>

      <title>Polarizations on a triangulated category</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15621</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15621v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In a recent collaboration, Hiroki Matsui and the author introduced a new proof of the reconstruction theorem of Bondal-Orlov and Ballard, using Matsui's construction of a ringed space associated to a triangulated category. This paper first shows that these ideas can be applied to reconstructions of more general varieties from their perfect derived categories. For further applications of these ideas, we introduce the framework of a polarized triangulated category, a pair $(\mathcal T,\tau)$ consisting of a triangulated category $\mathcal T$ and an autoequivalence $\tau$ (called a polarization), to which we can associate a ringed space called the pt-spectrum. As concrete applications, we observe that several reconstruction results of Favero naturally fit within this framework, leading to both generalizations and new proofs of these results. Furthermore, we explore broader implications of polarizations and pt-spectra in tensor triangular geometry, noncommutative projective geometry, birational geometry and homological mirror symmetry.</description>
