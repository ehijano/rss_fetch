      <title>Capacities Characterizing Removable Sets for Various Function Spaces in Carnot Groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study removable sets for the Campanato, H\"{o}lder continuous, $L^p_{\text{loc}}$, and Lipschitz functions in Carnot groups. In the former three cases, we characterize removability through the use of capacities with respect to any left-invariant linear differential operator $\mathcal{L}$ for which $\mathcal{L}$ and $\mathcal{L}^t$ are hypoelliptic and satisfy a homogeneity condition, while in the latter case we characterize Lipschitz functions with respect to the sub-Laplacian.</description>

      <title>Sharp Favard length of random Cantor sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that for a large class of planar $1$-dimensional random fractals $S$, the Favard length $\Fav(S(r))$ of the neighborhood $S(r)$ is comparable to $\log^{-1}(1/r)$, matching a universal lower bound; up to now, this was only known in expectation for a few concrete models. In particular, we show that there exist $1$-Ahlfors regular sets with the fastest possible Favard length decay. For a wide class of planar one-dimensional ``grid random fractals'', including fractal percolation and its Ahlfors-regular variants, we further show that $\Fav(S(r))/\log(1/r)$ converges almost surely, and we identify the limit explicitly. Furthermore, we prove that for some $1$-dimensional Ahlfors-regular random fractals $S$, the Favard length of $S(r)$ decays instead like $\log\log(1/r)/\log(1/r)$, showing that the $1/\log(1/r)$ decay is not universal among random fractals, as might be expected from previous results.</description>

      <title>On a new condition implying that an achievement set is a Cantorval and its applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a nonincreasing sequence of positive numbers $(a_n)$ such that the series $\sum a_n$ is convergent, by $E(a_n)$ we denote the set of all subsums of the series $\sum a_n$ and call it the achievement set of $(a_n)$. It is well known that such a set can be a finite union of closed intervals, a Cantor set or a Cantorval. We give a new condition implying that the last possibility occurs. We also show how we can use this condition to produce new achievable Cantorvals. In particular, we prove that Kakeya conditions cannot tell us more about the form of the achievement set than it was proved by Kakeya.</description>

      <title>Some examples of use of transfinite induction in analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16973</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16973v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is not uncommon in analysis that existence of extremal objects is obtained via an iterative procedure: we start from a given admissible object, then modify it, then modify again etc... If being extremal means maximimizing a real valued quantity and we are sure to approach the supremum fast enough, after a countable number of steps and a limiting procedure we are done.
  In this short note we want to advertise a slightly different line of thought, where rather than trying to approach the supremum fast enough, we: try to increase, if possible, the function to be maximized and, at the same time, index our recursive procedure over ordinals. Since there are no increasing functions from $\omega_1$ to $\R$, the procedure must stop at some countable ordinal and existence is proved anyway.
  The advantage of this line of reasoning is that it can be helpful even in situations where it is not so evident how to measure `being maximal' via a real valued function. This is the case, for instance, for existence of a Maximal Globally Hyperbolic Development of an initial data set in General Relativity.
  Speaking of this particular example, we also show that such `real-valued quantification' of the size of a development is actually possible, thus existence of a maximal one can be obtained in a countable number of steps using the original argument in [2] together with the standard procedure depicted above. This provides a way alternative to the one given in [5] to `dezornify' the proof in [2].</description>

      <title>Les Houches Lectures on Exact WKB Analysis and Painlev\'e Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17599v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The first part of these lecture notes is devoted to an introduction to the theory of exact WKB analysis for second-order Schr\"odinger-type ordinary differential equations. It reviews the construction of the WKB solution, Borel summability, connection formulas, and their application to direct monodromy problems.
  In the second part, we discuss recent developments in applying exact WKB analysis to the study of Painlev\'e equations. By combining exact WKB analysis with topological recursion, it becomes possible to explicitly compute the monodromy of linear differential equations associated with Painlev\'e equations, assuming Borel summability and other conditions. Furthermore, by using isomonodromy deformations (integrability of the Painlev\'e equations), the resurgent structure of the $\tau$-function and partition function is analyzed.
  These lecture notes accompanied a series of lectures at the Les Houches school, ``Quantum Geometry (Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics)'' in Summer 2024.</description>

      <title>Zeros of polynomial powers under the heat flow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17808</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17808v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the evolution of zeros of high polynomial powers under the heat flow. For any fixed polynomial $P(z)$, we prove that the empirical zero distribution of its heat-evolved $n$-th power converges to a distribution on the complex plane as $n$ tends to infinity. We describe this limit distribution $\mu_t$ as a function of the time parameter $t$ of the heat evolution: For small time, zeros start to spread out in approximately semicircular distributions, then intricate curves start to form and merge, until for large time, the zero distribution approaches a widespread semicircle law through the initial center of mass. The Stieltjes transform of the limit distribution $\mu_t$ satisfies a self-consistent equation and a Burgers' equation. The present paper deals with general complex-rooted polynomials for which, in contrast to the real-rooted case, no free-probabilistic representation for $\mu_t$ is available.</description>

Abstract: We investigate variants of the Erd\H{o}s similarity problem for Cantor sets. We prove that under a mild Hausdorff or packing logarithmic dimension assumption, Cantor sets are not full measure universal, significantly improving the known fact that sets of positive Hausdorff dimension are not measure universal. We prove a weaker result for all Cantor sets $A$: there is a dense $G_\delta$ set of full measure $X\subset\mathbb{R}^d$, such that for any bi-Lipschitz function $f:\mathbb{R}^d\to \mathbb{R}^d$, the set of translations $t$ such that $f(A)+t\subseteq X$ is of measure zero. Equivalently, there is a null set $B\subset\mathbb{R}^d$ such that $\mathbb{R}^d\setminus (f(A)+B)$ is null for all bi-Lipschitz functions $f$.</description>

      <title>Capacitary Muckenhoupt Weights and Weighted Norm Inequalities for Hardy-Littlewood Maximal Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.23839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathcal H_{\infty}^\delta$ denote the Hausdorff content of dimension $\delta\in(0,n]$ defined on subsets of $\mathbb R^n$. The principal problem, considered in this paper, is to characterize the non-negative function $w$ for which the weighted $L^p$-norm inequality with $p\in(1,\infty)$ and the weighted weak $L^1$-norm inequality on Hardy-Littlewood maximal operators associated with Hausdorff contents hold true. To achieve this, we introduce a class of capacitary Muckenhoupt weights depending on the dimension $\delta$, denoted as $\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$, which enjoys the strict monotonicity on the dimension index $\delta$. Then we show that, for any $p\in(1,\infty)$ and $\delta\in(0,n]$, the weighted $L^p$-norm inequality holds true if and only if $w\in\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$, and the weighted weak $L^1$-norm inequality holds true if and only if $w\in\mathcal A_{1,\delta}$ by a new approach developed in this paper. As the second objective, applying this new approach, the seminal properties of classical Muckenhoupt $A_p$ weights, such as the reverse H\"older inequality [R. R. Coifman and C. Fefferman, Studia Math. 51 (1974), 241-250], the self-improving property [B. Muckenhoupt, Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 165 (1972), 207-226], and Jones' factorization theorem [P. W. Jones, Ann. of Math. (2) 111 (1980), 511-530], are all established within the framework of capacitary Muckenhoupt weight class $\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$. Finally, we also show that the maximal operator is bounded on the weak weighted Choquet-Lebesgue space $L_w^{p,\infty}(\mathbb R^n,{\mathcal H}_\infty^\delta)$ if and only if $w\in\mathcal A_{p,\delta}$ with $p\in(1,\infty)$ and $\delta\in(0,n]$.</description>

      <title>Almost sharp local Bernstein estimates for Laplace eigenfunctions on compact Riemannian manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.16036v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study local growth properties of Laplace eigenfunctions on compact Riemannian manifolds. Following the paradigm introduced by Donnelly and Fefferman in the late 1980s, an eigenfunction is expected to behave locally like a polynomial of degree comparable to the square root of the eigenvalue. In this direction we establish almost sharp local $L^{p}$--Bernstein inequalities, $p\in[1,\infty]$, conjectured by Donnelly--Fefferman in 1990. We also derive analogous estimates for $A$-harmonic functions, with the square root of the eigenvalue replaced by the doubling index.
  Our argument refines the original Donnelly--Fefferman method based on $L^{2}$--Carleman estimates. At the $L^{2}$--level, we first prove a uniform bound for the doubling index on annuli of width comparable to the wavelength. This implies, with an arbitrarily small polynomial loss, the corresponding property at the $L^{p}$--level for all $p\in[1,\infty]$. The latter step relies on a bootstrap scheme combining elliptic regularity with a patching of local Carleman estimates on small balls.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2503.21742v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In these lectures we detail the interplay between the low-energy dynamics of quantum field theories with four supercharges and the exact WKB analysis. This exposition may be the first comprehensive account of this connection and includes new arguments and results.
  The lectures start with the introduction of massive two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theories and their spectra of BPS solitons. We place these theories in a two-dimensional cigar background with supersymmetric boundary conditions labelled by a phase $\zeta = e^{i \vartheta}$, while turning on the two-dimensional $\Omega$-background with parameter~$\epsilon$. We show that the resulting partition function $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathrm{2d}}^\vartheta(\epsilon)$ can be characterized as the Borel-summed solution, in the direction $\vartheta$, to an associated Schr\"odinger equation. The partition function $\mathcal{Z}_{\mathrm{2d}}^\vartheta(\epsilon)$ is locally constant in the phase $\vartheta$ and jumps across phases $\vartheta_\textrm{BPS}$ associated with the BPS solitons. Since these jumps are non-perturbative in the parameter~$\epsilon$, we refer to $Z^\vartheta_\mathrm{2d}(\epsilon)$ as the non-perturbative partition function for the original two-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=(2,2)$ theory. We completely determine this partition function $\mathcal{Z}^\vartheta_\mathrm{2d}(\epsilon)$ in two classes of examples, Landau-Ginzburg models and gauged linear sigma models, and show that $\mathcal{Z}^\vartheta_\mathrm{2d}(\epsilon)$ encodes the well-known vortex partition function at a special phase $\vartheta_\textrm{FN}$ associated with the presence of self-solitons. This analysis generalizes to four-dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ theories in the $\frac{1}{2} \Omega$-background.</description>

      <title>Incremental Generation is Necessary and Sufficient for Universality in Flow-Based Modelling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09902</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09902v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Incremental flow-based denoising models have reshaped generative modelling, but their empirical advantage still lacks a rigorous approximation-theoretic foundation. We show that incremental generation is necessary and sufficient for universal flow-based generation on the largest natural class of self-maps of $[0,1]^d$ compatible with denoising pipelines, namely the orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. All our guarantees are uniform on the underlying maps and hence imply approximation both samplewise and in distribution.
  Using a new topological-dynamical argument, we first prove an impossibility theorem: the class of all single-step autonomous flows, independently of the architecture, width, depth, or Lipschitz activation of the underlying neural network, is meagre and therefore not universal in the space of orientation-preserving homeomorphisms of $[0,1]^d$. By exploiting algebraic properties of autonomous flows, we conversely show that every orientation-preserving Lipschitz homeomorphism on $[0,1]^d$ can be approximated at rate $O(n^{-1/d})$ by a composition of at most $K_d$ such flows, where $K_d$ depends only on the dimension. Under additional smoothness assumptions, the approximation rate can be made dimension-free, and $K_d$ can be chosen uniformly over the class being approximated. Finally, by linearly lifting the domain into one higher dimension, we obtain structured universal approximation results for continuous functions and for probability measures on $[0,1]^d$, the latter realized as pushforwards of empirical measures with vanishing $1$-Wasserstein error.</description>
