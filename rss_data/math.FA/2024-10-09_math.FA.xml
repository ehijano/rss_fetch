      <title>Stability of sorting based embeddings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05446v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Consider a group $G$ of order $M$ acting unitarily on a real inner product space $V$. We show that the sorting based embedding obtained by applying a general linear map $\alpha : \mathbb{R}^{M \times N} \to \mathbb{R}^D$ to the invariant map $\beta_\Phi : V \to \mathbb{R}^{M \times N}$ given by sorting the coorbits $(\langle v, g \phi_i \rangle_V)_{g \in G}$, where $(\phi_i)_{i=1}^N \in V$, satisfies a bi-Lipschitz condition if and only if it separates orbits.
  Additionally, we note that any invariant Lipschitz continuous map (into a Hilbert space) factors through the sorting based embedding, and that any invariant continuous map (into a locally convex space) factors through the sorting based embedding as well.</description>

      <title>Multi-Window Approaches for Direct and Stable STFT Phase Retrieval</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05486v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phase retrieval from phaseless short-time Fourier transform (STFT) measurements is known to be inherently unstable when measurements are taken with respect to a single window. While an explicit inversion formula exists, it is useless in practice due to its instability. In this paper, we overcome this lack of stability by presenting two multi-window approaches that rely on a "good coverage" of the time-frequency plane by the ambiguity functions of the windows. The first is to use the fractional Fourier transform of a dilated Gauss function with various angles as window functions. The essential support of a superposition of the ambiguity function from such window functions is of a "daffodil shape", which converges to a large disc as more angles are used, yielding a much broader coverage in the time-frequency domain. The second approach uses Hermite functions of various degrees as the window functions. The larger the degree, the wider the ambiguity function but with zeros on circles in the time-frequency domain. Combining Hermite functions of different degrees, we can achieve a wide coverage with zeros compensated by the essential support of the ambiguity function from other Hermite windows. Taking advantage of these multi-window procedures, we can stably perform STFT phase retrieval using the direct inversion formula.</description>

      <title>Modelling Signals as Mild Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.05872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This note gives a summary of ideas concerning Applied Fourier Analysis, mostly formulated for those who have to give such courses to engineers or mathematicians interested in real life applications. It tries to answer recurrent questions arising regularly after my talks on the subject. It outlines alternative ways of presenting the core material of Fourier Analysis in a way which is supposed to help students to grasp the relevance of this transform in the context of applications. Essentially we consider functions in $S_0(R^d)$ (known as Feichtinger's algebra) as possible measurements, and the elements of the dual space (which can be also described by various completion procedures) is thus the collection of all "things" (in the spirit of signals) which can be measured in a reasonable way. We call them mild distributions. In other words, we want to base signal analysis on the mathematical theory of mild distributions. They do not need to be defined in a pointwise sense. Dirac's Delta or Dirac combs are natural examples. The are "as real as point masses in physics". Various equivalent approaches (including a sequential approach) help to verify the relevant results. The material is based on the experiences gained by the author in the last 30 years by teaching the subject in an abstract or application oriented manner, at different universities, and to audiences with quite different background.

      <title>Restriction of Fractional Derivatives of the Fourier Transform</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06092</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06092v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we showed that for suitable $(\beta,p, s,\ell)$ the $\beta$-order fractional derivative with respect to the last coordinate of the Fourier transform of an $L^p(\mathbb{R}^n)$ function is in $H^{-s}$ after restricting to a graph of a function with non-vanishing Gaussian curvature provided that the restriction of the Fourier transform of such function to the surface is in $H^{\ell}$. This is a generalization of the result in \cite{GoldStol}*{Theorem 1.12}.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present intriguing findings that characterize both the closed (unbounded) and bounded EP operators on Hilbert spaces. Additionally, we demonstrate the result $\gamma(T) \leq r(T)$, where $T$ is a bounded EP operator, and $\gamma(T) \text{ and } r(T)$ represent the reduced minimum modulus and the spectral radius of $T$, respectively.</description>

      <title>Real-variable Theory of Anisotropic Musielak-Orlicz-Lorentz Hardy Spaces with Applications to Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund Operators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06611v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $\varphi: \mathbb{R}^{n}\times[0,\infty)\rightarrow[0,\infty)$ be a Musielak-Orlicz function satisfying the uniformly anisotropic Muckenhoupt condition and be of uniformly lower type $p^-_{\varphi}$ and of uniformly upper type $p^+_{\varphi}$ with $0&lt;p^-_{\varphi}\leq p^+_{\varphi}&lt;\infty$, $q\in(0,\infty]$, and $A$ be a general expansive matrix on $\mathbb{R}^{n}$. In this article, the authors first introduce the anisotropic Musielak-Orlicz-Lorentz Hardy space $H^{\varphi,q}_A(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ which, when $q=\infty$, coincides with the known anisotropic weak Musielak-Orlicz Hardy space $H^{\varphi,\infty}_A(\mathbb{R}^{n})$, and then establish atomic and molecular characterizations of $H^{\varphi,q}_A(\mathbb{R}^{n})$. As applications, the authors prove the boundedness of anisotropic Calder\'{o}n-Zygmund operators on $H^{\varphi,q}_A(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ when $q\in(0,\infty)$ or from the anisotropic Musielak-Orlicz Hardy space $H^{\varphi}_A(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ to $H^{\varphi,\infty}_A(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ in the critical case. The ranges of all the exponents under consideration are the best possible admissible ones which particularly improve all the known corresponding results for $H^{\varphi,\infty}_A(\mathbb{R}^{n})$ via widening the original assumption $0&lt;p^-_{\varphi}\leq p^+_{\varphi}\leq1$ into the full range $0&lt;p^-_{\varphi}\leq p^+_{\varphi}&lt;\infty$, and all the results when $q\in(0,\infty)$ are new and generalized from isotropic setting to anisotropic setting.</description>

      <title>On the extension of singular linear infinite-dimensional Hamiltonian flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.06749v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Hamiltonian flows in a real separable Hilbert space endowed with a symplectic structure. Measures on the Hilbert space that are invariant with respect to the flows of completely integrable Hamiltonian systems are investigated. These construction gives the opportunity to describe Hamiltonian flows in the phase space by means of unitary groups in the space of functions that are quadratically integrable by the invariant measure. Invariant measures are applied to the study of model linear Hamiltonian systems that admit features of the type of unlimited increase in kinetic energy over a finite time. Due to this approach solutions of Hamilton equations that admit singularities can be described by means of the phase flow in the extended phase space and by the corresponding Koopman representation of the unitary</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we introduce and study the Weyl transform of functions which are integrable with respect to a vector measure on a phase space associated to a locally compact abelian group. We also study the Weyl transform of vector measures. Later, we also introduce and study the convolution of functions from $L^p$-spaces associated to a vector measure. We also study the Weyl transform of vector-valued functions and prove a vector-valued analogue of the Hausdorff-Young inequality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2308.11292v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop the quantum harmonic analysis framework in the reducible setting and apply our findings to polyanalytic Fock spaces. In particular, we explain some phenomena observed in arXiv:2201.10230 and answer a few related open questions. For instance, we show that there exists a symbol such that the corresponding Toeplitz operator is unitary on the analytic Fock space but vanishes completely on one of the true polyanalytic Fock spaces. This follows directly from an explicit characterization of the kernel of the Toeplitz quantization, which we derive using quantum harmonic analysis. Moreover, we show that the Berezin transform is injective on the set of of Toeplitz operators. Finally, we provide several characterizations of the $\mathcal{C}_1$-algebra in terms of integral kernel estimates and essential commutants.</description>

      <title>Pointwise semi-Lipschitz functions and Banach-Stone theorems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17574</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.17574v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the fundamental properties of pointwise semi-Lipschitz functions between asymmetric spaces, which are the natural asymmetric counterpart of pointwise Lipschitz functions. We also study the influence that partial symmetries of a given space may have on the behavior of pointwise semi-Lipschitz functions defined on it. Furthermore, we are interested in characterizing the pointwise semi-Lipschitz structure of an asymmetric space in terms of real-valued pointwise semi-Lipschitz functions defined on it. By using two algebras of functions naturally associated to our spaces of pointwise real-valued semi-Lipschitz functions, we are able to provide two Banach-Stone type results in this context. In fact, these results are obtained as consequences of a general Banach-Stone type theorem of topological nature, stated for abstract functional spaces, which is quite flexible and can be applied to many spaces of continuous functions over metric and asymmetric spaces.</description>

      <title>A generalized Legendre duality relation and Gaussian saturation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.13611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.13611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by the barycenter problem in optimal transportation theory, Kolesnikov--Werner recently extended the notion of the Legendre duality relation for two functions to the case for multiple functions. We further generalize the duality relation and then establish the centered Gaussian saturation property for a Blaschke--Santal\'{o} type inequality associated with it. Our approach to the understanding such a generalized Legendre duality relation is based on our earlier observation that directly links Legendre duality with the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality. More precisely, for a large family of degenerate Brascamp--Lieb data, we prove that the centered Gaussian saturation property for the inverse Brascamp--Lieb inequality holds true when inputs are restricted to even and log-concave functions.
  As an application to convex geometry, we establish the most important case of a conjecture of Kolesnikov and Werner about the Blaschke--Santal\'{o} inequality for multiple even functions as well as multiple symmetric convex bodies. Furthermore, in the direction of information theory and optimal transportation theory, this provides an affirmative answer to another conjecture of Kolesnikov--Werner about a Talagrand type inequality for multiple even probability measures that involves the Wasserstein barycenter.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04437v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: It is the purpose of this article to compare various concepts of ``function spaces''. In particular we compare notions of the concept of Banach Function Spaces (in the spirit of Luxemburg-Zaanen) to the setting of solid BF-spaces as it is widely used in a number of papers in Time-Frequency Analysis or Coorbit Theory.
  More recently ball quasi-Banach function spaces come into the picture. In a way this note is a companion to the authors' article entitled ``Choosing Function Spaces in Harmonic Analysis'' (from 2015, February Fourier Talks at the Norbert Wiener Center, Vol.4) and the recent article by E.~Lorist and Z.Nieraeth, entitled ``Banach Function Spaces done right'' (Indag. Math., 2023). We restrict our attention to the Banach space case, avoiding the complications arising in the quasi-Banach case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2205.00279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The goal of this paper is to clarify when the solutions to stochastic partial differential equations stay close to a given subset of the state space for starting points which are close as well. This includes results for deterministic partial differential equations. As an example, we will consider the situation where the subset is a finite dimensional submanifold with boundary. We also discuss applications to mathematical finance, namely the modeling of the evolution of interest rate curves.</description>

Abstract: We present a unified representation of the most popular neural network activation functions. Adopting Mittag-Leffler functions of fractional calculus, we propose a flexible and compact functional form that is able to interpolate between various activation functions and mitigate common problems in training neural networks such as vanishing and exploding gradients. The presented gated representation extends the scope of fixed-shape activation functions to their adaptive counterparts whose shape can be learnt from the training data. The derivatives of the proposed functional form can also be expressed in terms of Mittag-Leffler functions making it a suitable candidate for gradient-based backpropagation algorithms. By training multiple neural networks of different complexities on various datasets with different sizes, we demonstrate that adopting a unified gated representation of activation functions offers a promising and affordable alternative to individual built-in implementations of activation functions in conventional machine learning frameworks.</description>

      <title>Convergence rate of Tsallis entropic regularized optimal transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2304.06616v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Tsallis entropic regularized optimal transport in the continuous setting and establish fundamental results such as the $\Gamma$-convergence of the Tsallis regularized optimal transport to the Monge--Kantorovich problem as the regularization parameter tends to zero. In addition, using the quantization and shadow arguments developed by Eckstein--Nutz, we derive the convergence rate of the Tsallis entropic regularization and provide explicit constants. Furthermore, we compare these results with the well-known case of the Kullback--Leibler (KL) divergence regularization and show that the KL regularization achieves the fastest convergence rate in the Tsallis framework.</description>

      <title>Groups without unitary representations, submeasures, and the escape property</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.11388</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.11388v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give new examples of topological groups that do not have non-trivial continuous unitary representations, the so-called exotic groups. We prove that all groups of the form $L^0(\phi, G)$, where $\phi$ is a pathological submeasure and $G$ is a topological group, are exotic. This result extends, with a different proof, a theorem of Herer and Christensen on exoticness of $L^0(\phi,\mathbb{R})$ for $\phi$ pathological. It follows that every topological group embeds into an exotic one. In our arguments, we introduce the escape property, a geometric condition on a topological group, inspired by the solution to Hilbert's fifth problem and satisfied by all locally compact groups, all non-archimedean groups, and all Banach--Lie groups. Our key result involving the escape property asserts triviality of all continuous homomorphisms from $L^0(\phi, G)$ to $L^0(\mu, H)$, where $\phi$ is pathological, $\mu$ is a measure, $G$ is a topological group, and $H$ is a topological group with the escape property.</description>

      <title>Integro-differential diffusion equations on graded Lie groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14125</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.14125v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We first study the existence, uniqueness and well-posedness of a general class of integro-differential diffusion equation on $L^p(\mathbb{G})$ $(1&lt;p&lt;+\infty$, $\mathbb{G}$ is a graded Lie group). We show the explicit solution of the considered equation by using the Fourier analysis of the group. The equation involves a nonlocal in time operator (with a general kernel) and a positive Rockland operator acting on $\mathbb{G}.$ Also, we provide $L^p(\mathbb{G})-L^q(\mathbb{G})$ $(1&lt;p\leqslant 2\leqslant q&lt;+\infty)$ norm estimates and time decay rate for the solutions. In fact, by using some contemporary results, one can translate the latter regularity problem to the study of boundedness of its propagator which strongly depends on the traces of the spectral projections of the Rockland operator. Moreover, in many cases, we can obtain time asymptotic decay for the solutions which depends intrinsically on the considered kernel. As a complement, we give some norm estimates for the solutions in terms of a homogeneous Sobolev space in $L^{2}(\mathbb{G})$ that involves the Rockland operator. We also give a counterpart of our results in the setting of compact Lie groups. Illustrative examples are also given.</description>

      <title>General solidity phenomena and anticoarse spaces for type $\mathrm{III}_1$ factors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18106v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: By developing a theory of anticoarse spaces in the purely infinite setting and using 1-bounded entropy techniques along with recent strong convergence results in random matrix theory, we show that free Araki--Woods factors offer the first examples of type $\mathrm{III}$ factors satisfying vastly general degrees of indecomposability phenomena. Notably this includes strong solidity with respect to any weakening of the normalizer currently in the literature and the Peterson--Thom property.</description>
