      <title>The Leavitt inverse semigroup of a separated graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16003</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16003v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce and study a new inverse semigroup associated to a separated graph $(E,C)$, which we call the \emph{Leavitt inverse semigroup}. This semigroup is obtained as a quotient of the separated graph inverse semigroup $\mathcal{S}(E,C)$, introduced in our previous paper [9], and it provides a canonical inverse semigroup model for the tame Leavitt path algebra $\mathcal{L}_K^\mathrm{ab}(E,C)$ over a commutative unital ring $K$.
  Our first main result describes the Leavitt inverse semigroup $\mathcal{LI}(E,C)$ as a restricted semidirect product of the free group on the edges of $E$ acting partially on a certain semilattice, which is isomorphic to the semilattice of idempotents of $\mathcal{LI}(E,C)$. This description, given in terms of Leavitt--Munn trees, yields a normal form for the elements of $\mathcal{LI}(E,C)$.
  We obtain a normal form for elements of $\mathcal{L}_K^\mathrm{ab}(E,C)$, leading to explicit linear bases for $\mathcal{L}_K^\mathrm{ab}(E,C)$. Building on this and on the structural properties of $\mathcal{LI} (E,C)$, we prove that the natural homomorphism from $\mathcal{LI}(E,C)$ to $\mathcal{L}_K^\mathrm{ab}(E,C)$ is injective, so that $\mathcal{LI}(E,C)$ embeds as the inverse semigroup generated by the canonical partial isometries in $\mathcal{L}_K^\mathrm{ab}(E,C)$. Further applications include the determination of natural bases of the kernel $\mathcal Q$ of the natural map from the tame Cohn algebra $\mathcal{C}_K^\mathrm{ab} (E,C)$ to the tame Leavitt path algebtra $\mathcal{L}_K^\mathrm{ab} (E,C)$, the computation of the socle, and a characterization of the isolated points of the spectrum. Several examples, such as the Cuntz separated graph and free separations, are discussed to illustrate the theory.</description>

      <title>Diagrammatic Hochschild cohomology via cohomology of categories, and incidence algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15835v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the Hochschild cohomology of diagrams of algebras introduced by Gerstenhaber and Schack and provide computations for filtrations of incidence algebras. Our aims are threefold: firstly, we revisit and explore the connection between the Gerstenhaber-Schack complexes and the Baues-Wirsching cohomology of categories. Secondly, we analyse the behaviour of (diagrammatic) Hochschild cohomology in the context of homological epimorphisms of algebras. Thirdly, we study diagrams of incidence algebras. In particular, as a main application, we compute the diagrammatic Hochschild cohomology of diagrams of incidence algebras associated to finite filtrations of simplicial complexes.</description>

      <title>Fundamental Theorems in the K-Theory of Gamma Semirings: Additivity, Localization, and D\'evissage</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15839v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Building on the Waldhausen and Quillen models of higher algebraic $K$-theory for exact categories and Waldhausen categories attached to a non-commutative $n$-ary $\Ga$-semiring $(T,\Ga)$, we establish the fundamental formal properties of $K$-theory in this $\Ga$-parametrised, slot-sensitive setting. For the exact/Waldhausen categories of finitely generated bi-positional $n$-ary $\Ga$-modules, perfect complexes in the derived category, and perfect quasi-coherent complexes on the non-commutative $\Ga$-spectrum $\SpecGnC{T}$, we prove Waldhausen Fibration and Additivity theorems and Quillen-type Localization for Serre and Waldhausen pairs. Under natural hypotheses on $\Ga$-stable filtrations we obtain d\'evissage and Approximation theorems, together with cofinality and Karoubi invariance, showing that idempotent completion does not change $K$-theory and that cofinal subcategories control $K_n$ in positive degrees. We further derive a Bass--Quillen fundamental triangle for polynomial extensions in the $n$-ary $\Ga$-context and prove nilpotent invariance for two-sided $\Ga$-ideals. In geometric terms, these results yield localization and Mayer--Vietoris sequences for the $K$-theory of $\Perf(X)$ on $X=\SpecGnC{T}$ and its admissible open covers. Altogether, the paper shows that the higher $K$-theory of non-commutative $n$-ary $\Ga$-semirings enjoys the same formal properties as in the classical ring and scheme cases, providing a robust foundation for subsequent computational and homotopy-theoretic applications.</description>

      <title>On finitude of the number of isomorphism classes in the category NT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15908v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The category $\bcalNT$ was defined in \cite{Lobos2}, it is a category whose objects are commutative nil graded algebras over a field, defined by presentation encoded by triangular matrices. A natural problem related to this category is to reach a complete classification up to isomorphism of its objects. Based in some results coming from \cite{Lobos2}, we can divide this problem by working with encoding matrices of a fixed size $n.$ In \cite{Lobos3} and \cite{Lobos4}, there are several advances for this search, in particular, in \cite{Lobos3} one can see that, for small matrices, the number of isomorphism classes seems to be finite and independent on the ground field. That fact, opened a series of questions related with the number of isomorphism classes and its relation with the ground field. At that point it was no clear, under which conditions of the ground field, this number could be finite. In this article, among other results, we prove that for each $n\geq4,$ the number of isomorphism classes is finite if and only if the ground field is finite.</description>

      <title>From affine algebraic racks to Leibniz algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15909v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce analogues of algebraic groups called algebraic racks, which are pointed rack objects in the category of schemes over a ground field. Addressing a problem of Loday, we construct a functor assigning a canonical Leibniz algebra to every affine algebraic rack. This functor recovers the Lie algebras of affine algebraic groups (via conjugation quandles) and the Leibniz algebras of algebraic Lie racks, and it is compatible with closed subracks and left ideals. We also compare properties of affine algebraic racks, commutative corack algebras, and their Leibniz algebras.</description>

      <title>Classification of real modules in monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a conjectural formula for the highest $\ell$-weight monomial of an arbitrary real module over a simply-laced quantum affine algebra. We verify the conjecture under a multiplicative reachability condition, answering the Hernandez--Leclerc classification problem in monoidal categorifications of cluster algebras under this condition. Moreover, we introduce the notion of cluster modules, generalizing Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules and Hernandez--Leclerc modules as special cases. We prove that cluster modules are reachable real modules, and obtain a system of equations governing $q$-characters of the prime cluster modules, providing a natural generalization of both the classical T-system relations for Kirillov--Reshetikhin modules and the exchange relations for Hernandez--Leclerc modules.</description>

      <title>Rota-Baxter operators on braces, post-braces and the Yang-Baxter equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16116v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Combining the notions of braces and relative Rota-Baxter operators on groups in connection with the Yang-Baxter equation and a factorization theorem of Lie groups from integrable systems, relative Rota-Baxter operators on braces and post-braces are introduced. A relative Rota-Baxter operator on a brace naturally induces a post-brace, and conversely, every post-brace determines a relative Rota-Baxter operator on its sub-adjacent brace. Furthermore, a post-brace yields two Drinfel'd-isomorphic solutions to the Yang-Baxter equation. As a special case, {\it enhanced} relative Rota-Baxter operators give rise to matched pairs of braces. Focusing on enhanced Rota-Baxter operators on two-sided braces, a corresponding factorization theorem is established. Examples are provided from the two-sided brace associated with the three-dimensional Heisenberg Lie algebra.</description>

      <title>Deformations of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16354</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.16354v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a complete description of the A$_\infty$ deformation theory of partially wrapped Fukaya categories of graded surfaces. We show that any abstract A$_\infty$ deformation is "geometric", namely it is equivalent to the partially wrapped Fukaya category of an orbifold surface obtained as a partial compactification of the original surface. For certain genus 0 surfaces, these deformations are generically Fukaya categories of compact pillowcases.
  We introduce the notion of a weak dual and use unbounded twisted complexes to overcome the curvature problem that naturally arises when some of the boundary components are fully wrapped.
  Our results provide a first account of the relationship between A$_\infty$ deformations of Fukaya categories and partial compactifications, as advocated in P. Seidel's ICM 2002 address, in the presence of stop data. All of our results also hold when the original surface has finitely many order 2 orbifold points.</description>

Abstract: We show that the monoids totM_{k,1} introduced by Birget and their generalizations tot nM_{k,r} which extend the Brin-Higman-Thompson groups, can be realized as the endomorphism monoids of higher-dimensional J\'onsson-Tarski algebras. We also show how elements of these monoids can be thought of as "rewrite rules". Using these representations, we show that the monoids are finitely presented.</description>

      <title>On K\"{o}the's normality question for locally finite-dimensional central division algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.14564v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper considers K\"{o}the's question of whether every associative locally finite-dimensional (abbr., LFD) central division algebra $R$ over a field $K$ is a normally locally finite (abbr., NLF) algebra over $K$, that is, whether every nonempty finite subset $Y$ of $R$ is contained in a finite-dimensional central $K$-subalgebra $\mathcal{R} _{Y}$ of $R$. It shows that the answer to the posed question is negative if $K$ is a purely transcendental extension of infinite transcendence degree over an algebraically closed field $k$. On the other hand, central division LFD-algebras over $K$ turn out to be NLF in the following special cases: (i) $K$ is a finitely-generated extension of a finite or a pseudo-algebraically closed perfect field $K _{0}$; (ii) $K$ is a higher-dimensional local field with last residue field equal to $K _{0}$.</description>

Abstract: We introduce a new point of view to present classical notions related to set-theoretic solutions of the Yang-Baxter equation: left skew braces, dirings, left skew rings. The idea is to replace the single multiplication on a left near-ring by two operations, one associative and the other left distributive. Two algebraic structures naturally appear: left skew rings and left weak rings, whose categories turn out to be canonically isomorphic.</description>

      <title>The Jordan canonical form of the Fr\'{e}chet derivative of a matrix function</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.08399v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $\mathbb{F}$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic $0$. Given a square matrix $A \in \mathbb{F}^{n \times n}$ and a polynomial $f \in \mathbb{F}[w]$, we determine the Jordan canonical form of the formal Fr\'{e}chet derivative of $f(A)$, in terms of that of $A$ and of $f$. When $\mathbb{F}\subseteq \mathbb{C}$, via Hermite interpolation, our result provides a solution to [N.J. Higham, \emph{Functions of Matrices: Theory and Computation}, Research Problem 3.11]. A generalization consists of finding the Jordan canonical form of linear combinations of Kronecker products of powers of two square matrices, i.e., $\sum_{i,j} a_{ij} (X^i \otimes Y^j)$. For this generalization, we provide some new partial results, including a partial solution under certain assumptions and general bounds on the number and the sizes of Jordan blocks.</description>

      <title>On the Hopf envelope of finite-dimensional bialgebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05821v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Hopf envelope of a bialgebra is the free Hopf algebra generated by the given bialgebra. Its existence, as well as that of the cofree Hopf algebra, is a well-known fact in Hopf algebra theory, but their construction is not particularly handy or friendly. In this note, we offer a novel realisation of the Hopf envelope and of the cofree Hopf algebra of a finite-dimensional bialgebra as a particular quotient and sub-bialgebra, respectively, of the bialgebra itself. Our construction can also be extended to the infinite-dimensional case, provided that the bialgebra satisfies additional conditions, such as being right perfect as an algebra or admitting a $n$-antipode, the latter being a notion hereby introduced. Remarkably, the machinery we develop also allows us to give a new description of the Hopf envelope of a commutative bialgebra and of the cofree cocommutative Hopf algebra of a cocommutative bialgebra.</description>
