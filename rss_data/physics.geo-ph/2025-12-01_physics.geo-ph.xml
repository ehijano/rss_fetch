      <title>Waveform-Based Probabilistic Seismic Hazard Analysis Using Ground-Motion Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22106</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22106v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA), the exceedance probability of a ground-motion intensity measure (IM) is typically evaluated. However, in recent years, dynamic response analyses using ground-motion time histories as input have been increasingly common in seismic design and risk assessment, and thus there is a growing demand for representing seismic hazard in terms of ground-motion waveforms. In this study, we propose a novel PSHA framework, referred to as waveform-based PSHA, that enables the direct evaluation of the probability distribution of ground-motion waveforms by introducing ground-motion models (GMMs) based on deep generative models (ground-motion generative models; GMGMs) into the PSHA framework. In waveform-based PSHA, seismic hazard is represented, in a Monte Carlo sense, as a set of ground-motion waveforms. We propose the formulation of such a PSHA framework as well as an algorithm for performing the required Monte Carlo simulations. Three different GMGMs based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) are constructed. After verifying the performance of each GMGM, hazard evaluations using the proposed method are conducted for two numerical examples: one assuming a hypothetical area source and the other assuming an actual site and source faults in Japan. We demonstrate that seismic hazard can be represented as a set of ground-motion waveforms, and that the IM-based hazard obtained from these waveforms is consistent with the results of conventional PSHA using GMMs. Finally, nonlinear dynamic response analyses of a building model are performed using the evaluated seismic hazard as input, and it is shown that exceedance probabilities of engineering demand parameters (EDPs) as well as hazard disaggregation with respect to EDPs can be carried out in a straightforward manner within the proposed framework.</description>

      <title>Disentangling the soil and atmospheric stress on carbon sequestration in a Mediterranean pine forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22720v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sequestration of atmospheric CO$_2$ in a Mediterranean semi-arid Aleppo Pine Forest (Pinus halepensis) close to the border of the semi-arid timberline was characterized and quantified under field conditions. Measurements of organic and inorganic CO$_2$ sequestration with gas exchange and stock counting approaches were made in both rainfed control (approximately 12$\%$ average annual soil moisture) and summer irrigated plots (approximately 24$\%$ annual average soil moisture), providing the opportunity to separate the effects of atmospheric water demand from soil water stress on the atmospheric CO$_2$ sequestration responses. Measurements yield an organic carbon sequestration (OCS) rate of approximately 550 g CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$, two-thirds in soil and one-third in biomass. In addition, measurements yield an inorganic carbon sequestration (ICS) rate of approximately 216 g CO$_2$ m$^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$; via calcite (CaCO$_3$) precipitation in the soil due to root exhalation of CO$_2$ (60$\%$) and microbial activity (40$\%$). The drip irrigated plot showed approximately 3 times higher organic CO$_2$ sequestration than the control plot. The organic sequestration is divided equally between the soil and the biomass. For the irrigated plot, the inorganic CO$_2$ was approximately 1.8 times higher than that of the control plot. However, for inorganic CO$_2$ sequestration, the soil moisture would need to be maintained lower than that of the study plot to preclude dissolving precipitated calcite. For many drylands, irrigation could be achieved by using fossil water reserves. These measured values demonstrate the relatively high potential carbon sequestration in Mediterranean drylands forests under irrigated and non-irrigated conditions.</description>

      <title>Influence of Fluid Rheology on Fluid Flow in a Natural Fracture Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22556v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-Newtonian rheology is widely acknowledged in subsurface fluids, yet its presence and effects are largely ignored in current fracture-flow studies. Here, we simulate fracture flow of non-Newtonian polymer solutions on a several metre-wide millimetre-aperture network of fractures, examining the complex interplay between fluid rheology, fracture geometry, and fluid inertia. Non-Newtonian fluid characteristics, including a yield stress and shear-thinning behaviour, are modelled using the Herschel-Bulkley-Papanastasiou approach. For the investigated flow rates, our Navier-Stokes simulations reveal significant viscosity variations, resulting in complex flow patterns at both aperture- and network scale. At low rates, non-yielded fluid forms rigid zones occupying up to ~65% of the network cross-sectional area, reducing fracture flow connectivity. At high rates, shear-thinning promotes inertia-dominated flow with circulations near fracture intersections. Regarding flow partitioning, yield stress confines flow to dominant pathways while shear-thinning promotes a broader fluid distribution as compared with a Newtonian fluid. Observed multimodal velocity distributions and nonlinear pressure drop-flow rate relationships underscore that fluid rheology must be considered during fracture-flow modelling.</description>

      <title>Super-resolution of satellite-derived SST data via Generative Adversarial Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22610</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22610v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we address the super-resolution problem of satellite-derived sea surface temperature (SST) using deep generative models. Although standard gap-filling techniques are effective in producing spatially complete datasets, they inherently smooth out fine-scale features that may be critical for a better understanding of the ocean dynamics. We investigate the use of deep learning models as Autoencoders (AEs) and generative models as Conditional-Generative Adversarial Networks (C-GANs), to reconstruct small-scale structures lost during interpolation. Our supervised -- model free -- training is based on SST observations of the Mediterranean Sea, with a focus on learning the conditional distribution of high-resolution fields given their low-resolution counterparts. We apply a tiling and merging strategy to deal with limited observational coverage and to ensure spatial continuity. Quantitative evaluations based on mean squared error metrics, spectral analysis, and gradient statistics show that while the AE reduces reconstruction error, it fails to recover high-frequency variability. In contrast, the C-GAN effectively restores the statistical properties of the true SST field at the cost of increasing the pointwise discrepancy with the ground truth observation. Our results highlight the potential of deep generative models to enhance the physical and statistical realism of gap-filled satellite data in oceanographic applications.</description>

      <title>Order-Disorder in Fe-Si Alloys: Implications for Seismic Anisotropy and Thermal Evolution of Earth's Inner Core</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22899</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22899v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding the structure and dynamics of Earth's inner core is essential for constraining its composition, thermal evolution, and seismic properties. Silicon is a probable major component of Earth's core. Using first-principles molecular dynamics and thermodynamic modeling, we investigate the structural, elastic, and transport properties of Fe-Si alloys at high pressures and temperatures. By computing the Gibbs free energies of B2, hcp, fcc, and bcc solid solutions, we construct the Fe-Si phase diagram applicable to the Earth's inner core. Our results reveal a pronounced miscibility gap between hcp and B2 Fe-Si, with the two phases coexisting over the compositional range of 6-11 wt% Si at 6000 K. The B2 Fe-Si alloy exhibits strong single-crystal shear anisotropy (22.9% at 6000 K) compared to the nearly isotropic hcp phase (0.6%), and yields a shear wave velocity (3.73 km/s) and Poisson's ratio consistent with seismological observations. Moreover, the computed transport properties reveal substantially lower thermal conductivity of B2 Fe-Si relative to pure iron or hcp Fe-Si under inner-core conditions. These results imply that Earth's inner core likely comprises multiple phases, whose distribution and crystallographic texture critically influence its seismic and thermal properties.</description>
