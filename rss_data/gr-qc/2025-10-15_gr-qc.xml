      <title>Floquet resonances and redshift-enhanced acceleration radiation from vibrating atoms in Schwarzschild spacetime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study acceleration radiation from a two-level Unruh-DeWitt detector that undergoes small-amplitude radial oscillations at fixed mean radius $R_0$ outside a Schwarzschild black hole. The massless scalar field is quantized in the Boulware vacuum to isolate curvature-modulated acceleration effects without a thermal Hawking background. Working in a (1+1) radial reduction and using first-order time-dependent perturbation, we evaluate the period-averaged transition rate (or the "Floquet" transition rate). The resulting particle emission spectrum exhibits a thermal Bose-Einstein-type profile with periodic trajectory yielding a Floquet resonance condition $n\Omega &gt; \omega_0$ and a closed-form expression for the Floquet transition rate $\overline{P}_n$ which reduces to the flat Minkowski spacetime result as $R_0\to\infty$. Near the horizon, $f(R_0)&lt;1$ enhances the effective Bessel argument by $1/\sqrt{f(R_0)}$, providing a simple analytic demonstration of curvature/redshift amplification of acceleration radiation. In particular, the spectrum weighted by Bessel function becomes ill-defined near the black hole horizon as $R_{0}\rightarrow 2M$, possibly manifesting the well-known pathological behavior of Boulware vacuum state. We discuss the regime of validity (small amplitude, $R_0$ away from the horizon) and outline the extensions to (3+1) dimensions, including density-of-states and greybody factors, and to alternative vacuum choices. Our results offer an analytically tractable link between flat-space "vibrating atom" proposals and black-hole spacetimes.</description>

      <title>Cosmology in the Hoyle Narlikar gravity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the late time cosmic acceleration of the Quintessence model within the framework of Hoyle Narlikar Gravity, consisting of a creation field. Using the Hubble tension as a function of the density parameter for matter, the density parameter for radiation, and the density parameter for dark energy in the covariant formulation, we find the gravitational field equations in the spatially flat, homogeneous, and isotropic spacetime to examine the dynamical mechanism that leads to cosmic acceleration in the late-time universe. We analyze the observational constraints on the late-time density parameters using various recent observational datasets, including the Hubble datasets, Pantheon+, and joint compilation, Pantheon++BAO. Consequently, it is explicitly demonstrated that late-time cosmic acceleration can be consistent with recent observational data in Hoyle Narlikar Gravity with non-minimal matter interaction. In contrast with other modified theories of gravity, it is observed that the creation field theory with non-minimal matter interaction renders more compact constraints on the Hubble tension together with density parameters, and extensively explains the accelerating expansion of the universe, which makes it a more plausible option compared to the {\Lambda}CDM model. Furthermore, the w dw phase analysis confirms alternating thawing and freezing behaviour of the model, with all trajectories ultimately converging toward the {\Lambda}CDM point, thereby confirming the model stability and the observational consistency.</description>

      <title>Black Hole Ringdown Amplitudescopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Black hole ringdowns in extensions of General Relativity (GR) generically exhibit two distinct signatures: (1) theory-dependent shifts in the standard black-hole quasinormal modes, and (2) additional modes arising from extra fundamental fields --such as scalar, vector, or tensor degrees of freedom-- that can also contribute to the gravitational-wave signal. As recently argued, in general both effects are present simultaneously, and accurately modeling them is essential for robust tests of GR in the ringdown regime. In this work, we investigate the impact of extra field-induced modes, which are often neglected in standard ringdown analyses, on the interpretation of gravitational-wave signals. To provide some concrete examples, we focus on dynamical Chern-Simons and Einstein-scalar-Gauss-Bonnet theories, well-motivated extensions of GR, characterized respectively by a parity-odd and a parity-even coupling between a dynamical scalar field and quadratic curvature invariants. We show that including extra field-induced modes improves the bounds on these theories compared to standard spectroscopy and also allows for equally constraining complementary tests not based on quasinormal mode shifts. Our analysis highlights the relevance of incorporating extra field-induced modes in ringdown templates and assesses their potential to either bias or enhance constraints on GR deviations.</description>

      <title>Quasinormal modes from numerical relativity with Bayesian inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Numerical relativity (NR) enables the study of physics in strong and dynamical gravitational fields and provides predictions for the gravitational-wave signals produced by merging black holes. Despite the impressive accuracy of modern codes, the resulting waveforms inevitably contain numerical uncertainties. Quantifying these uncertainties is important, especially for studies probing subdominant or nonlinear effects around the merger and ringdown. This paper describes a flexible Gaussian-process model for the numerical uncertainties in all the spherical-harmonic waveform modes across a state-of-the-art catalog of NR waveforms and a highly efficient procedure for sampling the posteriors of quasinormal mode models without the need for expensive Markov chain Monte Carlo. The Gaussian-process model is used to define a likelihood function which allows many Bayesian data analysis techniques - already widely used in the analysis of experimental gravitational wave data - to be applied to NR waveforms as well. The efficacy of this approach is demonstrated by applying it to the analysis of quasinormal modes in Cauchy-characteristic evolved waveforms.</description>

      <title>False Alarm Rates in Detecting Gravitational Wave Lensing from Astrophysical Coincidences: Insights with Model-Independent Technique GLANCE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11790v2 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The strong lensing gravitational waves (GWs) due to intervening massive astrophysical systems between the source and an observer are an inevitable consequence of the general theory of relativity, which can produce multiple GW events in overlapping sky localization error. However, the confirmed detection of such a unique astrophysical phenomenon is challenging due to several sources of contamination, arising from detector noise to astrophysical uncertainties. Robust model-independent search techniques that can mitigate noise contamination were developed in the past. In this study, we explore the astrophysical uncertainty associated with incorrectly classifying a pair of unlensed GW events as a lensed event, and the associated False Alarm Rate (FAR) depending on the GW source properties. To understand the effect of unlensed astrophysical GW sources in producing false lensing detections, we have performed a model-independent test using the pipeline GLANCE on a simulated population of merging binary-black holes (BBHs). We find that $\sim$ 0.01\% of the event pairs can be falsely classified as lensed with a lensing threshold signal-to-noise ratio of 1.5, appearing at a time delay between the event pairs of $\sim$ 1000 days or more. We show the FAR distribution for the parameter space of GW source masses, delay time, and lensing magnification parameter over which the model-independent technique GLANCE can confidently detect lensed GW pair with the current LIGO detector sensitivity. In the future, this technique will be useful for understanding the FAR of the upcoming next-generation GW detectors, which can observe many more GW sources.</description>

      <title>Black hole mergers beyond general relativity: a self-force approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11793</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11793v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational waves from binary black hole mergers provide a glimpse of gravitational dynamics in its most extreme observable regime, potentially enabling precision tests of general relativity (GR) and of the Kerr description of black holes. However, until recently, numerical simulations of black hole mergers have not been possible in theories beyond GR. While recent breakthroughs have overcome that obstacle, simulations covering the full, interesting range of binary parameters remain unfeasible. Here we present a new first-principles approach to this problem. We show how self-force theory can be used to model the merger and ringdown of black holes in a broad class of gravitational theories, assuming one object is much smaller than the other. We calculate self-force effects on the merger waveform for the first time, and we demonstrate how our formulation allows us to modularly compute beyond-GR effects and readily incorporate them into a fast merger-ringdown waveform model.</description>

      <title>Aspects of holographic complexity and volume of the black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11833</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11833v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study the complexity growth rate for Banados Teitlboim Zanelli, Schwarzschild, Reissner Nordstrom, and Kerr black holes using complexity-volume (CV) and complexity-action (CA) dualities and verify that it is proportional to the product of the horizon temperature and entropy of the black holes as conjectured by Susskind. Furthermore, we explore the variation in the complexity growth rate $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ under various physical processes, including the Penrose process, superradiance, particle accretion, and Hawking radiation, and demonstrate that $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ exhibits non-trivial behavior. Under the Penrose process and superradiance, $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ always increases, and under particle accretion, $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ can increase, remain zero, or decrease depending upon the direction of angular momentum of an infalling particle. For the cases of particle accretion, where we find $\delta \dot{\mathcal{C}}$ to be negative, we argue that for a reliable estimate, one has to take into account the contribution of the horizon dynamics of the perturbed black hole to the growth of its complexity.</description>

      <title>Shift vector symmetry in the Alcubierre warp drive spacetime geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11836</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11836v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work explores the set of coupled partial differential equations of the Einstein equations yielding vacuum solutions in the original Alcubierre warp drive metric with the cosmological constant. It is shown that under an appropriate ansatz they reveal a Burgers-type equation and a heat-type equation. These results indicate that the spacetime distortion carrying a mass particle at superluminal speeds, the Alcubierre warp bubble, may be interpreted as a geometric analog of a propagating shock front, which suggests a possible novel theoretical framework to deal with superluminal warp speeds.</description>

      <title>Lorentz Covariant Supertranslation Frames for the Angular Momentum Aspect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11849</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11849v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this letter, we review the well known ambiguity in defining angular momentum (and mass dipole) fluxes in general relativity and we reinterpret recent works that resolve the ambiguity by defining invariant charges. We resolve the ambiguity by finding the conditions that fix a frame for supertranslation and for space-time translation. We also present an elementary method for measuring the angular momentum aspect and work out explicitly the supertranslation frame-fixing conditions for the metric created by point particles to first nontrivial order in the Newton constant.</description>

      <title>Impact of facility timing and coordination for next-generation gravitational-wave detectors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: While the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer proposals for next-generation, ground-based detectors promise vastly improved sensitivities to gravitational-wave signals, only joint observations are expected to enable the full scientific potential of these facilities, making timing and coordination between the efforts crucial to avoid missed opportunities. This study investigates the impact of long-term delays on the scientific capabilities of next-generation detector networks. We use the Fisher information formalism to simulate the performance of a set of detector networks for large, fiducial populations of binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and primordial black-hole binaries. Bootstrapping the simulated populations, we map the expected observation times required to reach a number of observations fulfilling scientific targets for key sensitivity and localization metrics across various network configurations. We also investigate the sensitivity to stochastic backgrounds. We find that purely sensitivity-driven metrics such as the signal-to-noise ratio are not strongly affected by delays between facilities. This is contrasted by the localization metrics, which are very sensitive to the number of detectors in the network and, by extension, to delayed observation campaigns for a detector. Effectively, delays in one detector behave like network-wide interruptions for the localization metrics for networks consisting of two next-generation facilities. We examine the impact of a supporting, current-generation detector such as LIGO India operating concurrently with next-generation facilities and find such an addition will greatly mitigate the negative effects of delays for localization metrics, with important consequences on multi-messenger science and stochastic searches.</description>

      <title>Non-linear causal bulk viscosity in Unified Dark Matter Cosmologies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11900v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a bulk viscous unified dark matter scenario based on a nonlinear extension of the full causal Israel-Stewart theory. This framework allows the viscous fluid to remain far from equilibrium, an essential feature for a physically consistent description of viscosity-driven accelerated expansion. We adopt the standard parametrization for the bulk viscosity, $\xi = \xi_{0} \rho_{m}^{s}$, treating $s$ as a free parameter, and study the model in a spatially flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker background. By reformulating the cosmological equations as an autonomous dynamical system, we obtain both asymptotic analytical solutions and a numerical characterization of the phase space. At early times, the viscous component can mimic a stiff fluid, while at intermediate epochs it behaves like dark matter. With a suitable choice of dynamical variables, the system admits three distinct classes of late-time attractors. Two of them are separated by a basin-boundary saddle point: (i) a generic quintessence solution for $s = 1/2$, which encompasses a de Sitter-like behavior when $\xi_{0}$ satisfies a specific relation involving the nonlinear parameters; (ii) a global exact de Sitter attractor for $s &lt; 1/2$; and (iii) a phantom-like solution that emerges for $s \ge 1/2$. In contrast to the generic $s \ne 1/2$ case, the $s = 1/2$ scenario exhibits a qualitatively different stability structure, allowing de Sitter and phantom attractors to coexist. All solutions respect entropy production, and cosmic acceleration emerges independently of $\xi_{0}$, relaxing the strong bounds $\xi_{0} \sim \mathcal{O}(1)$ required in Eckart-based viscous models.</description>

      <title>Information paradox and island of covariant black holes in LQG</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study information paradox of four dimensional covariant black holes inspired by loop quantum gravity (LQG) with two well motivated solutions. We first prepare the spacetime in the Hartle-Hawking state, compute the radiation entropy and recover a linear growth at late time. When considering the mass loss and incorporating greybody factors, we show that for Solution~1 the LQG parameter $\zeta$ leaves temperature and Planckian factor of the spectrum unchanged but enhances the near-horizon barrier, leading to a faster evaporation rate as $M$ decreases. This behavior contrasts sharply with Solution~2, which has slow evaporation rate at small $M$ and admits a non-singular continuation suggestive of a remnant or a black-to-white-hole transition. We then apply the island prescription on the eternal background and find that quantum extremal surfaces exist in solution 1 geometries; $\zeta$ primarily shifts the island boundary and suppresses the late time entropy growth, preserving unitarity. Our results highlight that covariance-respecting LQG black hole do not exhibit a universal late time behavior.</description>

      <title>Phase space analysis of an exponential model in $f(Q)$ gravity including linear dark-sector interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a cosmological analysis of an exponential $f(Q)$ gravity model, within the dynamical systems formalism. Following the method introduced by B\"ohmer \textit{et al} [Universe \textbf{9} no.4, 166 (2023)], the modified Friedmann modified equations are successfully reduced to an autonomous system. Given the exponential form of $f(Q)$, the equilibrium conditions result in transcendental equations, which we approximate to identify the critical points. We therefore perform a general stability analysis of these points in terms of the model parameters. Finally, we extend the model by including a linear dark energy-dark matter interaction, where the equilibrium points are found with their stability properties. The model exhibits the three main domination epochs in the Universe, as well as a non-trivial impact on the late-time de Sitter attractor.</description>

      <title>Coexistence of Spectrally Stable and Unstable Modes in Black Hole Ringdowns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12135v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that a secondary potential barrier, forming a potential well outside the event horizon, can destabilize the Quasinormal Mode (QNM) spectrum of black holes. We find that spectral instability may persist even after the potential well vanishes, giving rise to a distinct family of spectrally unstable QNMs that differ from the spectrally stable modes localized near the potential peak and associated with the photon sphere. Nevertheless, time-domain simulations reveal that early-time ringdown waveforms remain dominated by stable modes, while unstable modes have only a subdominant contribution. These results highlight the robustness of black hole spectroscopy, as the observable ringdown signal is primarily governed by the most stable QNMs.</description>

      <title>The importance of being non-minimally coupled: scalar Hawking radiation from regular black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12257v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In curved space-time, a scalar field $\phi$ is generically expected to couple to curvature, via a coupling of the form $\xi\phi^2R$. Yet in the study of Hawking emission from regular black holes (RBHs), where scalar fields are often introduced as simple probes of the geometry, and the Ricci scalar is generically non-zero, this non-minimal coupling is almost always ignored. We revisit this assumption by studying scalar Hawking emission from four representative RBHs (the Bardeen, Hayward, Simpson-Visser, and D'Ambrosio-Rovelli space-times), within two benchmark cases: the conformal case $\xi=1/6$, and a large negative value $\xi=-10^4$ motivated by Higgs inflation. We compute the graybody factors and emission spectra, showing that the latter can be either enhanced or suppressed, even by several orders of magnitude. A crucial role is played by the sign of the term $\xi fR$, with $f(r)=-g_{tt}$ in Schwarzschild-like coordinates, as it determines whether the non-minimal coupling suppresses or enhances the geometric potential barrier. For the D'Ambrosio-Rovelli case with large negative $\xi$, the low-energy emission spectrum is enhanced by up to five orders of magnitude, since $\xi fR&lt;0$ throughout the space-time, leading to a deep potential well which broadens the transmissive window. The deviations we find can be particularly relevant in the case where primordial RBHs are dark matter candidates, given the impact of the non-minimal coupling on their evaporation history.</description>

      <title>Observational Constraints on Chaplygin Gas Models in Non-Minimally Coupled Power Law $f(Q)$ Gravity with Quasars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of $f(Q)$ gravity, where gravity emerges from non-metricity $Q$, we explore the cosmological implications of its non-minimal coupling to matter. Inspired by the recent success of Chaplygin gas models in explaining dark energy, we consider a background fluid composed of baryonic matter, radiation, and a family of Chaplygin gas variants namely Generalized Chaplygin Gas (GCG), Modified Chaplygin Gas (MCG), and Variable Chaplygin Gas (VCG). We constrain these models with three recent observational datasets: Observational Hubble Data (OHD), Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements, and Quasi-Stellar Objects (QSO) data. For the QSO dataset, we propose an analytical expression for errors in comoving distance to circumvent the reliance on Monte Carlo simulations. Using kinematic diagnostics such as the deceleration and jerk parameters and Om diagnostic, we assess deviations of the proposed models from $\Lambda$CDM. Our joint analysis of the three datasets reveals that the transition redshift from a decelerated to an accelerated expansion of the universe for the GCG, MCG and VCG models is $0.620^{+0.018}_{-0.017}$, $0.537^{+0.017}_{-0.017}$ and $0.470^{+0.012}_{-0.012}$ respectively, indicating a departure from $\Lambda$CDM.</description>

      <title>OCTOPUS: A Versatile, User-Friendly, and Extensible Public Code for General-Relativistic Ray-Tracing in Spherically Symmetric and Static Spacetimes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12585v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents OCTOPUS, a relativistic ray-tracing algorithm developed within a Fortran-based, OpenMP-accelerated framework, designed for asymptotically flat, spherically symmetric curved spacetimes. The code efficiently and accurately computes key relativistic features -- including the black hole event horizon, photon rings, critical curves, and innermost stable circular orbits -- and simulates black hole shadows, redshift factor distributions, accretion disk images, toroidal images, as well as gravitational lensing, light curves, and gravitational radiation from hot-spots. OCTOPUS provides an automated, modular solution for qualitative studies of black hole observables and multi-messenger correlations between electromagnetic and gravitational signals in curved spacetime. Its implementation requires only the metric potential and its first-, second-, and third-order radial derivatives as input, ensuring low user barriers while remaining highly extensible and adaptable. Using a Schwarzschild black hole surrounded by a Dehnen-type dark matter halo, we thoroughly validate the algorithm's precision, efficiency, and functionality, and investigate how dark matter halo parameters affect observational signatures. Our results demonstrate that increasing the scale and density of the dark matter halo strengthens the spacetime's gravitational field, an effect clearly reflected in black hole images and supported by hot-spot light curve signatures. A future version of OCTOPUS, with expanded capabilities for axisymmetric spacetimes, is planned for release.</description>

      <title>Hessian in the spinfoam models with cosmological constant</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12755</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12755v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a general method to prove the non-degeneracy of the Hessian in the spinfoam vertex amplitude for quantum gravity and apply it to the spinfoam models with a cosmological constant ($\Lambda$-SF models). By reformulating the problem in terms of the transverse intersection of some submanifolds in the phase space of flat ${\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{C})$ connections, we demonstrate that the Hessian is non-degenerate for critical points corresponding to non-degenerate, geometric 4-simplices in de Sitter or anti-de Sitter space. Non-degeneracy of the Hessian is an important necessary condition for the stationary phase method to be applicable. With a non-degenerate Hessian, this method not only confirms the connection of the $\Lambda$-SF model to semiclassical gravity, but also shows that there are no dominant contributions from exceptional configurations as in the Barrett-Crane model. Given its general nature, we expect our criterion to be applicable to other spinfoam models under mild adjustments.</description>

      <title>Dynamically generated tilt of isocurvature fluctuations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.11803v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Light scalar fields acquire isocurvature fluctuations during inflation. While these fluctuations could lead to interesting observable signatures at small scales, they are strongly constrained on large scales by cosmic microwave background observations. When the mass of the scalar is much lighter than the inflationary Hubble scale, $m\ll H_I$, the spectrum of these fluctuations is flat. Meanwhile, if $m\gg H_I$, the fluctuations are suppressed. A blue-tilted isocurvature spectrum which exhibits enhanced structure on small scales but avoids observational constraints on large scales therefore requires a coincidence of scales $m\sim H_I$ for a free massive scalar. In this Letter, we show that if a scalar field possesses a nontrivial potential, its inflationary dynamics naturally cause this condition to be satisfied, and so a blue-tilted spectrum is generically expected for a large class of potentials. Specifically, if its potential $V$ exhibits a region which satisfies the slow-roll condition $V''&lt;3H_I^2$, the scalar condensate will spend most of inflation close to the boundary of this region, so that its effective mass is typically close to $H_I$. The resulting blue tilt is inversely proportional to the number of $e$-folds of inflation prior to horizon crossing. If the scalar is long-lived, this mechanism leads to an attractor prediction for its relic abundance, which is insensitive to initial conditions of the scalar. In particular, a scalar field with quartic self-interactions can achieve the correct abundance to constitute all of the dark matter for a wide range of masses. We compute the relationship between the mass and self-coupling of quartic dark matter predicted by this mechanism.</description>

      <title>Non-conformally Einstein instantons in Conformal Gravity with and without nonlinear matter fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study non-conformally Einstein gravitational instantons in four-dimensional Conformal Gravity, both in vacuum and in the presence of nonlinear conformal matter. First, the one-parameter extension of the Kerr-NUT-AdS metric is analyzed. We obtain their conserved charges by using the Noether-Wald formalism. It turns out that they receive corrections from the linear modes present in Conformal Gravity, which are properly identified. Then, we perform the analytic continuation into the Euclidean section and find the curve in parameter space along which this solution becomes regular and globally (anti)-self-dual. Using the Dunajski-Tod theorem, we show that the metric is not conformally Einstein. Then, the backreaction of nonlinear conformal matter is considered. In particular, we find new gravitational instantons in the presence of conformally coupled scalar fields and ModMax electrodynamics. We compute the partition function and conserved charges, which turn out to be finite by virtue of the conformal invariance of the theory. As a byproduct, we also obtain a generalization of the Riegert metric dressed with nonlinear conformal matter as a particular limit of these instantons. For all cases, we analyze the global properties, the curve in parameter space where the solutions are (anti)-self-dual, and the on-shell Euclidean action, among other features.</description>

      <title>New Tests of Low-Scale Quantum Gravity with Cosmic-Ray Collisions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.11879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cosmic ray collisions at high center of mass energy could enable graviton and black hole production as expected in theories of low-scale quantum gravity, such as extra-dimensions, many species, or some versions of string theory. Here we propose three novel phenomenological tests of these theories. We first consider the collision of cosmic rays with ambient protons, electrons and photons in Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), finding that high-energy neutrino data from the blazar TXS 0506+056 places a constraint on the fundamental scale of gravity of $M_f \gtrsim 0.3$ TeV, and future high-energy neutrino data could raise this bound to $M_f \gtrsim 200$ TeV. We then point out that collisions of pairs of cosmic rays could occur at a sizable rate in AGN where the accelerated cosmic rays are not collimated, or on supermassive black hole binaries. This consideration could potentially let us test unprecedented large fundamental scales of $M_f \gtrsim 2$ PeV. We further compute the corresponding thermal neutrino emission arising from the Hawking evaporation of black holes produced in cosmic ray collisions, finding a spectrum that clearly differs from that expected in meson decays. Finally, we speculate with an scenario which would produce high-energy neutrino and gamma-ray emission from regions in the sky where no multi-wavelength counterparts would be expected, via graviton propagation from a different brane, which then decays in our Universe.</description>

      <title>Holographic Turbulence and the Fractal Dimension of the Turbulent Horizon</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12198v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study two-dimensional turbulence driven by a scalar operator within the framework of the AdS/CFT correspondence, where the external driving source is used to sustain a quasi-steady turbulent state. We numerically construct dynamical and spatially inhomogeneous turbulent black holes in the asymptotically $\mathrm{AdS}_4$ spacetime by solving the full nonlinear equations of motion in the Bondi-Sachs formalism. The inverse energy cascade and the corresponding energy spectrum of both decaying and driven turbulence are analyzed. The scalar driving leads to a compressible energy dominated flow, and the corresponding scaling power laws agree well with previous simulations of two-dimensional turbulence in compressible fluids. Furthermore, we take a direct estimate of the fractal structure of the turbulent black hole, obtaining a fractal dimension $D\approx2.65$, which matches the result from simulating the boundary conformal fluid.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.12373v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Generic solutions are studied in Einstein-scalar gravity in an ansatz that can interpolate between de Sitter and Anti-de Sitter regimes. The scalar potential is arbitrary. All solutions are determined by their end-points in the scalar field space. All such end-points are classified. This provides a complete classification and characterization of the full space of regular solutions. It is shown that there are no regular (Centaur) solutions that interpolate between an AdS boundary and a dS interior, within our ansatz, when $d&gt;2$. This no-go theorem persists in the presence of multiple scalar fields with a non-trivial field space metric. The Gubser classification of regular solutions is also upgraded to include cases that are not Lorentz invariant and do not contain AdS boundaries.</description>

      <title>Semi-Global Existence and Trapped Surface Formation for the Einstein-Vlasov System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12429v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove a large-data semi-global existence theorem and the dynamical formation of trapped surfaces for the Einstein-massless Vlasov system in 3+1 dimensions, without any symmetry assumptions. The analysis critically hinges on a finely calibrated hierarchy of estimates for the Weyl curvature, Ricci coefficients, and velocity moments of the distribution function, designed to capture the delicate interaction between the geometric and kinetic structures of the coupled system. The presence of the Vlasov field introduces significant analytic challenges, both in terms of integrability and regularity. These are circumvented through a refined renormalization of the Ricci coefficients, a strategic restriction of the need for the elliptic estimates to a minimal number of Ricci coefficients, and a precise commutator calculus adapted to the geometry of the mass-shell of the tangent bundle of the dynamical spacetime. The results constitute the first large-data, symmetry-free construction of dynamical black hole formation in the context of kinetic matter. Beyond its immediate application to the Einstein-Vlasov system in regimes of strong gravitational interaction and absence of symmetry, we anticipate that this framework will prove useful in a broader context, including, for instance, simplified approaches to the proof of nonlinear stability of Minkowski spacetime with massless Vlasov matter</description>

      <title>Alleviating the $H_0$ tension through new interacting dark energy model in light of DESI DR2</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12627</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12627v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The $H_0$ tension has become one of the most significant challenges in modern cosmology. The recent DESI DR2 data has shown a significant preference for dynamical dark energy, yet this has further exacerbated the $H_0$ tension. In this work, we explore the potential of new interacting dark energy models ($\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM and $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM) to alleviate the $H_0$ tension. We perform observational constraints using the latest baryon acoustic oscillation data from DESI DR2, cosmic microwave background (CMB) data from Planck and Atacama Cosmology Telescop, and type Ia supernova data from DESY5 and PantheonPlus, as well as the SH0ES data. From our analysis, we observe the dynamical scale parameter of the cosmological constant, $\delta_{\Lambda} = -0.410^{+0.140}_{-0.120}$, in the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model using the CMB+DESI+SH0ES data, which deviates from $\Lambda$CDM at the $3.2\sigma$ level. Due to the anti-correlation between $\delta_{\Lambda}$ and $H_0$, a negative $\delta_{\Lambda}$ results in a higher inferred $H_0$. Consequently, we obtain $H_0 = 71.90 \pm 1.00~\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$, reducing the $H_0$ tension to $0.8\sigma$. Even without SH0ES, the CMB+DESI data alone still alleviate the $H_0$ tension to $1.7\sigma$. Overall, the $e\widetilde{\Lambda}$CDM model not only deviates from the $\Lambda$CDM model but also demonstrates a significant capability to alleviate the $H_0$ tension.</description>

      <title>GEFF: The Gradient Expansion Formalism Factory - A tool for inflationary gauge-field production</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.12644v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The GEFF - the Gradient Expansion Formalism Factory - is a new Python package designed to study gauge-field production during inflation. The package provides a framework to implement and use the gradient expansion formalism (GEF), a numerical technique devised to study the nonlinear dynamics associated with inflationary gauge-field generation. The GEF has already been applied in the context of axion inflation, and with the GEFF package, one can build on these results. The GEFF gives users access to ready-to-use model files for two scenarios of axion inflation: pure axion inflation, with the inflaton coupled to a pure Abelian gauge sector, and fermionic axion inflation, which assumes that the Standard Model (SM) hypercharge field is coupled to the inflaton, resulting in the production SM fermions via the Schwinger effect. The GEFF provides the user with methods to solve GEF equations, including an integrated error estimator and self-correction algorithm. Furthermore, users can implement their own GEF models, e.g., variations of axion inflation or related scenarios. The package also comes with tools to study the production of primordial gravitational waves induced by gauge fields. This is a starting guide for the GEFF, providing a high-level introduction to the GEF, installation instructions, and the basics for using this package.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.02362v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The holographic entropy bound is discussed in cosmology. Inspired by the work of Fischler and Susskind [hep-th/9806039], we aim to define a special class of spherical systems in cosmology, within which the entropy of matter remains compliant with the holographic entropy bound throughout the evolution of the universe, irrespective of the universe's components. It is found that if the entropy of matter per unit co-moving volume is bounded from above, such a special class of spherical systems indeed exists. Moreover, the matter contained within a unit co-moving volume can be replaced by a black hole of the same mass-energy. Provided that the entropy of the black hole consistently exceeds that of the matter it replaces, there is also a unified definition for these special spherical systems.</description>

      <title>Emergent Cosmological Expansion in Scalar-Tensor Theories of Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.01397v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the emergence of large-scale cosmological expansion in scalar-tensor theories of gravity. This is achieved by modelling sub-horizon regions of space-time as weak-field expansions around Minkowski space, and then subsequently joining many such regions together to create a statistically homogeneous and isotropic cosmology. We find that when the scalar field can be treated perturbatively, the cosmological behaviour that emerges is well modelled by the Friedmann solutions of the theory. When non-perturbative screening mechanisms occur this result no longer holds, and in the case of scalar fields subject to the chameleon mechanism we find significant deviations from the expected Friedmann behaviour. In particular, the screened mass no longer contributes to the Klein-Gordon equation, suppressing deviations from general relativistic behaviour.</description>

      <title>Cosmological Evolution of Viscous Dark Energy in f(Q,C) Gravity: Two-Fluid Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00910</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.00910v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the cosmological evolution of a viscous dark energy model within the framework of $f(Q, C)$ gravity, utilizing a two-fluid approach. The model incorporates non-metricity and boundary contributions to the total action, represented by the scalar quantities $Q$ and $C$. The viscosity in the dark energy fluid is modeled to understand the impact of bulk viscosity on cosmic expansion and the late-time acceleration of the universe. We derive the field equations using the modified FLRW metric and analyze the behavior of key cosmological parameters, including the energy density, pressure, and the equation of state (EoS) parameter. The effective EoS parameter is also studied in the context of cosmic evolution. We impose observational constraints on the Hubble parameter $H(z)$ using recent datasets from DESI-Y1, SDSS-IV, Pantheon+ (without SHOES calibration), and cosmic chronometer measurements. The analysis shows that the model effectively describes the universe's expansion history and predicts a transition from deceleration to acceleration, consistent with observational data. This model also provides an alternative explanation for cosmic acceleration without the need for a cosmological constant.</description>

      <title>Is graviton shot noise detectable?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06694v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Direct detection of gravitons in gravitational experiments, including gravitational wave observatories, has been all but ruled out given the weak coupling between the gravitational field and matter. Here we propose an alternative: looking not for the presence but for the absence of graviton shot noise in gravitational wave data. Gravitational wave experiments detect very weak signals that correspond to a surprisingly small number of gravitons even at the relatively low frequencies that characterize signals from gravitational wave events. A detailed calculation, which also yields results that are consistent with the existing literature, demonstrates that graviton shot noise may be present at detectable levels in gravitational wave observations. The absence of elevated noise levels due to graviton shot noise, in turn, would indicate that gravity is not a quantum field theory with a conventional perturbative expansion at low energies.</description>

      <title>On the Cutoff Scale Identification of FLRW Cosmology in Asymptotically Safe Gravity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.15288v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We examine Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker cosmology, incorporating quantum gravitational corrections through the functional renormalization group flow of the effective action for gravity. We solve the Einstein equation with quantum improved coupling perturbatively including the case with non-vanishing classical cosmological constant (CC) which was overlooked in the literatures. We discuss what is the suitable identification of the momentum cutoff $k$ with time scale, and find that the choice of the Hubble parameter is suitable for vanishing CC but not so for non-vanishing CC. We suggest suitable identification in this case. The energy-scale dependent running coupling breaks the time translation symmetry and then introduces a new physical scale.</description>

      <title>Characterized behaviors of black hole thermodynamics in the supercritical region</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04995v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The comprehension of universal thermodynamic behaviors in the supercritical region is crucial for examining the characteristics of black hole systems under high temperature and pressure. This study is devoted to the analysis of characteristic lines and crossover behaviors within the supercritical region. By making use of the free energy, we introduce three key thermodynamic quantities: scaled variance, skewness, and kurtosis. Our results demonstrate that the Widom line, associated with the maximal scaled variance, can effectively differentiate between small and large black hole-like subphases, each displaying distinct thermodynamic behaviors within the supercritical region. Furthermore, by utilizing quasinormal modes, we identify the Frenkel line, offering a dynamic perspective to distinguish between small and large black hole-like subphases. These contribute to a deeper comprehension of black hole subphases in the supercritical region, thus illuminating new facets of black hole thermodynamics.</description>

      <title>Deciphering signatures of Kerr-Sen black holes in presence of plasma from the Event Horizon Telescope data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09443v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The present work explores the role of the dilaton charge $r_2$ and the plasma environment in explaining the observed images of M87* and Sgr A*. Dilaton charges are associated with Kerr-Sen black holes, the stationary, axi-symmetric black hole solution in the Einstein-Maxwell-dilaton-axion (EMDA) gravity which arise in the low energy effective action of superstring theories. We investigate the impact of the background spacetime (here dilaton charge and spin) and the plasma environment in modifying the shape and size of the black hole shadow. The theoretically derived shadow is compared with the observed images of M87* and Sgr A* which enable us to constrain the background spacetime in presence of the plasma environment. { Our analysis reveals that the shadow of M87* favors the Kerr scenario and rules out $r_2&gt;0.48$, while the shadow of Sgr A* exhibits a marginal preference towards the Kerr-Sen scenario (although GR is allowed within 1-$\sigma$) and rules out $r_2&gt;1$. Thus, large values of dilaton charge are disfavored for M87* and Sgr A* and this result holds good irrespective of the inhomogeneous plasma environment. Moreover, the shadows of M87* and Sgr A* rule out very dense inhomogeneous plasma environments surrounding these objects but the plasma density is further constrained from the electron number density and accretion rate estimates. As a consequence, with the current level of precision of the shadow related data we cannot distinguish between the Kerr and mildly charged Kerr-Sen black holes. }</description>

Abstract: We analyze the conformal Einstein equation with a positive cosmological constant to extract fall-off conditions of the gravitational fields. The fall-off conditions are consistent with a finite, non-trivial presymplectic current on the future boundary of de Sitter. Hence our result allows a non-zero gravitational flux across the boundary of the de Sitter. We present an explicit gauge-free computation to show that the Gibbons-Hawking boundary term, counterterm in the action, and fall-off condition of gravitational field in conformal Einstein equation are crucial to reproduce the finite symplectic flux.</description>

Abstract: In spherical symmetry, gravitational collapse of dust may give rise to the so-called shell-crossing singularities, beyond which spacetime can be extended using weak solutions to the integrated version of the equations of motion. We argue that the paradigm of weak solutions is ill-suited for dynamical extension beyond shell crossings through shock waves because it is based implicitly on an assumption that turns out to be unphysical for the shock and leads to the unwanted prospect of shock waves of dust particles moving faster than light.</description>

      <title>On the Identification of Exotic Compact Binaries with Gravitational Waves: a Phenomenological approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.16380v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Gravitational wave (GW) astronomy has been hailed as a gateway to discovering unexpected phenomena in the universe. Over the last decade there have been close to one hundred GW observations of compact-binary mergers. While these signals are largely consistent with mergers of binary black holes, binary neutron stars, or black hole-neutron star systems, some events suggest the intriguing possibility of binaries involving exotic compact objects (ECOs). Identifying and characterising an ECO merger would require accurate ECO waveform models. Using large numbers of numerical relativity simulations to develop customised models for ECO mergers akin to those used for binary black holes, would be not only computationally expensive but also challenging due to the limited understanding of the underlying physics. Alternatively, key physical imprints of the ECO on the inspiral or merger could in principle be incorporated phenomenologically into waveform models, sufficient to quantify generic properties. In this work we present a first application of this idea to assess the detectability and distinguishability of ECO mergers, and we propose a phenomenological approach that can iteratively incorporate features of ECO mergers, laying the groundwork for an effective exotic compact object identifier in compact binary coalescences. Using Bayesian parameter estimation on the data for the GW event GW150914, we find the inferred compactness to be consistent with that expected for black holes, within this framework. The efficacy of the identifier can be refined by adding information from numerical relativity simulations involving fundamental fields. Conversely, such an identifier framework can help focus future numerical relativity and modeling efforts for exotic objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.00640v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the cosmological dynamics induced by nonlinear electrodynamics in a homogeneous and isotropic universe, focusing on the role of primordial electromagnetic fields with random spatial orientations. Building upon a generalization of the Tolman-Ehrenfest averaging procedure, we derive a modified energy-momentum tensor consistent with the spacetime symmetries, incorporating the influence of the dual invariant G and its statistical contributions. A specific nonlinear electrodynamics model with quadratic corrections to Maxwell's Lagrangian is considered, giving rise to what we define as a quasi-magnetic universe, interpolating between purely magnetic and statistically null field configurations. We analyze the resulting cosmological dynamics through qualitative methods. By casting the equations into autonomous dynamical systems, we identify the equilibrium points, determine their stability, and study the behavior of solutions under various spatial curvatures. Our findings reveal the existence of bouncing and cyclic solutions, regions where energy conditions are violated, and scenarios of accelerated expansion. Special attention is given to two limiting cases, both of which exhibit qualitatively distinct phase portraits and energy-condition behavior. This work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the influence of nonlinear electromagnetic fields in the early universe and opens avenues for exploring their observational consequences</description>

      <title>Accelerated inference of binary black-hole populations from the stochastic gravitational-wave background</title>

Abstract: Third-generation ground-based gravitational wave detectors are expected to observe $\mathcal{O}(10^5)$ of overlapping signals per year from a multitude of astrophysical sources that will be computationally challenging to resolve individually. On the other hand, the stochastic background resulting from the entire population of sources encodes information about the underlying population, allowing for population parameter inference independent and complementary to that obtained with individually resolved events. Parameter estimation in this case is still computationally challenging, as computing the power spectrum involves sampling $\sim 10^5$ sources for each set of hyperparameters describing the binary population. In this work, we build on recently developed importance sampling techniques to compute the SGWB efficiently and train neural networks to interpolate the resulting background. We show that a multi-layer perceptron can encode the model information, allowing for significantly faster inference. We test the network assuming an observing setup with CE and ET sensitivities, where for the first time we include the intrinsic variance of the SGWB in the inference, as in this setup it presents a dominant source of measurement noise.</description>

Abstract: The thermodynamic inconsistency observed in regular black holes is resolved through the framework of reduced thermodynamic phase spaces. We demonstrate that regular black holes are essentially induced from singular black holes by adding an extra requirement, which imposes a constraint among black hole parameters. This constraint reduces the thermodynamic phase space, rendering the standard form of the first law of black hole thermodynamics inapplicable. Accordingly, we propose a novel methodology to study the thermodynamic properties of regular black holes. Thermodynamic quantities must be defined in the full, unconstrained thermodynamic phase space of the underlying singular black holes, only afterward is the constraint imposed to derive the consistent and meaningful thermodynamic quantities of the regular black holes. Crucially, this framework extends beyond regular black holes and applies universally to any black hole with this kind of constraint.</description>

Abstract: The experimental verification of the quantum nature of gravity represents a milestone in quantum gravity research. Recently, interest has grown for testing it via gravitationally induced entanglement (GIE). Here, we propose a space-based interferometer inspired by the LISA Pathfinder (LPF). Our design employs two kg-scale gold-platinum test masses which, unlike in the LPF, are surrounded by a shield below 1 K and positioned side-by-side with a centimeter-scale separation. This configuration enables the detection of GIE through simultaneous measurements of differential and common-mode motions. To estimate the integration time required for GIE detection, we simulate quantum measurements of these modes, considering noise sources such as gas damping, black-body radiation, and cosmic-ray collisions. Our results show that GIE can be demonstrated with a few modifications to the LPF setup.</description>

      <title>Estimating High-Order Time Derivatives of Kerr Orbital Functionals</title>

      <description>arXiv:2508.08888v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functions of bound Kerr geodesic motion play a central role in many calculations in relativistic astrophysics, ranging from gravitational-wave generation to self-force and radiation-reaction modeling. Although these functions can be expressed as a Fourier series using the geodesic fundamental frequencies, reconstructing them in coordinate time is challenging due to the coupling of the radial and polar motions. In this paper, we compare two strategies for performing such reconstructions and their ability to estimate high-order coordinate-time derivatives of the orbital functional. The first method maps Fourier coefficients from Mino to coordinate time; the second method fits a sampled time series of the function to a truncated coordinate-time Fourier series. While the latter method is prone to overfitting, it yields more accurate reconstructions and derivatives than the mapping, but completely misrepresents the harmonic content of the orbital functional. For the purpose of accurate coordinate-time derivative estimation, we propose a hybrid method: fit for the Mino-time coefficients, differentiate with respect to Mino time, then convert to coordinate time. Applied to the mass quadrupole of a generic Kerr geodesic, this hybrid method recovers the sixth derivative with a fractional residual $\sim10^{-6}$ using only two harmonics. For orbital functionals that depend explicitly on the geodesic orbit expressed in Boyer--Lindquist coordinates, we also provide a recursive procedure for computing coordinate-time derivatives using exact analytic expressions. These results offer a general framework for accurately evaluating high-order time derivatives along Kerr geodesic worldlines, with direct relevance to applications such as extreme-mass-ratio inspiral kludge waveform modeling, where such derivatives are key ingredients for precise gravitational-wave predictions.</description>

Abstract: We present a proof of the reverse isoperimetric inequality -- a central conjecture in extended black hole thermodynamics -- for black holes in Einstein gravity with $D \geq 4$, employing a two-pronged geometric-analytic method. Our analysis shows that the reversal of the usual isoperimetric inequality originates from the structure of curved backgrounds governed by Einstein's equations, thereby underscoring the fundamental role of gravity in the reverse isoperimetric property of AdS black hole horizons.</description>

      <title>Splitting the Gravitational Atom: Instabilities of Black Holes with Synchronized/Resonant Hair</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.20450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Black holes (BHs) with synchronized bosonic hair challenge the Kerr paradigm, linking superradiance from ultralight fields -- creating gravitational atoms -- to bosonic stars across parameter space. In the ''very hairy'' regime, where a small horizon lies inside a bosonic star containing most of the energy, they deviate sharply from Kerr, but their dynamics remain unexplored. We show that for such solutions the horizon gets naturally ejected from the center of its scalar environment, and observe a similar dynamics in a cousin model of BHs with resonant scalar hair, albeit with a different fate. This dynamical splitting is likely to be generic for sufficiently hairy BHs in the broader class of models with synchronized or resonant hair, but possible exceptions may exist.</description>

      <title>Some inequalities among curvature invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.22187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We prove an infinite sequence of inequalities among scalar polynomial invariants of symmetric rank-2 tensors of Segre type A1, A3, and B. In particular, these inequalities apply to the Ricci tensor and the energy-momentum tensor. We use one of them to generalize the known relation between the second Ricci invariant and the Kretschmann scalar.</description>

      <title>GW250114 reveals black hole horizon signatures</title>

Abstract: The horizon of a black hole, the "surface of no return," is characterized by its rotation frequency $\Omega_H$ and surface gravity $\kappa$. A striking signature is that any infalling object appears to orbit at $\Omega_H$ due to frame dragging, while its emitted signals decay exponentially at a rate set by $\kappa$ as a consequence of gravitational redshift. Recent theoretical work predicts that the merger phase of gravitational waves from binary black hole coalescences carries direct imprints of the remnant horizon's properties, via a "direct wave" component that (i) oscillates near $2\Omega_H$, reflecting the horizon's frame dragging and the quadrupole nature of the gravitational radiation, and (ii) decays at an increasing rate characterized by $\kappa$, with additional screening from the black hole's potential barrier. In this paper, we report observational evidence for the direct wave in GW250114 with a matched-filter signal-to-noise ratio of $14.0^{+0.2}_{-0.1}$ ($13.5^{+0.1}_{-0.2}$) in the LIGO Hanford (Livingston) detector. The measured properties are in full agreement with theoretical predictions. These findings establish a new observational channel to directly measure frame-dragging effects in black hole ergospheres and explore (near-)horizon physics in dynamical, strong-gravity regimes.</description>

      <title>Fermionic Love number of Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10036v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The tidal deformation of compact objects, characterised by their Love numbers, provides insights into the internal structure of neutron stars and black holes. While bosonic tidal Love numbers vanish for black holes in general relativity, it has been recently revealed that fermionic tidal perturbations can induce non-zero Love numbers for Kerr black holes. In this paper, we investigate the response of the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black hole to the fermionic Weyl field. As a result, we find that the corresponding fermionic tidal Love numbers are also non-vanishing for the Reissner-Nordstr\"om black holes except for the extremal ones, which highlights the universal distinct behavior of the fermionic tidal Love numbers compared to the bosonic counterparts.</description>

      <title>Hunting Primordial Black Hole Dark Matter in Lyman-$\alpha$ Forest</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.10617</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.10617v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A very pressing question in contemporary physics is the identity of Dark Matter (DM). Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) are one of the most well-motivated DM candidates. Light PBHs have been constrained by either the non-detection of their Hawking radiation itself, or by the non-observation of any measurable effects of this radiation on astrophysical and cosmological observables. We constrain the PBH contribution to the DM density by non-detection of their Hawking radiation's effect on the intergalactic medium (IGM) temperature evolution. We use the latest deductions of IGM temperature from Lyman-$\alpha$ forest observations. We put constraints on the fraction of DM as PBHs with masses $5 \times 10^{15}$ g - $10^{17}$ g, separately for spinning and non-spinning BHs. We derive constraints by dealing with the heating effects of the astrophysical reionization sources on the IGM in two ways. In one way, we completely neglect this heating due to astrophysical sources, thus giving us weaker constraints, but completely robust to the reionization history of the universe. In the second way, we utilise some modelling of the ionization and temperature history, and use it to derive more stringent constraints. We find that for non-spinning PBHs of mass $10^{16}$ g, the current measurements can constrain the PBH-density to be $\lesssim$ 0.1\% of the total DM. We find that these constraints are competitive, and hence provide a new observable to probe the nature of PBH DM. The systematics affecting Lyman-$\alpha$ forest measurements are different from other constraining observations, and thus this is a complementary probe.</description>

      <title>Enhancing the reliability of machine learning for gravitational wave parameter estimation with attention-based models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10486</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10486v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a technique to enhance the reliability of gravitational wave parameter estimation results produced by machine learning. We develop two independent machine learning models based on the Vision Transformer to estimate effective spin and chirp mass from spectrograms of gravitational wave signals from binary black hole mergers. To enhance the reliability of these models, we utilize attention maps to visualize the areas our models focus on when making predictions. This approach enables demonstrating that both models perform parameter estimation based on physically meaningful information. Furthermore, by leveraging these attention maps, we demonstrate a method to quantify the impact of glitches on parameter estimation. We show that as the models focus more on glitches, the parameter estimation results become more strongly biased. This suggests that attention maps could potentially be used to distinguish between cases where the results produced by the machine learning model are reliable and cases where they are not.</description>

      <title>Leading soft theorems on plane wave backgrounds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.09314v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The infrared singularities of scattering amplitudes have historically contributed to much development in understanding fundamental structures in physics. However, the fate of the leading soft singularities of amplitudes in non-trivial background fields has remained largely unknown. In this paper, we derive the leading soft theorems for photons, gluons and gravitons on generic plane wave backgrounds in gauge theory and gravity. The results differ from the flat space results through dependence on the initial conditions of the soft mediator. We also consider the special case of self-dual plane wave backgrounds, and match onto the flat space results when the background is treated perturbatively.</description>

      <title>Classical-quantum systems breaking conservation laws</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.15291v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Whether gravity must be quantized remains one of the biggest open problems in fundamental physics. Classical-quantum hybrid theories have recently attracted attention as a possible framework in which gravity is treated classically yet interacts consistently with quantum matter. Schemes based on completely positive dynamics satisfy most formal consistency requirements and enable a systematic treatment of quantum backreaction, but they also give rise to features that challenge conventional physical intuition, such as the breakdown of conservation laws. To illustrate this issue, we consider a qubit interacting with a classical particle and demonstrate that the corresponding hybrid system violates angular momentum conservation despite the rotational symmetry of the underlying equations of motion. This provides an explicit example of a fully closed, rotationally invariant classical-quantum system with completely positive dynamics that violates a conservation law.</description>

Abstract: We utilize various computational techniques in flat and curved backgrounds to calculate the classical gravitational Compton amplitude up to the second post-Minkowskian order. Our novel result supports the use of worldline quantum field theory in non-trivial background spacetimes to obtain new theoretical insights that can both enhance computational efficiency and provide useful cross-checks of results, particularly in the context of classical binary black hole mergers.</description>

      <title>Prospects for probing dark matter particles and primordial black holes with the Square Kilometre Array using the 21 cm power spectrum at cosmic dawn</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02651v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Probing the nature of dark matter (DM) remains an outstanding problem in modern cosmology. The 21 cm signal, as a sensitive tracer of neutral hydrogen during cosmic dawn, provides a unique means to investigate DM nature during this critical epoch. Annihilation and decay of DM particles, as well as Hawking radiation of primordial black holes (PBHs), can modify the thermal and ionization histories of the early universe, leaving distinctive imprints on the 21 cm power spectrum. Therefore, the redshifted 21 cm power spectrum serves as a powerful tool to investigate such DM processes. In this work, we systematically assess the potential of the upcoming Square Kilometre Array (SKA) to constrain DM and PBH parameters using the 21 cm power spectrum. Assuming $10,000$ hours of integration time, the SKA is projected to reach sensitivities of $\langle\sigma v\rangle \leq 10^{-28}\,{\rm cm}^{3}\,{\rm s}^{-1}$ and $\tau\geq 10^{28}\,{\rm seconds}$, for $10\,{\rm GeV}$ DM particles. It can also probe PBHs with masses of $10^{16}\,\mathrm{g}$ and abundances $f_{\mathrm{PBH}} \leq 10^{-6}$. These results indicate that the SKA could place constraints on DM annihilation, decay, and PBH Hawking radiation that are up to two to three orders of magnitude stronger than current limits. Furthermore, the SKA is expected to exceed existing bounds on sub-GeV DM and to probe Hawking radiation from PBHs with masses above $10^{17}\,{\rm g}$, which are otherwise inaccessible by conventional cosmological probes. Overall, the SKA holds great promise for advancing our understanding of both DM particles and PBHs, potentially offering new insights into the fundamental nature of DM.</description>

      <title>Extended mass distribution of PBHs during QCD phase transition: SGWB and mini-EMRIs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25083</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.25083v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are one of the most important tracers of cosmic history. In this work, we investigate the formation of PBHs around the time of the QCD phase transition from a broadly peaked inflationary scalar power spectrum, which naturally produces an extended PBH mass function. This scenario yields two distinct stochastic gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWB): (i) scalar-induced, second-order tensor perturbations generated at PBH formation, and (ii) a merger-driven SGWB from the subsequent PBH binary population. Using Bayesian analysis, we examine both SGWB channels with the data from the NANOGrav 15-year dataset and the first three observing runs of LVK. We also forecast continuous-wave signals from mini extreme mass ratio inspirals (mini-EMRIs) for direct comparison with NANOGrav and LVK constraints. Our parameter scans identify regions of the parameter space where the combined SGWB is detectable in future ground-based and space-based detectors. A broad PBH mass distribution naturally gives rise to mini-EMRIs, which future ground-based observatories, such as LVK A+, ET, and CE, can detect. For a large part of the PBH parameter space, the SGWB of astrophysical origin masks the primordial SGWB in the frequency band of ground-based detectors. Thus, for extended PBH mass distributions, we find that the detection of mini-EMRIs is a more robust channel for probing the PBH parameter space than the corresponding SGWB.</description>
