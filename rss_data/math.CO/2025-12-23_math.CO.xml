      <title>Assembly Addition Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18030v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we extend the notion of Addition Chains over Z+ to a general set S. We explain how the algebraic structure of Assembly Multi-Magma over the pairs (S,BB proper subset of S) allows to define the concept of Addition Chain over S, called Assembly Addition Chains of S with Building Blocks BB. Analogously to the Z+ case, we introduce the concept of Optimal Assembly Addition Chains over S and prove lower and upper bounds for their lengths, similar to the bounds found by Schonhage for the Z+ case. In the general case the unit 1 is in set Z+ is replaced by the subset BB and the mentioned bounds for the length of an Optimal Assembly Addition Chain of O is in set S are defined in terms of the size of O (i.e. the number of Building Blocks required to construct O). The main examples of S that we consider through this papers are (i) j-Strings (Strings with an alphabeth of j letters), (ii) Colored Connected Graphs and (iii) Colored Polyominoes.</description>

      <title>Packing Independent Cliques in $K_4$-minor-free Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18090</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18090v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and $S$ be a set of cliques of $G$. The set $S$ is an indeque set if every component of $G[S]$, the subgraph induced by vertices of $S$, is a clique. In this paper, we prove that the indeque ratio of $K_4$-minor-free graphs is $\frac 1 2$, which settle two conjectures of Biro, Collado and Zamora. We also show that the indeque ratio of subcubic graphs is $\frac 1 2$.</description>

      <title>Alternating Power Difference and Matrix Symmetry: Closed-Form Formulas for the First Appearance Degree $m_1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper focuses on an integer-valued function $f_A(\sigma) := \operatorname{tr}(A P_\sigma)$ defined uniformly from a specific square matrix $A$ of order $n$ and a permutation $\sigma$ on the symmetric group $S_n$. The main objective of this study is to investigate in detail the algebraic behavior of the Alternating Power Difference (APD), denoted as $APD_m(f_A)$, and its first appearance degree $m_1(f_A)$ for this function $f_A$ across various matrix classes. Specifically, we address special matrices such as shifted $r$-th power lattices, Vandermonde matrices, and circulant matrices, analyzing the phenomenon where the value of $APD_m(A)$ remains zero as $m$ increases until a specific degree (the first appearance phenomenon). In particular, we explore closed-form formulas for the first appearance degree $m_1(A)$ and the first appearance value $APD_{m_1}(A)$, presenting Conjectures that hold across multiple matrix classes. These results suggest a deep relationship between the structure of matrices and the analytical properties of functions on the symmetric group, providing new perspectives in matrix theory and combinatorics.</description>

      <title>Fibonacci and Lucas numbers arising from two-component spanning forests of wheel graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a constructive bijection between a conditioned spanning forest of the wheel graph $W_{n+1}$ and a spanning tree of the fan graph $F_n$. In addition, by applying the effective resistance formula obtained by Bapat and Gupta \cite{bapat-gupta}, we derive an explicit formula for the number of two-component spanning forests of $W_{n+1}$ in which two specified vertices $u$ and $v$ lie in distinct components. Based on this result, we obtain explicit formulas for the following three conditioned two-component spanning forests $F_{W_{n+1}}(v_1\mid v_2)$, $F_{W_{n+1}}(v_1\mid v_3)$, and $F_{W_{n+1}}(v_1\mid v_c)$. These formulas are $F_{W_{n+1}}(v_1\mid v_2)=2(f_{2n-1}-1)$, $F_{W_{n+1}}(v_1\mid v_3)=2(\ell_{2n-2}-3)$, $F_{W_{n+1}}(v_1\mid v_c)=f_{2n}$, where $f_i$ and $\ell_j$ denote the $i$-th Fibonacci number and $j$-th Lucas number, respectively. As these identities show, the enumerations naturally lead to formulas involving Fibonacci numbers and Lucas numbers. Taken together, these two approaches show a unified perspective. One is the constructive combinatorial bijection, and the other is the analytic method based on effective resistance. Together they provide a new integrated framework for studying the structure of spanning forests on $W_{n+1}$.</description>

      <title>Strong Central 2-Trees with Tail Degrees {2, 3}: Structural Characterization and Uniqueness Criteria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18378v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study strong $r$-central $2$-trees whose non-central vertices have degrees in $\{2,3\}$, focusing on the cases $r=1,2,3$. For each $r$, we derive exact degree constraints relating the maximum degree $\Delta$ to the numbers of degree-$3$ and degree-$2$ tail vertices. In the unicentral case ($r=1$), we prove that the fan graph is the unique realization for all $n\ge 3$. For bicentral $2$-trees ($r=2$), we show that the number of degree-$3$ vertices is always even, establish sharp uniqueness results for $x\in\{0,2\}$, prove existence for all feasible values of $\Delta$, and obtain linear lower bounds on the number of non-isomorphic realizations. For tricentral $2$-trees ($r=3$), we characterize extremal configurations, establish a divisibility constraint on the tail parameters, and prove a quadratic lower bound on the number of non-isomorphic graphs for infinitely many values of $n$. These results provide a unified structural framework for central $2$-trees with bounded tail degrees and highlight sharp transitions between rigidity and combinatorial growth.</description>

      <title>A cop-robber game on metric graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a variant of the classical cop-robber game played on compact metric graphs, where each edge is assigned a positive length and identified with a real interval of corresponding length. In this setting, both the cop and the robber move continuously along the edges, subject to upper bounds on their speeds. The cop has no knowledge of the robber's location and must choose a continuous path through the graph that is guaranteed to intersect the robber's trajectory at some point in time. We show that for every compact metric graph, there exists a constant s &gt; 0 such that if the cop's speed exceeds s times the robber's speed, then the cop can guarantee capture.</description>

      <title>Canonical tree-decompositions of chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18480v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Halin characterised the chordal locally finite graphs as those that admit a tree-decomposition into cliques. We show that these tree-decompositions can be chosen to be canonical, that is, so that they are invariant under all the graph's automorphisms. As an application, we show that a locally finite, connected graph $G$ is $r$-locally chordal (that is, its $r/2$-balls are chordal) if and only if the unique canonical graph-decomposition $\mathcal{H}_r(G)$ of $G$ which displays its $r$-global structure is into cliques. Our results also serve as tools for further characterisations of $r$-locally chordal graphs.</description>

      <title>Cyclic sieving phenomena for trees and tree-rooted maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18656</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18656v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove cyclic sieving phenomena satisfied by corner-rooted plane trees (alias ordered trees). The sets of rooted plane trees that we consider are: (1) all trees with $n$ nodes; (2) all trees with $n$ nodes and $k$ leaves; (3) all trees with a given degree distribution of the nodes. Moreover, we consider four different cyclic group actions: (1) the root is moved to the next corner along a tour of the tree; (2) only trees in which the root is at a leaf are considered, and the action moves the root to the next leaf; (3) only trees in which the root is at a non-leaf are considered, and the action moves the root to the next non-leaf corner; (4) only trees in which the root is at a node of degree $\delta$ are considered, for a fixed $\delta$, and the action moves the root to the next corner of this type. We prove a cyclic sieving phenomenon for each meaningful combination of these sets and actions. As a bonus, we also establish corresponding cyclic sieving phenomena for tree-rooted planar maps.</description>

      <title>$SL_2$-tilings with translational symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18810v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An $SL_2$-tiling is a bi-infinite matrix in which all adjacent $2 \times 2$ minors are equal to $1$. Positive integral $SL_2$-tilings were introduced by Assem, Reutenauer and Smith as generalisations of classical Conway--Coxeter frieze patterns. We show that positive integral $SL_2$-tilings with translational symmetry are in bijection with triangulations of annuli. We use this correspondence to study the properties of periodic positive integral $SL_2$-tilings.</description>

      <title>Induced minors and subpolynomial treewidth</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a family $\mathcal{H}$ of graphs, we say that a graph $G$ is $\mathcal{H}$-induced-minor-free if no induced minor of $G$ is isomorphic to a member of $\mathcal{H}$, We denote by $W_{t\times t}$ the $t$-by-$t$ hexagonal grid, and by $K_{t,t}$ the complete bipartite graph with both sides of the bipartition of size $t$. We show that the class of $\{K_{t,t},W_{t\times t}\}$-induced minor-free graphs with bounded clique number has subpolynomial treewidth. Specifically, we prove that for every integer $t$ there exist $\epsilon \in (0,1]$ and $c \in \nat$ such that every $n$-vertex $\{K_{t,t},W_{t\times t}\}$-induced minor-free graph with no clique of size $t$ has treewidth at most $2^{c\log^{1-\epsilon}n}$.</description>

      <title>The Gr\"unbaum--Rigby configuration as a special K\'arteszi configuration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1990, Branko Gr\"unbaum and John Rigby presented a 4-configuration, known today as the \emph{Gr\"unbaum--Rigby configuration}; it is denoted by $\mathrm{GR}(21_4)$. Independently and earlier, in 1986, Ferenc K\'arteszi published a paper in which he proved a theorem in real geometry that gives rise to a series of 4-configurations $\mathrm{K}(n;\ell,m)$. In an even earlier paper from 1964, he presented a figure which is essentially the same as that given by Gr\"unbaum and Rigby. In this paper, we explore some properties of the \emph{K\'arteszi configurations} and in particular show that $\mathrm{GR}(21_4)$ is isomorphic to $\mathrm{K}(7;2,3)$. We present a theorem that gives necessary and sufficient conditions on parameters $n,\ell,m$ such that the corresponding configuration $\mathrm{K}(n;\ell,m)$ is realisable as a geometric polycyclic configuration with $n$-fold rotational symmetry and no extra incidences.</description>

      <title>On the Ban-Linial Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18913v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph and let $\{X_0,X_1\}$ be a partition of $V(G)$. This partition is called external or unfriendly if every $x \in X_i$ has at least as many neighbours in $X_{1-i}$ as in $X_i$. Every maximum edge-cut gives rise to an external partition, so these partitions are always guaranteed to exist. However, it remains a challenge to find such partitions with additional restrictions. Ban and Linial have conjectured that in the case when $G$ is cubic, there always exists an external partition $\{X_0,X_1\}$ for which $-2 \le |X_0| - |X_1| \le 2$. We prove this in two special cases: whenever $G$ can be decomposed into a cycle and a tree, and whenever $G$ has a cubic tree $T$ for which $G - E(T)$ is bipartite.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18923v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 1983, A. Bouchet extended W.T. Tutte's notion of nowhere-zero flows to signed graphs, and conjectured that every flow-admissible signed graph has a nowhere-zero 6-flow. In this paper we prove that every flow-admissible signed graph that is 3-edge-connected has a nowhere-zero 8-flow. This is a continuation of a previous paper where we proved the same conclusion under stronger assumptions.</description>

      <title>Locally interval graphs are circular-arc graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19040v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular-arc graphs are graphs that can be represented as intersection graphs of subpaths of a cycle. Interval graphs are graphs that can be represented as intersection graphs of subpaths of a path. Since cycles are locally paths, every circular-arc graph is locally interval. In this paper, we prove that the converse holds as well: every locally interval graph is a circular-arc graph. This result and its proofs are connected to a recent broader study of structural local-global theory and build on previous work on locally chordal graphs.</description>

      <title>The global structure of locally chordal graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19044v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A graph is locally chordal if each of its small-radius balls is chordal. In an earlier work [AKK25], the authors and Kobler proved that locally chordal graphs can be characterized by having chordal local covers, by forbidding short cycles and wheels as induced subgraphs, and by the property that each of their minimal local separators is a clique. In this paper, we address the global structure of locally chordal graphs. The global structure of chordal graphs is given by the following characterizations: a graph is chordal if and only if it is the intersection graph of subtrees of a tree, if and only if it admits a tree-decomposition into cliques. We prove a local analog of this characterization, which essentially says that a graph is locally chordal if and only if it is the intersection graph of special subtrees of a high-girth graph, if and only if it admits a special graph-decomposition over a high-girth graph into cliques. We also prove that these global representations of locally chordal graphs can be efficiently computed.
  This paper has two major contributions. The first is to exhibit for locally chordal graphs an ideal "local to global" analysis: given a graph class defined by restricted local structure, we fully describe the global structure of graphs in the class. The second is to develop the theory of graph-decompositions. Much of the work in this paper is devoted to properties of graph-decompositions that represent the global structure of graphs. This theory will be useful to find global decompositions for graph classes beyond locally chordal graphs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By computing all cyclotomic points on some algebraic varieties, we get an independent and efficient way to find all rational $a^3b$-monotiles for the sphere, thereby completing the classification of edge-to-edge monohedral quadrilateral tilings. Both of the previous classifications \cite{lw2} and \cite{cl} depended on many old works of different authors while quite a few typos and gaps were found.</description>

      <title>Chromatic numbers for contact graphs of congruent cuboids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19080v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We initiate the study of chromatic numbers for contact graphs of configurations of integer-sized cuboids in three dimensions, all of which are mutually congruent. Disallowing rotations, we show a global upper bound of 8 for the chromatic numbers, which implies that there is a global upper bound of 48 when the cuboids may be rotated freely. Specializing further to cuboids that are required to have a side length of one we obtain more precise upper bounds.
  Such upper bounds are compared to examples of configurations having relatively large chromatic numbers, leading to a complete determination of some of these chromatic numbers, but in general, the gaps between our upper and lower bounds are rather wide. In particular, we know of no such configuration of any size leading to a chromatic number above 6.</description>

      <title>The Snapshot Problem for Wave Equations on Homogeneous Trees</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: By definition, a wave on a homogeneous tree $\mathfrak X$ is a solution to the discrete wave equation on $\mathfrak{X}$; that is, a family $\{f_k\}_{k\in\mathbb Z}$ of complex-valued functions on $\mathfrak X$ satisfying the partial difference equation $\mu_1 f_k=(f_{k+1}+f_{k-1})/2$ for all $k$, where $\mu_1$ is the mean value operator on $\mathfrak X$ of radius $1$. The function $f_k$ is called the snapshot of the wave at time $k$. For $k\geq 2$, we will show that there exist infinitely many waves having given snapshots at times $0$ and $k$, but that all such waves have the same snapshots at times which are multiples of $k$. For integers $0&lt;k&lt;\ell$, we then consider necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of a wave with given snapshots at times $0,\,k,\,\ell$.</description>

      <title>3-path-connectivity of Cayley graphs generated by wheel graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $G = (V(G), E(G))$ be a simple connected graph and $\Omega$ a subset of $ V(G)$ with $|\Omega|\geq2$. An $\Omega$-path in $G$ is a path that connects all vertices of $\Omega$. Two $\Omega$-paths $P_i$ and $P_j$ are said to be internally disjoint if $V(P_i)\cap V(P_j)=\Omega$ and $E(P_i)\cap E(P_j)=\emptyset$. Denote $\pi_G(\Omega)$ by the maximum number of internally disjoint $\Omega$-paths in $G$. For an integer $k\geq2$, the $k$-path-connectivity $\pi_k(G)$ of $G$ is defined as $\min\{\pi_G(\Omega)\mid\Omega\subseteq V(G)$ and $|\Omega|=k\}$. Let $CW_n$ denote the Cayley graph generated by the $n$-vertex wheel graph. In this paper, we investigate the $3$-path-connectivity of $CW_n$ and prove that $\pi_3(CW_n)=\lfloor\frac{6n-9}4\rfloor$ for all $n\geq4$.</description>

      <title>The number of rooted spanning forests of bicirculant graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A bi-Cayley graph over the cyclic group $(\mathbb{Z}_n, +)$ is called a bicirculant graph. Let $\Gamma=BC(\mathbb{Z}_n; R,T,S)$ be a bicirculant graph with $R=-R\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n\setminus \{0\}$ and $T={-}T\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n\setminus \{0\}$ and $S\subseteq \mathbb{Z}_n$. In this paper, using Chebyshev polynomials, we obtain a closed formula for the number of rooted spanning forests of $\Gamma$. Moreover, we investigate some arithmetic properties of the number of rooted spanning forests of $\Gamma$, and find its asymptotic behaviour as $n$ tends infinity.</description>

      <title>Open XOR-magic odd graphs and closed XOR-magic even graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19278</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19278v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: XOR-magic graph labelings form a special subclass of group distance magic labelings. A simple connected graph of order $2^n$ is called an open (respectively, closed) XOR-magic graph of power $n$ if its vertices can be labeled bijectively with vectors from $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^n$ such that the sum (over $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^n$) of labels in each open (respectively, closed) neighborhood of every vertex is equal to the zero vector. In one paper, Batal asked whether there exists any odd-regular open XOR-magic graph or any even-regular closed XOR-magic graph. In this paper, with partial help of MILP solver, we answer this question in the affirmative. More precisely, we prove that for every integer $n&gt;3$, there exists an odd-regular open XOR-magic graph of power $n$ and an even-regular closed XOR-magic graph of power $n$. We also show some applications of the spectra of graphs for an open XOR-magic labeling.</description>

      <title>On induced subgraphs with degree parity conditions in Paley graphs and Paley tournaments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19312</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19312v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the number of induced subgraphs and subdigraphs of Paley graphs and Paley tournaments where the (out-)degree of each vertex has the same parity. For Paley graphs, we establish a lower bound for the number of large even induced subgraphs, particularly those containing a constant proportion of vertices. We determine the number of even-even partitions of Paley graphs, showing it is exponential if $q\equiv 1\Mod{8}$ and is trivial if $q\equiv 5\Mod{8}$, while proving the non-existence of even-even partition for Paley tournaments. Furthermore, we derive asymptotic formulas for the numbers of even induced sub(di)graphs of order $r=o(q^{1/4})$ in Paley graphs and Paley tournaments, demonstrating their concentration around the expected values in the corresponding random (di)graph models.
  In the context of coding theory, we establish a correspondence between even/odd induced sub(di)graphs of Paley graphs (tournaments) and maximum distance separable (MDS) self-dual codes that can be constructed via (extended) generalized Reed-Solomon codes from subsets of finite fields. As a consequence, our contribution on induced subgraphs leads to new existence and counting results about MDS self-dual codes.</description>

      <title>A new family of maximum linear symmetric rank-distance codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\mathscr{S}_n(q)$ denote the set of symmetric bilinear forms over an $n$-dimensional $\mathbb{F}_q$-vector space. A subset $\mathcal{C}$ of $\mathscr{S}_n(q)$ is called a $d$-code if the rank of $A-B$ is larger than or equal to $d$ for any distinct $A$ and $B$ in $\mathcal{C}$. If $\mathcal{C}$ is further closed under matrix addition, then $|\mathcal{C}|$ is sharply upper bounded by $q^{n(n-d+2)/2}$ if $n-d$ is even and $q^{(n+1)(n-d+1)/2}$ if $n-d$ is odd. Additive codes meeting these upper bounds are called maximum. There are very few known constructions of them. In this paper, we obtain a new family of maximum $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear $(n-2)$-codes in $\mathscr{S}_n(q)$ for $n=6,8$ and $10$ which are not equivalent to any known constructions. Furthermore, we completely determine the equivalence between distinct members in this new family.</description>

      <title>Regular Cyclic $(q+1)$-Arcs in $\PG(3,2^m)$: Spectral Rigidity, Descent, and an MDS Criterion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19371</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19371v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $q=2^m$ with $m\ge 3$ and set $n:=q+1$. We investigate $(q+1)$-arcs $\mathcal A\subset \mathrm{PG}(3,q)$ that admit a regular cyclic subgroup $C\le \mathrm{PGL}(4,q)$ of order $n$. Over $K=\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, such an action can be conjugated to a diagonal one, producing explicit cyclic monomial models \[ \mathcal M_a = \{[1:t:t^a:t^{a+1}]:t\in U_n\}\subset \mathrm{PG}(3,K), \qquad U_n=\{u\in K^\times:u^n=1\}, \] with $a\in(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^\times$. We develop
  a spectral rigidity principle to
  obtain a precise descent criterion: $\mathcal M_a$ is $K$-projectively equivalent to a $(q+1)$-arc defined over $\mathbb{F}_q$ if and only if $a\equiv \pm 2^e \pmod n$ for some integer $e$ with $\gcd(e,m)=1$. Consequently, regular cyclic pairs $(\mathcal A,C)$ fall into exactly $\varphi(m)/2$ $K$-projective equivalence classes. As an immediate coding-theoretic application, we resolve the remaining AMDS/MDS dichotomy for the BCH family $\mathcal C_{(q,q+1,3,h)}$ studied by Xu et al.: $\mathcal C_{(q,q+1,3,h)}$ is MDS
  if and only if $2h+1\equiv \pm 2^e \pmod n$ for some $e$ with $\gcd(e,m)=1$. The underlying spectral rigidity step is formulated in a general setting for diagonal regular cyclic pairs in $\mathrm{PG}(r,K)$, providing a portable reduction of projective equivalence questions to explicit congruences on exponent data.</description>

Abstract: The edge-spectral-Tur\'an type problem is also called the Brualdi-Hoffman-Tur\'an type problem, which is a central topic in spectral graph theory, seeking to determine the maximum spectral radius $\lambda(G)$ of an $F$-free graph $G$ with $m$ edges. This problem has attracted significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we will sort out several closely related results in this type of problem and then propose some conjectures for further research.</description>

      <title>On Spectral Properties of Lanzhou Matrix of Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19404v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $\Gamma$ be a simple graph on $n$ vertices. Lanzhou index is defined as $Lz(\Gamma)=\sum\limits_{u \in V(\Gamma)}d_\Gamma(u)^2d_{\overline{\Gamma}}(u).$ In this manuscript, the Lanzhou matrix, denoted by $A_{Lz}(\Gamma)$, has been defined, and its spectral properties are studied. The $uv^{th}$ entry in $A_{Lz}(\Gamma)$ is $d_\Gamma(u)d_{\overline{\Gamma}}(u)+d_\Gamma(v)d_{\overline{\Gamma}}(v)$ if $u$ and $v$ are adjacent. Otherwise, the entry is zero. Some bounds on Lanzhou energy and spread on the Lanzhou matrix are obtained. Also, Lanzhou eigenvalues and inertia for some standard graphs have been obtained. Additionally, characterizations for the symmetricity of Lanzhou eigenvalues about the origin are obtained.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19462</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19462v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stanley-Wilf limit of the pattern 1324 is known to lie between 10.271 and 13.5. We obtain lower bounds on this limit by encoding permutations as walks in directed graphs: building a permutation by successive insertion of maxima corresponds to traversing edges, and the growth rate of walks equals the spectral radius of the adjacency matrix. For 1324, this graph is too large for direct computation, so we pass to a quotient graph with weighted edges. Conditional on a natural conjecture, this yields a lower bound of 10.418.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19600</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19600v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Around 10 years ago, Agol and Krushkal showed that the number of chromatic polynomials $P_{G}$ arising from graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices grows exponentially with $n$, by establishing that the (dual) flow polynomial $F_{G}\left(\frac{3+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)$ already takes on exponentially many values, if one varies $G$ over all planar cubic graphs $G$ on $n$ vertices. We show, more generally, that the size of the set $\{P_G(q): |V(G)|=n\}$ is exponential in $n$, for every fixed real number $q \neq 0,1,2$. In fact, our approach can also be pushed to show that $P_{G}(q)$ already takes on exponentially many values, if we only vary $G$ over all planar graphs on $n$ vertices. The case $q=3$ confirms a conjecture of Agol, which was initially motivated by the $\mathsf{NP}$-completeness of planar $3$-colorability.</description>

      <title>Equivalent bounded confidence processes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18016v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the bounded confidence model the opinions of a set of agents evolve over discrete time steps. In each round an agent averages the opinion of all agents whose opinions are at most a certain threshold apart. Here we assume that the opinions of the agents are elements of the real line. The details of the dynamics are determined by the initial opinions of the agents, i.e. a starting configuration, and the mentioned threshold -- both allowing uncountable infinite possibilities. Recently it was observed that for each starting configuration the set of thresholds can be partitioned into a finite number of intervals such that the evolution of opinions does not depend on the precise value of the threshold within one of the intervals. So, we may say that, given a starting configuration of initial opinions, there is only a finite number of equivalence classes of bounded confidence processes (and an algorithm to compute them). Here we systematically study different notions of equivalence. In our widest notion we can also get rid of the initial starting configuration and end up with a finite number of equivalent bounded confidence processes for each given (finite) number of agents. This allows to precisely study the occurring phenomena for small numbers of agents without the jeopardy of missing interesting cases by performing numerical experiments. We exemplarily study the freezing time, i.e. number of time steps needed until the process stabilizes, and the degree of fragmentation, i.e. the number of different opinions that survive once the process has reached its final state.</description>

      <title>Fast Rational Search via Stern-Brocot Tree</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18036v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We revisit the problem of rational search: given an unknown rational number $\alpha = \frac{a}{b} \in (0,1)$ with $b \leq n$, the goal is to identify $\alpha$ using comparison queries of the form ``$\beta \leq \alpha$?''. The problem has been studied several decades ago and optimal query algorithms are known. We present a new algorithm for rational search based on a compressed traversal of the Stern--Brocot tree, which appeared to have been overlooked in the literature. This approach also naturally extends to two related problems that, to the best of our knowledge, have not been previously addressed: (i) unbounded rational search, where the bound $n$ is unknown, and (ii) computing the best (in a precise sense) rational approximation of an unknown real number using only comparison queries.</description>

      <title>Quasipolynomial behavior via constructability in multigraded algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Piecewise quasipolynomial growth of Presburger counting functions combines with tame persistent homology module theory to conclude piecewise quasipolynomial behavior of constructible families of finely graded modules over constructible commutative semigroup rings. Functorial preservation of constructibility for families under local cohomology, $\operatorname{Tor}$, and $\operatorname{Ext}$ yield piecewise quasipolynomial, quasilinear, or quasiconstant growth statements for length of local cohomology, $a$-invariants, regularity, depth; length of $\operatorname{Tor}$ and Betti numbers; length of $\operatorname{Ext}$ and Bass numbers; associated primes via $v$-invariants; and extended degrees, including the usual degree, Hilbert--Samuel multiplicity, arithmetic degree, and homological~degree.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.18668v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study a new perspective on a certain Pieri rules for classical groups. Furthermore, we extend a fundamental theorem of Kostant concerning tensor products for classical groups. We show that a certain form of the Pieri rule is equivalent to the converse of this extended version of Kostant's theorem. In addition, we show an equivalence between the Pieri rule and the branching rule for general linear groups.</description>

      <title>On $\ell_1$ embeddings of finite metric spaces, and sphere-of-influence graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18975</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18975v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce the {\em pair-cut cone $PCUT_n$} of metrics on sets with $n\ge 3$ elements, that correspond to linear combinations with non-negative coefficients of the cut-metrics resulting from cuts that are pairs. Given a metric, we fully characterize membership in the pair-cut cone in terms of quantities computed from the metric directly. We also prove a new result by which a metric $d$ that satisfies a system of inequalities, lies in the (full) cut cone of metrics, making it $\ell_1$-embeddable into Euclidean space.
  We give applications of our results to the $\ell_1$-embeddability of simple graphs into Euclidean space as {\em sphere-of-influence graphs}. We exhibit an example of a simple graph that admits no such $\ell_1$-metric in the pair-cut cone.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19034v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a classical group defined over the complex numbers with a Borel subgroup $B$. Choose a holomorphic involution of $G$ and let $K$ be its set of fixed points. The group $K$ acts on the flag variety $G/B$ with finitely many orbits and Brion has derived a general formula for the cohomology classes of the corresponding orbit closures as linear combinations of Schubert classes. This article provide a uniform description of the sets of Weyl group elements (which we refer to as Brion atoms) indexing the terms in this formula. This builds on prior work addressing types A, B, and C. The main novelty of our results is a thorough treatment of type D. As one application, we introduce a notion of involution Schubert polynomials for all classical types and present several conjectures related to these objects.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19045v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Kirillov and Naruse have constructed double Grothendieck polynomials to represent the equivariant K-theory classes of Schubert varieties in the complete flag manifolds of types B, C, and D. We derive a recursive formula for these polynomials, extending certain K-theoretic transition equations known in type A to all classical types. As an application, we obtain an identity that expands the K-Stanley symmetric functions in types B, C, and D into positive linear combinations of K-theoretic Schur P- and Q-functions. We also resolve several positivity conjectures related to the skew generalizations of the latter functions.</description>

Abstract: We show that a strong version of the geometric Merkurjev-Panin conjecture holds for the Cox category of a projective toric variety. That is, we prove that the full strong exceptional collection of Bondal-Thomsen line bundles is invariant under the group of lattice automorphisms that permute the rays of the toric variety's fan. Our result is meant to further illustrate that the Cox category is a natural repository for homological algebra on toric varieties.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that the common basis complex of a free group of rank $n$ has the homotopy type of a wedge of spheres of dimension $2n-3$. This establishes an $\mathrm{Aut}(F_n)$-analogue of the connectivity conjecture that Rognes originally stated for $\mathrm{GL}_n(R)$. To prove this, we provide several homotopy-equivalent models of the common basis complex, both in terms of free factors in free groups and in terms of sphere systems in 3-manifolds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19638v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We give a general lower bound on the rank of matrices of the form $\rho(h) - I$ with $\rho : G \rightarrow GL({\mathbb F}^n)$ an irreducible representation of a finite group $G$. The main tool in the proof is a (strengthening) of a reduction due to Efremenko from low rank matrices spanned by a few images of $\rho$ to Locally Decodable Codes (LDCs), which are a special kind of error correcting codes. We then apply the known results on 2-query LDCs to derive our rank bound.</description>

Abstract: We construct a functor associating a cubical set to a (simple) graph. We show that cubical sets arising in this way are Kan complexes, and that the A-groups of a graph coincide with the homotopy groups of the associated Kan complex. We use this to prove a conjecture of Babson, Barcelo, de Longueville, and Laubenbacher from 2006, and a strong version of the Hurewicz theorem in discrete homotopy theory.</description>

      <title>Affine extended weak order is a lattice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.05737v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Coxeter groups are equipped with a partial order known as the weak order, such that $u \leq v$ if the inversions of $u$ are a subset of the inversions of $v$. In finite Coxeter groups, weak order is a complete lattice, but in infinite Coxeter groups it is only a meet semi-lattice. Motivated by questions in Kazhdan-Lusztig theory, Matthew Dyer introduced a larger poset, now known as extended weak order, which contains the weak order as an order ideal and coincides with it for finite Coxeter groups. The extended weak order is the containment order on certain sets of positive roots: those which satisfy a geometric condition making them "biclosed". The finite biclosed sets are precisely the inversion sets of Coxeter group elements. Generalizing the result for finite Coxeter groups, Dyer conjectured that the extended weak order is always a complete lattice, even for infinite Coxeter groups.
  In this paper, we prove Dyer's conjecture for Coxeter groups of affine type. To do so, we introduce the notion of a clean arrangement, which is a hyperplane arrangement where the regions are in bijection with biclosed sets. We show that root poset order ideals in a finite or rank 3 untwisted affine root system are clean. We set up a general framework for reducing Dyer's conjecture to checking cleanliness of certain subarrangements. We conjecture this framework can be used to prove Dyer's conjecture for all Coxeter groups.</description>

      <title>On the connected (sub)partition polytope</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.01716v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $k$ be a positive integer and let $G$ be a graph with $n$ vertices. A connected $k$-subpartition of $G$ is a collection of $k$ pairwise disjoint sets (a.k.a. classes) of vertices in $G$ such that each set induces a connected subgraph. The connected $k$-subpartition polytope of $G$, denoted by $\poly(G,k)$, is defined as the convex hull of the incidence vectors of all connected $k$-subpartitions of $G$. Many applications arising in off-shore oil-drilling, forest planning, image processing, cluster analysis, political districting, police patrolling, and biology are modeled in terms of finding connected (sub)partitions of a graph. This study focuses on the facial structure of~$\poly(G,k)$ and the computational complexity of the corresponding separation problems. We first propose a set of valid inequalities having non-zero coefficients associated with a single class that extends and generalizes the ones in the literature of related problems, show sufficient conditions for these inequalities to be facet-defining, and design a polynomial-time separation algorithm for them. We also devise two sets of inequalities that consider multiple classes, prove when they define facets, and study the computational complexity of associated separation problems. Finally, we report on computational experiments showing the usefulness of the proposed inequalities.</description>

      <title>The sandpile model on the complete split graph: $q,t$-Schr\"oder polynomials, sawtooth polyominoes, and a cycle lemma</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.15372</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.15372v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper studies sorted recurrent configurations of the Abelian sandpile model on the complete split graph. We introduce two natural toppling processes, CTI and ITC toppling, on the recurrent configurations and use these to define two toppling delay statistics, wtopple$_{CTI}$ and wtopple$_{ITC}$. These new toppling delay statistics are time-weighted sums for the number of vertices that topple during each iteration of the toppling processes. We then introduce the bivariate $q,t$-CTI and $q,t$-ITC polynomials that are the generating functions of the bistatistics (level,wtopple$_{ITC}$) and (level,wtopple$_{CTI}$), where level is the well-established sandpile level statistic.
  We prove the bistatistic (level,wtopple$_{ITC}$) maps to a bistatistic (area,bounce) on Schr\"oder paths that was introduced by Egge, Haglund, Killpatrick and Kremer (2003). This establishes equality of the $q,t$-ITC polynomial and the $q,t$-Schr\"oder polynomial of those same authors. This connection allows us to relate the $q,t$-ITC polynomial to the theory of symmetric functions and also establishes symmetry of the $q,t$-ITC polynomials. We conjecture equality of the $q,t$-CTI and $q,t$-ITC polynomials.
  We also present and prove a characterization of sorted recurrent configurations as a new class of polyominoes that we call sawtooth polyominoes. The CTI and ITC toppling processes on sorted recurrent configurations are proven to correspond to bounce paths within the polyominoes. The main difference between the two bounce paths is the initial direction in which they travel. In addition to this, and building on the results of Aval, D'Adderio, Dukes, and Le Borgne (2016), we present a cycle lemma for a slight extension of stable configurations that allows for an enumeration of sorted recurrent configurations within the framework of the sandpile model.</description>

Abstract: The local $h^*$-polynomial is a natural invariant of a lattice polytope appearing in Ehrhart theory and Hodge theory. In this work, we study the question posed in [GKZ94] concerning the classification of lattice simplices with vanishing local $h^*$-polynomial. Such simplices are called thin. We relate this question to linear codes and hyperplane arrangements over finite rings. This allows us to obtain a complete classification of the $4$-dimensional thin simplices, extending the previously known results in dimensions up to $3$.</description>

      <title>Voting Profiles Admitting All Candidates as Knockout Winners</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.01382v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A set of $2^n$ candidates is presented to a commission. At every round, each member of this commission votes by pairwise comparison, and one-half of the candidates is deleted from the tournament, the remaining ones proceeding to the next round until the $n$-th round (the final one) in which the final winner is declared. The candidates are arranged on a board in a given order, which is maintained among the remaining candidates at all rounds. A study of the size of the commission is carried out in order to obtain the desired result of any candidate being a possible winner. For $2^n$ candidates with $n \geq 3$, we identify a voting profile with $4n -3$ voters such that any candidate could win simply by choosing a proper initial order of the candidates. Moreover, in the setting of a random number of voters, we obtain the same results, with high probability, when the expected number of voters is large.</description>

Abstract: We generalize the notion of (geometric) substitution rule to obtain overlapping substitutions. Our motivating example is the substitution presented in Ziherl, Dotera and Bekku \cite{DBZ}, which features a substitution matrix with non-integer entries. We give the meaning of such a matrix by showing that the right Perron--Frobenius eigenvector encodes the patch frequency of the resulting tiling. The patch frequencies are shown to be uniformly convergent, implying that the corresponding dynamical system is uniquely ergodic. Under mild assumptions, we further prove that the associated expansion constant is always an algebraic integer. In general, overlapping substitutions may yield a patch with illegal (partial) overlaps of tiles, even if it is locally consistent. We provide a sufficient condition for an overlapping substitution to be consistent, ensuring that no such illegal tiles emerge. Finally, we construct many intriguing one-dimensional overlapping substitutions and present higher dimensional examples from Delone multi-sets with inflation symmetry.</description>

      <title>Introducing irrational enumeration: analytic combinatorics for objects of irrational size</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.14682v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the scope of analytic combinatorics to classes containing objects that have irrational sizes. The generating function for such a class is a power series that admits irrational exponents (which we call a Ribenboim series). A transformation then yields a generalised Dirichlet series from which the asymptotics of the coefficients can be extracted by singularity analysis using an appropriate Tauberian theorem. In practice, the asymptotics can often be determined directly from the original generating function. We illustrate the technique with a variety of applications, including tilings with tiles of irrational area, ordered integer factorizations, lattice walks enumerated by Euclidean length, and plane trees with vertices of irrational size. We also explore phase transitions in the asymptotics of families of irrational combinatorial classes.</description>

      <title>Locally chordal graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.17320v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we study locally chordal graphs, i.e. graphs where every small-radius ball is chordal. We prove four characterizations of locally chordal graphs. Two are counterparts of the classic descriptions of chordal graphs via induced subgraphs and via minimal separators. For the latter, we rely on the local separators introduced in [CJKK25]. Another characterization is via the local covering, which was introduced in [DJKK22] to study local-global characteristics of graphs using coverings from topology. Our final characterization of locally chordal graphs is in terms of their binary cycle spaces. This gives a new characterization of chordal graphs as wheel-free graphs whose binary cycle space is generated by triangles.
  Together, these results demonstrate the potential of local-global tools to uncover rich new properties. Our results in this paper also form the basis of our local-global analysis of locally chordal graphs [AKb], where we develop a local-global perspective into structural characterizations.</description>

      <title>A Bose-Laskar-Hoffman theory for $\mu$-bounded graphs with fixed smallest eigenvalue</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.05520v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In 2018, by Ramsey and Hoffman theory, Koolen, Yang, and Yang presented a structural result on graphs with smallest eigenvalue at least $-3$ and large minimum degree. In this study, we depart from the conventional use of Ramsey theory and instead employ a novel approach that combines the Bose-Laskar type argument with Hoffman theory to derive structural insights into $\mu$-bounded graphs with fixed smallest eigenvalue. Our method establishes a reasonable bound on the minimum degree. Note that local graphs of distance-regular graphs are $\mu$-bounded. We apply these results to characterize the structure for any local graph of a distance-regular graph with classical parameters $(D,b,\alpha,\beta)$. Consequently, we show that the parameter $\alpha$ is bounded by a cubic polynomial in $b$ if $D \geq 9$ and $b \geq 2$. We also show that $\alpha \leq 2$ if $b =2$ and $D \geq 12$.</description>

      <title>Proof of a conjecture of Green and Liebeck on codes in symmetric groups</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.10744v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $A$ and $B$ be subsets of a finite group $G$ and $r$ a positive integer. If for every $g\in G$, there are precisely $r$ pairs $(a,b)\in A\times B$ such that $g=ab$, then $B$ is called a code in $G$ with respect to $A$ and we write $r G=A\boldsymbol{\cdot}B$. If in addition $B$ is a subgroup of $G$, then we say that $B$ is a subgroup code in $G$. In this paper we resolve a conjecture by Green and Liebeck \cite[Conjecture 2.3]{Green20} on certain subgroup codes in the symmetric group $S_n$. Let $n&gt;2k$ and let $j$ be such that $2^j\leqslant k&lt;2^{j+1}$. Suppose that $X$ is a conjugacy class in $S_n$ containing $x$, and $Y_k$ is the subgroup $S_k\times S_{n-k}$ of $S_n$, where the factor $S_k$ permutes the subset $\{1,\ldots,k\}$ and the factor $S_{n-k}$ permutes the subset $\{k+1,\ldots,n\}$. We prove that $r S_n=X\boldsymbol{\cdot}Y_k$ for some positive integer $r$ if and only if the cycle type of $x$ has exactly one cycle of length $2^i$ for $0\leqslant i\leqslant j$ and all other cycles have length at least $k+1$. We also propose several problems concerning the existence of certain subgroup codes in a finite group $G$ with respect to a conjugation-closed subset in $G$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.14720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Luis Ferroni and Alex Fink recently introduced a polytope of all unlabeled matroids of rank $r$ on $n$ elements, and they showed that the vertices of this polytope come from matroids that can be characterized by maximizing a sequence of valuative invariants. We prove that a number of the matroids that they conjectured to yield vertices indeed do (these include cycle matroids of complete graphs, projective geometries, and Dowling geometries), and we give additional examples (including truncations of cycle matroids of complete graphs, Bose-Burton geometries, and binary and free spikes with tips). We prove a special case of a conjecture of Ferroni and Fink by showing that direct sums of uniform matroids yield vertices of their polytope, and we prove a similar result for direct sums whose components are in certain restricted classes of extremal matroids.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.01163v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a graph with adjacency matrix $A(G)$. We conjecture that \[2n^+(G) \le n^-(G)(n^-(G) + 1),\] where $n^+(G)$ and $n^-(G)$ denote the number of positive and negative eigenvalues of $A(G)$, respectively. This conjecture generalizes to all graphs the well-known absolute bound for strongly regular graphs. The conjecture also relates to a question posed by Torga\v{s}ev. We prove the conjecture for special graph families, including line graphs and planar graphs, and provide examples where the conjecture is exact. We also conjecture that for any connected graph $G$, its line graph $L(G)$ satisfies $n^+(L(G)) \le n^-(L(G)) + 1$, and obtain partial results.</description>

Abstract: Combinatorial analogues of classical Borsuk-Ulam-type theorems (e.g., Tucker's lemma, $\mathbb{Z}_p$-Tucker's lemma, etc.) have numerous important applications in combinatorics. In this paper, we formulate a combinatorial degree version of a generalized $\mathbb{Z}_p$-Tucker's lemma. Our proof is purely combinatorial in the sense that it does not involve homology, cohomology or any other notions from continuous topology. In order to prove the aforementioned degree theorem, as a main technical tool, we prove a Hopf trace-type formula, which is also purely combinatorial and involves no homology. This combinatorial Hopf trace formula is of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.15864v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the first chapter of their classic book "Concrete Mathematics", Graham, Knuth, and Patashnik consider the maximum number of pieces that can be obtained from a pancake by making n cuts with a knife blade that is straight, or bent into a V, or bent twice into a Z. We extend their work by considering knives, or "cookie-cutters", of even more exotic shapes, including a k-armed V, a chain of k connected line segments, a long-legged version of one of the letters A, E, H, L, M, T, W, or X, a convex polygon, a circle, a phi, a figure 8, a pentagram, a hexagram, or a lollipop. In many cases a counting argument combined with Euler's formula produces an explicit expression for the maximum number of pieces. "Constrained" versions of the long-legged letters A and T are also considered, for which we have only conjectural formulas.</description>

      <title>Algebraic Obstructions and the Collapse of Elementary Structure in the Kronecker Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.22856v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: While Kronecker coefficients $g(\lambda,\mu,\nu)$ with bounded rows are polynomial-time computable via lattice-point methods, no explicit closed-form formulas have been obtained for genuinely three-row cases in the 87 years since Murnaghan's foundational work. This paper provides such formulas for the first time and identifies a universal structural boundary at parameter value 5 where elementary combinatorial patterns collapse.
  We analyze two independent families of genuinely three-row coefficients and establish that for $k \leq 4$, the formulas exhibit elementary structure: oscillation bounds follow the triangular-Hogben pattern, and polynomial expressions factor completely over $\mathbb{Z}$. At the critical threshold $k=5$, this structure collapses: the triangular pattern fails, and algebraic obstructions -- irreducible quadratic factors with negative discriminant -- emerge.
  We develop integer forcing, a proof technique exploiting the tension between continuous asymptotics and discrete integrality. As concrete results, we prove that $g((n,n,1)^3) = 2 - (n \mod 2)$ for all $n \geq 3$ -- the first explicit formula for a genuinely three-row Kronecker coefficient -- derive five explicit polynomial formulas for staircase-hook coefficients, and verify Saxl's conjecture for 132 three-row partitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.12876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We continue on a recent concept introduced by Kariuki and Okoth, about skew 2-Dyck paths, introducing an additional down-step $L$, together with the usual steps
  $U$ (up) and $D$ down. There is the syntactical condition that $UL$ and $LU$ can never occur. An automaton that checks these conditions is introduced, and the
  relevant generating functions are obtained by applying the kernel method to three functional equations. It is briefly discussed how the setting can be extended to $t$-Dyck paths. As a benefit, prefixes of skew $t$-Dyck paths are also enumerated. An approach that scans 2-Dyck paths from right to left is also discussed.</description>

      <title>Matchings avoiding ordered patterns</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.15461v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A {\it vertex-ordered} graph is a graph equipped with a linear ordering of its vertices.
  A pair of independent edges in an ordered graph can exhibit one of the following three patterns: separated, nested or crossing.
  We say a pair of independent edges is non-separated if it is either crossing or nested.
  Non-nested and non-crossing pairs are defined analogously.
  We are interested in the following Tur\'an-type problems: for each of the aforementioned six patterns, determine the maximum number of edges of an $n$-vertex ordered graph that does not contain a $k$-matching such that every pair of edges exhibit the fixed pattern.
  Exact answers have already been obtained for four of the six cases.
  The main objective of this paper is to investigate the two remaining open cases, namely non-separated and non-nested matchings.
  We determine the exact maximum number of edges of an $n$-vertex ordered graph that does not contain a non-separated $k$-matching, which has the form $\frac{3}{2}(k-1)n+\Theta(k^2)$.
  For the non-nested case, we show the maximum number of edges lies between $(k-1)n$ and $(k-1)n+\binom{k-1}{2}$.
  We also determine the exact maximum number of edges of an $n$-vertex ordered graph that does not contain an alternating path of given length.
  We discuss some related problems and raise several
  conjectures.
  Furthermore, our results and conjectures yield consequences to certain Ramsey-type problems for non-nested matchings and alternating paths.</description>

      <title>Verifying Hadwiger's Conjecture for Examples of Graphs with $\alpha(G) = 2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17114v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hadwiger's Conjecture states that every graph with chromatic number $k$ contains a complete graph on $k$ vertices as a minor. This conjecture is a tremendous strengthening of the Four-Colour Theorem and is regarded as one of the most important open problems in graph theory. The case of Hadwiger's Conjecture for graphs with $\alpha(G) = 2$ has garnered much attention. Seymour writes: ``My own belief is, if Hadwiger's Conjecture is true for graphs with stability number two then it is probably true in general, so it would be very nice to decide this case.''
  This paper presents several tools useful for proving that a graph $G$ with $\alpha(G) = 2$ satisfies Hadwiger's Conjecture. In doing so, we survey and generalise several classical results on the $\alpha(G) = 2$ case of Hadwiger's Conjecture. Further, we apply these tools to prove variants of Hadwiger's Conjecture for several noteworthy classes of graphs with $\alpha(G) = 2$. In particular, we prove Hadwiger's Conjecture for inflations of the complements of the following graphs: graphs with girth at least $5$, triangle-free Kneser graphs, and the Clebsch, Mesner, and Gewirtz graphs. This paper also highlights classes of graphs with $\alpha(G) = 2$ where it is unknown if Hadwiger's Conjecture holds.</description>

Abstract: A linear code over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with the Hamming metric is called $\Delta$-divisible if the weights of all codewords are divisible by $\Delta$. They have been introduced by Harold Ward a few decades ago. Applications include subspace codes, partial spreads, vector space partitions, and distance optimal codes. The determination of the possible lengths of projective divisible codes is an interesting and comprehensive challenge.</description>

      <title>Single-cell 3D genome reconstruction in the haploid setting using rigidity theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10700v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article considers the problem of 3-dimensional genome reconstruction for single-cell data, and the uniqueness of such reconstructions in the setting of haploid organisms. We consider multiple graph models as representations of this problem, and use techniques from graph rigidity theory to determine identifiability. Biologically, our models come from Hi-C data, microscopy data, and combinations thereof. Mathematically, we use unit ball and sphere packing models, as well as models consisting of distance and inequality constraints. In each setting, we describe and/or derive new results on realisability and uniqueness. We then propose a 3D reconstruction method based on semidefinite programming and apply it to synthetic and real data sets using our models.</description>

      <title>Homotopy $n$-types of cubical sets and graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.05289</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.05289v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a new construction of the model structure on the category of simplicial sets for homotopy $n$-types, originally due to Elvira-Donazar and Hernandez-Paricio, using a right transfer along the coskeleton functor. We observe that an analogous model structure can be constructed on the category of cubical sets, and use it to equip the category of (simple) graphs with a fibration category structure whose weak equivalences are discrete $n$-equivalences.</description>

      <title>On plus-one generated arrangements of plane conics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.23024</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.23024v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the combinatorial properties of conic arrangements in the complex projective plane that possess certain quasi-homogeneous singularities. First, we introduce a new tool that enables us to characterize the property of being plus-one generated within the class of conic arrangements with some naturally chosen quasi-homogeneous singularities. Next, we present a classification result on plus-one generated conic arrangements admitting only nodes and tacnodes as singularities. Building on results regarding conic arrangements with nodes and tacnodes, we present new examples of strong Ziegler pairs of conic-line arrangements -- that is, arrangements having the same strong combinatorics but distinct derivation modules.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20731v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a transitive permutation group acting on $\Omega$. In this paper, we introduce and study the parameter ${\bf m}(G)$, which denotes the size of the smallest set of points $A$ such that, for every permutation $g\in G$, $A \cap A^g$ is nonempty. In particular, we focus on deriving general bounds for arbitrary transitive groups, and on the asymptotic behaviour of certain families of primitive groups. We also provide a classification of transitive groups with ${\bf m}(G)$ largest possible, namely with ${\bf m}(G)=\lceil (|\Omega|+1) / 2 \rceil$.</description>

      <title>Mathematical exploration and discovery at scale</title>

Abstract: AlphaEvolve (Novikov et al., 2025) is a generic evolutionary coding agent that combines the generative capabilities of LLMs with automated evaluation in an iterative evolutionary framework that proposes, tests, and refines algorithmic solutions to challenging scientific and practical problems. In this paper we showcase AlphaEvolve as a tool for autonomously discovering novel mathematical constructions and advancing our understanding of long-standing open problems.
  To demonstrate its breadth, we considered a list of 67 problems spanning mathematical analysis, combinatorics, geometry, and number theory. The system rediscovered the best known solutions in most of the cases and discovered improved solutions in several. In some instances, AlphaEvolve is also able to generalize results for a finite number of input values into a formula valid for all input values. Furthermore, we are able to combine this methodology with Deep Think and AlphaProof in a broader framework where the additional proof-assistants and reasoning systems provide automated proof generation and further mathematical insights.
  These results demonstrate that large language model-guided evolutionary search can autonomously discover mathematical constructions that complement human intuition, at times matching or even improving the best known results, highlighting the potential for significant new ways of interaction between mathematicians and AI systems. We present AlphaEvolve as a powerful new tool for mathematical discovery, capable of exploring vast search spaces to solve complex optimization problems at scale, often with significantly reduced requirements on preparation and computation time.</description>

      <title>Sub-$n^k$ Deterministic algorithm for minimum $k$-way cut in simple graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.12900v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a \emph{deterministic exact algorithm} for the \emph{minimum $k$-cut problem} on simple graphs.
  Our approach combines the \emph{principal sequence of partitions (PSP)}, derived canonically from ideal loads, with a single level of \emph{Kawarabayashi--Thorup (KT)} contractions at the critical PSP threshold~$\lambda_j$.
  Let $j$ be the smallest index with $\kappa(P_j)\ge k$ and $R := k - \kappa(P_{j-1})$.
  We prove a structural decomposition theorem showing that an optimal $k$-cut can be expressed as the level-$(j\!-\!1)$ boundary $A_{\le j-1}$ together with exactly $(R-r)$ \emph{non-trivial} internal cuts of value at most~$\lambda_j$ and $r$ \emph{singleton isolations} (``islands'') inside the parts of~$P_{j-1}$.
  At this level, KT contractions yield kernels of total size $\widetilde{O}(n / \lambda_j)$, and from them we build a \emph{canonical border family}~$\mathcal{B}$ of the same order that deterministically covers all optimal refinement choices.
  Branching only over~$\mathcal{B}$ (and also including an explicit ``island'' branch) gives total running time
  $$
  T(n,m,k) = \widetilde{O}\left(\mathrm{poly}(m)+\Bigl(\tfrac{n}{\lambda_j}+n^{\omega/3}\Bigr)^{R}\right),
  $$
  where $\omega &lt; 2.373$ is the matrix multiplication exponent.
  In particular, if $\lambda_j \ge n^{\varepsilon}$ for some constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, we obtain a \emph{deterministic sub-$n^k$-time algorithm}, running in $n^{(1-\varepsilon)(k-1)+o(k)}$ time.
  Finally, combining our PSP$\times$KT framework with a small-$\lambda$ exact subroutine via a simple meta-reduction yields a deterministic $n^{c k+O(1)}$ algorithm for $c = \max\{ t/(t+1), \omega/3 \} &lt; 1$, aligning with the exponent in the randomized bound of He--Li (STOC~2022) under the assumed subroutine.</description>

      <title>Staircase Minimality and a Proof of Saxl's Conjecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15035</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.15035v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Saxl's conjecture (2012) asserts that for the staircase partition $\rho_k = (k, k-1, \ldots, 1)$, the tensor square of the corresponding irreducible representation of the symmetric group $S_{T_k}$ contains every irreducible representation as a constituent, where $T_k = k(k+1)/2$ is the $k$th triangular number. We prove this conjecture unconditionally.
  Our proof introduces the Staircase Minimality Theorem: among all 2-regular partitions of $T_k$, the staircase $\rho_k$ is the unique dominance-minimal element. Combined with Ikenmeyer's theorem on dominance and Kronecker positivity for staircases, this establishes that every 2-regular partition appears in the tensor square. Modular saturation then follows using only the diagonal entries $d_{\mu\mu} = 1$ of the decomposition matrix, and the Bessenrodt--Bowman--Sutton lifting theorem completes the proof.
  We further prove that at triangular numbers, staircases are the only Kronecker-universal self-conjugate partitions, providing a complete characterization.</description>
