      <title>Thematic analysis of student perceptions of resources and demands experienced in introductory physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14692</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14692v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current work aims to better understand student course experiences for those who reported negative perceptions in introductory physics. Researchers conducted semi-structured interviews with 24 students who reported negative perceptions of their class on a screening survey. Participants were asked to share general reflections on challenges and successes they experienced, as well as their reflections on specific aspects of the course (e.g., experiences with instructors and peers). Interview transcripts were then coded to identify the types of experiences students reported, whether they were experienced as positive or negative, as well as the themes and features associated with those experiences. Experiences with the classroom, course structure, instructors, and exams were most frequently reported as negative. Experiences with peers, help-seeking, course curriculum, and specific learning activities were the most positive, though only experiences with peers had more positive reports than negative. We then used a resources vs. demands framework [Soc Personal Psychol Compass 7, 637 (2013)] to interpret the common instructional, cognitive, and motivational themes and features reported across multiple contexts. We discuss the implications of the results for theory and practice.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the displacement current: Two key examples showing when and why it can be neglected</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14737</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14737v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work examines the often-overlooked role of the displacement current in systems beyond capacitors, particularly in coaxial cables and resistors with alternating currents. While its influence is negligible at low frequencies compared to conduction currents, displacement current becomes crucial at higher frequencies for precise field calculations. Introductory physics textbooks commonly restrict the concept to capacitor charging, potentially leading to misconceptions about its broader applications and the interdependence of Maxwell's equations in dynamic scenarios. By analyzing two specific cases, we clarify when displacement current can be disregarded, when simplified laws like Biot-Savart are valid, and where coupled electromagnetic equations are essential. This approach highlights the boundaries of common models and promotes a deeper understanding of dynamic field interactions.</description>

      <title>MoNA -- The first 25 years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14612</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.14612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Modular Neutron Array (MoNA) collaboration was initiated in 2000 at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory (NSCL) at Michigan State University (MSU). Since then, the collaboration studied properties of nuclides at and beyond the neutron dripline discovering seven new isotopes between lithium to fluorine. The collaboration included liberal arts colleges, regional comprehensive universities, and major research universities with the focus of giving undergraduate students meaningful research experiences. Over the last 25 years, the combined efforts of hundreds of undergraduates, dozens of graduate students and research associates, and faculty from more than a dozen colleges and universities produced over fifty publications, won awards for research, and combined research and teaching in new and interesting ways.</description>

      <title>Assessing Students' Understanding of Uncertainty in Undergraduate Physics Laboratory Courses at a Major Canadian University: Longitudinal Results and Misconceptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.15382v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Over the last five years, McGill University's Office of Science Education (OSE) has partnered with faculty members from the Department of Physics to form an education working group with the aim of charting the progression of students' conceptual understanding of uncertainties across their undergraduate degree. The research conducted by this group seeks to provide further insight into both the experimental skill set that students gain through undergraduate laboratory courses and how the department could address noticeable gaps in student understanding. In this paper, we evaluate the conceptual understanding of uncertainty using the Concise Data Processing Assessment (CDPA) instrument. First, we characterize the physics laboratory curriculum at McGill University by evaluating the evolution of CDPA scores across consecutive laboratory courses, and further propose the utilization of this tool for identifying gaps in student understanding. Following the analysis of student responses (N=2023), we specifically investigate data collected in second-year courses to better diagnose what student errors can tell us about common misconceptions in experimental physics. This more in-depth research focuses on data collected from students at the beginning and the end of their first full year of experimental laboratory courses, consisting of two consecutive laboratory courses that build on each other. By the end of the second course, students have engaged with all the material covered in the CDPA test. Interestingly, there have been no changes in CDPA total scores throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. We notice a marked upward shift in student understanding; however, the results indicate that a significant portion of students continue to struggle with uncertainties, basic data analysis, and curve fitting.</description>
