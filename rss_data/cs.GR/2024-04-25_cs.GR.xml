      <title>DreamCraft: Text-Guided Generation of Functional 3D Environments in Minecraft</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15538</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15538v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Procedural Content Generation (PCG) algorithms enable the automatic generation of complex and diverse artifacts. However, they don't provide high-level control over the generated content and typically require domain expertise. In contrast, text-to-3D methods allow users to specify desired characteristics in natural language, offering a high amount of flexibility and expressivity. But unlike PCG, such approaches cannot guarantee functionality, which is crucial for certain applications like game design. In this paper, we present a method for generating functional 3D artifacts from free-form text prompts in the open-world game Minecraft. Our method, DreamCraft, trains quantized Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) to represent artifacts that, when viewed in-game, match given text descriptions. We find that DreamCraft produces more aligned in-game artifacts than a baseline that post-processes the output of an unconstrained NeRF. Thanks to the quantized representation of the environment, functional constraints can be integrated using specialized loss terms. We show how this can be leveraged to generate 3D structures that match a target distribution or obey certain adjacency rules over the block types. DreamCraft inherits a high degree of expressivity and controllability from the NeRF, while still being able to incorporate functional constraints through domain-specific objectives.</description>

      <title>CWF: Consolidating Weak Features in High-quality Mesh Simplification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15661v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In mesh simplification, common requirements like accuracy, triangle quality, and feature alignment are often considered as a trade-off. Existing algorithms concentrate on just one or a few specific aspects of these requirements. For example, the well-known Quadric Error Metrics (QEM) approach prioritizes accuracy and can preserve strong feature lines/points as well but falls short in ensuring high triangle quality and may degrade weak features that are not as distinctive as strong ones. In this paper, we propose a smooth functional that simultaneously considers all of these requirements. The functional comprises a normal anisotropy term and a Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) energy term, with the variables being a set of movable points lying on the surface. The former inherits the spirit of QEM but operates in a continuous setting, while the latter encourages even point distribution, allowing various surface metrics. We further introduce a decaying weight to automatically balance the two terms. We selected 100 CAD models from the ABC dataset, along with 21 organic models, to compare the existing mesh simplification algorithms with ours. Experimental results reveal an important observation: the introduction of a decaying weight effectively reduces the conflict between the two terms and enables the alignment of weak features. This distinctive feature sets our approach apart from most existing mesh simplification methods and demonstrates significant potential in shape understanding.</description>

      <title>Interactive Manipulation and Visualization of 3D Brain MRI for Surgical Training</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15293</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15293v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In modern medical diagnostics, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is an important technique that provides detailed insights into anatomical structures. In this paper, we present a comprehensive methodology focusing on streamlining the segmentation, reconstruction, and visualization process of 3D MRI data. Segmentation involves the extraction of anatomical regions with the help of state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms. Then, 3D reconstruction converts segmented data from the previous step into multiple 3D representations. Finally, the visualization stage provides efficient and interactive presentations of both 2D and 3D MRI data. Integrating these three steps, the proposed system is able to augment the interpretability of the anatomical information from MRI scans according to our interviews with doctors. Even though this system was originally designed and implemented as part of human brain haptic feedback simulation for surgeon training, it can also provide experienced medical practitioners with an effective tool for clinical data analysis, surgical planning and other purposes</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein: A Scalable Metric for Heterogeneous Joint Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15378</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15378v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Sliced Wasserstein (SW) and Generalized Sliced Wasserstein (GSW) have been widely used in applications due to their computational and statistical scalability. However, the SW and the GSW are only defined between distributions supported on a homogeneous domain. This limitation prevents their usage in applications with heterogeneous joint distributions with marginal distributions supported on multiple different domains. Using SW and GSW directly on the joint domains cannot make a meaningful comparison since their homogeneous slicing operator i.e., Radon Transform (RT) and Generalized Radon Transform (GRT) are not expressive enough to capture the structure of the joint supports set. To address the issue, we propose two new slicing operators i.e., Partial Generalized Radon Transform (PGRT) and Hierarchical Hybrid Radon Transform (HHRT). In greater detail, PGRT is the generalization of Partial Radon Transform (PRT), which transforms a subset of function arguments non-linearly while HHRT is the composition of PRT and multiple domain-specific PGRT on marginal domain arguments. By using HHRT, we extend the SW into Hierarchical Hybrid Sliced Wasserstein (H2SW) distance which is designed specifically for comparing heterogeneous joint distributions. We then discuss the topological, statistical, and computational properties of H2SW. Finally, we demonstrate the favorable performance of H2SW in 3D mesh deformation, deep 3D mesh autoencoders, and datasets comparison.</description>

      <title>Sketch2Human: Deep Human Generation with Disentangled Geometry and Appearance Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15889</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15889v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Geometry- and appearance-controlled full-body human image generation is an interesting but challenging task. Existing solutions are either unconditional or dependent on coarse conditions (e.g., pose, text), thus lacking explicit geometry and appearance control of body and garment. Sketching offers such editing ability and has been adopted in various sketch-based face generation and editing solutions. However, directly adapting sketch-based face generation to full-body generation often fails to produce high-fidelity and diverse results due to the high complexity and diversity in the pose, body shape, and garment shape and texture. Recent geometrically controllable diffusion-based methods mainly rely on prompts to generate appearance and it is hard to balance the realism and the faithfulness of their results to the sketch when the input is coarse. This work presents Sketch2Human, the first system for controllable full-body human image generation guided by a semantic sketch (for geometry control) and a reference image (for appearance control). Our solution is based on the latent space of StyleGAN-Human with inverted geometry and appearance latent codes as input. Specifically, we present a sketch encoder trained with a large synthetic dataset sampled from StyleGAN-Human's latent space and directly supervised by sketches rather than real images. Considering the entangled information of partial geometry and texture in StyleGAN-Human and the absence of disentangled datasets, we design a novel training scheme that creates geometry-preserved and appearance-transferred training data to tune a generator to achieve disentangled geometry and appearance control. Although our method is trained with synthetic data, it can handle hand-drawn sketches as well. Qualitative and quantitative evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our method to state-of-the-art methods.</description>

      <title>The State of the Art in Visual Analytics for 3D Urban Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Urbanization has amplified the importance of three-dimensional structures in urban environments for a wide range of phenomena that are of significant interest to diverse stakeholders. With the growing availability of 3D urban data, numerous studies have focused on developing visual analysis techniques tailored to the unique characteristics of urban environments. However, incorporating the third dimension into visual analytics introduces additional challenges in designing effective visual tools to tackle urban data's diverse complexities. In this paper, we present a survey on visual analytics of 3D urban data. Our work characterizes published works along three main dimensions (why, what, and how), considering use cases, analysis tasks, data, visualizations, and interactions. We provide a fine-grained categorization of published works from visualization journals and conferences, as well as from a myriad of urban domains, including urban planning, architecture, and engineering. By incorporating perspectives from both urban and visualization experts, we identify literature gaps, motivate visualization researchers to understand challenges and opportunities, and indicate future research directions.</description>

      <title>A Hierarchical Architecture for Neural Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.10135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.10135v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Neural reflectance models are capable of reproducing the spatially-varying appearance of many real-world materials at different scales. Unfortunately, existing techniques such as NeuMIP have difficulties handling materials with strong shadowing effects or detailed specular highlights. In this paper, we introduce a neural appearance model that offers a new level of accuracy. Central to our model is an inception-based core network structure that captures material appearances at multiple scales using parallel-operating kernels and ensures multi-stage features through specialized convolution layers. Furthermore, we encode the inputs into frequency space, introduce a gradient-based loss, and employ it adaptive to the progress of the learning phase. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method using a variety of synthetic and real examples.</description>

      <title>Structure-Guided Image Completion with Image-level and Object-level Semantic Discriminators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.06310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2212.06310v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Structure-guided image completion aims to inpaint a local region of an image according to an input guidance map from users. While such a task enables many practical applications for interactive editing, existing methods often struggle to hallucinate realistic object instances in complex natural scenes. Such a limitation is partially due to the lack of semantic-level constraints inside the hole region as well as the lack of a mechanism to enforce realistic object generation. In this work, we propose a learning paradigm that consists of semantic discriminators and object-level discriminators for improving the generation of complex semantics and objects. Specifically, the semantic discriminators leverage pretrained visual features to improve the realism of the generated visual concepts. Moreover, the object-level discriminators take aligned instances as inputs to enforce the realism of individual objects. Our proposed scheme significantly improves the generation quality and achieves state-of-the-art results on various tasks, including segmentation-guided completion, edge-guided manipulation and panoptically-guided manipulation on Places2 datasets. Furthermore, our trained model is flexible and can support multiple editing use cases, such as object insertion, replacement, removal and standard inpainting. In particular, our trained model combined with a novel automatic image completion pipeline achieves state-of-the-art results on the standard inpainting task.</description>

      <title>ZeroNVS: Zero-Shot 360-Degree View Synthesis from a Single Image</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.17994v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a 3D-aware diffusion model, ZeroNVS, for single-image novel view synthesis for in-the-wild scenes. While existing methods are designed for single objects with masked backgrounds, we propose new techniques to address challenges introduced by in-the-wild multi-object scenes with complex backgrounds. Specifically, we train a generative prior on a mixture of data sources that capture object-centric, indoor, and outdoor scenes. To address issues from data mixture such as depth-scale ambiguity, we propose a novel camera conditioning parameterization and normalization scheme. Further, we observe that Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) tends to truncate the distribution of complex backgrounds during distillation of 360-degree scenes, and propose "SDS anchoring" to improve the diversity of synthesized novel views. Our model sets a new state-of-the-art result in LPIPS on the DTU dataset in the zero-shot setting, even outperforming methods specifically trained on DTU. We further adapt the challenging Mip-NeRF 360 dataset as a new benchmark for single-image novel view synthesis, and demonstrate strong performance in this setting. Our code and data are at http://kylesargent.github.io/zeronvs/</description>

      <title>Mosaic-SDF for 3D Generative Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09222</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.09222v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Current diffusion or flow-based generative models for 3D shapes divide to two: distilling pre-trained 2D image diffusion models, and training directly on 3D shapes. When training a diffusion or flow models on 3D shapes a crucial design choice is the shape representation. An effective shape representation needs to adhere three design principles: it should allow an efficient conversion of large 3D datasets to the representation form; it should provide a good tradeoff of approximation power versus number of parameters; and it should have a simple tensorial form that is compatible with existing powerful neural architectures. While standard 3D shape representations such as volumetric grids and point clouds do not adhere to all these principles simultaneously, we advocate in this paper a new representation that does. We introduce Mosaic-SDF (M-SDF): a simple 3D shape representation that approximates the Signed Distance Function (SDF) of a given shape by using a set of local grids spread near the shape's boundary. The M-SDF representation is fast to compute for each shape individually making it readily parallelizable; it is parameter efficient as it only covers the space around the shape's boundary; and it has a simple matrix form, compatible with Transformer-based architectures. We demonstrate the efficacy of the M-SDF representation by using it to train a 3D generative flow model including class-conditioned generation with the 3D Warehouse dataset, and text-to-3D generation using a dataset of about 600k caption-shape pairs.</description>

      <title>Open Your Ears and Take a Look: A State-of-the-Art Report on the Integration of Sonification and Visualization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.16558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.16558v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The research communities studying visualization and sonification for data display and analysis share exceptionally similar goals, essentially making data of any kind interpretable to humans. One community does so by using visual representations of data, and the other community employs auditory (non-speech) representations of data. While the two communities have a lot in common, they developed mostly in parallel over the course of the last few decades. With this STAR, we discuss a collection of work that bridges the borders of the two communities, hence a collection of work that aims to integrate the two techniques into one form of audiovisual display, which we argue to be "more than the sum of the two."
  We introduce and motivate a classification system applicable to such audiovisual displays and categorize a corpus of 57 academic publications that appeared between 2011 and 2023 in categories such as reading level, dataset type, or evaluation system, to mention a few. The corpus also enables a meta-analysis of the field, including regularly occurring design patterns such as type of visualization and sonification techniques, or the use of visual and auditory channels, showing an overall diverse field with different designs. An analysis of a co-author network of the field shows individual teams without many interconnections. The body of work covered in this STAR also relates to three adjacent topics: audiovisual monitoring, accessibility, and audiovisual data art. These three topics are discussed individually in addition to the systematically conducted part of this research. The findings of this report may be used by researchers from both fields to understand the potentials and challenges of such integrated designs while hopefully inspiring them to collaborate with experts from the respective other field.</description>

      <title>NToP: NeRF-Powered Large-scale Dataset Generation for 2D and 3D Human Pose Estimation in Top-View Fisheye Images</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18196v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human pose estimation (HPE) in the top-view using fisheye cameras presents a promising and innovative application domain. However, the availability of datasets capturing this viewpoint is extremely limited, especially those with high-quality 2D and 3D keypoint annotations. Addressing this gap, we leverage the capabilities of Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) technique to establish a comprehensive pipeline for generating human pose datasets from existing 2D and 3D datasets, specifically tailored for the top-view fisheye perspective. Through this pipeline, we create a novel dataset NToP570K (NeRF-powered Top-view human Pose dataset for fisheye cameras with over 570 thousand images), and conduct an extensive evaluation of its efficacy in enhancing neural networks for 2D and 3D top-view human pose estimation. A pretrained ViTPose-B model achieves an improvement in AP of 33.3 % on our validation set for 2D HPE after finetuning on our training set. A similarly finetuned HybrIK-Transformer model gains 53.7 mm reduction in PA-MPJPE for 3D HPE on the validation set.</description>

      <title>NoiseNCA: Noisy Seed Improves Spatio-Temporal Continuity of Neural Cellular Automata</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06279</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06279v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) is a class of Cellular Automata where the update rule is parameterized by a neural network that can be trained using gradient descent. In this paper, we focus on NCA models used for texture synthesis, where the update rule is inspired by partial differential equations (PDEs) describing reaction-diffusion systems. To train the NCA model, the spatio-termporal domain is discretized, and Euler integration is used to numerically simulate the PDE. However, whether a trained NCA truly learns the continuous dynamic described by the corresponding PDE or merely overfits the discretization used in training remains an open question. We study NCA models at the limit where space-time discretization approaches continuity. We find that existing NCA models tend to overfit the training discretization, especially in the proximity of the initial condition, also called "seed". To address this, we propose a solution that utilizes uniform noise as the initial condition. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in preserving the consistency of NCA dynamics across a wide range of spatio-temporal granularities. Our improved NCA model enables two new test-time interactions by allowing continuous control over the speed of pattern formation and the scale of the synthesized patterns. We demonstrate this new NCA feature in our interactive online demo. Our work reveals that NCA models can learn continuous dynamics and opens new venues for NCA research from a dynamical systems' perspective.</description>
