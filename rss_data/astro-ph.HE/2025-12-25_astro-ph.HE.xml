      <title>Simultaneous JWST, NuSTAR, and VLA Monitoring of Sgr A*: A Unified Picture of the Variable IR, X-ray and Radio Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flux variability is a fundamental channel of information from Sgr A* because of its direct probe of processes occurring within an accretion disk under strong gravity. We present simultaneous IR, X-ray and radio observations of Sgr A* on 2024 Apr 05 using JWST, NuSTAR, and VLA. We report the detection of a strong X-ray flare with a luminosity of $\sim5.2x10^{35}$ erg/s coincident with a bright near-IR flare, and a brightening in radio about an hour later. We investigate the candidate physical mechanisms for the X-ray flare emission and conclude that this can best be explained by inverse Compton scattering of near-IR flare radiation. We propose a dynamic scenario analogous to a coronal mass ejection in which a magnetic flux rope is ejected from Sgr A*'s inner accretion flow with a current sheet extending down from the rope to the bulk of the accretion flow. Reconnection within the sheet produces oppositely directed flows of accelerated particles moving upwards towards the rope and downwards towards the accretion flow. Infrared radiation from the approaching energetic electrons is enhanced by beaming and up-scattered by thermal electrons in the accretion flow to produce the strong X-ray flare. Meanwhile, the relativistic electrons moving in the opposite direction away from the disk experience weaker magnetic fields so radiate at longer wavelengths by feeding into the magnetic flux tube and adiabatically cooled during its subsequent expansion. This physical picture attempts to unify the origin of the variable emission from Sgr A* at IR, X-ray and radio/submm wavelengths.</description>

      <title>Universal relations between the quasinormal modes of neutron stars and magnetic tidal deformability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20867</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20867v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Tidal deformabilities are one of the observable quantities characterizing neutron stars, which are strongly associated with the stellar compactness, the ratio of the stellar mass to the radius. In addition to the tidal deformability, the quasinormal modes excited in a neutron star are also an important property for extracting information about the neutron star interior, adopting gravitational wave asteroseismology. In this study, we especially focus on the magnetic tidal deformability, which acts on the gravitational waveform from a neutron star binary merger as a higher-order effect than the electric tidal deformability, and derive the universal relations expressing the quasinormal modes, such as the fundamental ($f$-), 1st pressure ($p_1$-), and 1st spacetime ($w_1$-) modes, as a function of the magnetic tidal deformability. The universal relations derived in this study exhibit accuracy more or less comparable to those of the electric tidal deformability.</description>

      <title>Considering lensing effect on gravitational wave signals from black holes in mass gap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The pair-instability supernova (PISN) mechanism predicts a mass gap in the black hole population, where no stellar-origin black holes are expected to form. However, the binary black hole merger events GW190521 and GW231123 appear unusual, as current analyses place their component masses within the PISN mass gap. In this work, we investigate the relationship between different lensing magnifications and the inferred source-frame black hole masses for these two events. If the gravitational wave source is lensed, neglecting lensing effect can bias the inferred luminosity distance and hence the redshift, leading to an underestimation of the luminosity distance and consequently an overestimation of the source-frame masses, potentially placing them in the mass-gap region. For the two events in mass gap, when adopting a lower bound of $60 M_{\odot}$ for the mass gap, the minimum magnifications required to shift the inferred source-frame masses below this gap boundary are found to be $\mu=12.2$ for GW190521 and $\mu=320.1$ for GW231123, corresponding to lensing-corrected luminosity distances of $11155\, \mathrm{Mpc}$ and $15207\, \mathrm{Mpc}$, respectively. These results provide a quantitative reference for assessing the lensing hypothesis as a possible explanation for the existence of black holes in the PISN mass gap.</description>

      <title>GW241011 and GW241110: Hints of Hierarchical Mergers from the Merger Entropy Index</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20965v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: GW241011 and GW241110 both exhibit extremely asymmetric masses, high primary spins, and significant spin-orbit misalignment, which challenge the formation of first-generation binary black hole mergers formed from stellar collapse. This implies that these two gravitational wave events might originate from the hierarchical merger mechanism, with at least one of the black holes being the remnant of a previous merger. Here we investigate the origin of hierarchical mergers for GW241011 and GW241110 using the merger entropy index which measures the efficiency of entropy transfer for binary black hole mergers in general relativity. We find that GW241011 is consistent with hierarchical mergers in dense star clusters. The origin of GW241110 remains under debate due to its large distribution uncertainty, which leads to method-dependent inference and should be taken into account when interpreting this event in terms of hierarchical mergers.</description>

      <title>IMPACTX: An X-ray Spectral Model for Polar Dust and Clumpy Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20993</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20993v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a generic X-ray spectral model for the reflection component from the clumpy torus and dusty gas in the polar region (polar dusty gas) in an active galactic nucleus (AGN), designated as Inclusive spectral energy distribution Model of Polar dust And Clumpy Torus for X-ray (IMPACTX). To calculate the spectra, we utilize the Monte-Carlo based, 3-dimensional radiative transfer code SKIRT. The adopted geometry is the same as that of the IMPACT model (Ogawa et al. in prep.), consisting of a clumpy torus defined by Nenkova et al. (2008) and paraboloid-shell polar dusty gas launched at the inner radius of the torus. We discuss the dependence of the X-ray spectrum on geometrical parameters in comparison with the conventional torus-only model (XCLUMPY). As an example, we have simultaneously applied the IMPACTX and IMPACT models to the X-ray and infrared spectra of the nearby Seyfert 2 galaxy NGC 4388, and have found a solution that can well reproduce both spectra. This demonstrates the importance of using both X-ray and infrared data to constrain the nuclear structure of an AGN.</description>

      <title>Evolution of the 2021 Outburst of GX 339-4 with AstroSat</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of the 2021 outburst of GX 339-4 using AstroSat observations in the hard-intermediate (HIMS) and soft-intermediate states (SIMS). Spectral and timing analyses across these states suggest that during the SIMS, unabsorbed flux (0.1-3 keV), inner disc temperature, and "apparent" inner disc radius do not change, suggesting the stability of the disc. In the SIMS, the photon index decreases from 2.1 to 1.7, indicating spectral hardening. The power density spectra (PDS) suggest the presence of quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) in the HIMS and SIMS. The QPO frequency evolves from 0.1 Hz to 0.2 Hz in the HIMS, and further to 5.7 Hz in the SIMS. We also observe a decrease in QPO frequency from 5.7 Hz to 4.5 Hz during the SIMS. We discuss the evolution of the QPO, fractional root mean square (rms) amplitude, and time-lag spectra. We discover that variations in disc normalization, disc temperature, and coronal heating rate can reproduce the observed rms and lag spectra with a time delay between them.</description>

      <title>Exploring the Role of Vector Potential and Plasma-$\beta$ in Jet Formation from Magnetized Accretion Flows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate how the choice of initial vector potential and plasma parameters influences the development of accretion columns and jet formation in magnetized accretion flows. Using general relativistic magnetohydrodynamic simulations, we explore two different configurations of the vector potential $A_{\phi}$ and three plasma beta values $\beta$ = 50, 100, 500. We analyze how variations in the poloidal magnetic field strength and plasma magnetization affect magnetic flux accumulation near the black hole and the subsequent growth of the accretion column. Our results highlight the dependence of jet launching efficiency and accretion dynamics on the initial magnetic field topology and plasma beta, offering insight into the conditions that favor magnetically arrested disk or standard and normal evolution states.</description>

      <title>Assessing systematic uncertainties from spectral re-analysis of Cyg X-1 with different coronal geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21230</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21230v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we carry out a new spectral reanalysis of NuSTAR and Suzaku observations of the disk reflection spectra in the stellar-mass black hole X-ray binary Cyg~X-1. We compare three types of models: a broken power-law disk emissivity profile with no assumption about the coronal shape used in the previous work of the same observations, a compact lamppost corona, and an extended disk-like corona motivated by recent X-ray polarization results. Our goal is to measure the systematic uncertainties caused by the assumed geometry, with a focus on key parameters such as the black hole spin and the inclination of the inner accretion disk. We find that the disk-like corona gives a fit that is statistically similar to the broken power-law and lamppost models, but it leads to more physically reasonable results, such as a lower inclination angle of about $30^{\circ}$. By using a variable disk density model, we measure the disk density to be $n_{\rm e}\approx10^{20}$\,cm$^{-3}$, which is similar to earlier results. While the extended corona model infers a wider allowed parameter space for black hole spin and the inner radius of the disk-shaped coronal region, this reflects the additional physical freedom of the model. Even so, the disk-like corona remains a strong and physically well-motivated candidate for explaining the X-ray emission from Cyg~X-1.</description>

      <title>Minijets and Broken Stationarity in a Blazar : Novel Insights into the Origin of $\gamma$-ray Variability in CTA 102</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-energy blazar light curves, in X-rays and beyond, have historically preferred a log-normal flux distribution, signifying multiplicative processes either in the jet itself or due to connection(s) with accretion. Here we present 18 year archival Fermi-LAT light curves (0.1-100 GeV) of the flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) CTA 102 from August 2008 to November 2025, which underwent a huge flare in 2017, with a $\sim$ factor of 100 jump in $\gamma$-ray flux, along with similar flaring in X-rays. Our statistical analyses confirm that neither the pre nor the post-flare total GeV light curves follow a strictly log-normal distribution. Instead, we observe a statistically significant reduction in skewness from the pre to the post-flare light curves, which implies the blazar transitioned from an energetic state with frequent flaring to a more plateaued state with occasional flaring. We further find that this state transition can be explained through magnetic relaxation, where many reconnection events caused the 2017 flare, after which the magnetic field was ordered and its energy reached a minimum. To explain this further, we use a Monte Carlo simulation of a modified minijets-in-a-jet model where GeV flares are produced only when a maximum number of minijets move toward the broad line region and towards the line of sight, in the context of an external Compton model. The flux distributions (both observed and simulated) could be fit by a modified log-normal power-law distribution, implying our minijets model can reproduce the GeV flares in CTA 102 as well as their flux distributions.</description>

      <title>ZTF SN Ia DR2 follow-up: Characterization of subluminous Type Ia supernovae in the ZTF DR2 full sample</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.21256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Zwicky Transient Facility Data Release 2 (ZTF DR2) includes a total of 3,628 Type Ia supernovae (SNe~Ia), providing the largest and most complete sample of spectroscopically confirmed SNe~Ia at low redshift to date. In this paper, we present a photometric and spectroscopic analysis of 124 subluminous SNe~Ia, the largest sample of spectroscopically classified subluminous SNe~Ia observed with a single instrument, comprising 87 91bg-like, 12 86G-like, 18 04gs-like, and 7 02es-like events. We complement the published DR2 SALT2 light-curve parameters with new parameters obtained using template-based fits from SNooPy. Expansion velocities and pseudo-equivalent widths pEW of key spectral features are measured using Spextractor, and spectral averages are constructed for each subluminous subtype, binned by phase. We also analyze the host galaxy environments, both global and local, in terms of $g - z$ color, stellar mass, and directional light radius $d_{DLR}$. We find that all subluminous SNe~Ia (except the 02es-like subtype) are intrinsically red. This is evident by separating extrinsic from intrinsic color components. Since SALT2 is not trained on subluminous SNe~Ia, it compensates for their redder colors by inflating the $c$ parameter, thus extending the luminosity-width relation to negative values of x1. As expected, all subluminous SNe~Ia fall within the Cool region of the Branch et al. (2006) diagram, with the exception of 02es-like events, which show lower Si II 5972 pEW values. All subluminous subtypes tend to occur in more massive, redder host galaxies, and in the reddest local environments. Notably, 91bg- and 86G-like SNe~Ia explode at significantly larger normalized galactocentric distances. Finally, we identify the $pEW$ of the blended Ti II+Si II+Mg II absorption feature at 4300~A, along with s_BV, as robust and sufficient indicators for subclassifying subluminous SNe~Ia.</description>

      <title>A novel sub-grid model for super-Eddington accretion of spinning black holes in galaxy-scale simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19281v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Super-Eddington accretion has been proposed to explain the existence of black holes (BHs) with masses exceeding a billion solar masses within the first billion years after the Big Bang. We present a novel accretion disc-based sub-grid model for BH mass and spin evolution in the super-Eddington regime, implemented in the hydrodynamics code GIZMO. In our model, motivated by results of radiation-hydrodynamics simulations of accretion discs, the growth of the BH is mediated by a sub-grid accretion disc, comprising an inner photon-trapping region described by simulation-based fitting formulae and an outer thin $\alpha$-disc with three regions. We incorporate a self-consistent spin evolution prescription that transitions between the Bardeen-Petterson effect and inner thick-disc precession, depending on the accretion rate. We perform a suite of idealised simulations of a BH embedded in a gaseous circumnuclear disc and a spherically distributed stellar component to explore the conditions under which super-Eddington accretion can be sustained in the environment of a realistic galactic nucleus. Simulations with misaligned gas inflows onto an initially aligned BH-disc system yield very high Eddington ratios, triggered by the rapid removal of disc angular momentum via inflows. These results highlight the importance of angular momentum misalignment in enabling super-Eddington accretion and suggest that such episodes are difficult to trigger unless the system resides in a highly dynamical environment -- a condition more likely to occur in high-redshift galaxies. Our model potentially provides a way to grow moderate-mass BH seeds to the sizes required to explain the bright high-redshift quasars.</description>

      <title>Comparing next-generation detector configurations for high-redshift gravitational wave sources with neural posterior estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20699</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.20699v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The coming decade will be crucial for determining the final design and configuration of a global network of next-generation (XG) gravitational-wave (GW) detectors, including the Einstein Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). In this study and for the first time, we assess the performance of various network configurations using neural posterior estimation (NPE) implemented in Dingo-IS-a method based on normalizing flows and importance sampling that enables fast and accurate inference. We focus on a specific science case involving short-duration, massive and high-redshift binary black hole (BBH) mergers with detector-frame chirp masses $M_{\mathrm{d}} &gt; 100$ M$_\odot$. These systems encompass early-Universe stellar and primordial black holes, as well as intermediate-mass black-hole binaries, for which XG observatories are expected to deliver major discoveries. Validation against standard Bayesian inference demonstrates that NPE robustly reproduces complex and disconnected posterior structures across all network configurations. For a network of two misaligned L-shaped ET detectors (2L MisA), the posterior distributions on luminosity distance can become multimodal and degenerate with the sky position, leading to less precise distance estimates compared to the triangular ET configuration. However, the number of sky-location multimodalities is substantially lower than the eight expected with the triangular ET, resulting in improved sky and volume localization. Adding CE to the network further reduces sky-position degeneracies, and the better performance of the 2L MisA configuration over the triangle remains evident.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20834v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the tremendous impact of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) on the field of cosmology, their underlying physics are still poorly understood. Studies have found an intriguing correlation between standardized Type Ia supernova (SN Ia) luminosities and host galaxy masses, commonly referred to as the "mass step". SNe Ia in massive galaxies appear systematically brighter than in lower-mass, star-forming hosts after standardization. However, previous analyses use host galaxy mass estimates derived largely from optical data alone and assume parametric forms for host star formation histories (SFHs), both of which are known to misestimate galaxy stellar masses. In this work, we re-examine the mass-step relation with a sample of SN Ia host galaxies complete in broadband optical (3000 Angstrom to 1 micron) and near-infrared (up to 1.8 micron) data, and in some cases including mid-infrared observations (up to 4.5 micron), using Prospector to derive nonparametric SFHs. We find that while the masses for these galaxies have indeed been underestimated, the overall trend in SN Ia luminosity versus host mass remains largely unchanged. We also uncover an environmental metallicity-dependent trend, in which low-metallicity galaxies (Z &lt; -1 Zsol) may drive much of the observed SN Ia luminosity-mass correlation, suggesting that the chemical composition of the SN environment plays a central role in shaping the standardized brightness of SNe Ia.</description>

      <title>The polar IL Leo in a low accretion state</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.20955v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We performed an optical study of the magnetic period-bouncer candidate IL Leo. Long-term photometric analysis over $\approx 20$ years reveals multiple state transitions. Modelling the ultraviolet and optical spectral energy distribution refined the white dwarf parameters, yielding a mass of $M_\textrm{wd} = 0.74 \pm 0.05 M_{\odot}$ and an effective temperature of $T_\mathrm{eff} = 12700 \pm 360$ K. We analyzed phase-resolved spectroscopy obtained with the 6-m BTA telescope and the VLT during the low state. Orbital variability of the H$\alpha$ emission, inferred from dynamical spectra and Doppler tomograms, suggests that it originates in the accretion stream. Zeeman splitting gives a mean magnetic field of $B = 40.7 \pm 0.5$ MG. Modelling two sets of cyclotron spectra determined a low-state accretion rate of $\dot{M} = (2.5 - 4.1) \times 10^{-13}~M_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a magnetic field of $B_\mathrm{m} \approx 41$ MG near magnetic pole.</description>

      <title>Axion-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate axion-photon conversion in stochastic magnetic fields, focusing on the evolution of the photon intensity and polarizations induced by conversion into axions. Assuming Gaussian magnetic fields characterized by the power spectra of their helical/non-helical components, we express the expectation values and variances of the photon intensity and linear/circular polarizations after conversion in terms of these spectra. We find nontrivial dependencies of these statistical quantities on the characteristic magnetic field correlation length, the propagation distance, and the axion mass. Moreover, we find that nontrivial polarizations emerge even if the photons are initially unpolarized, that the variances of these observables become suppressed in specific frequency regions, and that a peak structure arises in the expectation value of the circular polarization in the presence of statistically helical magnetic fields. We also point out consistency relations among these statistical quantities that hold independently of the specific forms of the magnetic field power spectra.</description>

      <title>The disc instability model: original recipe and additional ingredients</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.21188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The disc instability model successfully reproduces many of the observed properties of cataclysmic variables. However, additional ingredients such as mass-transfer variations, disc irradiation, stream-disc overflow, or inner-disc truncation must be included to explain certain systems. The physics underlying these processes is often poorly constrained, and our lack of knowledge is typically absorbed into extra free parameters, much like the $\alpha$-prescription for viscosity. In this paper, I examine how each of these ingredients affects the predicted light curves and discuss the limitations that arise from the growing number of unconstrained parameters on the model's predictive power.</description>

      <title>Data-driven core collapse supernova multilateration with first neutrino events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11984</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11984v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Galactic core-collapse supernova (CCSN) is likely to be observed in neutrino detectors around the world minutes to hours before the electromagnetic radiation arrives. The SNEWS2.0 network of neutrino and dark matter detectors aims to use the relative arrival times of the neutrinos at the different experiments to point back to the supernova so as to facilitate follow-up observation. One of the simplest methods to estimate the CCSN direction is to use the first neutrino events detected through the inverse beta decay (IBD) process, $\overline{\nu}_e p\rightarrow e^+n$. We will consider neutrino detectors sensitive to IBD interactions with low backgrounds. The difference in signal arrival times between a large and a small detector will be biased, however, with the first event at the smaller detector, on average, arriving later than that at the larger detector. This bias can be mitigated by using these first events in a data-driven approach without recourse to simulations or models. The resulting method requires, at minimum, only the times of the first events at most detectors, along with a longer time series of events from one larger detector to act as a reference lightcurve. In this article, we demonstrate this method and its uncertainty estimate using pairs of detectors of different sizes and with different supernova distances. Finally, we use this method to calculate probability skymaps using four detectors currently in operation (Super-Kamiokande, JUNO, LVD, and SNO+) and show that the calculated probabilities yield appropriate confidence intervals for all supernova directions. The area of the 68\% confidence interval varies by distance and direction, but is expected to be a few thousand square degrees. The resulting skymaps should be useful for the multi-messenger community as a rapid, initial pointing to follow up on the SNEWS2.0 Galactic CCSN neutrino alert.</description>

      <title>A Novel Technique for Long-term Timing of Redback Millisecond Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.08688v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present timing solutions spanning nearly two decades for five redback (RB) systems found in globular clusters (GC), created using a novel technique that effectively "isolates" the pulsar. By accurately measuring the time of passage through periastron ($T_0$) at points over the timing baseline, we use a piecewise-continuous, binary model to get local solutions of the orbital variations that we pair with long-term orbital information to remove the orbital timing delays. The isolated pulse times of arrival can then be fit to describe the spin behavior of the millisecond pulsar (MSP). The results of our timing analyses via this method are consistent with those of conventional timing methods for binaries in GCs as demonstrated by analyses of NGC 6440D. We also investigate the observed orbital phase variations for these systems. Quasi-periodic oscillations in Terzan 5P's orbit may be the result of changes to the gravitational-quadruple moment of the companion as prescribed by the Applegate model. We find a striking correlation between the standard deviation of the phase variations as a fraction of a system's orbit ($\sigma_{\Delta T_0}$) and the MSP's spin frequency, as well as a potential correlation between $\sigma_{\Delta T_0}$ and the binary's projected semi-major axis. While long-term RB timing is fraught with large systematics, our work provides a needed alternative for studying systems with significant orbital variations, especially when high-cadence monitoring observations are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Chromatic activity window of periodic FRBs: FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04609v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Two fast radio bursts, FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B, show periodic activity with cycles of 159.3 and 16.33 days, respectively. These cycles consist of active and inactive windows, with peak activity centered within the active phase. For FRB 20180916B, studies have reported a frequency-dependent-or ``chromatic''-behaviour, where the activity window starts earlier and becomes narrower at higher frequencies. The activity across frequencies is typically modeled with a power law. In this work, we develop a simple model that combines the phase and frequency dependence of the activity windows of FRB 20121102A and FRB 20180916B. Our goal is to perform a chromaticity study for FRB 20121102A, incorporating model improvements to account for the cyclic nature of its activity window, and to compare the chromatic behaviour between both periodic FRBs. We standardise the detections from the 425 observing epochs for FRB 20121102A and the 214 epochs for FRB 20180916B to account for differences in radio telescope sensitivity. To the normalised detection rate phase distribution, we fit a von Mises distribution and extract the peak activity phase and activity width. These quantities, as a function of frequency, are then modelled as power-laws to construct the chromatic model. For both sources, the activity window starts earlier at higher frequencies. However, FRB 20121102A shows an activity window broadening at higher frequencies, while FRB 20180916B broadens at lower frequencies. Interestingly, it appears to remain active during at least 80% of the cycle at C-band. The observed chromatic behaviour of FRB 20180916B is consistent with previous findings. For FRB 20121102A, a chromaticity in its activity window is also seen; however, the source appears to be active for longer at higher frequencies, opposite to the behaviour of FRB 20180916B.</description>

      <title>On the optical emission in the mini-outburst of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19645v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the optical emission of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1348-630 during its 2019 minioutburst. Using optical data from the Las Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope and X-ray data from Insight-HXMT, we performed time delay analysis, optical-X-ray correlation analysis, and spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. Our key findings are as follows: (1) The X-ray Comptonization flux lags behind the optical emission by about 8.5 days, a delay naturally explained by the disk instability model (DIM). (2) The optical and X-ray fluxes show a power-law correlation with a slope about 0.4, which lies between the predicted values for viscous heating and X-ray reprocessing, consistent with the DIM framework. (3) SED fitting with the irradiated disk model successfully reproduces the quasi-simultaneous optical and X-ray data, and the contribution of the jet is negligible. Our results indicate that the optical emission during the mini-outburst originates from the disk, rather than the jet or hot accretion flow, and highlight the critical role of the DIM in understanding the mini-outburst of X-ray binaries.</description>

      <title>Polarization Dynamics of X-Ray Synchrotron Emission from a Multi-Zone Blazar Jet</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13776</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.13776v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The polarization of X-ray synchrotron emission in blazars directly probes the magnetic field geometry and particle acceleration processes in relativistic jets. We use particle-in-cell simulations of magnetic reconnection and magnetized turbulence, coupled to polarization-sensitive radiative transfer code, to interpret IXPE observations of Mrk 421 during a high flux state recorded in December of 2023. To evaluate the fitness of the two theoretical scenarios, we rely on a quantitative comparison of the statistical properties of simulated and observed X-ray flux and polarization light curves using five evaluation metrics, rather than attempting to fit individual data points. We propose a turbulence-driven multi-zone model where jet emission is represented as the sum of the radiative output of N independent cells, each described by a particle-in-cell simulation. Comparison of ensembles of simulated Stokes-parameter light curves with IXPE data shows that magnetic reconnection dominated models provide the best match to the observed X-ray flux and polarization dynamics. The optimal configuration corresponds to N = 15 emitting cells, which reproduces the observed amplitudes and timescales of the X-ray flux and polarization variations. Magnetized turbulence models underpredict both the flux and polarization variability. Our results indicate that a multi-zone, reconnection-powered emission scenario can describe the X-ray polarization behavior of Mrk 421 and establish a quantitative framework for testing theoretical models against IXPE observations of other high-synchrotron-peaked blazars.</description>

Abstract: We apply the recently developed analysis of 16 years of INTEGRAL/SPI data including a dark matter spatial template to derive bounds on dark matter candidates lighter than WIMPs (like sterile neutrinos or axion-like particles) decaying into line or continuum electromagnetic final state channels. The bounds obtained are the strongest to date for dark matter masses between $\sim $60 keV and $\sim$16 MeV experiencing two-body decays producing photon lines.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2407.10339v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The determination of the direction of a stellar core collapse via its neutrino emission is crucial for the identification of the progenitor for a multimessenger follow-up. A highly effective method of reconstructing supernova directions within the Deep Underground Neutrino Experiment (DUNE) is introduced. The supernova neutrino pointing resolution is studied by simulating and reconstructing electron-neutrino charged-current absorption on 40Ar and elastic scattering of neutrinos on electrons. Procedures to reconstruct individual interactions, including a newly developed technique called ``brems flipping'', as well as the burst direction from an ensemble of interactions are described. Performance of the burst direction reconstruction is evaluated for supernovae happening at a distance of 10 kpc for a specific supernova burst flux model. The pointing resolution is found to be 3.4 degrees at 68% coverage for a perfect interaction-channel classification and a fiducial mass of 40 kton, and 6.6 degrees for a 10 kton fiducial mass respectively. Assuming a 4% rate of charged-current interactions being misidentified as elastic scattering, DUNE's burst pointing resolution is found to be 4.3 degrees (8.7 degrees) at 68% coverage.</description>

      <title>Kinetic theory and the speed of sound in dense matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.19770v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We discuss a constraint on the speed of sound, $c_s^2$, derived from relativistic kinetic theory and show how it can be expressed in terms of the average sound speed, $\langle c_s^2 \rangle$. This reformulation highlights the interplay between instantaneous and integrated stiffness of the equation of state and allows the kinetic-theory bound to be visualized as a restriction in the $c_s^2$-$\langle c_s^2 \rangle $ plane.</description>
