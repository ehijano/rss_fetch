      <title>Z(3) Metastable Bubbles and Chiral Dynamics Across a Dark-QCD Deconfinement Transition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15342</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15342v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a self-contained theoretical analysis of a dark-QCD chiral transition in which the Polyakov-loop sector retains an explicit $Z(3)$ structure and couples consistently to the chiral order parameter.Working within a coupled chiral--Polyakov effective theory, we map the homogeneous vacuum landscape and identify a metastability window bounded by spinodal loss of stability.We then construct $Z(3)$ domain-wall solutions including chiral backreaction, extracting temperature-dependent wall profiles and surface tension.Finally, we connect homogeneous metastability and wall microphysics to thermal bubble nucleation by evaluating the critical radius $R_c(T)$ and the nucleation exponent $S_3(T)/T$ in the thin-wall regime, providing a compact set of reproducible diagnostics for the decay of the metastable phase.Our results establish a coherent pipeline from vacuum structure to nonperturbative interfaces and nucleation barriers, suitable for systematic extensions to full multi-field bounce calculations and dark-sector cosmological applications.</description>

      <title>Metastable Transitions and $\Gamma$--Convergent Eyring--Kramers Asymptotics in Landau--QCD Gradient Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15343v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop a rigorous analytical framework for metastable stochastic transitions in Landau--type gradient systems inspired by QCD phenomenology. The functional $F(\sigma;u)=\int_\Omega [\frac{\kappa}{2}|\nabla\sigma|^2+V(\sigma;u)]\,dx$, depending smoothly on a control parameter $u\in\mathcal U$, is analyzed through the Euler--Lagrange map $\mathcal{E}(\sigma;u)=-\kappa\Delta\sigma+V'(\sigma;u)$ and its Hessian $\mathcal{L}_{\sigma,u}=-\kappa\Delta+V''(\sigma;u)$. By combining variational methods, $\Gamma$-- and Mosco convergence, and spectral perturbation theory, we establish the persistence and stability of local minima and index--one saddles under parameter deformations and variational discretizations. The associated mountain--pass solutions form Cerf--continuous branches away from the discriminant set $\mathcal D=\{u:\det\mathcal L_{\sigma,u}=0\}$, whose crossings produce only fold or cusp catastrophes in generic one-- and two--parameter slices. The $\Gamma$--limit is taken with respect to the $L^2(\Omega)$ topology, ensuring compactness, convergence of gradient flows, and spectral continuity of $\mathcal L_{\sigma,u}$. As a consequence, the Eyring--Kramers formula for the mean transition time between metastable wells retains quantitative validity under both parameter deformations and discretization refinement, with convergent free--energy barriers, unstable eigenvalues, and zeta--regularized determinant ratios. This construction unifies the classical intuition of Eyring, Kramers, and Langer with modern variational and spectral analysis, providing a mathematically consistent and physically transparent foundation for metastable decay and phase conversion in Landau--QCD--type systems.</description>

      <title>On the quantum separability of qubit registers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15364</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15364v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that the bipartite separability of a pure qubit state hinges critically on the combinatorial structure of its computational-basis support. Using Boolean cube geometry, we introduce a taxonomy that distinguishes support-guaranteed separability from cases in which entanglement depends on probability amplitudes. We provide closed-form support counts, identify forbidden configurations that enforce multipartite entanglement, and show how these results can enable fast entanglement diagnostics in quantum circuits. The framework offers immediate utility in classical simulation, entanglement-aware circuit design, and quantum error-correcting code analysis. This establishes support geometry as a practical and scalable tool for understanding entanglement in quantum information processing.</description>

      <title>Scaling-Based Quantization of Spacetime Microstructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.15649v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Planck-scale physics challenges the classical smooth-spacetime picture by introducing quantum fluctuations that imply a nontrivial spacetime microstructure. We present a framework that encodes these fluctuations by promoting local scale factors, rather than the metric tensor, to fundamental dynamical variables while preserving general covariance. The construction employs a two-tiered hierarchy of scale manifolds, comprising a first-order manifold of scale coordinates and a second-order manifold of fluctuation amplitude coordinates. On the first-order manifold, we formulate differential geometry, field equations, and a canonical quantization procedure. The theory yields a geometric renormalization-group flow for scale variables and implies spacetime discreteness at the microscopic level. By constructing a quadratic action and performing spectral decomposition with a stabilizing potential, we obtain discrete modal degrees of freedom quantized as harmonic oscillators. The framework proposes a microscopic description for zero-point energy of spacetime and explores implications for vacuum energy and ultraviolet regularization, suggesting a potential dynamical mechanism that could ameliorate the cosmological constant problem. Main results include a generalized uncertainty relation with scale-dependent coefficients, locally scaled Klein-Gordon and Dirac equations, geodesic equations for scale spacetime, and a microscopic area operator whose state counting is consistent with the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy. This work develops a scale-based quantization procedure, providing a foundation for further mathematical analysis and phenomenological tests of spacetime quantization.</description>

      <title>On Geometric Evolution and Microlocal Regularity of the Navier-Stokes Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08854v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We develop a geometric and microlocal framework for the Navier-Stokes equations by lifting the dynamics to the cosphere bundle of a Riemannian manifold. In this formulation, the velocity field and vorticity are represented as microlocal distributions whose evolution is governed by a linear transport-dissipation system generated by a canonical dynamical vector field. We introduce microlocal amplitudes, directional energy functionals, and monotone volume invariants on the compact phase space, which quantify directional concentration and alignment mechanisms associated with potential loss of regularity. The viscous term induces an effective geometric diffusion on the cosphere bundle, yielding closed differential inequalities in a geometric setting. To capture the interaction between fluid deformation and geometry, we define an effective connection and curvature tensor encoding the influence of the symmetric velocity gradient. This structure gives rise to a Ricci-type microlocal geometric evolution that constrains directional stretching and excludes extreme angular concentration compatible with viscous dissipation. While the present results do not resolve the global regularity problem, they provide a coherent geometric mechanism that severely restricts admissible blow--up scenarios, reformulating the regularity question as a problem of dissipative stability on a compact phase space.</description>
