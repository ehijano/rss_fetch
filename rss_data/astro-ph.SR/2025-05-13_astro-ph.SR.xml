      <title>Multitaper magnitude-squared coherence for time series with missing data: Understanding oscillatory processes traced by multiple observables</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06368v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: To explore the hypothesis of a common source of variability in two time series, observers may estimate the magnitude-squared coherence (MSC), which is a frequency-domain view of the cross correlation. For time series that do not have uniform observing cadence, MSC can be estimated using Welch's overlapping segment averaging. However, multitaper has superior statistical properties to Welch's method in terms of the tradeoff between bias, variance, and bandwidth. The classical multitaper technique has recently been extended to accommodate time series with underlying uniform observing cadence from which some observations are missing. This situation is common for solar and geomagnetic datasets, which may have gaps due to breaks in satellite coverage, instrument downtime, or poor observing conditions. We demonstrate the scientific use of missing-data multitaper magnitude-squared coherence by detecting known solar mid-term oscillations in simultaneous, missing-data time series of solar Lyman $\alpha$ flux and geomagnetic Disturbance Storm Time index. Due to their superior statistical properties, we recommend that multitaper methods be used for all heliospheric time series with underlying uniform observing cadence.</description>

      <title>Submillimeter observations of the white dwarf pulsar AR Sco</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AR Scorpii, the so called white dwarf pulsar, contains a rapidly rotating magnetic white dwarf (WD; Pspin = 117.0564 s) interacting with a cool, red dwarf (RD) companion in a 3.56 hour orbit. It is a strong radio source with an inverted spectral index between 1-200 GHz that is indicative of synchrotron emission. This paper presents the first submillimeter observations of AR Scorpii using the Submillimeter Array, helping to fill a critical gap in the spectral energy distribution between 10-600 GHz. The average flux densities at 220 and 345 GHz are 124 and 86 mJy, respectively. The lower than expected flux density at 345 GHz suggests a break in the synchrotron emission at about 200 GHz. A periodogram analysis of the 220 GHz observations shows a modulation with an amplitude of ~6% at a period of 58.26 s or at twice the spin frequency of the white dwarf. This modulation is the first direct detection of the WD spin period at radio frequencies and implies that the synchrotron emission arises near the WD and and not from an interaction with the photosphere of the RD. A fit to the spectral energy distribution shows that the synchrotron emission arises from a small, low density region with a magnetic field of 43 MG at a distance of 0.6 orbital radii from the WD. This result implies that AR Scorpii contains a weakly magnetic WD (~15 MG) and not a strongly magnetic WD (~500 MG) as previously asserted.</description>

      <title>Decimetric Type-IV Radio Bursts of Solar Flares Induced by Electron Cyclotron Maser Emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The radiation mechanism of decimetric wideband and pulsating radio bursts from the Sun (in terms of decimetric type-IV (t-IVdm) burst) and other flaring stars is a long-standing problem. Early investigations were based on the leading-spot hypothesis for the sun and yielded contradictory results. Here we provide essential evidence to support the scenario that these bursts are induced by the electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) driven by energetic electrons mirrored in converging sunspot fields. This is done by analyzing 2 flare-associated t-IVdm bursts that are selected from a larger sample of 60 bursts recorded during 2010-2014, according to the levels of polarization and whether the source-field orientation can be unambiguously determined. We further modeled the transport of downward-streaming energetic electrons along a coronal loop and found most electrons get mirrored within the specific altitude range of 20-100 Mm. This explains why such bursts tend to have well-defined spectral ranges. The study greatly expands the application of ECME in solar radio astronomy and provides solar samples for similar bursts from other flaring stars.</description>

      <title>The Abundance Origin Of A Highly r-process-Enhanced r-II Star: LAMOST J020623.21+494127.9</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06494</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06494v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Object LAMOST J020623.21+494127.9 (program star) in the thin disk of the Milky Way (MW) is reported as a highly r-process-enhanced (RPE) r-II star with[Eu/Fe]= +1.32 and [Fe/H]= -0.54. The chemical profile of the star reflects the intrinsic composition of the gas cloud present at its birth. Using an abundance decomposition method, we fit 25 elements from the abundance dataset, including 10 heavy neutron capture elements. We explore the astrophysical origin of the elements in this star through its abundance ratios and component ratios. We find that the contributions from the massive stars played a significant role in the production of light elements in the program star. Our analysis reveals that the heavy neutron-capture elements are produced purely by the main r-process. However, the adopted main r-process model does not adequately fit the observed data, suggesting another main r-process pattern may exist.</description>

      <title>Magnetic field morphologies in convective zones influenced by a turbulent surface layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06618</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06618v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spectropolarimetric observations show that many low-mass stars possess large-scale poloidal magnetic fields with considerable dipole component, which in some cases exhibit temporal dynamics - cycles or reversals. Although it is widely accepted that their magnetic fields are generated by the dynamo process, it is hard to reproduce coherent oscillations of large-scale magnetic fields with a dipolar symmetry as observed for the Sun when turbulent and compressible regimes are explored. Most previous 3D numerical studies partially avoided this problem by considering a numerical domain with low density stratification, which may correspond to neglecting surface effects where density drops considerably. To address this question, we perform direct numerical simulations of convective dynamos in extreme parameter regimes of both strong turbulence and strong density stratification, using software MagIC. Our simulations exhibit rotationally-influenced large-scale convective motions surrounded by a turbulent compressible surface layer. We find complex time variations of the magnetic field in flow regimes of predominantly dipolar configuration with respect to the few large-scale harmonics. In such regimes, turbulent surface layer induces global magnetic pumping mechanism, transporting magnetic energy into the deep interiors of our dynamo model. Dipole magnetic fields are found in regimes of transition between solar- and anti-solar differential rotation, and interact dynamically with it. The spatial distribution and temporal behavior of the large-scale fields is consistent with observations of low-mass stars, which suggest magnetic pumping could promote time-dependent magnetic fields with a dipolar symmetry as observed for the Sun and other solar-like stars. Our results suggest a parameter path in which dynamo models with a complex multiscale dynamics should be explored.</description>

      <title>The role of stellar model input in correcting the asteroseismic scaling relations. Red giant branch models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06629v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This study investigates the variability of the theoretical correction factor, $f_{\Delta \nu}$, used in red giant branch (RGB) scaling relations, arising from different assumptions in stellar model computations. Adopting a commonly used framework, we focused on a 1.0 $M_{\odot}$ star and systematically varied seven input parameters: the reference solar mixture, the initial helium abundance, the inclusion of microscopic diffusion and mass loss, the method for calculating atmospheric opacity, the mixing-length parameter, and the boundary conditions. Each parameter was tested using two distinct but physically plausible values to mimic possible choices of different evolutionary codes. For each resulting stellar model, we computed the oscillation frequencies along the RGB and derived the large frequency spacing, $\Delta \nu_0$. The correction factor $f_{\Delta \nu}$ was then calculated by comparing the derived $\Delta \nu_0$ with that predicted by the uncorrected scaling relations. We found substantial variability in $f_{\Delta \nu}$ across the different models. The variation ranged from approximately 1.3% in the lower RGB to about 3% at $\log g = 1.4$. This level of variability is significant, as it corresponds to roughly half the values typically quoted in the literature and leads to a systematic change in derived masses from 5% to more than 10%. The most significant contribution to this variability came from the choice of atmospheric opacity calculation (approximately 1.2%), with a smaller contribution from the inclusion of microscopic diffusion (approximately 0.4%). These results indicate that the choice of the reference stellar model has a non-negligible impact on the calculation of correction factors applied to RGB star scaling relations.</description>

      <title>Radio polarization from runaway star bowshocks-I. The general case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06777v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High velocity stars move through the interstellar medium with V &gt; 30 km/s. When the star has powerful winds, under the appropriate conditions, the interaction of the wind with the interstellar material produces a system of shocks. The outer shock, called the bowshock, perturbs the ambient medium, heating and compressing the gas. The dust in the compressed bowshock cools, producing infrared radiation. This emission appears as extended coma-shape structures. The discovery of radio nonthermal emission from two stellar bowshock nebulae indicates that these sources might be accelerating electrons up to relativistic energies. The produced nonthermal radio emission is most probably synchrotron which has a high degree of polarization. In this work we model the synchrotron emission of runaway massive star bowshocks aiming to produce synthetic radio emission and polarization maps for two frequencies: 1.40 and 4.86 GHz. We model the interacting plasmas in a steady-state regime by means of magnetohydrodynamics simulations and we compute the injection and transport of the relativistic electrons in the diffusion approximation. We include in the model the most important depolarization effects. Our main conclusions are i) the effects of Faraday rotation within the source are important at the lowest frequency considered, ii) inferring the local magnetic field direction from polarization measurements only can be misleading, iii) thermal radio emission produced by ionized plasma within the bowshock structure and surroundings can surpass the polarized one for the considered frequencies, and iv) the contribution from the background electrons is minor.</description>

      <title>Abundance analysis of benchmark M dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07116v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Abundances of M dwarfs, being the most numerous stellar type in the Galaxy, can enhance our understanding of planet formation processes. They can also be used to study the chemical evolution of the Galaxy, where in particular alpha-capture elements play an important role. We aim to obtain abundances for Fe, Ti, and Ca for a small sample of well-known M dwarfs for which interferometric measurements are available. These stars and their abundances are intended to serve as a benchmark for future large-scale spectroscopic studies. We analysed spectra obtained with the GIANO-B spectrograph. Turbospectrum and the wrapper TSFitPy were used with MARCS atmospheric models in order to fit synthetic spectra to the observed spectra. We performed a differential abundance analysis in which we also analysed a solar spectrum with the same method and then subtracted the derived abundances line-by-line. The median was taken as the final abundance for each element and each star. Our abundances of Fe, Ti, and Ca agree mostly within uncertainties when comparing with other values from the literature. However, there are few studies to compare with.</description>

      <title>Discovery of Main-sequence Radio Pulse emitters from widefield sky surveys</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07195</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07195v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic AB stars are known to produce periodic radio pulses by the electron cyclotron maser emission (ECME) mechanism. Only 19 such stars, known as 'Main-sequence Radio Pulse emitters' (MRPs) are currently known. The majority of MRPs have been discovered through targeted observation campaigns that involve carefully selecting a sample of stars that are likely to produce ECME, and which can be detected by a given telescope within reasonable amount of time. These selection criteria inadvertently introduce bias in the resulting sample of MRPs, which affects subsequent investigation of the relation between ECME properties and stellar magnetospheric parameters. The alternative is to use all-sky surveys. Until now, MRP candidates obtained from surveys were identified based on their high circular polarisation ($\gtrsim 30\%$). In this paper, we introduce a complementary strategy, which does not require polarisation information. Using multi-epoch data from the Australian SKA Pathfinder (ASKAP) telescope, we identify four MRP candidates based on the variability in the total intensity light curves. Follow-up observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) confirm three of them to be MRPs, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our strategy. With the expanded sample, we find that ECME is affected by temperature and the magnetic field strength, consistent with past results. There is, however, a degeneracy regarding how the two parameters govern the ECME luminosity for magnetic A and late-B stars (effective temperature $\lesssim 16$ kK). The current sample is also inadequate to investigate the role of stellar rotation, which has been shown to play a key role in driving incoherent radio emission.</description>

      <title>An Actinide-boost Star Discovered in the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07281v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an actinide-boost, very metal-poor ($\left[\mathrm{Fe/H} \right]=-2.38$), $r$-process-enhanced ($\left[\mathrm{Eu/Fe} \right]=0.80$) star, LAMOST J0804+5740, within the Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus (GSE). Based on the high-resolution ($R\sim36,000\; and \;60,000$) and high signal-to-noise ratio spectra obtained with the High Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope, the abundances of 48 species are determined. Its $\log\epsilon\rm(\mathrm{Th}/\mathrm{Eu}) = -0.22 $ establishes it as the first confirmed actinide-boost star within the GSE. Comparative analysis of its abundance pattern with theoretical $r$-process models reveals that the magnetorotationally driven jet supernova $r$-process model with $\hat{L}v$ = 0.2 provides the best fit and successfully reproduces the actinide-boost signature. Kinematic analysis of actinide-boost stars reveals that approximately two-thirds of them are classified as $\textit{ex-situ}$ stars, suggesting that actinide-boost stars are more likely to originate from accreted dwarf galaxies. As the first actinide-boost star identified within the GSE, J0804+5740 will provide valuable insights into $r$-process nucleosynthesis in accreted dwarf galaxies like the GSE, especially on the production of the heaviest elements.</description>

      <title>Solar Orbiter's 2024 Major Flare Campaigns: An Overview</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07472</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07472v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Solar Orbiter conducted a series of flare-optimised observing campaigns in 2024 utilising the Major Flare Solar Orbiter Observing Plan (SOOP). Dedicated observations were performed during two distinct perihelia intervals in March/April and October, during which over 22 flares were observed, ranging from B- to M-class. These campaigns leveraged high-resolution and high-cadence observations from the mission's remote-sensing suite, including the High-Resolution EUV Imager (EUI/HRI_EUV), the Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX), the Spectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE) spectrometer, and the High Resolution Telescope of the Polarimetric and Helioseismic Imager (PHI/HRT), as well as coordinated ground-based and Earth-orbiting observations. EUI/HRI_EUV operating in short-exposure modes, provided two-second-cadence, non-saturated EUV images, revealing structures and dynamics on scales not previously observed. Simultaneously, STIX captured hard X-ray imaging and spectroscopy of accelerated electrons, while SPICE acquired EUV slit spectroscopy to probe chromospheric and coronal responses. Together, these observations offer an unprecedented view of magnetic reconnection, energy release, particle acceleration, and plasma heating across a broad range of temperatures and spatial scales. These campaigns have generated a rich dataset that will be the subject of numerous future studies addressing Solar Orbiter's top-level science goal: "How do solar eruptions produce energetic particle radiation that fills the heliosphere?". This paper presents the scientific motivations, operational planning, and observational strategies behind the 2024 flare campaigns, along with initial insights into the observed flares. We also discuss lessons learned for optimizing future Solar Orbiter Major Flare campaigns and provide a resource for researchers aiming to utilize these unique observations.</description>

      <title>The nature of small scale EUV solar brightenings investigated as impulsive heating of short loop in 1D hydrododynamics simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Small (400 to 4000 km) and short lived (10 to 200 km) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) brightenings, detected by the High Resolution Imager EUV (HRIEUV), have been found to be ubiquitous in the Quiet Sun (QS). Their contribution to coronal heating as well as their physical origin are currently being investigated. We wish to determine whether models of short loops and impulsive heating are compatible with the results from observations. In particular, we used two models of loops with distinct thermal properties: cool (T below 1E5 K) and hot loops (T above 1E5 K). We simulated the evolution of impulsively heated short loops, using the 1D hydrodynamics (HD) code HYDRAD. We computed the synthetic light curves of HRIEUV, four EUV channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA), and five emission lines measured by the SPectral Imaging of the Coronal Environment (SPICE). We then compared the results from the synthetic light curves with observations. The aim was to reproduce the short delays observed between the intensity peaks of the light curves. Cool loops subjected to impulsive heating are good candidates to explain the physical origin of the EUV brightenings. On the other hand, hot loops are not consistent with observations, except when they are subjected to especially strong impulsive heating.</description>

      <title>Fine-scale opposite-polarity magnetic fields in a solar plage revealed by integral field spectropolarimetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Plages are small concentrations of strong, nearly vertical magnetic fields in the solar photosphere that expand with height. A high spatial and spectral resolution that can resolve their fine structure is required to characterize them, and spectropolarimetric capabilities are needed to infer their magnetic fields. We constrain the 3D fine structure of the magnetic field in the photosphere of a solar plage from a unique spectropolarimetric dataset with a very high spatial and spectral resolution and a fast temporal cadence. We analyzed spectropolarimetric observations of a solar plage in the two magnetically sensitive spectral lines of neutral iron around 630 nm. The observations were obtained with MiHI, which is an integral field unit attached to the Swedish Solar Telescope. MiHI obtained diffraction-limited, high-cadence observations with high spectral fidelity. These observations were interpreted using the spectropolarimetric inversion with magnetohydrostatic constraints, which allowed us to recover the magnetic and thermodynamic structure of the plage on a geometrical scale. The inversion results reveal that the magnetic field can reach up to 2 kG and that it expands significantly from the deep to the mid-photosphere. Weaker (200 G), and very small (subarcsecond) vertical magnetic loops lie beneath this canopy, rooted in the photosphere. This novel picture of a solar plage, in which weak opposite-polarity field patches surround the main polarity, provides new insight into convection in strongly magnetized plasma.</description>

      <title>The JDISC Survey: Linking the Physics and Chemistry of Inner and Outer Protoplanetary Disk Zones</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mid-infrared spectroscopy of protoplanetary disks provides a chemical inventory of gas within a few au, where planets are readily detected around older stars. With the JWST Disk Infrared Spectral Chemistry Survey (JDISCS), we explore demographic trends among 31 disks observed with MIRI (MRS) and with previous ALMA millimeter continuum imaging at high angular resolution (5-10 au). With these S/N $\sim$200-450 spectra, we report emission from H$_2$O, OH, CO, C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, CO$_2$, [Ne II], [Ne III], and [Ar II]. Emission from H$_2$O, OH and CO is nearly ubiquitous for low-mass stars, and detection rates of all molecules are higher than for similar disks observed with Spitzer-IRS. Slab model fits to the molecular emission lines demonstrate that emission from C$_2$H$_2$, HCN, and possibly CO$_2$ is optically thin; thus since column densities and emitting radii are degenerate, observations are actually sensitive to the total molecular mass. C$_2$H$_2$ and HCN emission also typically originate in a hotter region ($920^{+70}_{-130}$, $820^{+70}_{-130}$ K, respectively) than CO$_2$ ($600^{+200}_{-160}$ K). The HCN to cold H$_2$O luminosity ratios are generally smaller in smooth disks, consistent with more efficient water delivery via icy pebbles in the absence of large dust substructures. The molecular emission line luminosities are also correlated with mass accretion rates and infrared spectral indices, similar to trends reported from Spitzer-IRS surveys. This work demonstrates the power of combining multi-wavelength observations to explore inner disk chemistry as a function of outer disk and stellar properties, which will continue to grow as the sample of observed Class II systems expands in the coming JWST observation cycles.</description>

      <title>Short- and long-term variations of the high mass accretion rate classical T Tauri star DR Tau</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical T Tauri stars are newly formed, low mass stars which may display both periodic and random variations in their brightness. The interaction between the star and its circumstellar disk is time-dependent, leading to short or long-term changes in the environment, and hence variability of the system. By compiling a large dataset with high-cadence photometric (Kepler, TESS), and high-resolution spectroscopic observations (CFHT/ESPaDOnS) of the highly variable T Tauri star DR Tau, we aim to examine the short- and long-term variability of the system, and identify the underlying physical mechanisms. Our results reveal that DR Tau exhibits stochastic photometric variability not only on daily, but also on hourly timescale with peak-to-peak amplitude of 1.4 mag probably originating from accretion related variations. Our ground-based multifilter photometry shows that the amplitude of the variability decreases with increasing wavelength. This trend towards the infrared wavelengths suggests that part of the disk may be optically thick and invariable. The spectroscopic analysis showed that the H$\alpha$ line presents the most complex line profile with several components but the significance of the components changes over time. This suggests the presence and variation of both accretion flow and wind. Broad and narrow components can be clearly distinguished in the He I and the Ca II lines, suggesting contribution from both the accretion flow and the post-shock region. DR Tau exhibits high level of photometric and spectroscopic variability on both short- and long-timescales, which is caused by the combination of accretion, wind, stellar activity, and obscuration by circumstellar matter; and the significance of the physical mechanisms causing the observed variability changes over time.</description>

      <title>Surprising Variation of Gamma Rays from the Sun over the Solar Cycle Revealed with Fermi-LAT</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06348v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The steady-state gamma-ray emission from the Sun is thought to consist of two emission components due to interactions with Galactic cosmic rays: (1) a hadronic component covering the solar disk, and (2) a leptonic component peaking at the solar edge and extending into the heliosphere. The flux of these components is expected to vary with the 11-year solar cycle, being highest during solar minimum and lowest during solar maximum, because it is correlated with the cosmic-ray flux. No study has yet analyzed the flux variation of the two components separately over solar cycles.
  In this work, we measure the temporal variations of the flux of each component over 15 years of Fermi Large Area Telescope observations and compare them with the sunspot number and Galactic cosmic-ray flux from AMS-02 near the Earth.
  We find that the flux variation of the disk anticorrelates with solar activity and correlates with cosmic-ray protons, confirming its emission mechanism. The flux variation of the extended component anticorrelates with solar activity only until mid 2012. After that, we no longer observe any correlation or anticorrelation, even with the CR electron flux. This most likely suggests that cosmic-ray transport and modulation in the inner heliosphere are unexpectedly complex and different for electrons and protons or, alternatively, the presence of an additional, unknown component of gamma rays or cosmic rays.
  These findings impact space weather research and emphasize the need for close monitoring of Cycle 25 and the ongoing polarity reversal.</description>

      <title>The CHIMERAS Project: Design Framework for the Collisionless HIgh-beta Magnetized Experiment Researching Astrophysical Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06426v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: From the near-Earth solar wind to the intracluster medium of galaxy clusters, collisionless, high-beta, magnetized plasmas pervade our universe. Energy and momentum transport from large-scale fields and flows to small scale motions of plasma particles is ubiquitous in these systems, but a full picture of the underlying physical mechanisms remains elusive. The transfer is often mediated by a turbulent cascade of Alfv{\'e}nic fluctuations as well as a variety of kinetic instabilities; these processes tend to be multi-scale and/or multi-dimensional, which makes them difficult to study using spacecraft missions and numerical simulations alone (Dorfman et al. 2023; Lichko et al. 2020, 2023). Meanwhile, existing laboratory devices struggle to produce the collisionless, high ion beta ($\beta_i \gtrsim 1$), magnetized plasmas across the range of scales necessary to address these problems. As envisioned in recent community planning documents (Carter et al. 2020; Milchberg and Scime 2020; Baalrud et al. 2020; Dorfman et al. 2023; National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine 2024, it is therefore important to build a next generation laboratory facility to create a $\beta_i \gtrsim 1$, collisionless, magnetized plasma in the laboratory for the first time. A Working Group has been formed and is actively defining the necessary technical requirements to move the facility towards a construction-ready state. Recent progress includes the development of target parameters and diagnostic requirements as well as the identification of a need for source-target device geometry. As the working group is already leading to new synergies across the community, we anticipate a broad community of users funded by a variety of federal agencies (including NASA, DOE, and NSF) to make copious use of the future facility.</description>

      <title>Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus star formation history as revealed by detailed elemental abundances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Gaia-Sausage-Enceladus was the last major merger and central turning point in the Milky Way's story. This event, comparable in mass to the Large Magellanic Cloud today, left behind significant debris that provides valuable insights into the assembly history of our Galaxy and the chemical evolution of dwarf galaxies. By examining the aftermath of the GSE merger, we can delve deeper into understanding how the Milky Way's formation unfolded and how dwarf galaxies evolved chemically. Specifically, the distinct patterns of neutron capture elements such as Eu and Ba, along with Mg, offer clues about the star formation history. Through a comprehensive analysis of data compiled in the SAGA database, we investigated the Gaia Sausage-Enceladus' star formation history. Elemental abundance ratios ([Eu/Mg], [Ba/Mg], and [Eu/Ba]) derived from this study, when compared with those of surviving Milky Way satellites, indicate that the GSE experienced a prolonged period of slow star formation, lasting over 2 Gyr, until it was eventually quenched by merging with the Milky Way. Consequently, these elemental signatures serve as a unique window into the complex history of both surviving and accreted satellites orbiting our Galaxy.</description>

      <title>Systematic Investigation into Radio Supernovae with Markov Chain Monte Carlo Analysis: Implications for Massive Stars' Mass Loss and Shock Acceleration Physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06609</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present a systematic analysis of radio supernovae (SNe) to investigate the statistical tendencies of SN progenitors' mass-loss rates and shock acceleration efficiencies. We conduct parameter estimation through Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis for 32 radio SN samples with a clear peak observed in their light curves, and successfully fit 27 objects with the widely-used radio SN model. We find the inferred mass-loss rates of stripped-envelope SN progenitors are by an order of magnitude greater ($\sim 10^{-3}\,M_\odot{\rm yr}^{-1}$) than those of SN II progenitors ($&lt;10^{-4}\,M_\odot{\rm yr}^{-1}$). The efficiencies of electron acceleration and magnetic field amplification are found to be less than $10^{-2}$, and the possibility of their energy equipartition is not ruled out. On the other hand, we find the following two properties that might be related to limitations of the standard model for radio SNe; one is the extremely high magnetic field amplification efficiency, and the other is the shallower density gradient of the outer ejecta. We suggest the new interpretation that these peculiar results are misleading due to the setup that is not included in our model, and we identify the missing setup as a dense CSM in the vicinity of the progenitor. This means that a large fraction of radio SN progenitors might possess dense CSM in the vicinity of the progenitor, which is not smoothly connected with the outer CSM.</description>

      <title>Equation-of-motion coupled-cluster variants in combination with perturbative triples corrections in strong magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06976</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06976v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we report on the implementation of the EOM spin-flip (SF), ionization-potential (IP) and electron-affinity (EA) coupled cluster singles doubles (CCSD) methods for atoms and molecules in strong magnetic fields for energies as well as one-electron properties. Moreover, non-perturbative triples corrections using the EOM-CCSD(T)(a)* scheme were implemented in the finite-field framework for the EE, SF, IP, and EA variants. These developments allow the access to a large variety of electronic states as well as the investigation of IPs and EAs in a strong magnetic field. The latter two indicate the relative stability of the different oxidation states of elements. The increased flexibility to target challenging electronic states and the access to the electronic states of the anion and cation are important for the assignment of spectra from strongly magnetic White Dwarf (WD) stars. Here, we investigate the development of the IPs and EAs in the presence of a magnetic field for the elements of the first and second row of the periodic table. In addition, we study the development of the electronic structure of Na, Mg, and Ca that aided in the assignment of metal lines in a magnetic WD. Lastly, we investigate the electronic excitations of CH in different magnetic-field orientations and strengths, a molecule that has been found in the atmospheres of WD stars.</description>

      <title>An analysis of Born-Infeld boson compact objects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we study gravitationally bound compact objects sourced by a string theory inspired Born-Infeld scalar field. Unlike many of their canonical scalar field counterparts, these ``boson stars'' do not have to extend out to infinity and may generate compact bodies. We analyze in detail both the junction conditions at the surface as well as the boundary conditions at the center which are required in order to have a smooth structure throughout the object and into the exterior vacuum region. These junction conditions, although involved, turn out to be relatively easy to satisfy. Analysis reveals that these compact objects have a richer structure than the canonical boson stars and some of these properties turn out to be physically peculiar: There are several branches of solutions depending on how the junction conditions are realized. Further analysis illustrates that in practice the junction conditions tend to require interior geometries reminiscent of ``bag of gold'' spacetimes, and also hide the star behind an event horizon in its exterior. The surface compactness of such objects, defined here as the ratio $2M/r$, can be made arbitrarily close to unity indicating the absence of a Buchdahl bound. Some comments on the stability of these objects is provided to find possible stable and unstable regimes. However, we argue that even in the possibly stable regime the event horizon in the vacuum region shielding the object is potentially unstable, and would cut off the star from the rest of the universe.</description>

      <title>Understanding the IBEX ribbon using the kinetic model of pickup proton transport in a scatter-free limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07471</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07471v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most remarkable discoveries by the IBEX is the ribbon - a narrow band of enhanced ENA fluxes observed in the sky. The prevailing explanation attributes the IBEX ribbon to the secondary ENA mechanism. In this process, primary H ENAs, produced via charge exchange between solar wind (SW) protons and interstellar H atoms within the heliosphere, travel beyond the heliopause (HP) and undergo further charge exchange with protons of the LISM, generating pickup protons. Some of these pickup protons subsequently experience charge exchange with interstellar H atoms, forming secondary ENAs, some of which travel back toward the Sun and are detected by the IBEX. This paper presents a kinetic model developed to simulate secondary ENA fluxes. Ribbon simulations are performed using global distributions of plasma and H atoms in the heliosphere derived from a kinetic-MHD model of the SW/LISM interaction. The model accounts for all relevant primary ENA populations, including neutralized thermal SW protons, neutralized pickup protons, and ENAs originating in the inner heliosheath (IHS). The transport of pickup protons beyond the HP is described by the focused transport equation for a gyrotropic velocity distribution in the scatter-free limit, assuming no pitch-angle scattering or energy diffusion. Our simulations qualitatively reproduce IBEX-Hi ribbon observations and exhibit good quantitative agreement at low heliolatitudes. However, the model underestimates fluxes at high heliolatitudes, likely due to the omission of non-stationary SW behavior in the stationary framework used in this work. The study highlights the importance of ENAs from the IHS, a population considered for the ribbon production in the frame of the kinetic model of pickup proton transport in the heliosphere for the first time, for accurately reproducing ribbon fluxes observed by IBEX-Hi at the highest energy steps.</description>

      <title>Rapid formation of a very massive star &gt;50000 $M_\odot$ and subsequently an IMBH from runaway collisions. Direct N-body and Monte Carlo simulations of dense star clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07491</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07491v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Context. We present simulations of a massive young star cluster using \textsc{Nbody6++GPU} and \textsc{MOCCA}. The cluster is initially more compact than previously published models, with one million stars, a total mass of $5.86 \times 10^5~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$, and a half-mass radius of $0.1~\mathrm{pc}$.
  Aims. We analyse the formation and growth of a very massive star (VMS) through successive stellar collisions and investigate the subsequent formation of an intermediate-mass black hole (IMBH) in the core of a dense star cluster.
  Methods. We use both direct \textit{N}-body and Monte Carlo simulations, incorporating updated stellar evolution prescriptions (SSE/BSE) tailored to massive stars and VMSs. These include revised treatments of stellar radii, rejuvenation, and mass loss during collisions. While the prescriptions represent reasonable extrapolations into the VMS regime, the internal structure and thermal state of VMSs formed through stellar collisions remain uncertain, and future work may require further refinement.
  Results. We find that runaway stellar collisions in the cluster core produce a VMS exceeding $5 \times 10^4~\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$ within 5 Myr, which subsequently collapses into an IMBH.
  Conclusions. Our model suggests that dense stellar environments may enable the formation of very massive stars and massive black hole seeds through runaway stellar collisions. These results provide a potential pathway for early black hole growth in star clusters and offer theoretical context for interpreting recent JWST observations of young, compact clusters at high redshift.</description>

      <title>Astrophysical $S$ factor and reaction rate of the direct $^{12}{\rm C}(p, \gamma)^{13}{\rm N}$ capture process within a potential model approach</title>

Abstract: The astrophysical direct nuclear capture reaction $^{12}{\rm C}(p, \gamma)^{13}{\rm N}$ is studied within the framework of a potential model. Parameters of the nuclear $p-^{12}$C interaction potentials of the Woods-Saxon form are adjusted to reproduce experimental $p-^{12}$C scattering phase shifts, as well as the binding energies and empirical values of the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC) for the $^{13}$N(1/2$^-$) ground state from the literature. The reaction rates are found to be very sensitive to the description of the value of the ANC of the $^{13}$N($1/2^{-}$) ground state and width of the $^{13}$N($1/2^+$) resonance at the $E_x=2.365$ MeV excitation energy. The potential model, which yields the ANC value of 1.63 fm$^{-1/2}$ for the $^{13}$N($1/2^{-}$) ground state and a value $\Gamma$=39 keV for the $^{13}$N($1/2^+$) resonance width, is able to reproduce the astrophysical $S$ factor in the energy interval up to 2 MeV, the empirical values of the reaction rates in the temperature region up to $T=10^{10}$ K of the LUNA Collaboration and the results of the R-matrix fit. The astrophysical factor $S(0)=1.35$ keV b is found using the asymptotic expansion method of D. Baye. The obtained value is in a good agreement with the Solar Fusion II result. At the same time, the calculated value of 1.44 keV b of the astrophysical $S$ factor at the Solar Gamow energy is consistent with the result of the R-matrix fit of $S(25~\rm{keV})=1.48 \pm 0.09$ keV b by Kettner {\it et al.}, but slightly less than the result of $S(25~\rm{keV})=1.53 \pm 0.06$ keV b the LUNA Collaboration.</description>

      <title>The HOSTS Survey: Suspected variable dust emission and constraints on companions around $\theta$ Boo</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: During the HOSTS survey by the LBTI, an excess emission from the main sequence star $\theta$ Boo (F7V spectral type, 14.5pc distance) was observed. This excess indicates the presence of exozodiacal dust near the habitable zone (HZ) of the star. Previous observations from Spitzer and Herschel showed no sign of outer cold dust within their respective detection limits. Additional nulling and high-contrast AO observations were taken to spatially constrain the dust distribution, search for variability, and directly image potential companions in the system. This study presents the results of these observations and provides an interpretation of the inner system's architecture. The star was observed using the LBTI's N'-band nulling mode during three epochs in 2017, 2018, and 2023. The dust distribution is modeled and constrained for each epoch using the standard LBTI nulling pipeline, assuming a vertically thin disk with a face-on inclination. In addition, high-contrast AO observations are performed in the L'-band and H-band to constrain the presence of substellar companions around the star. Several solutions are found for the dust distribution, and for each epoch. However, the LBTI nulling observations are not able to discriminate between them. Using the upper limits from previous observations, we constrain the representative size of the dust grains around 3-5$\mu$m. A tentative increase in dust brightness is also measured at the Earth-equivalent insolation distance between 2017 and 2023. Several options are considered to explain the origin of the observed dust and its variability, but no clear sources could be identified from the current observations. Partly because our high-contrast AO observations could only constrain the presence of companions down to $11M_\text{Jup}$ at 1.3" separation.</description>

      <title>WISE 12 micron search for exozodi candidates within 10 parsecs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of extra-terrestrial life is one of the ultimate goals for future exoplanet-seeking missions, with one major challenge being the presence of 'exozodiacal' dust near target stars or within their habitable zone. Therefore, it is critical to identify which stars possess exozodiacal dust and quantify their emission levels. In this study, we conducted a search for exozodi candidates within 10 parsecs using the Reyl'e sample. We performed proper motion calculations and cross-matched the sample with the WISE and 2MASS database, resulting in 339 preliminary target samples. We further analysed the infrared radiation characteristics of these targets, using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting to predict photometric flux levels in the infrared and searching for 3sigma excesses in the WISE W3 band. During further selection processes, we applied various analysis methods to perform rigorous validation. We identified five exozodi candidates all of which are brown dwarfs (BDs). Given the clustering in candidate spectral types, we expect that these are not true exozodi candidates, rather the apparent excess arises from the inability of the BD photosphere models to accurately represent the SEDs of objects at the L-T transition. Indeed, for the object DENIS J025503.3-470049, excess is likely due to silicate clouds in the BD atmosphere. We suggest that a more stringent 5sigma excess is required to infer excess for this spectral type. The detection rate (0/339) in our sample shows that less than 1% M stars have exozodi above 21% excess levels. This is consistent with the rate of exozodi at similar level towards FGK stars in the Kennedy &amp; Wyatt sample (25/24,174). We provide upper limits on the 12 micron exozodi emission for the sample, which is typically at 21% relative to the star. For most stars, in particular the low mass M stars, this is the first such upper limit in the literature.</description>

      <title>The Effect of Luminosity Outbursts on the Abundance of Pebbles and Their Ice Mantles in Protoplanetary Disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.07718v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Centimeter-sized dust grains-pebbles-are necessary for planetesimal formation via the streaming instability, they play an important role in forming protoplanetary cores and giant planets, as well as enriching their atmospheres with chemical elements. This work investigates the effect of luminosity outbursts on the abundance of pebbles and their ice mantles in protoplanetary disks. We perform global simulations of formation and evolution of a self-gravitating viscous protoplanetary disk using the 2D hydrodynamic thin-disk FEOSAD code, which self-consistently reproduces luminosity outbursts. The model includes thermal balance, dust evolution and its interaction with gas, development of magnetorotational instability, adsorption and desorption of four volatile compounds (H$_2$O, CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO), and the feedback of ice mantles on dust fragmentation properties. We show that luminosity outbursts have a stronger effect on the positions of CO$_2$, CH$_4$ and CO snowlines compared to the water snowline. This is because the H$_2$O snowline falls within the viscous heating dominated region during early disk evolution stages, while snowlines of other molecules are located in regions dominated by stellar irradiation heating and are thus more sensitive to temperature changes during outbursts. Nevertheless, luminosity outbursts reduce the total amount of pebbles in the disk by half due to destruction of dust aggregates into monomers following the loss of water ice that binds the aggregates together. Pebble recovery occurs over several thousand years after the outburst ends due to collisional coagulation, with recovery timescales significantly exceeding water freeze-out times. Ice mantle desorption occurs in a complex non-axisymmetric 2D region of the disk, associated with spiral substructure formation during early evolution of gravitationally unstable disks.</description>

      <title>The observable impact of runaway OB stars on protoplanetary discs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.07723v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: UV radiation from OB stars can drive ``external'' photoevaporative winds from discs in clusters, that have been shown to be important for disc evolution and planet formation. However, cluster dynamics can complicate the interpretation of this process. A significant fraction of OB stars are runaways, propagating at high velocity which might dominate over the wider cluster dynamics in setting the time variation of the UV field in part of the cluster. We explore the impact of a runaway OB star on discs and the observational impact that may have. We find that discs exposed to even short periods of strong irradiation are significantly truncated, and only rebound slightly following the ``flyby'' of the UV source. This is predicted to leave an observable imprint on a disc population, with those downstream of the OB star vector being more massive and extended than those upstream. Because external photoevaporation acts quickly, this imprint is less susceptible to being washed out by cluster dynamics for faster runaway OB stars. The Gaia proper motion vector of the B star 42 Ori in NGC 1977 is transverse to the low mass stellar population and so may make a good region to search for this signature in resolved disc observations.</description>

      <title>Testing tidal theory using Gaia binaries: the red giant branch</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.13929v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Tidal interaction is a major ingredient in the theory of binary evolution. Here, we study tidal circularization in binaries with red giant primaries. We compute the tidal evolution for binaries as their primary stars evolve along the red giant branch, under dissipation of dynamical tides in the convective envelope. We then compare this evolution with a sample of ~30,000 red giant binaries reported by Gaia DR3. These binaries clearly show the expected gradual advance of tidal circularization, as the primary expands. But some tension with theory remains. While our calculations always predict a critical separation for tidal circularization at about 3-4 times the stellar radii, binaries with less evolved giants are observed to be circularized out to about twice as far. They also exhibit an overly extended `cool island', a collection of circular orbits that reach a couple times beyond the circularization limit. These discrepancies are reminiscent of, but less severe than, the situation for main-sequence binaries. We also find that tides can spin giant stars up to rotation rates that should affect their mass-loss. Additionally, many binaries may begin mass transfer while still eccentric.</description>

      <title>Multi-mode Pulsations in AGB Stars: Insights from 3D RHD CO5BOLD Simulations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.11978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stars on the AGB can exhibit acoustic pulsation modes of different radial orders, along with non-radial modes. These pulsations are essential to the mass-loss process and influence the evolutionary pathways of AGB stars. P-L relations serve as a valuable diagnostic for understanding stellar evolution along the AGB. 3D RHD simulations provide a powerful tool for investigating pulsation phenomena driven by convective processes and their non-linear coupling with stellar oscillations. We investigate multi-mode pulsations in AGB stars using advanced 3D 'star-in-a-box' simulations with the CO5BOLD code. Signatures of these multi-mode pulsations were weak in our previous 3D models. Our focus is on identifying and characterising the various pulsation modes, examining their persistence and transitions, and comparing the results with 1D model predictions and observational data where applicable. We produced a new model grid comprising AGB stars with current masses of $0.7$, $0.8$, and $1\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$. Fourier analysis was applied to dynamic, time-dependent quantities to extract dominant pulsation modes and their corresponding periods. Additionally, wavelet transforms were employed to identify mode-switching behaviour over time. The models successfully reproduce the P-L sequences found in AGB stars. Mode-switching phenomena are found in both the models and wavelet analyses of observational data, allowing us to infer similarities in the underlying pulsation dynamics. These 3D simulations highlight the natural emergence of multi-mode pulsations, including both radial and non-radial modes, driven by the self-consistent interplay of convection and oscillations. Our findings underscore the value of 3D RHD models in capturing the non-linear behaviour of AGB pulsations, providing insights into mode switching, envelope structures, and potential links to episodic mass-loss events.</description>

      <title>Photometric activity cycles in fast-rotating stars: Revisiting the reality of stellar activity cycle branches</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.02375v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We aim to detect activity cycles in young main-sequence stars, analogous to the 11-year solar cycle, using combined photometric survey data. This research will enhance our understanding of how cycle periods relate to rotation rates in fast-rotating stars. We measured activity cycles for 138 G-K-type main sequence stars using combined time-series photometry spanning ~14 years. The first set of 70 stars used data from Kepler Full Frame Images (FFIs)-ASAS-SN-ZTF, and the second set of 68 stars used data from Kepler-FFIs-ZTF. Additionally, we measured the activity cycles for 25 RS CVn candidates. For our sample, we analyzed the correlation or anti-correlation between flux variations and photospheric activity, which arises due to the presence of faculae or starspots. We identified fast-rotating K-type stars that are faculae-dominated by tracking spot or faculae evolution in Kepler RMS data. Our findings reveal that fast-rotating G-K-type stars show no strong correlation between cycle length and rotation period. Previous studies have identified active and inactive branches in the cycle-rotation diagram. However, we find that G-K-type stars do not show a clear trend aligning with the active branch, with 34 per cent of stars falling within the intermediate region between the two branches, where our Sun resides. Our results highlight that the proposed distinction between the two branches may not be as definitive as previously thought, particularly regarding the active branch. Furthermore, we also detected 23 per cent of young Sun-like stars in the intermediate region, where our Sun is located, implying that our Sun may not be unique in this regard.</description>

      <title>Run-away transition to turbulent strong-field dynamo</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.10981v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Planets and stars are able to generate coherent large-scale magnetic fields by helical convective motions in their interiors. This process, known as hydromagnetic dynamo, involves nonlinear interaction between the flow and magnetic field. Nonlinearity facilitates existence of bi-stable dynamo branches: a weak field branch where the magnetic field is not strong enough to enter into the leading order force balance in the momentum equation at large flow scales, and a strong field branch where the field enters into this balance. The transition between the two with enhancement of convection can be either subcritical or supercritical, depending on the strength of magnetic induction. In both cases, it is accompanied by topological changes in velocity field across the system; however, it is yet unclear how these changes are produced. In this work, we analyse transitions between the weak and strong dynamo regimes using a data-driven approach, separating different physical effects induced by dynamically active flow scales. Using Dynamic Mode Decomposition, we decompose the dynamo data from direct numerical simulations into different components (modes), identify the ones relevant for transition, and estimate relative magnitudes of their contributions Lorentz force and induction term. Our results suggest that subcritical transition to a strong dynamo is facilitated by a subharmonic instability, allowing for a more efficient mode of convection, and provide a modal basis for reduced-order models of this transition.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the properties of relativistic stars made of isotropic matter within the framework of the minimal Standard Model Extension, where a Bumblebee field (BF) coupled to spacetime induces spontaneous Lorentz symmetry breaking. We adopt analytic equations-of-state describing either condensate dark stars or strange quark stars. We solve the structure equations numerically, and we compute the mass-to-radius relationships. The influence of the Bumblebee parameter $\mathbf{l}$ is examined in detail, and an upper bound is obtained using the massive pulsar (PSR) J0740+6620 and the strangely light High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS) J1731-347 compact object.</description>

      <title>Prestellar Cores in Turbulent Clouds: Numerical Modeling and Evolution to Collapse</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07349</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07349v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A fundamental issue in star formation is understanding the precise mechanisms leading to the formation of prestellar cores, and their subsequent gravitationally unstable evolution. To address this question, we carefully construct a suite of turbulent, self-gravitating numerical simulations, and analyze the development and collapse of individual prestellar cores. We show that the numerical requirements for resolving the sonic scale and internal structure of anticipated cores are essentially the same in self-gravitating clouds, calling for the number of cells per dimension to increase quadratically with the cloud's Mach number. In our simulations, we follow evolution of individual cores by tracking the region around each gravitational potential minimum over time. Evolution in nascent cores is towards increasing density and decreasing turbulence, and there is a wide range of critical density for initiating collapse. At given spatial scale the turbulence level also varies widely, and tends to be correlated with density. By directly measuring the radial forces acting within cores, we identify a distinct transition to a state of gravitational runaway. We use our new theory for turbulent equilibrium spheres to predict the onset of each core's collapse. Instability is expected when the critical radius becomes smaller than the tidal radius; we find good agreement with the simulations. Interestingly, the imbalance between gravity and opposing forces is only $\sim 20\%$ during core collapse, meaning that this is a quasi-equilibrium rather than a free-fall process. For most of their evolution, cores exhibit both subsonic contraction and transonic turbulence inherited from core-building flows; supersonic radial velocities accelerated by gravity only appear near the end of the collapse.</description>

      <title>Systematic Search for FFPs in KMTNet Full-Frame Images. I. Photometry Pipeline</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.24097v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: To exhume the buried signatures of free-floating planets (FFPs) with small angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$, we build a new full-frame difference image pipeline for the Korean Microlensing Telescope Network (KMTNet) survey based on the newly optimized pySIS package. We introduce the detailed processes of the new pipeline, including frame registration, difference image analysis, and light curve extraction. To test this pipeline, we extract 1-year light curves for 483,068 stars with $I \lesssim 17$ and conduct a model-independent search for microlensing events. The search finds 36 microlensing events, including five new events and six events discovered by other collaborations but missed by previous KMTNet searches. We find that the light curves from the new pipeline are precise enough to be sensitive to FFPs with $\theta_{\rm E} \sim 1~\mu$as. Using the new pipeline, a complete FFP search on the eight-year KMTNet images can be finished within six months and then yield the FFP mass function. The new pipeline can be used for a new KMTNet AlertFinder system, with significantly reduced false positives.</description>

      <title>KMT-2022-BLG-1818Lb,c: A Cold Super-Jupiter with a Saturn Sibling</title>

Abstract: We present the discovery and analysis of the sixth microlensing two-planet system, KMT-2022-BLG-1818Lb,c, detected by a follow-up program targeting high-magnification events. Both planets are subject to the well-known ''Close/Wide'' degeneracy, although for the first planet, which has a super-Jovian mass ratio of $q_2 \simeq 5\times 10^{-3}$ in both solutions, the Close topology, with a normalized separation of $s\simeq 0.70$, is clearly preferred by $\Delta\chi^2=26$. However, contrary to all previous two-planet microlensing systems, the mass ratio for the second planet, $q_3$, is substantially (factor of $\sim 10$) different for the Close and Wide topologies of the first planet. While this degeneracy is resolved in the present case due to high-cadence follow-up observations, the appearance of this new degeneracy indicates the need for caution in the analysis of future two-planet systems. A Bayesian analysis suggests that the host is likely a K-dwarf star in the Galactic disk. The first planet is probably a super-Jupiter on a Jupiter-like orbit, while the second planet is a Saturn-class planet on either a Mercury-like or Saturn-like orbit.</description>

      <title>Shadow-Based Framework for Estimating Transition Disk Geometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06044</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06044v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Some transition disks host misaligned inner disks with radii of several au. Understanding the geometric and physical properties of these misaligned disks is essential for advancing terrestrial planet formation models. This study introduces a novel method to infer the three-dimensional structures of both inner and outer disks by analyzing non-axisymmetric shadows and the horizon in optical and infrared scattered light images of the outer disk. This method was applied to the HD 100453 system, in which infrared scattered light images from the Very Large Telescope revealed disk shadows. These results indicate that the inner disk is misaligned by $\sim$70$^{\circ}$ relative to the outer disk, which is consistent with the results of previous studies. The aspect ratio of the inner disk surface was estimated to be 0.17, which may reflect the surface height of the optically thick dusty component due to vertical lofting by MHD winds or turbulence. In addition, the surface height distribution of the outer disk was characterized, providing novel insights into its vertical structure.</description>
