      <title>Strongly Interacting Matter Under Extreme Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Different variants of the Hadron Resonance Gas model have been used to describe the hadronic phase of strongly interacting matter. HRG model is improved by including repulsive interaction through the inclusion of excluded volume in Excluded Volume Hadron Resonance Gas (EVHRG) model. Here, the EVHRG model is further improved by incorporating unequal radii of hadrons which has been named as Modified Excluded Volume Hadron Resonance Gas (MEVHRG) model and also by taking their Lorentz contraction in Lorentz contracted MEVHRG model, namely, LMEVHRG model. Another way of incorporating the repulsive interactions in the HRG model is through the introduction of a mean-field potential. This is done in the HRG mean-field (HRGMF) model where the single particle energies are modified by a density dependent term. Both the inclusion of unequal radii and the Lorentz contraction have significant effects on the thermodynamic quantities and susceptibilities of conserved charges. The centre of mass energy dependence of some thermodynamic quantities in presence of repulsive interaction has been studied. Our study clearly indicates that proper modelling of repulsive interaction among hadrons is very important to explain the thermodynamic quantities and susceptibilities of conserved charges. The effect of static magnetic field in HRG and EVHRG models by the means of Landau levels has also been investigated. The vacuum part of the pressure, in presence of magnetic field, has been properly renormalised. The magnetic field is found to effect the thermodynamic quantities and the susceptibilities significantly. The electric charge susceptibility is influenced more strongly by the magnetic field than the baryon susceptibility. The total magnetization of hadronic matter is found to be positive.</description>

      <title>The Open Relativistic Two-body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The open relativistic two-body problem, when two interacting particles also are in external potentials, is considered in terms of the principle of the least action. Based on the consistent modification of the relativistic version Newton's third law in external fields, the exact covariant operator equations, which govern dynamics of either a scalar particle or each of the components of the 16 component spinor of spin-$1/2$ fermions, depending on the particle type, are derived in the center-mass and relative motion variables, beyond the consideration in the Breit frame only. The class of external fields and interaction potentials, when the two-body problem can be covariantly reformulated in (3+1) phase space of relative motion variables, uncoupled from the center-mass motion of such a system, is outlined. In the case of fermions the new $\gamma$-matrix basis generating the Dirac-like equation for the 16 component spinors in the (3+1) phase space is found. The chosen basis allows us to decouple the derived Dirac-like equation into four independent equations governing the dynamics of the four-component spinors. The developed approach is examined in studying the low-energy positronium states in magnetic fields.</description>

      <title>Comparison of Three Methods for Triggering Core-collapse Supernova Explosions in Spherical Symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13172</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13172v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the three-dimensional nature of core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), simulations in spherical symmetry (1D) play an important role to study large model sets for the progenitor-remnant connection, explosion properties, remnant masses, and CCSN nucleosynthesis. To trigger explosions in 1D, various numerical recipes have been applied, mostly with gross simplifications of the complex microphysics governing stellar core collapse, the formation of the compact remnant, and the mechanism of the explosion. Here we investigate the two most popular treatments, piston-driven and thermal-bomb explosions, in comparison to 1D explosions powered by a parametric neutrino engine in the P-HOTB code. For this comparison we calculate CCSNe for eight stars and evolution times up to 10,000 s, targeting the same progenitor-specific explosion energies as obtained by the neutrino-engine results. Otherwise we employ widely-used ("classic") modelling assumptions, and alternatively to the standard contraction-expansion trajectory for pistons, we also test suitably selected Lagrangian mass shells adopted from the neutrino-driven explosions as "special trajectories." Although the 56Ni production agrees within roughly a factor of two between the different explosion triggers, neither piston nor thermal bombs can reproduce the correlation of 56Ni yields and explosion energies found in neutrino-driven explosions. This shortcoming as well as the problem of massive fallback witnessed in classical piston models, which diminishes or extinguishes the ejected nickel, can be largely cured by the special trajectories. These and the choice of the explosion energies, however, make the modelling dependent on pre-existing neutrino-driven explosion results.</description>

      <title>Distribution Functions of a Radially Excited Pion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13243</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13243v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A nonperturbatively-improved, symmetry-preserving approximation to the quantum field equations relevant in calculations of meson masses and interactions is used to deliver predictions for all distribution functions (DFs) of the ground state pion, $\pi_0$, and its first radial excitation, $\pi_1$, viz. valence, glue, and sea. Regarding Mellin moments of the valence DFs, the $m=0,1$ moments in both states are identical; but for each $m\geq 2$, that in the $\pi_0$ is greater than its partner in the $\pi_1$. Working with such information, pointwise reconstructions of the hadron-scale $\pi_{0,1}$ valence DFs are developed. The predicted $\pi_0$ valence DF is consistent with extant results. The $\pi_1$ valence DF is novel: it possesses three-peaks, with the central maximum partnered by secondary peaks on either side, each separated from the centre by a zero: the zeroes lie at $x\approx 0.2,0.8$ and the secondary peaks at $x\approx 0.1,0.9$. Evolution to $\zeta =3.2\,$GeV, a typical scale for nonperturbative calculations, is accomplished using an evolution scheme for parton DFs that is all-orders exact. At this higher scale, differences between the $\pi_{0,1}$ valence DFs remain significant, but analogous differences between glue and sea DFs are far smaller. This analysis shows that, owing to constraints imposed by chiral symmetry and the pattern by which it is broken in Nature, there are noticeable differences between the structural properties of the pion ground state and its radial excitations.</description>

      <title>Towards a parameter-free analysis of the QCD chiral phase transition and its universal critical behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13653</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To quantify the universal properties of chiral phase transition in (2+1)-flavor QCD, we use an improved, renormalized order parameter for the chiral symmetry breaking. We construct ratios of this divergence-free order parameter from its values for different pairs of light quark masses. From this, we determine in a parameter-independent manner, the chiral phase transition temperature $T_c$ and the associated critical exponent $\delta$ of the universality class. We present first numerical results of these calculations on $N_\tau=8$ lattices, with staggered fermions.</description>

      <title>Polarization of Thermal Dilepton Radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03189v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The invariant mass spectra of dileptons radiated from the fireballs formed in high-energy heavy-ion collisions have been successfully used to investigate the properties of hot and dense QCD matter. Using a realistic model for the in-medium electromagnetic spectral function, we predict polarization observables and compare them to experiment. This allows, for the first time, independent tests of the longitudinal and transverse components of the virtual photon's selfenergy. While the low- and high-mass regions exhibit the expected limits of transverse and unpolarized photons, respectively, baryon-driven medium effects in the $\rho$-meson mass region create a marked longitudinal polarization that transits into a largely unpolarized emission from the quark-gluon plasma, thus providing a sensitive test of microscopic emission processes in QCD matter. Applications to available data from the HADES and NA60 experiments at SIS and SPS energies, respectively, are consistent with our predictions and set the stage for quantitative polarization studies at FAIR and collider energies.</description>

Abstract: This review article presents historical developments and recent advances in our understanding on the three-body forces and Efimov physics, from an interdisciplinary viewpoint encompassing nuclear physics and cold atoms. Theoretical attempts to elucidate the three-body force with the chiral effective field theory are explained, followed by an overview of experiments aimed at observing signatures of the nuclear three-body force. Some recent experimental and theoretical works in the field of cold atoms devoted to measuring and engineering three-body forces among atoms are also presented. As a phenomenon arising from the three-body effect, Efimov physics in both cold atoms and nuclear systems is reviewed.</description>

      <title>Elliptic and quadrangular flow of protons in the high baryon density region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.06196v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The collective flow provides valuable insights into the anisotropic expansion of particles produced in heavy-ion collisions and is sensitive to the equation of the state of nuclear matter in high-baryon-density regions. In this paper, we use the hadronic transport model SMASH to investigate the elliptic flow ($v_2$), quadrangular flow ($v_4$), and their ratio ($v_{4}/v_{2}^{2}$) in Au+Au collisions at high baryon density. Our results show that the inclusion of baryonic mean-field potential in the model successfully reproduces experimental data from the HADES experiment, indicating that baryonic interactions play an important role in shaping anisotropic flow. In addition to comparing the transverse momentum ($p_T$), rapidity, and centrality dependence of $v_{4}/v_{2}^{2}$ between HADES data and model calculations, we also explore its time evolution and energy dependence across $\sqrt{s_{NN}} =$ 2.4 to 4.5 GeV. While the ratio $v_{4}/v_{2}^{2}$ for high-$p_{T}$ particles approaches 0.5, which aligns with expectations from hydrodynamic behavior, we emphasize that this result primarily reflects agreement with the HADES measurements rather than a definitive indication of ideal fluid behavior. These findings contribute to understanding the early-stage dynamics in heavy-ion collisions at high baryon density.</description>

      <title>Extracting the Speed of Sound in Heavy-Ion Collisions: A Study of Quantum Fluctuations and Thermalization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02777</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The thermalization of quark-gluon plasma created in heavy-ion collisions is crucial for understanding its behavior as a relativistic fluid and the thermodynamic properties of the Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD). This study investigates the role of fluctuations in the relationship between transverse momentum and particle multiplicity, with a particular focus on their impact on extracting the QCD speed of sound. In a thermalized quark-gluon plasma, fluctuations are dominantly quantum in origin and follow a Gaussian distribution due to their independence from the thermodynamic response. In contrast, non-thermalized systems display non-Gaussian fluctuations, reflecting the breakdown of thermalization. By leveraging the Gaussianity condition of quantum fluctuations, the physical value of the speed of sound can be extracted statistically, even in the presence of significant event-by-event fluctuations. This framework provides a robust diagnostic tool for probing thermalization and extracting thermodynamic properties in both large and small collision systems.</description>

Abstract: We perform the first global QCD analysis of electron-nucleon deep-inelastic scattering and related high-energy data including the beyond the Standard Model $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge boson, $Z'$. Contrary to the dark photon case, we find no improvement in the $\chi^2$ relative to the baseline result. The finding allows us to place exclusion limits on the coupling constant of the $Z'$ with mass in the range $M_{Z'} = 2$ to 160 GeV.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.11856v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In the QCD instanton vacuum, the C-even and C-odd nucleon Pauli form factors receive a large contribution from the underlying ensemble of pseudoparticles, that is sensitive to a finite QCD vacuum angle $\theta$. This observation is used to derive explicitly the electric dipole form factor for light quark flavors, and estimate the proton and neutron electric dipole moment induced by a small CP violating $\theta$. The results are in the range of some recently reported lattice simulations.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.12675v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate spatial two-point correlation functions of mesonic operators in two-flavor lattice QCD at high temperatures. The simulated temperatures over the range $T \in [147, 330]$ MeV, where the critical temperature is estimated around 165 MeV. To ensure a good control of the chiral symmetry we employ the M\"obius domain-wall fermion action for two degenerate flavors of quarks. With a lattice cut off $a^{-1}\sim 2.6$ GeV, the residual mass is reduced to 0.14 MeV. With the energy spectrum obtained from the screening mass at incremental values of the temperature range, we examine the $SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R$ chiral symmetry, the anomalous axial $U(1)$ as well as an enhanced symmetry which exchanges the spin degrees of freedom. We also study how the data approaches the perturbative prediction given by twice the Matsubara frequency of free quarks.</description>
