      <title>Auriga Streams II: orbital properties of tidally disrupting satellites of Milky Way-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Galaxies like the Milky Way are surrounded by complex populations of satellites at all stages of tidal disruption. In this paper, we present a dynamical study of the disrupting satellite galaxies in the Auriga simulations that are orbiting 28 distinct Milky Way-mass hosts across three resolutions. We find that the satellite galaxy populations are highly disrupted. The majority of satellites that remain fully intact at present day were accreted recently without experiencing more than one pericentre ($n_{\rm peri} \lesssim 1$) and have large apocentres ($r_{\rm apo} \gtrsim 200$ kpc) and pericentres ($r_{\rm peri} \gtrsim 50$ kpc). The remaining satellites have experienced significant tidal disruption and, given full knowledge of the system, would be classified as stellar streams. We find stellar streams in Auriga across the range of pericentres and apocentres of the known Milky Way dwarf galaxy streams and, interestingly, overlapping significantly with the Milky Way intact satellite population. We find no significant change in satellite orbital distributions across resolution. However, we do see substantial halo-to-halo variance of $(r_\text{peri}, r_\text{apo})$ distributions across host galaxies, as well as a dependence of satellite orbits on host halo mass - systems disrupt at larger pericentres and apocentres in more massive hosts. Our results suggest that either cosmological simulations (including, but not limited to, Auriga) are disrupting satellites far too readily, or that the Milky Way's satellites are more disrupted than current imaging surveys have revealed. Future observing facilities and careful mock observations of these systems will be key to revealing the nature of this apparent discrepancy.</description>

      <title>Auriga Streams I: disrupting satellites surrounding Milky Way-mass haloes at multiple resolutions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09144</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09144v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In a hierarchically formed Universe, galaxies accrete smaller systems that tidally disrupt as they evolve in the host's potential. We present a complete catalogue of disrupting galaxies accreted onto Milky Way-mass haloes from the Auriga suite of cosmological magnetohydrodynamic zoom-in simulations. We classify accretion events as intact satellites, stellar streams, or phase-mixed systems based on automated criteria calibrated to a visually classified sample, and match accretions to their counterparts in haloes re-simulated at higher resolution. Most satellites with a bound progenitor at the present day have lost substantial amounts of stellar mass -- 67 per cent have $f_\text{bound} &lt; 0.97$ (our threshold to no longer be considered intact), while 53 per cent satisfy a more stringent $f_\text{bound} &lt; 0.8$. Streams typically outnumber intact systems, contribute a smaller fraction of overall accreted stars, and are substantial contributors at intermediate distances from the host centre ($\sim$0.1 to $\sim$0.7$R_\text{200m}$, or $\sim$35 to $\sim$250 kpc for the Milky Way). We also identify accretion events that disrupt to form streams around massive intact satellites instead of the main host. Streams are more likely than intact or phase-mixed systems to have experienced preprocessing, suggesting this mechanism is important for setting disruption rates around Milky Way-mass haloes. All of these results are preserved across different simulation resolutions, though we do find some hints that satellites disrupt more readily at lower resolution. The Auriga haloes suggest that disrupting satellites surrounding Milky Way-mass galaxies are the norm and that a wealth of tidal features waits to be uncovered in upcoming surveys.</description>

      <title>Exploring the interaction between the MW and LMC with a large sample of blue horizontal branch stars from the DESI survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09149v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) is a Milky Way (MW) satellite that is massive enough to gravitationally attract the MW disc and inner halo, causing significant motion of the inner MW with respect to the outer halo. In this work, we probe this interaction by constructing a sample of 9,866 blue horizontal branch (BHB) stars with radial velocities from the DESI spectroscopic survey out to 120 kpc from the Galactic centre. This is the largest spectroscopic set of BHB stars in the literature to date, and it contains four times more stars with Galactocentric distances beyond 50 kpc than previous BHB catalogues. Using the DESI BHB sample combined with SDSS BHBs, we measure the bulk radial velocity of stars in the outer halo and observe that the velocity in the Southern Galactic hemisphere is different by 3.7$\sigma$ from the North. Modelling the projected velocity field shows that its dipole component is directed at a point 22 degrees away from the LMC along its orbit, which we interpret as the travel direction of the inner MW. The velocity field includes a monopole term that is -24 km/s, which we refer to as compression velocity. This velocity is significantly larger than predicted by the current models of the MW and LMC interaction. This work uses DESI data from its first two years of observations, but we expect that with upcoming DESI data releases, the sample of BHB stars will increase and our ability to measure the MW-LMC interaction will improve significantly.</description>

      <title>Mergers, Radio Jets, and Quenching Star-Formation in Massive Galaxies: Quantifying their Synchronized Cosmic Evolution &amp; Assessing the Energetics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The existence of a population of massive quiescent galaxies with little to no star-formation poses a challenge to our understanding of galaxy evolution. The physical process that quenched the star formation in these galaxies is debated, but the most popular possibility is that feedback from supermassive black holes lifts or heats the gas that would otherwise be used to form stars. In this paper, we evaluate this idea in two ways. First, we compare the cumulative growth in the cosmic inventory of the total stellar mass in quiescent galaxies to the corresponding growth in the amount of kinetic energy carried by radio jets. We find that these two inventories are remarkably well-synchronized, with about half of the total amounts being created in the epoch from z of 1 to 2. We also show that these agree extremely well with the corresponding growth in the cumulative number of major mergers that result in massive (over 100 billion solar masses) galaxies. We therefore argue that major mergers trigger the radio jets and also transform the galaxies from disks to spheroids. Second, we evaluate the total amount of kinetic energy delivered by jets and compare it to the baryonic binding energy of the galaxies. We find the jet kinetic energy is more than sufficient to quench star-formation, and the quenching process should be more effective in more massive galaxies. We show that these results are quantitatively consistent with recent measurements of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect seen in massive galaxies at z of 1.</description>

      <title>From UV-bright Galaxies to Early Disks: the Importance of Turbulent Star Formation in the Early Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Bursty star formation at early times can explain the surprising abundance of early UV-bright galaxies revealed by JWST but can also be a reason for the delayed formation of galactic disks in high-resolution cosmological simulations. We investigate this interplay in a cosmological simulation of an early-forming Milky Way analog with detailed modeling of cold turbulent interstellar medium (ISM), star formation, and feedback. We find that the modeling of locally variable star formation efficiency (SFE) coupled with the ISM turbulence on the scales of star-forming regions is important for producing both early bursty evolution and early formation and survival of galactic disks. Such a model introduces a qualitatively new channel of the global star formation rate (SFR) burstiness caused by chaotic fluctuations in the average SFE due to changes in the ISM turbulence, which, in our simulation, dominates the short-term SFR variability. The average SFE stays low, close to $\sim 1\%$ per freefall time, and its variation decreases when the gas disk forms, leading to only mild effects of stellar feedback on the early disk, enabling its survival. By rerunning our simulation with fixed SFE values, we explicitly show that low SFEs lead to smoother SFR histories and disk survival, while high SFEs lead to bursty SFRs and hinder disk formation. The model with variable SFE switches between these two regimes at the moment of disk formation. These trends are missing in more commonly used star formation prescriptions with fixed SFE; in particular, the prescriptions tying star formation to molecular gas should be interpreted with caution because the two are decoupled at early times, as we also show in this paper.</description>

      <title>Sensitivity Analysis of Aromatic Chemistry to Gas-Phase Kinetics in a Dark Molecular Cloud Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09212</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09212v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The increasingly large number of complex organic molecules detected in the interstellar medium necessitates robust kinetic models that can be relied upon for investigating the involved chemical processes. Such models require rate constants for each of the thousands of reactions; the values of these are often estimated or extrapolated, leading to large uncertainties that are rarely quantified. We have performed a global Monte Carlo and a more local one-at-a-time sensitivity analysis on the gas-phase rate coefficients in a 3-phase dark cloud model. Time-dependent sensitivities have been calculated using four metrics to determine key reactions for the overall network as well as for the cyanonaphthalene molecule in particular, an important interstellar species that is severely under-produced by current models. All four metrics find that reactions involving small, reactive species that initiate hydrocarbon growth have large effects on the overall network. Cyanonaphthalene is most sensitive to a number of these reactions as well as ring-formation of the phenyl cation (C6H5+) and aromatic growth from benzene to naphthalene. Future efforts should prioritize constraining rate coefficients of key reactions and expanding the network surrounding these processes. These results highlight the strength of sensitivity analysis techniques to identify critical processes in complex chemical networks, such as those often used in astrochemical modeling.</description>

      <title>The JWST-NIRCam View of Sagittarius C. I. Massive Star Formation and Protostellar Outflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09253</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09253v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present James Webb Space Telescope (JWST)-NIRCam observations of the massive star-forming molecular cloud Sagittarius C (Sgr C) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). In conjunction with ancillary mid-IR and far-IR data, we characterize the two most massive protostars in Sgr C via spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, estimating that they each have current masses of $m_* \sim 20\:M_\odot$ and surrounding envelope masses of $\sim 100\:M_\odot$. We report a census of lower-mass protostars in Sgr C via a search for infrared counterparts to mm continuum dust cores found with ALMA. We identify 88 molecular hydrogen outflow knot candidates originating from outflows from protostars in Sgr C, the first such unambiguous detections in the infrared in the CMZ. About a quarter of these are associated with flows from the two massive protostars in Sgr C; these extend for over 1 pc and are associated with outflows detected in ALMA SiO line data. An additional $\sim 40$ features likely trace shocks in outflows powered by lower-mass protostars throughout the cloud. We report the discovery of a new star-forming region hosting two prominent bow shocks and several other line-emitting features driven by at least two protostars. We infer that one of these is forming a high-mass star given an SED-derived mass of $m_* \sim 9\:M_\odot$ and associated massive ($\sim 90\:M_\odot$) mm core and water maser. Finally, we identify a population of miscellaneous Molecular Hydrogen Objects (MHOs) that do not appear to be associated with protostellar outflows.</description>

      <title>Measuring Star Formation Histories from Asymptotic Giant Branch Stars: A Demonstration in M31</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09256v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate how near infrared (NIR) imaging of resolved luminous asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars can be used to measure well-constrained star formation histories (SFHs) across cosmic time. Using UKIRT J and K-band imaging of M31, we first show excellent agreement over the past $\sim8$ Gyr between the PHAT SFH of M31's outer disk derived from a deep optical color-magnitude diagram (CMD; $\sim3.3\times10^{7}$ stars with $M_{F814W} \lesssim +2$), and our spatially-matched SFH based only on modeling AGB stars on a NIR CMD ($\sim2.3\times10^{4}$ stars with $M_{J} \lesssim -5$). We find that only hundreds of AGB stars are needed for reliable SFH recovery, owing to their excellent age sensitivity in the NIR. We then measure the spatially resolved SFH of M31's inner stellar halo ($D_{M31, projected} \sim20-30$ kpc) using $\sim10^5$ AGB stars. We find: (i) a dominant burst of star formation across M31's inner stellar halo from $4-5$ Gyr ago and lower level, spatially distributed star formation $\sim1-2$ Gyr ago; (ii) a younger 'quenching time' in the vicinity of NGC 205 ($\sim1$ Gyr ago) than near M32 ($\sim1.1$ Gyr ago); (iii) $M_{\star}\sim4\pm0.5\times10^9 M_{\odot}$ formed over the past $\sim8$ Gyr. We discuss some caveats and the enormous potential of resolved AGB stars in the NIR for measuring SFHs back to ancient epochs ($\sim13$ Gyr ago) in galaxies to large distances ($D\gtrsim20$ Mpc) with JWST, Roman, and Euclid.</description>

      <title>Turbulent Pressure Heats Gas and Suppresses Star Formation in Galactic Bar Molecular Clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09258</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09258v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) of the Milky Way is fed by gas inflows from the Galactic disk along almost radial trajectories aligned with the major axis of the Galactic bar. However, despite being fundamental to all processes in the nucleus of the galaxy, these inflows have been studied significantly less than the CMZ itself. We present observations of various molecular lines between 215 and 230 GHz for 20 clouds with $|\ell| &lt; 10^\circ$, which are candidates for clouds in the Galactic bar due to their warm temperatures and broad lines relative to typical Galactic disk clouds, using the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) Atacama Compact Array (ACA). We measure gas temperatures, shocks, star formation rates, turbulent Mach numbers, and masses for these clouds. Although some clouds may be in the Galactic disk despite their atypical properties, nine clouds are likely associated with regions in the Galactic bar, and in these clouds, turbulent pressure is suppressing star formation. In clouds with no detected star formation, turbulence is the dominant heating mechanism, whereas photo-electric processes heat the star-forming clouds. We find that the ammonia (NH3) and formaldehyde (H2CO) temperatures probe different gas components, and in general each transition appears to trace different molecular gas phases within the clouds. We also measure the CO-to-H2 X-factor in the bar to be an order of magnitude lower than the typical Galactic value. These observations provide evidence that molecular clouds achieve CMZ-like properties before reaching the CMZ</description>

      <title>Unveiling the quasar main sequence: illuminating the complexity of active galactic nuclei and their evolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09262</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09262v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Eigenvector 1 schema, or the main sequence of quasars, was introduced as an analogous scheme to the HR diagram that would allow us to understand the more complex, extended sources - active galactic nuclei (AGNs) that harbor accreting supermassive black holes. The study has spanned more than three decades and has advanced our knowledge of the diversity of Type-1 AGNs from both observational and theoretical aspects. The quasar main sequence, in its simplest form, is the plane between the FWHM of the broad H$\beta$ emission line and the strength of the optical FeII emission to the H$\beta$. While the former allows the estimation of the black hole mass, the latter enables direct measurement of the metal content and traces the accretion rate of the AGN. Together, they allow us to track the evolution of AGN in terms of the activity of the central nuclei, its effect on the line-emitting regions surrounding the AGN, and their diversity making them suitable distance indicators to study the expansion of our Universe. This mini-review aims to provide (i) a brief history leading up to the present day in the study of the quasar main sequence, (ii) introduce us to the many possibilities to study AGNs with the main sequence as a guiding tool, and (iii) highlight some recent, exciting lines of researches at the frontier of this ever-growing field.</description>

      <title>Probing Three-Dimensional Magnetic Fields: IV -- Synchrotron Polarization Derivative and Vision Transformer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Measuring the 3D spatial distribution of magnetic fields in the interstellar medium and the intracluster medium is crucial yet challenging. The probing of 3D magnetic field's 3D distribution, including the field plane-of-sky orientation ($\psi$), the magnetic field's inclination angle ($\gamma$) relative to the line of sight, and magnetization ($\sim$ the inverse Alfv\'en Mach number $M_A^{-1}$), at different distances from the observer makes the task even more formidable. However, the anisotropy and Faraday decorrelation effect in polarized synchrotron emission offer a unique solution. We show that due to the Faraday decorrelation, only regions up to a certain effective path length along the line of sight contribute to the measured polarization. The 3D spatial information can be consequently derived from synchrotron polarization derivatives (SPDs), which are calculated from the difference in synchrotron polarization across two wavelengths. We find that the 3D magnetic field can be estimated from the anisotropy observed in SPD: the elongation direction of the SPD structures probes $\psi$ and the degree of SPD anisotropy, along with its morphological curvature, provides insights into $M_A^{-1}$ and $\gamma$. To extract these anisotropic features and their correlation with the 3D magnetic field, we propose utilizing a machine learning approach, specifically the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture, which was exemplified by the success of the ChatGPT. We train the ViT using synthetic synchrotron observations generated from MHD turbulence simulations in sub-Alfv\'enic and super-Alfv\'enic conditions. We show that ViT's application to multi-wavelength SPDs can successfully reconstruct the 3D magnetic fields' 3D spatial distribution.</description>

Abstract: A simple analytic model is presented to predict the near-IR H2 fluorescent line intensities emitted by diffuse interstellar clouds with a Plummer density profile. It is applicable to sightlines where (1) the column densities of H and H2 have been measured and (2) the peak gas density can be estimated from extinction maps or observations of C2 absorption.</description>

      <title>The effects of super-Eddington accretion and feedback on the growth of early supermassive black holes and galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09450v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present results of cosmological zoom-in simulations of a massive protocluster down to redshift $z\approx4$ (when the halo mass is $\approx10^{13}$ M$_\odot$) using the SWIFT code and the EAGLE galaxy formation model, focusing on supermassive black hole (BH) physics. The BH was seeded with a mass of $10^4$ M$_\odot$ at redshift $z\approx17$. We compare the base model that uses an Eddington limit on the BH accretion rate and thermal isotropic feedback by the AGN, with one where super-Eddington accretion is allowed, as well as two other models with BH spin and jets. In the base model, the BH grows at the Eddington limit from $z=9$ to $z=5.5$, when it becomes massive enough to halt its own and its host galaxy's growth through feedback. We find that allowing super-Eddington accretion leads to drastic differences, with the BH going through an intense but short super-Eddington growth burst around $z\approx7.5$, during which it increases its mass by orders of magnitude, before feedback stops further growth (of both the BH and the galaxy). By $z\approx4$ the galaxy is only half as massive in the super-Eddington cases, and an order of magnitude more extended, with the half-mass radius reaching values of a few physical kpc instead of a few hundred pc. The BH masses in our simulations are consistent with the intrinsic BH mass$-$stellar mass relation inferred from high-redshift observations by JWST. This shows that galaxy formation models using the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology are capable of reproducing the observed massive BHs at high redshift. Allowing jets, either at super- or sub-Eddington rates, has little impact on the host galaxy properties, but leads to lower BH masses as a result of stronger self-regulation, which is itself a consequence of higher feedback efficiencies.</description>

      <title>The AstroSat UV Deep Field South II: A diverse set of Lyman-continuum leakers at $z\sim1$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09515v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of 5 newly identifed Lyman-continuum (LyC) leaker candidates at redshifts 0.99-1.42 in the AstroSat UV Deep Field South F154W image. We derive physical properties of these galaxies using a combination of spectral-energy distribution fitting and information from publicly available spectra. The estimated escape fraction of these objects vary from 14-85\% after accounting for the IGM attenuation. With only about a dozen known leakers at these redshifts, these detections significantly raise the fraction of LyC leakers in this redshift range. High-resolution HST UV imaging reveals that a subset of the galaxies in our sample have blue star-forming structures that are likely associated with harder ionizing sources. We find tentative evidence that the LyC emission is spatially offset from the non-ionizing UV continuum centers of these galaxies. The integrated properties of these galaxies, such as the UV continuum slope, dust attenuation, stellar mass, and $[\text{O III}] \lambda 5007/ [\text{O II}] \lambda 3727$ ratios, make them atypical compared to known LyC leakers. The leakage of LyC photons from these systems presents a compelling challenge.</description>

      <title>The formation and survival of the Milky Way's oldest stellar disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09705</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09705v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: It remains a mystery when our Milky Way first formed a stellar disk component that survived and maintained its disk structure from subsequent galaxy mergers. We present a study of the age-dependent structure and star formation rate of the Milky Way's disk using high-alpha stars with significant orbital angular momentum that have precise age determinations. Our results show that the radial scale length is nearly independent of age, while the vertical scale height experienced dramatic evolution. A disk-like geometry presents even for populations older than 13 Gyr, with the scale height-to-length ratio dropping below 0.5 for populations younger than 12.5 Gyr. We dub the oldest population that has maintained a disk geometry - apparently formed over 13 Gyr ago - PanGu. With an estimated present-day stellar mass of $2 \times 10^9$ $M_\odot$, PanGu is presumed to be a major stellar component of our Galaxy in the earliest epoch. The total present-day stellar mass of the whole high-alpha disk is $2 \times 10^{10}$ $M_\odot$, mostly formed during a distinct star formation rate peak of 11 $M_\odot$ per year around 11 Gyrs ago. A comparison with Milky Way analogs in the TNG50 simulations implies that our Galaxy has experienced an exceptionally quiescent dynamical history, even before the Gaia-Enceladus merger.</description>

      <title>Partially Ionized Gas at Equilibrium Powered by Ultraviolet Irradiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09753</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09753v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the formation of a partially ionized zone behind the usual H II zone in photo-ionized gas. While Lyman continuum photons are depleted before reaching this zone, Balmer continuum photons can ionize the $n=2$ hydrogen atoms as those are pumped by scattering-trapped Ly$\alpha$ photons. Ly$\alpha$ photons need to be replenished in a steady state, but fast radiative cooling at high gas temperature makes replenishment through electron collisional excitation of $n=2$ inefficient. Independently of the temperature, Raman scattering of incident continuum photons on the Lyman-series damping wings injects Ly$\alpha$ photons in the line core and pumps the $n=2$ state, which helps realize a partially ionized equilibrium at $5000$--$7000\,$K. Since the ratio between the incident radiation flux and gas density is limited by the dynamic effects of radiation pressure, significant ionization fraction is only realized at densities $n_{\rm H} \gtrsim 10^7\,{\rm cm}^{-3}$, intermediate between ordinary H II regions and AGN Broad Line Regions. A large H$\alpha$/H$\beta$ line ratio results from such partially ionized gas as large Balmer line optical depths enhance the $n=3$ population relative to higher $n$ states. Partial ionization also provides the ideal condition for internally forming an intense and very broad Ly$\alpha$ line, which can power strong fluorescent metal emission lines observed from the Weigelt blobs of $\eta$ Carinae in the Galaxy, and from a candidate young super star cluster in the Cosmic Noon Sunburst galaxy. This phenomenon may also have implications for understanding the spectra of high-$z$ galaxies that show unusually dense ionized gas.</description>

      <title>On the Stellar Disk Vertical Scale Height of Edge-on Galaxies from S$^{4}$G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09762v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Disk galaxies viewed as thin planar structures resulting from the conservation of angular momentum of an initially rotating pre-galactic cloud allow merely a first-order model of galaxy formation. Still, the presence of vertically extended structures has allowed us to gather a deeper understanding of the richness in astrophysical processes (e.g., minor mergers, secular evolution) that ultimately result in the observed diversity in disk galaxies and their vertical extensions. We measure the stellar disk scale height of 46 edge-on spiral galaxies from the Spitzer Survey of Stellar Structure in Galaxies (S$^{4}$G) project. This paper aims to investigate the radial variation of the stellar disk vertical scale height and the existence of the so-called thick disk component in our sample. The measurements were done using one-, two-, and three-dimensional profile fitting techniques using simple models. We found that two-thirds of our sample shows the presence of a thick disk, suggesting that these galaxies have been accreting gaseous material from their surroundings. We found an average thick-to-thin disk scale height ratio of 2.65, which agrees with previous studies. Our findings also support the disk flaring model, which suggests that the vertical scale height increases with radius. We further found good correlations: between the scale height $h_{z}$ and the scale length and between $h_z$ and the optical de Vaucouleurs radius $R_{25}$.</description>

      <title>Revisiting the Galactic Winds in M82 II: Development of Multiphase Outflows in Simulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09782</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09782v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We performed a suit of three-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations with a resolution of $\sim10$ parsecs to investigate the development of multiphase galactic wind in M82. The star formation and related feedback processes are solved self-consistently using a sink particle method, rather than relying on various assumptions that were used in previous studies. Our simulations produce a starburst event lasting around 25 Myr, which has a total stellar mass of 1.62 - 3.34 $\times 10^8\, \rm{M_{\odot}}$, consistent with observational estimates. The total injected supernova energy is between $1.14\times 10^{57}$ and $2.4\times 10^{57} \rm{erg}$. Supernova (SN) feedback heats portions of the cool gas in the central disc to warm and hot phases, and then drives the gas in all three phases out, eventually forming multiphase outflows. These outflows can replicate key properties of the winds observed in M82, such as morphology, mass outflow rate, and X-ray emission flux, provided the gas return from star-forming clumps to the interstellar medium is implemented appropriately. The maximum mass outflow rate of all gas (hot) is about 6-12 (2-3)$\rm{M_{\odot}/yr}$ at $r\sim4.0\,$ kpc, corresponding to a mass loading factor of 2-4. However, the outflow velocities in our simulations are slower than observational estimates by $\sim 20\%-60\%$. The gas return process significantly influences the outflow properties, while the initial gas distribution in the nuclear region has a moderate effect. However, our results face some challenges in achieving convergence as the resolution increases. We discuss potential improvements to address these issues in future work.</description>

      <title>Interpreting Millimeter Emission from IMEGIN galaxies NGC 2146 and NGC 2976</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09827v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The millimeter continuum emission from galaxies provides important information about cold dust, its distribution, heating, and role in their InterStellar Medium (ISM). This emission also carries an unknown portion of the free-free and synchrotron radiation. The IRAM 30m Guaranteed Time Large Project, Interpreting Millimeter Emission of Galaxies with IRAM and NIKA2 (IMEGIN) provides a unique opportunity to study the origin of the millimeter emission on angular resolutions of &lt;18" in a sample of nearby galaxies. As a pilot study, we present millimeter observations of two IMEGIN galaxies, NGC 2146 (starburst) and NGC 2976 (peculiar dwarf) at 1.15 mm and 2 mm. Combined with the data taken with Spitzer, Herschel, Plank, WSRT, and the 100m Effelsberg telescopes, we model the infrared-to-radio Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of these galaxies, both globally and at resolved scales, using a Bayesian approach to 1) dissect different components of the millimeter emission, 2) investigate the physical properties of dust, and 3) explore correlations between millimeter emission, gas, and Star Formation Rate (SFR). We find that cold dust is responsible for most of the 1.15 mm emission in both galaxies and at 2 mm in NGC 2976. The free-free emission emits more importantly in NGC 2146 at 2 mm. The cold dust emissivity index is flatter in the dwarf galaxy ($\beta = 1.3\pm 0.1$) compared to the starburst galaxy ($\beta = 1.7\pm 0.1$). Mapping the dust-to-gas ratio, we find that it changes between 0.004 and 0.01 with a mean of $0.006\pm0.001$ in the dwarf galaxy. In addition, no global balance holds between the formation and dissociation of H$_2$ in this galaxy. We find tight correlations between the millimeter emission and both the SFR and molecular gas mass in both galaxies.</description>

      <title>ALMA-IMF XVIII: The assembly of a star cluster: Dense N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) kinematics in the massive G351.77 protocluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09843</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09843v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: ALMA-IMF observed 15 massive protoclusters capturing multiple spectral lines and the continuum emission. We focus on the G351.77 protocluster ($\sim$ 2500 M$_{\odot}$, estimated from single-dish continuum observations) located at 2 kpc. We trace the dense gas emission and kinematics with N$_2$H$^+$ (1-0) at $\sim$ 4 kau resolution. We estimate an N$_2$H$^+$ relative abundance $\sim (1.7 \pm 0.5) \times 10^{-10}$. We decompose the N$_2$H$^+$ emission into up to two velocity components, highlighting the kinematic complexity in the dense gas. By examining the position-velocity (PV) diagrams on small scales, we observe clear inflow signatures (V-shapes) associated with dense cores. The most prominent V-shape has a mass inflow rate of $\sim 9.8 \times 10^{-4}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ and a short timescale of $\sim$ 15.6 kyr. We also observe V-shapes without associated cores. This suggests both that cores or centers of accretion exist below the 1.3 mm detection limit, and that the V-shapes may be viable tracers of very early accretion and star formation on $\sim$ 4 kau scales. The large-scale PV diagram shows that the protocluster is separated into 2 principal velocity structures. Combined with smaller scale DCN and H$_2$CO emission, we propose a scenario of larger scale slow contraction with rotation in the center based on simple toy models. This scenario leads the suggestion of outside-in evolution of the protocluster as it collapses. The gas depletion times implied by the V-shapes are short ($\sim$ 0.3 Myr), requiring either very fast cluster formation, and/or continuous mass feeding of the protocluster. The latter is possible via the Mother Filament G351.77 is forming out of. The similarities in the properties of G351.77 and the recently published work in G353.41 indicate that many of the physical conditions inferred via the ALMA-IMF N$_2$H$^+$ observations may be generic to protoclusters.</description>

      <title>The environment as a driver of galaxy evolution with the miniJPAS survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09931</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09931v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This thesis aims at discerning the effect of environment on galaxy evolution and on the properties of galaxies, using the data from the miniJPAS survey, a 1~deg$^2$ survey that uses the same photometric filter system as the incoming J-PAS survey, which is already in its scientific verification phase. This system is composed of 56 narrow-band filters that provide an spectral resolution comparable to low-resolution spectroscopy. We study the effect of environment using two approaches. First, we study the spatially resolved galaxies from miniJPAS. Secondly, we studied the galaxy population in the most massive galaxy cluster detected in the miniJPAS footprint, that is, the cluster mJPC2470-1771. We have developed a tool that automatises all the required processes for the analysis of the data. After probing the accuracy and reliability of the photmetry obtained with our tool, we apply it to a miniJPAS sample of spatially resolved galaxies, divided into four sub-samples according to their spectral-type (red/quiescent and blue/star forming), and environment (field or galaxy group). We find that redder, denser regions are usually older, more metal rich, and show lower values of the intensity of the star formation rate and the specific star formation rate than bluer and less dense regions. Regarding the mJPC2470-1771 cluster, our results point that more massive, redder and older galaxies typically populate the inner regions of the cluster. As a conclusion, our results suggest that galaxies in clusters are formed at a similar epoch, but have experienced different star formation histories. We conclude that the environment plays a role on galaxy evolution, but it is mainly reflected through the galaxy populations found in high density environments, such as galaxy clusters and groups, where the fraction of red, quiescent galaxies is larger in comparison to the field.</description>

      <title>AGN feeding along a one-armed spiral in NGC 4593: A study using ALMA CO(2-1) observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09941</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09941v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate active galactic nuclei (AGN) feeding through the molecular gas (CO(2-1) emission) properties of the local Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC 4593, using Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) observations and other multi-wavelength data. Our study aims to understand the interplay between the AGN and the interstellar medium (ISM) in this galaxy, examining the role of the AGN in steering gas dynamics within its host galaxy, evaluating the energy injected into the ISM, and determining whether gas is inflowing or outflowing from the galaxy. After reducing the ALMA CO(2-1) images, we employed two models, 3D-Barolo and DISCFIT, to construct a disc model and fit its emission to the ALMA data. Additionally, we used photometric data to build a spectral energy distribution (SED) and applied the CIGALE code to derive key physical properties of the AGN and its host. Our analysis reveals a complex interplay within NGC 4593, including a clear rotational pattern, the influence of a non-axisymmetric bar potential, and a central molecular zone (CMZ)-like ring. We observe an outflow of CO(2-1) gas along the minor axis, at a distance of approximately 220 pc from the nucleus. The total molecular gas mass is estimated to be between $1 - 5 \times 10^8 \, M_{\odot}$, with non-circular motions contributing about 10\%. Our SED analysis indicates an AGN fraction of 0.88 and a star formation rate (SFR) of 0.42 $M_{\odot} \, \text{yr}^{-1}$. These findings highlight the complex dynamics in the centre of NGC 4593, which are significantly influenced by the presence of the AGN. The overall physical properties of this system suggest that the AGN has a substantial impact on the evolution of NGC 4593.</description>

      <title>JWST/NIRSpec Observations of Brown Dwarfs in the Orion Nebula Cluster</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10000v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have used the multiobject mode of the Near-Infrared Spectrograph (NIRSpec) on board the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) to obtain low-resolution 1-5um spectra of 22 brown dwarf candidates in the Orion Nebula Cluster, which were selected with archival images from the Hubble Space Telescope. One of the targets was previously classified as a Herbig-Haro (HH) object and exhibits strong emission in H I, H2, and the fundamental band of CO, further demonstrating that HH objects can have bright emission in that CO band. The remaining targets have late spectral types (M6.5 to early L) and are young based on gravity sensitive features, as expected for low-mass members of the cluster. According to theoretical evolutionary models, these objects should have masses that range from the hydrogen burning limit to 0.003-0.007 Msun. Two of the NIRSpec targets were identified as proplyds in earlier analysis of Hubble images. They have spectral types of M6.5 and M7.5, making them two of the coolest and least massive known proplyds. Another brown dwarf shows absorption bands at 3-5um from ices containing H2O, CO2, OCN-, and CO, indicating that it is either an edge-on class II system or a class I protostar. It is the coolest and least massive object that has detections of these ice features. In addition, it appears to be the first candidate for a protostellar brown dwarf that has spectroscopy confirming its late spectral type.</description>

      <title>Could the inter-band lag of active galactic nucleus vary randomly?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The inter-band lags among the optical broad-band continua of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) have been intensively explored over the past decade. However, the nature of the lags remains under debate. Here utilizing two distinct scenarios for AGN variability, i.e., the thermal fluctuation of accretion disk and the reprocessing of both the accretion disk and clouds in the broad line region, we show that, owing to the random nature of AGN variability, the inter-band lags of an individual AGN would vary from one campaign with a finite baseline to another. Specifically, the thermal fluctuation scenario implies larger variations in the lags than the reprocessing scenario. Moreover, the former predicts a positive correlation between the lag and variation amplitude, while the latter does not result in such a correlation. For both scenarios, averaging the lags of an individual AGN measured with repeated and non-overlapping campaigns would give rise to a stable lag, which is larger for a longer baseline and gets saturation for a sufficiently long baseline. However, obtaining the stable lag for an individual AGN is very time-consuming. Alternatively, it can be equivalently inferred by averaging the lags of a sample of AGNs with similar physical properties, thus can be properly compared with predictions of AGN models. In addition, discussed are several new observational tests suggested by our simulations as well as the role of the deep high-cadence surveys of the Wide Field Survey Telescope in enriching our knowledge of the lags.</description>

      <title>ASW$^2$DF: Census of the obscured star formation in a galaxy cluster in formation at $z=2.2$</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10169v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the results of the deep and wide Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) 1.2 mm mapping of the Spiderweb protocluster at $z=2.16$. The observations were divided into six contiguous fields covering a survey area of 19.3\,arcmin$^2$. With $\sim$13h on-source time, the final maps in the six fields reach the 1$\sigma$ rms noise in a range of $40.3-57.1 \mu$Jy at a spatial resolution of $0.5-0.9$ arcsec. By using different source extraction codes and careful visual inspection, we detect 47 ALMA sources at a significance higher than 4$\sigma$. We construct the differential and cumulative number counts down to $\sim0.2$ mJy after the correction for purity and completeness obtained from Monte Carlo simulations. The ALMA 1.2 mm number counts of dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) in the Spiderweb protocluster are overall two times that of general fields, some fields/regions showing even higher overdensities (more than a factor of 3). This is consistent with the results from previous studies over a larger scale using single-dish instruments. Comparison of the spatial distributions between different populations indicates that our ALMA sources are likely drawn from the same distribution as CO(1-0) emitters from the COALAS large program, but distinct from that of H$\alpha$ emitters. The cosmic SFR density of the ALMA sources is consistent with previous results (e.g. LABOCA 870 $\mu$m observations) after accounting for the difference in volume. We show that molecular gas masses estimates from dust measurements are not consistent with the ones derived from CO(1-0) and thus have to be taken with caution. The multiplicity fraction of single-dish DSFGs is higher than that of the field. Moreover, two extreme concentrations of ALMA sources are found on the outskirts of the Spiderweb protocluster, with an excess of more than 12 times that of general fields.</description>

      <title>The Stellar Abundances and Galactic Evolution Survey (SAGES) III -- The g/r/i-band Data Release</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10218v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Stellar Abundances and Galactic Evolution Survey (SAGES) is a multi-band survey that covers the northern sky area of ~12000 deg2. Nanshan One-meter Wide-field Telescope (NOWT) of Xinjiang Astronomical Observatory (XAO) carried out observations on g/r/i bands. We present here the survey strategy, data processing, catalog construction, and database schema. The observations of NOWT started in 2016 August and was completed in 2018 January, total 17827 frames were obtained and ~4600 deg2 sky areas were covered. In this paper, we released the catalog of the data in the g/r/i bands observed with NOWT. In total, there are 109,197,578 items of the source records. The catalog is the supplement for the SDSS for the bright end, and the combination of our catalog and these catalogs could be helpful for source selections for other surveys and the Milky Way sciences, e.g., white dwarf candidates and stellar flares.</description>

      <title>Inferring the dust emission at submillimeter and millimeter wavelengths using neural networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10263</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10263v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Planck mission provided all-sky dust emission maps in the submm to mm range at an angular resolution of 5'. In addition, some specific sources can be observed at long wavelengths and higher resolution using ground-based telescopes. These observations are limited to small scales and require extensive data processing before they become available for scientific analysis. They also suffer from extended emission filtering. At present, we are still unable to fully understand the emissivity variations observed in different astrophysical environments at long wavelengths. It is therefore challenging to estimate any dust emission in the submm-mm at a better resolution than the 5' from Planck. In this analysis, based on supervised deep learning algorithms, we produced dust emission predictions in the two Planck bands centered at 850 mic and 1.38 mm, at the Herschel resolution (37''). Herschel data of Galactic environments, ranging from 160 to 500 mic and smoothed to 5', were used to train the neural network. Then, using Herschel data only, the model was applied to predict dust emission maps at 37''. The neural network is capable of reproducing dust emission maps of various Galactic environments. Remarkably, it also performs well for nearby extragalactic environments. This could indicate that large dust grains have similar properties in both our Galaxy and nearby galaxies, or at least that their spectral behaviors are comparable in Galactic and extragalactic environments. We provide dust emission prediction maps at 850 mic and 1.38 mm at the 37'' of several surveys: Hi-GAL, Gould Belt, Cold Cores, HERITAGE, Helga, HerM33es, KINGFISH, and VNGS. The ratio of these two wavelength brightness bands reveals a derived emissivity spectral index statistically close to 1 for all the surveys, which favors the hypothesis of a flattened dust emission spectrum for wavelengths larger than 850 mic.</description>

      <title>Searching for similarities in the accretion flow of Seyfert 1 galaxies and cataclysmic variables based on flare profiles of IRAS 13224-3809, 1H 0707-495, Mrk 766 and MV Lyr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AIMS: We studied fast variability of three selected AGNs, IRAS 13224-3809, 1H 0707-495 and Mrk 766, and the cataclysmic variable MV Lyr observed by XMM-Newton and Kepler spacecrafts, respectively. Our goal is to search for common origin of the variability and to test the so-called sandwich model where a geometrically thick corona is surrounding a geometrically thin disc. METHODS: We study substructures of the averaged flare profiles. The flare profile method identifies individual flares in the light curve, and averages them. Direct fitting of the profile substructures identify individual characteristic frequencies seen in standard power density spectra (PDS) as a break frequency or quasi-periodic oscillation. The credibility of flare profile substructures is demonstrated by comparison with autocorrelation function. RESULTS: We found that the flare profiles of AGNs are similar to that of the cataclysmic variable in the low state. We explain this as a consequence of a truncated inner disc in a sandwich model. The same scenario is also able to explain the presence of characteristic break frequencies in X-ray PDS, but not seen in optical. We also searched for substructures in the flare profile of IRAS 13224-3809. In addition to a permanently present main flare, we found transient side-lobe appearing before the main flare and only seen in a high flux period. This complex flare profile of this AGN suggests that an additional source of X-rays appears during the high flux period. We propose a scenario in which an accretion flow fluctuation enters the sandwich corona and propagates further to some very central part of the accretion disc.</description>

      <title>Ten years of searching for relics of AGN jet feedback through RAD@home citizen science</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10294v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the evolution of galaxies cannot exclude the important role played by the central supermassive black hole and the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Simulations have strongly suggested the negative feedback of AGN Jet/wind/outflows on the ISM/CGM of a galaxy leading to the eventual decline of star formation. However, no "smoking gun" evidence exists so far where relics of feedback, observed in any band, are consistent with the time scale of a major decline in star formation, in any sample of galaxies. Relics of any AGN-driven outflows will be observed as a faint and fuzzy structure which may be difficult to characterise by automated algorithms but trained citizen scientists can possibly perform better through their intuitive vision with additional heterogeneous data available anywhere on the Internet. RAD@home, launched on 15th April 2013, is not only the first Indian Citizen Science Research (CSR) platform in astronomy but also the only CSR publishing discoveries using any Indian telescope. We briefly report 11 CSR discoveries collected over the last eleven years. While searching for such relics we have spotted cases of offset relic lobes from elliptical and spiral, episodic radio galaxies with overlapping lobes as the host galaxy is in motion, large diffuse spiral-shaped emission, cases of jet-galaxy interaction, kinks and burls on the jets, a collimated synchrotron thread etc. Such exotic sources push the boundaries of our understanding of classical Seyferts and radio galaxies with jets and the process of discovery prepares the next generation for science with the upgraded GMRT and Square Kilometre Array Observatory (SKAO).</description>

      <title>Candidates for Substellar Members of the Orion Nebula Cluster from JWST/NIRCam</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10406</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10406v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In 2022, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) obtained 1-5um images of the center of the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). I have analyzed these data in an attempt to search for substellar members of the cluster. Using a pair of color-color diagrams, I have identified &gt;200 brown dwarf candidates that lack spectral classifications. Some of the candidates could be protostars (either stellar or substellar) given their very red colors. Based on the age of the ONC and the photometry predicted by theoretical evolutionary models, the faintest candidates could have masses of 1-2 Mjup. This sample of candidates may prove to be valuable for studying various aspects of young brown dwarfs, including their mass function and minimum mass. However, spectroscopy is needed to confirm the membership (via signatures of youth) and late spectral types of the candidates. Finally, I note that most of the "Jupiter-mass binary objects" that have been previously identified with these JWST images are absent from my sample of candidates because their colors are indicative of reddened background sources rather than young brown dwarfs or their photometry is inadequate for assessing their nature because of very low signal-to-noise ratios and/or detections in only a few bands.</description>

      <title>The Discovery of Polarized Water Vapor Megamaser Emission in a Molecular Accretion Disk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10569</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10569v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the first time in an extragalactic source, we detect linearly polarized water maser emission associated with the molecular accretion disk of NGC 1068. The position angles of the electric polarization vectors are perpendicular to the axes of filamentary structures in the molecular accretion disk. The inferred magnetic field threading the molecular disk must lie within approximately 35 degrees of the sky plane. The orientation of the magnetic fields relative to the disk plane implies that the maser region is unstable to hydromagnetically powered outflow; we speculate that the maser region may be the source of the larger scale molecular outflow found in ALMA studies. The new VLBI observations also reveal a compact radio continuum source, NGC 1068*, aligned with the near-systemic maser spots. The molecular accretion disk must be viewed nearly edge-on, and the revised central mass is (16.6 +/- 0.1) million solar masses.</description>

      <title>SOFIA/HAWC+ Far-Infrared Polarimetric Large-Area CMZ Exploration Survey. IV. Relative Magnetic Field Orientation Throughout the CMZ</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10597</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10597v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The nature of the magnetic field structure throughout the Galactic Center (GC) has long been of interest. The recent Far-InfraREd Polarimetric Large-Area CMZ Exploration (FIREPLACE) Survey reveals preliminary connections between the seemingly distinct vertical and horizontal magnetic field distributions previously observed in the GC. We use the statistical techniques of the Histogram of Relative Orientation (HRO) and the Projected Rayleigh Statistic (PRS) to assess whether the CMZ magnetic field preferentially aligns with the column density gradient derived from CMZ molecular clouds or the morphology of the non-thermal emission of the GC NTF population. We find that there is a range of magnetic field orientations throughout the population of CMZ molecular clouds, ranging from parallel to perpendicular orientation. This range of orientations contrasts with what is observed in Galactic Disk star-forming regions. We also compare the magnetic field orientation from dust polarimetry with individual prominent NTFs, finding a preferred perpendicular relative orientation. This perpendicular orientation indicates that the vertical field component found in the FIREPLACE observations is not spatially confined to the NTFs, providing evidence for a more pervasive vertical field in the GC. We estimate an upper limit on the magnetic field strength for this vertical field of 4 mG. A field close to this upper limit would indicate that the NTFs are likely not local enhancements of a weaker background field and that the locations of the NTFs depend on proximity to sites of cosmic ray production.</description>

      <title>Evaluating Sparse Galaxy Simulations via Out-of-Distribution Detection and Amortized Bayesian Model Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10606v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cosmological simulations are a powerful tool to advance our understanding of galaxy formation and many simulations model key properties of real galaxies. A question that naturally arises for such simulations in light of high-quality observational data is: How close are the models to reality? Due to the high-dimensionality of the problem, many previous studies evaluate galaxy simulations using simplified summary statistics of physical properties. In this work, we combine simulation-based Bayesian model comparison with a novel misspecification detection technique to compare simulated galaxy images of 6 hydrodynamical models observations. Since cosmological simulations are computationally costly, we address the problem of low simulation budgets by first training a $k$-sparse variational autoencoder (VAE) on the abundant dataset of SDSS images. The VAE learns to extract informative latent embeddings and delineates the typical set of real images. To reveal simulation gaps, we then perform out-of-distribution detection (OOD) based on the logits of classifiers trained on the embeddings of simulated images. Finally, we perform amortized Bayesian model comparison using probabilistic classification, identifying the relatively best-performing model along with partial explanations through SHAP values.</description>

      <title>Biases in galaxy spectral analysis from strong lensing differential magnification effect and correction methods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10654</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10654v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Strong gravitational lensing has significantly advanced the study of high-redshift galaxies, particularly those from the very early universe. However, the spectral analysis of lensed galaxies is inevitably affected by the differential magnification effect, which introduces biases into the derived properties. In this work, we investigate such biases in mock lensing systems generated with data from MaNGA survey and IllustrisTNG simulations. We study the changes of several spectral properties (stellar metallicity, age, flux of H$\alpha$ emission line and flux ratios of optical emission lines) before and after being lensed. Our result shows that all of these properties are significantly biased after being lensed and can be either over- or under-estimated, except for the consistently increasing H$\alpha$ flux. We also investigate the variations of biases with different lensing configurations and find that it always exists when part of the source galaxy falls into the strong lensing regime. Considering the prevalence of such biases, we examine two correction methods to recover the intrinsic source properties, with average magnification factor ($\bar{\mu}$) and full ray-tracing, respectively. Our findings reveal that both methods can reduce the overestimation of H$\alpha$ flux while the value corrected with $\bar{\mu}$ shows a larger discrepancy. For stellar population properties and emission line ratios, the $\bar{\mu}$ method fails to correct the biases, whereas the full ray-tracing method works effectively. The application of these two methods to a statistical sample of mock systems further shows their strong dependence on the accuracy of lens modeling. Our study indicates that spatially resolved spectroscopic observations of lensed images and precise lens modeling are crucial for the spectral analysis of strongly lensed high-redshift galaxies.</description>

      <title>Hidden Cooling Flows IV: More Details on Centaurus and the Efficiency of AGN Feedback in Clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cooling flows are common in galaxy clusters which have cool cores. The soft X-ray emission below 1 keV from the flows is mostly absorbed by cold dusty gas within the central cooling sites. Further evidence for this process is presented here through a more detailed analysis of the nearby Centaurus cluster and some additional clusters. Predictions of JWST near and mid-infrared spectra from cooling gas are presented. [NeVI] emission at 7.65 micron should be an important diagnostic of gas cooling between 6 and 1.5 times 10^5 K. The emerging overall picture of hidden cooling flows is explored. The efficiency of AGN feedback in reducing the total cooling rate in cool cores is shown to be above 50 percent for many clusters but is rarely above 90 per cent. The reduction is mostly in outer gas. Cooling dominates in elliptical galaxies and galaxy groups which have mass flow rates below about 15M/yr and in some massive clusters where rates can exceed 1000M/yr.</description>

      <title>Infrared Period-Luminosity-Metallicity Relations and the Evolution of Metallicity Gradient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We calibrate the period-luminosity-metallicity (PLZ) relations of classical Cepheid (DCEP) in three near-infrared bands ($J$, $H$, $K_S$) and four mid-infrared bands ($W1$, $W2$, $[3.6]$ and $[4.5]$). The PLZ relations of $W1$ and $W2$ bands are calibrated for the first time. The distance moduli of the Large Magellanic Cloud estimated by these PLZ relations are in good agreement with the most accurate published value measured by geometric methods. These seven homogenous PLZ relations can aid in obtaining more robust distances for DCEPs. Applying our PLZ relations to trace the metallicity gradient of the Galactic disc, we find that the gradient for sources with logarithmic age less than 7.67 is almost fixed: $-0.056 \,\pm\, 0.002 \,\textrm{dex}\, \textrm{kpc}^{-1}$; the gradient for sources with logarithmic age greater than 7.67 is period-dependent (i.e., age-dependent): $(-0.074 \,\pm\, 0.003)+(-0.022 \,\pm\, 0.002)\log P)\,\textrm{dex}\, \textrm{kpc}^{-1}$. In addition, we find that DCEPs in the $R_{GC} \gtrsim 14.5\,\textrm{kpc}$ region tend to migrate toward the Galactic center, while DCEPs in the $10.5\,\textrm{kpc} \lesssim R_{GC} \lesssim 14.5\,\textrm{kpc}$ region tend to migrate toward the anti-Galactic center, which may be the reason for the obvious break of the metallicity gradient at $R_{GC} \thickapprox 14.5\,\textrm{kpc}$. We conclude that the evolution of the metallicity gradient of DCEPs may be related to their radial migration.</description>

      <title>JWST/MIRI Observations of Newly Formed Dust in the Cold, Dense Shell of the Type IIn SN 2005ip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Dust from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe), specifically Type IIP SNe, has been suggested to be a significant source of the dust observed in high-redshift galaxies. CCSNe eject large amounts of newly formed heavy elements, which can condense into dust grains in the cooling ejecta. However, infrared (IR) observations of typical CCSNe generally measure dust masses that are too small to account for the dust production needed at high redshifts. Type IIn SNe, classified by their dense circumstellar medium (CSM), are also known to exhibit strong IR emission from warm dust, but the dust origin and heating mechanism have generally remained unconstrained because of limited observational capabilities in the mid-IR. Here, we present a JWST/MIRI Medium Resolution Spectrograph (MRS) spectrum of the Type IIn SN 2005ip nearly 17 years post-explosion. The Type IIn SN 2005ip is one of the longest-lasting and most well-studied SNe observed to date. Combined with a Spitzer mid-IR spectrum of SN 2005ip obtained in 2008, this data set provides a rare 15-year baseline, allowing for a unique investigation of the evolution of dust. The JWST spectrum shows a new high-mass dust component ($\gtrsim0.08$ M$_{\odot}$) that is not present in the earlier Spitzer spectrum. Our analysis shows dust likely formed over the past 15 years in the cold, dense shell (CDS), between the forward and reverse shocks. There is also a smaller mass of carbonaceous dust ($\gtrsim0.005$ M$_{\odot}$) in the ejecta. These observations provide new insights into the role of SN dust production, particularly within the CDS, and its potential contribution to the rapid dust enrichment of the early Universe.</description>

      <title>A Candidate High-Velocity Exoplanet System in the Galactic Bulge</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09147</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.09147v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an analysis of adaptive optics (AO) images from the Keck-I telescope of the microlensing event MOA-2011-BLG-262. The original discovery paper by Bennett et al. 2014 reports two distinct possibilities for the lens system; a nearby gas giant lens with an exomoon companion or a very low mass star with a planetary companion in the galactic bulge. The $\sim$10 year baseline between the microlensing event and the Keck follow-up observations allows us to detect the faint candidate lens host (star) at $K = 22.3$ mag and confirm the distant lens system interpretation. The combination of the host star brightness and light curve parameters yields host star and planet masses of $M_{\rm host} = 0.19 \pm 0.03M_{\odot}$ and $m_p = 28.92 \pm 4.75M_{\oplus}$ at a distance of $D_L = 7.49 \pm 0.91\,$kpc. We perform a multi-epoch cross reference to \textit{Gaia} DR3 and measure a transverse velocity for the candidate lens system of $v_L = 541.31 \pm 65.75$ km s$^{-1}$. We conclude this event consists of the highest velocity exoplanet system detected to date, and also the lowest mass microlensing host star with a confirmed mass measurement. The high-velocity nature of the lens system can be definitively confirmed with an additional epoch of high-resolution imaging at any time now. The methods outlined in this work demonstrate that the \textit{Roman} Galactic Exoplanet Survey (RGES) will be able to securely measure low-mass host stars in the bulge.</description>

      <title>Recurring tidal disruption events a decade apart in IRAS F01004-2237</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.09720v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a second optical flare that occurred in September 2021 in IRAS F01004-2237, where the first flare occurred in 2010 has been reported, and present a detailed analysis of multi-band data. The position of the flare coincides with the galaxy centre with a precision of 650 pc. The flare peaks in $\sim50$ days with an absolute magnitude of $\sim-21$ and fades in two years roughly following $L\propto t^{-5/3}$. It maintains a nearly constant blackbody temperature of $\sim$22,000 K in the late time. Its optical and UV spectra show hydrogen and helium broad emission lines with full width at half maxima of 7,000--21,000 km s$^{-1}$ and He II/H$\alpha$ ratio of 0.3--2.3. It shows weak X-ray emission relative to UV emission, with X-ray flares lasting for $&lt;2-3$ weeks, during which the spectrum is soft with a power-law index $\Gamma=4.4^{+1.4}_{-1.3}$. These characters are consistent with a tidal disruption event (TDE), ruling out the possibilities of a supernova or an active galactic nuclei flare. With a TDE model, we infer a peak UV luminosity of $3.3\pm0.2\times10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and an energy budget of $4.5\pm0.2\times10^{51}$ erg. The two optical flares separated by $10.3\pm0.3$ years can be interpreted as repeating partial TDEs, double TDEs, or two independent TDEs. Although no definitive conclusion can be drawn, the partial TDEs interpretation predicts a third flare around 2033, and the independent TDEs interpretation predicts a high TDE rate of $\gtrsim10^{-2}$ yr$^{-1}$ in F01004-2237, both of which can be tested by future observations.</description>

      <title>Radio Morphology of Gamma-ray Sources: Double-Lobed Radio Sources</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10192v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The extragalactic gamma-ray sky is dominated by relativistic jets aligned to the observer's line of sight, i.e., blazars. A few of their misaligned counterparts, e.g., radio galaxies, are also detected with the Fermi-Large Area Telescope (LAT) albeit in a small number ($\sim$50), indicating the crucial role played by the jet viewing angle in detecting gamma-ray emission from jets. These gamma-ray emitting misaligned active galactic nuclei (AGN) provide us with a unique opportunity to understand the high-energy emission production mechanisms from a different viewpoint than the more common blazars. With this goal in mind, we have systematically studied the radio morphology of gamma-ray emitting sources present in the fourth data release of the fourth catalog of Fermi-LAT detected gamma-ray sources to identify misaligned AGN. By utilizing the high-resolution and sensitive MHz and GHz frequency observations delivered by the Very Large Array Sky Survey, Low-Frequency Array Two-metre Sky Survey, Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty-Centimeters, and Rapid ASKAP Continuum Survey, here we present a catalog of 149 gamma-ray detected misaligned AGN, thus $\sim$tripling the number of known objects of this class. Our sample includes a variety of radio morphologies, e.g., edge-darkened and edge-brightened, hybrids, wide-angle-tailed, bent jets, and giants. Since the gamma-ray emission is thought to be highly sensitive to the jet viewing angle, such an enlarged sample of gamma-ray detected misaligned radio sources will permit us to explore the origin of high-energy emission in relativistic jets and radio lobes and study AGN unification, in general.</description>

      <title>A Multiwavelength Study of the Most Distant Gamma-ray Detected BL Lacertae Object 4FGL J1219.0+3653 ($z=3.59$)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: BL Lac objects are a class of jetted active galactic nuclei that do not exhibit or have weak emission lines in their optical spectra. Recently, the first $\gamma$-ray emitting BL Lac beyond $z=3$, 4FGL J1219.0 +3653 (hereafter J1219), was identified, i.e., within the first two billion years of the age of the universe. Here we report the results obtained from a detailed broadband study of this peculiar source by analyzing the new $\sim$58 ksec XMM-Newton and archival observations and reproducing the multiwavelength spectral energy distribution with the conventional one-zone leptonic radiative model. The XMM-Newton~data revealed that J1219 is a faint X-ray emitter ($F_{\rm 0.3-10~keV}=8.39^{+4.11}_{-2.40}\times10^{-15}$ erg/cm2/s) and exhibits a soft spectrum (0.3$-$10 keV photon index$=2.28^{+0.58}_{-0.48}$). By comparing the broadband physical properties of J1219 with $z&gt;3$ $\gamma$-ray detected flat spectrum radio quasars (FSRQs), we have found that it has a relatively low jet power and, similar to FSRQs, the jet power is larger than the accretion disk luminosity. We conclude that deeper multiwavelength observations will be needed to fully explore the physical properties of this unique high-redshift BL Lac object.</description>

      <title>Stripped helium-star and compact object binaries in coeval populations -- predictions based on detailed binary evolution models</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10283v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Massive stars mainly form in close binaries, where their mutual interactions can profoundly alter their evolutionary paths. Evolved binaries consisting of a massive OB-type main-sequence star with a stripped helium star or a compact companion represent a crucial stage in the evolution towards double compact objects, whose mergers are (potentially) detectable via gravitational waves. The recent detection of X-ray quiet OB+black hole binaries and OB+stripped helium star binaries has set the stage for discovering more of these systems in the near future. In this work, based on 3670 detailed binary-evolution models and using empirical distributions of initial binary parameters, we compute the expected population of such evolved massive binaries in coeval stellar populations, including stars in star clusters and in galaxies with starburst activities, for ages up to 100 Myr. Our results are vividly illustrated in an animation that shows the evolution of these binaries in the color-magnitude diagram over time. We find that the number of OB+black hole binaries peaks around 10 Myr, and OB+neutron star binaries are most abundant at approximately 20 Myr. Both black holes and neutron stars can potentially be found in populations with ages up to 90 Myr. Additionally, we analyze the properties of such binaries at specific ages. We find that OB+helium stars and OB+black hole binaries are likely to be identifiable as single-lined spectroscopic binaries. Our research serves as a guide for future observational efforts to discover such binaries in young star clusters and starburst environments.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.10314v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Blue straggler stars are unique main-sequence stars that appear more luminous, hotter, and therefore younger, than their coeval counterparts. In star clusters, these stars are located above the cluster turn-off in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram or color-magnitude diagram. First identified in the 1950s, these stars are found across diverse environments, from sparse galactic fields to dense star clusters. They are crucial for understanding stellar and binary evolution and star cluster dynamics. Despite extensive research, many challenges concerning their properties and origin mechanisms remain unresolved. This chapter delves into the properties and origins of blue stragglers, examining how theoretical tools are employed to study them and the implications of each proposed formation mechanism. We assess how contemporary observational data either support or challenge these theoretical predictions. Continued theoretical and observational efforts are essential for advancing our understanding of these enigmatic stars.</description>

      <title>Ultraviolet extinction correlation with 3D dust maps using white dwarfs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.10358</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.10358v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accurate astrometric and photometric measurements from Gaia have led to the construction of 3D dust extinction maps which can now be used for estimating the integrated extinctions of Galactic sources located within 5 kpc. These maps based on optical observations may not be reliable for use in the ultraviolet (UV) which is more sensitive to reddening. Past studies have focused on studying UV extinction using main-sequence stars but lack comparison with 3D dust maps. White dwarfs with well-modeled hydrogen-dominated (DA) atmospheres provide an advantage over main-sequence stars affected by magnetic activity. In this work, we study the variation of UV extinction with 3D dust maps utilising HST and GALEX observations of DA white dwarfs located within 300 pc. We used HST COS spectroscopic data of 76 sight lines to calculate the optical extinction from Si II column densities and validate our results with the kinematic model predictions of the local interstellar medium. Also, we combined GALEX and Gaia photometric observations of 1158 DA white dwarfs to study UV reddening by comparing observed and modeled colour-colour relations. We calculated GALEX non-linearity corrections and derived reddening coefficients (R(NUV-G) = 6.52 +/- 1.53 and R(FUV-G) = 6.04 +/- 2.41) considering their variations with optical extinction (Av &lt; 0.1 mag), and found them to be in good agreement with known extinction laws. HST analysis suggests a positive bias of 0.01-0.02 mag in the optical extinction from 3D maps depending on the Galactic latitude. These results independently confirm the validity of 3D dust maps to deredden the optical and UV observations of white dwarfs.</description>

      <title>Empirical derivation of the metallicity evolution with time and radius using TNG50 Milky Way/Andromeda analogues</title>

Abstract: Recent works have used a linear birth metallicity gradient to estimate the evolution of the [Fe/H] profile in the Galactic disk over time, and infer stellar birth radii (R$_\text{birth}$) from [Fe/H] and age measurements. These estimates rely on the evolution of [Fe/H] at the Galactic center ([Fe/H](0, $\tau$)) and the birth metallicity gradient ($\nabla$[Fe/H]($\tau)$) over time -- quantities that are unknown and inferred under key assumptions. In this work, we use the sample of Milky Way/Andromeda analogues from the TNG50 simulation to investigate the ability to recover [Fe/H](R, $\tau$) and R$_\text{birth}$ in a variety of galaxies. Using stellar disk particles, we test the assumptions required in estimating R$_\text{birth}$, [Fe/H](0, $\tau$), and $\nabla$[Fe/H]($\tau)$ using recently proposed methods to understand when they are valid. We show that $\nabla$[Fe/H]($\tau)$ can be recovered in most galaxies to within 26% from the range in [Fe/H] across age, with better accuracy for more massive and stronger barred galaxies. We also find that the true central metallicity is unrepresentative of the genuine disk [Fe/H] profile; thus we propose to use a projected central metallicity instead. About half of the galaxies in our sample do not have a continuously enriching projected central metallicity, with a dilution in [Fe/H] correlating with mergers. Most importantly, galaxy-specific [Fe/H](R, $\tau$) can be constrained and confirmed by requiring the R$_\text{birth}$ distributions of mono-age, solar neighborhood populations to follow inside-out formation. We conclude that examining trends with R$_\text{birth}$ is valid for the Milky Way disk and similarly structured galaxies, where we expect R$_\text{birth}$ can be recovered to within 20% assuming today's measurement uncertainties in TNG50.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the Invisible: A Study of Gaia18ajz, a Candidate Black Hole Revealed by Microlensing</title>

Abstract: Identifying black holes is essential for comprehending the development of stars and uncovering novel principles of physics. Gravitational microlensing provides an exceptional opportunity to examine an undetectable population of black holes in the Milky Way. In particular, long-lasting events are likely to be associated with massive lenses, including black holes. We present an analysis of the Gaia18ajz microlensing event, reported by the Gaia Science Alerts system, which has exhibited a long timescale and features indicative of the annual microlensing parallax effect. Our objective is to estimate the parameters of the lens based on the best-fitting model. We utilized photometric data obtained from the Gaia satellite and terrestrial observatories to investigate a variety of microlensing models and calculate the most probable mass and distance to the lens, taking into consideration a Galactic model as a prior. Subsequently, weapplied a mass-brightness relation to evaluate the likelihood that the lens is a main sequence star. We also describe the DarkLensCode (DLC), an open-source routine which computes the distribution of probable lens mass, distance and luminosity employing the Galaxy priors on stellar density and velocity for microlensing events with detected microlensing parallax. We modelled Gaia18ajz event and found its two possible models with most likely Einstein timescale of $316^{+36}_{-30}$ days and $299^{+25}_{-22}$ days. Applying Galaxy priors for stellar density and motion, we calculated the most probable lens mass of $4.9^{+5.4}_{-2.3} M_\odot$ located at $1.14^{+0.75}_{-0.57}\,\text{kpc}$ or $11.1^{+10.3}_{-4.7} M_\odot$ located at $1.31^{+0.80}_{-0.60}\,\text{kpc}$. Our analysis of the blended light suggests that the lens is likely a dark remnant of stellar evolution, rather than a main sequence star.</description>

      <title>Scales of Stability and Turbulence in the Molecular ISM</title>

Abstract: We re-analyze the data of the BU-FCRAO $^{13}{\rm CO}$ Galactic Ring Survey (GRS) to understand the dynamics of the turbulent molecular interstellar medium. We define molecular clouds by their spatial half-power contours of $^{13}{\rm CO}$ integrated intensity, independent of a boundary based on thresholding or tiling. We find properties of hydrostatic equilibrium (HE) and virial equilibrium (VE), the former independent and the latter dependent on time and spatial scales. We suggest that HE is a stationary property of the turbulence and that molecular clouds are high-density regions of a fluctuating component. The gravitational and turbulent kinetic energies within clouds are continuously evolving toward a time-dependent VE with the fluctuating, external, turbulent pressure energy (PE) that can be treated parametrically owing to the shorter time scale for virialization. The average PE is comparable to the pressure of the multiphase ISM at the Galactic mid-plane. Larson's scaling relations analyzed by different statistical methods are not significant. The non-dimensional variances of size, line width, and column density are of comparable magnitude, ruling out the inference of constant column density. Previously unrecognized autocorrelations may have contributed to the apparent validity of the inference.</description>

Abstract: Trends in the enrichment of elements with stellar ages are a powerful avenue to identify unexplained origins of the elements. We investigate the stellar abundance trends of low to intermediate-mass stars using the GALAH DR3 high-resolution spectroscopic dataset of 6234 solar-type stars. Our study explores the elemental abundance [X/Fe] of sodium (Na) with age. We find a pronounced enrichment in [Na/Fe] at super solar metallicity (i.e., [Fe/H] above 0) in the old sequence of Milky Way disc stars, a trend demanding a deeper understanding of the underlying source(s) responsible for the nucleosynthesis. This progressive [Na/Fe] enrichment at the young end of the old sequence has essential implications for Galactic archaeology. In this work, we propose a novel selection technique for separating the Milky Way's thick and thin disc stellar populations (i.e., old and young sequences) based on the observed [Na/Fe] rise of roughly 0.1 dex for stars around 5 - 8 Gyr old. We also compare our selection method to the conventional [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] selection approach, and we find that our new Na-based selection method better disentangles the overlap between young- and old-sequence disc stars at these intermediate ages. This is especially true at super solar [Fe/H], where [Mg/Fe] vs [Fe/H] or [alpha/Fe] vs [Fe/H] separation approaches exhibit a lot of overlap. This new selection method should help us better understand the Milky Way disc's formation history.</description>

      <title>Image formation near hyperbolic umbilic in strong gravitational lensing</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16826v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Hyperbolic umbilic (HU) is a point singularity of the gravitational lens equation, giving rise to a ring-shaped image formation made of four highly magnified images, off-centred from the lens centre. Recent observations have revealed new strongly lensed image formations near HU singularities, and many more are expected in ongoing and future observations. Like fold/cusp, image formations near HU also satisfy magnification relation ($R_{\rm hu}$), i.e., the signed magnification sum of the four images equals zero. Here, we study how $R_{\rm hu}$ deviates from zero as a function of area ($A_{\rm hu}$) covered by the image formation near HU and the distance ($d$) of the central maxima image (which is part of the HU image formation) from the lens centre for ideal single- and double-component cluster-scale lenses. For lens ellipticity values $\geq0.3$, the central maxima image will form sufficiently far from the lens centre ($d\gtrsim5''$), similar to the observed HU image formations with $R_{\rm hu}\simeq0$. We also find that, in some cases, double-component and actual cluster-scale lenses can lead to large cross-sections for HU image formations for sources at $z\gtrsim5$, effectively increasing the chances to observe HU image formation at high redshifts. Finally, we study the time delay distribution in the observed HU image formations, finding that not only are these images highly magnified, but the relative time delay between various pairs of HU characteristic image formation has a typical value of $\sim100$ days, an order of magnitude smaller than generic five-image formations in cluster lenses, making such image formations optimal targets for time delay cosmography studies.</description>

      <title>On the Galactic rotation curve inferred from the Jeans equations Assessing its robustness using Gaia DR3 and cosmological simulations</title>

Abstract: Several works have recently applied Jeans modelling to Gaia-based datasets to infer the circular velocity curve for the Milky Way. Such works have consistently found evidence for a continuous decline in the rotation curve beyond $\sim$15kpc possibly indicative of a light dark matter halo. We used Gaia DR3 RVS data, supplemented with Bayesian distances to determine the radial variation of the second moments of the velocity distribution for stars close to the Galactic plane. We have used these profiles to determine the rotation curve using the Jeans equations under the assumption of axisymmetry and explored how they vary with azimuth and above and below the Galactic disk plane. We have applied the same methodology to an N-body simulation of a Milky Way-like galaxy impacted by a satellite akin the Sagittarius dwarf and to the Auriga suite of cosmological simulations. We reveal evidence of disequilibrium and deviations from axisymmetry closer in. We find that the second moment of $V_R$ flattens out at $R \gtrsim 12.5$kpc, and that the second moment of $V_{\phi}$ is different above and below the plane for $R \gtrsim 11$kpc. The simulations indicate that these features are typical of galaxies that have been perturbed by external satellites. They also suggest that the difference between the true circular velocity curve and that inferred from Jeans equations can be as high as 15$\%$, but is likely of order 10$\%$ for the Milky Way. This is of larger amplitude than the systematics inherent to Jeans equations. However, if the density of the tracer population were truncated at large radii, the erroneous conclusion of a steeply declining rotation curve can be reached. We find that steady-state axisymmetric Jeans modelling becomes less robust at large radii, indicating that particular caution is needed when interpreting the rotation curve inferred in those regions.</description>

      <title>Weak Gravitational Lensing around Low Surface Brightness Galaxies in the DES Year 3 Data</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.19081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present galaxy-galaxy lensing measurements using a sample of low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs) drawn from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 (Y3) data as lenses. LSBGs are diffuse galaxies with a surface brightness dimmer than the ambient night sky. These dark-matter-dominated objects are intriguing due to potentially unusual formation channels that lead to their diffuse stellar component. Given the faintness of LSBGs, using standard observational techniques to characterize their total masses proves challenging. Weak gravitational lensing, which is less sensitive to the stellar component of galaxies, could be a promising avenue to estimate the masses of LSBGs. Our LSBG sample consists of 23,790 galaxies separated into red and blue color types at $g-i\ge 0.60$ and $g-i&lt; 0.60$, respectively. Combined with the DES Y3 shear catalog, we measure the tangential shear around these LSBGs and find signal-to-noise ratios of 6.67 for the red sample, 2.17 for the blue sample, and 5.30 for the full sample. We use the clustering redshifts method to obtain redshift distributions for the red and blue LSBG samples. Assuming all red LSBGs are satellites, we fit a simple model to the measurements and estimate the host halo mass of these LSBGs to be $\log(M_{\rm host}/M_{\odot}) = 12.98 ^{+0.10}_{-0.11}$. We place a 95% upper bound on the subhalo mass at $\log(M_{\rm sub}/M_{\odot})&lt;11.51$. By contrast, we assume the blue LSBGs are centrals, and place a 95% upper bound on the halo mass at $\log(M_\mathrm{host}/M_\odot) &lt; 11.84$. We find that the stellar-to-halo mass ratio of the LSBG samples is consistent with that of the general galaxy population. This work illustrates the viability of using weak gravitational lensing to constrain the halo masses of LSBGs.</description>

      <title>A Multiwavelength Portrait of the 3C 220.3 Lensed System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.21020v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The 3C 220.3 system is a rare case of a foreground narrow-line radio galaxy ("galaxy A," $z_A = 0.6850$) lensing a background submillimeter galaxy ($z_{{\rm SMG1}} = 2.221$). New spectra from MMT/Binospec confirm that the companion galaxy ("galaxy B") is part of the lensing system with $z_B = 0.6835$. New three-color HST data reveal a full Einstein ring and allow a more precise lens model. The new HST images also reveal extended emission around galaxy A, and the spectra show extended [OII] emission with irregular morphology and complex velocity structure. All indications are that the two lensing galaxies are a gravitationally interacting pair. Strong [OII] emission from both galaxies A and B suggests current star formation, which could be a consequence of the interaction. This would indicate a younger stellar population than previously assumed and imply smaller stellar masses for the same luminosity. The improved lens model and expanded spectral energy distributions have enabled better stellar-mass estimates for the foreground galaxies. The resulting dark matter fractions are ~0.8, higher than previously calculated. Deeper Chandra imaging shows extended X-ray emission but no evidence for a point X-ray source associated with either galaxy. The detection of X-rays from the radio lobes of 3C 220.3 allows an estimate of ~3 nT for the magnetic fields in the lobes, a factor of ~3 below the equipartition fields, as typical for radio galaxies.</description>

      <title>Late-time radio brightening and emergence of a radio jet in the changing-look AGN 1ES 1927+654</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.18061v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present multi-frequency (5-345 GHz) and multi-resolution radio observations of 1ES 1927+654, widely considered one of the most unusual and extreme changing-look active galactic nuclei (CL-AGN). The source was first designated a CL-AGN after an optical outburst in late 2017 and has since displayed considerable changes in X-ray emission, including the destruction and rebuilding of the X-ray corona in 2019-2020. Radio observations prior to 2023 show a faint and compact radio source typical of radio-quiet AGN. Starting in February 2023, 1ES 1927+654 began exhibiting a radio flare with a steep exponential rise, reaching a peak 60 times previous flux levels, and has maintained this higher level of radio emission for over a year to date. The 5-23 GHz spectrum is broadly similar to gigahertz-peaked radio sources, which are understood to be young radio jets less than ~1000 years old. Recent high-resolution VLBA observations at 23.5 GHz now show resolved extensions on either side of the core, with a separation of ~0.15 pc, consistent with a new and mildly relativistic bipolar outflow. A steady increase in the soft X-ray band (0.3-2 keV) concurrent with the radio may be consistent with jet-driven shocked gas, though further observations are needed to test alternate scenarios. This source joins a growing number of CL-AGN and tidal disruption events which show late-time radio activity, years after the initial outburst.</description>

      <title>The Tidal Torque Theory Revisited. I. Protohalo Angular Momentum</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15939</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15939v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: According to the Tidal Torque Theory (TTT), the angular momentum (AM) of dark matter haloes arises from the tidal torque suffered by ellipsoidal protohaloes due to their surrounding mass distribution. Unfortunately, the practical implementation of the TTT in the peak model of structure formation, where protohaloes are, indeed, ellipsoidal patches around triaxial peaks (maxima) in the Gaussian-smoothed density field, faces some fundamental issues. First, the mass and collapse time of patches marked by Gaussian peaks are poorly determined. Second, the growth of the resulting AM is only known in linear regime. This Paper is the first of two devoted to revisiting the TTT and accurately calculating the rotational halo properties it predicts. Here we use the CUSP formalism fixing the above mentioned indeterminacy in the protohalo AM. The peak viewpoint is fully accomplished in the sense that not only is the protohalo identified to a peak, but also the mass fluctuations causing the tidal torque are identified to peaks or holes (local minima). This way we obtain a very simple analytic expression for the mean (and median) Lagrangian protohalo AM, which can be readily implemented in galaxy formation models and be compared to the results of simulations.</description>
