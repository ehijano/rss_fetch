      <title>Quaternion Domain Super MDS for 3D Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17890</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17890v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel low-complexity three-dimensional (3D) localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks, termed quaternion-domain super multidimensional scaling (QD-SMDS). This algorithm reformulates the conventional SMDS, which was originally developed in the real domain, into the quaternion domain. By representing 3D coordinates as quaternions, the method enables the construction of a rank-1 Gram edge kernel (GEK) matrix that integrates both relative distance and angular (phase) information between nodes, maximizing the noise reduction effect achieved through low-rank truncation via singular value decomposition (SVD). The simulation results indicate that the proposed method demonstrates a notable enhancement in localization accuracy relative to the conventional SMDS algorithm, particularly in scenarios characterized by substantial measurement errors.</description>

      <title>Material Identification Via RFID For Smart Shopping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17898</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17898v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cashierless stores rely on computer vision and RFID tags to associate shoppers with items, but concealed items placed in backpacks, pockets, or bags create challenges for theft prevention. We introduce a system that turns existing RFID tagged items into material sensors by exploiting how different containers attenuate and scatter RF signals. Using RSSI and phase angle, we trained a neural network to classify seven common containers. In a simulated retail environment, the model achieves 89% accuracy with one second samples and 74% accuracy from single reads. Incorporating distance measurements, our system achieves 82% accuracy across 0.3-2m tag to reader separations. When deployed at aisle or doorway choke points, the system can flag suspicious events in real time, prompting camera screening or staff intervention. By combining material identification with computer vision tracking, our system provides proactive loss prevention for cashierless retail while utilizing existing infrastructure.</description>

      <title>Optimal Power Allocation for OFDM-based Ranging Using Random Communication Signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: High-precision ranging plays a crucial role in future 6G Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) systems. To improve the ranging performance while maximizing the resource utilization efficiency, future 6G ISAC networks have to reuse data payload signals for both communication and sensing, whose inherent randomness may deteriorate the ranging performance. To address this issue, this paper investigates the power allocation (PA) design for an OFDM-based ISAC system under random signaling, aiming to reduce the ranging sidelobe level of both periodic and aperiodic auto-correlation functions (P-ACF and A-ACF) of the ISAC signal. Towards that end, we first derive the closed-form expressions of the average squared P-ACF and A-ACF, and then propose to minimize the expectation of the integrated sidelobe level (EISL) under arbitrary constellation mapping. We then rigorously prove that the uniform PA scheme achieves the global minimum of the EISL for both P-ACF and A-ACF. As a step further, we show that this scheme also minimizes the P-ACF sidelobe level at every lag. Moreover, we extend our analysis to the P-ACF case with frequency-domain zero-padding, which is a typical approach to improve the ranging resolution. We reveal that there exists a tradeoff between sidelobe level and mainlobe width, and propose a project gradient descent algorithm to seek a locally optimal PA scheme that reduces the EISL. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings through extensive simulation results, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed PA methods in reducing the ranging sidelobe level for random OFDM signals.</description>

      <title>Physical Layer Security for Integrated Sensing and Communication: A Survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has become a crucial technology in the development of next-generation wireless communication systems. The integration of communication and sensing functionalities on a unified spectrum and infrastructure is expected to enable a variety of emerging use cases. The introduction of ISAC has led to various new challenges and opportunities related to the security of wireless communications, resulting in significant research focused on ISAC system design in relation to physical layer security (PLS). The shared use of spectrum presents a risk where confidential messages embedded in probing ISAC signals may be exposed to potentially malicious sensing targets. This situation creates a tradeoff between sensing performance and security performance. The sensing functionality of ISAC offers a unique opportunity for PLS by utilizing sensing information regarding potential eavesdroppers to design secure PLS schemes. This study examines PLS methodologies to tackle the specified security challenge associated with ISAC. The study begins with a brief overview of performance metrics related to PLS and sensing, as well as the optimization techniques commonly utilized in the existing literature. A thorough examination of existing literature on PLS for ISAC is subsequently presented, with the objective of emphasizing the current state of research. The study concludes by outlining potential avenues for future research pertaining to secure ISAC systems.</description>

      <title>Full-Duplex ISCC for Low-Altitude Networks: Resource Allocation and Coordinated Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18143</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18143v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper investigates an integrated sensing, communication, and computing system deployed over low-altitude networks for enabling applications within the low-altitude economy. In the considered system, a full-duplex enabled unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) is dispatched in the airspace, functioning as a UAV-enabled low-altitude platform (ULAP). The ULAP is capable of achieving simultaneous information transmission, target sensing, and mobile edge computing services. To reduce the overall energy consumption of the system while meeting the sensing beampattern threshold and user computation requirements, we formulate an energy consumption minimization problem by jointly optimizing the task allocation, computation resource allocation, transmit beamforming, and receive beamforming. Since the problem is non-convex and involves highly coupled variables, we propose an efficient algorithm based on alternation optimization, which decomposes the original problem into tractable convex subproblems. Moreover, we analyze the convergence and complexity of the proposed algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme saves up to 54.12\% energy consumption performance compared to the benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Generative AI for Physical-Layer Authentication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18175</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18175v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In recent years, Artificial Intelligence (AI)-driven Physical-Layer Authentication (PLA), which focuses on achieving endogenous security and intelligent identity authentication, has attracted considerable interest. When compared with Discriminative AI (DAI), Generative AI (GAI) offers several advantages, such as fingerprint data augmentation, fingerprint denoising and reconstruction, and protection against adversarial attacks. Inspired by these innovations, this paper provides a systematic exploration of GAI's integration into PLA frameworks. We commence with a review of representative authentication techniques, emphasizing PLA's inherent strengths. Following this, we revisit four typical GAI models and contrast the limitations of DAI with the potential of GAI in addressing PLA challenges, including insufficient fingerprint data, environment noises and inferences, perturbations in fingerprint data, and complex tasks. Specifically, we delve into providing GAI-enhance methods for PLA across the data, model, and application layers in detail. Moreover, we present a case study that combines fingerprint extrapolation, generative diffusion models, and cooperative nodes to illustrate the superiority of GAI in bolstering the reliability of PLA compared to DAI. Additionally, we outline potential future research directions for GAI-based PLA.</description>

      <title>Multi-Sensor Fusion of Active and Passive Measurements for Extended Object Tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of achieving robust and reliable positioning of a radio device carried by an agent, in scenarios where direct line-of-sight (LOS) radio links are obstructed by the agent. We propose a Bayesian estimation algorithm that integrates active measurements between the radio device and anchors with passive measurements in-between anchors reflecting off the agent. A geometry-based scattering measurement model is introduced for multi-sensor structures, and multiple object-related measurements are incorporated to formulate an extended object probabilistic data association (PDA) algorithm, where the agent that blocks, scatters and attenuates radio signals is modeled as an extended object (EO). The proposed approach significantly improves the accuracy during and after obstructed LOS conditions, outperforming the conventional PDA (which is based on the point-target-assumption) and methods relying solely on active measurements.</description>

      <title>Advanced Channel Decomposition Techniques in OTFS: A GSVD Approach for Multi-User Downlink</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18315</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18315v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a multi-user downlink system for two users based on the orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation scheme. The design leverages the generalized singular value decomposition (GSVD) of the channels between the base station and the two users, applying precoding and detection matrices based on the right and left singular vectors, respectively. We derive the analytical expressions for three scenarios and present the corresponding simulation results. These results demonstrate that, in terms of bit error rate (BER), the proposed system outperforms the conventional multi-user OTFS system in two scenarios when using minimum mean square error (MMSE) equalizers or precoder, both for perfect channel state information and for a scenario with channel estimation errors. In the third scenario, the design is equivalent to zero-forcing (ZF) precoding at the transmitter.</description>

      <title>STNet: Prediction of Underwater Sound Speed Profiles with An Advanced Semi-Transformer Neural Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17912</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17912v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Real time acquisition of accurate underwater sound velocity profile (SSP) is crucial for tracking the propagation trajectory of underwater acoustic signals, making it play a key role in ocean communication positioning. SSPs can be directly measured by instruments or inverted leveraging sound field data. Although measurement techniques provide a good accuracy, they are constrained by limited spatial coverage and require substantial time investment. The inversion method based on real-time measurement of acoustic field data improves operational efficiency, but loses the accuracy of SSP estimation and suffers from limited spatial applicability due to its stringent requirements for ocean observation infrastructure. To achieve accurate long-term ocean SSP estimation independent of real-time underwater data measurements, we propose a Semi-Transformer neural network (STNet) specifically designed for simulating sound velocity distribution patterns from the perspective of time series prediction. The proposed network architecture incorporates an optimized self-attention mechanism to effectively capture long-range temporal dependencies within historical sound velocity time-series data, facilitating accurate estimation of current SSPs or prediction of future SSPs. Through architectural optimization of the Transformer framework and integration of a time encoding mechanism, STNet could effectively improve computational efficiency. Comparative experimental results reveal that STNet outperforms state-of-the-art models in predictive accuracy and maintain good computational efficiency, demonstrating its potential for enabling accurate long-term full-depth ocean SSP forecasting.</description>

      <title>Joint Resource Estimation and Trajectory Optimization for eVTOL-involved CR network: A Monte Carlo Tree Search-based Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18031</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18031v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric Vertical Take-Off and Landing (eVTOL) aircraft, pivotal to Advanced Air Mobility (AAM), are emerging as a transformative transportation paradigm with the potential to redefine urban and regional mobility. While these systems offer unprecedented efficiency in transporting people and goods, they rely heavily on computation capability, safety-critical operations such as real-time navigation, environmental sensing, and trajectory tracking--necessitating robust offboard computational support. A widely adopted solution involves offloading these tasks to terrestrial base stations (BSs) along the flight path. However, air-to-ground connectivity is often constrained by spectrum conflicts with terrestrial users, which poses a significant challenge to maintaining reliable task execution. Cognitive radio (CR) techniques offer promising capabilities for dynamic spectrum access, making them a natural fit for addressing this issue. Existing studies often overlook the time-varying nature of BS resources, such as spectrum availability and CPU cycles, which leads to inaccurate trajectory planning, suboptimal offloading success rates, excessive energy consumption, and operational delays. To address these challenges, we propose a trajectory optimization framework for eVTOL swarms that maximizes task offloading success probability while minimizing both energy consumption and resource competition (e.g., spectrum and CPU cycles) with primary terrestrial users. The proposed algorithm integrates a Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB) model to dynamically estimate BS resource availability and a Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm to determine optimal offloading decisions, selecting both the BSs and access time windows that align with energy and temporal constraints.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Cell-Free Massive MIMO: A Simplified Design for Uniform Service Quality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18155</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18155v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In traditional cellular networks, users at the cell edge often suffer from poor quality of service (QoS) due to large distance-dependent path loss and severe inter-cell interference. While cell-free (CF) massive multi-input multi-out (MIMO) mitigates this issue by distributing access points (APs) to ensure uniform QoS, the deployment of numerous distributed APs and a fronthaul network incurs high infrastructure costs. To balance performance and cost efficiency, this article proposes a simplified design called hierarchical cell-free (HCF) massive MIMO. The key idea is to reduce the number of APs, thus minimizing the scale of the fronthaul network. The antennas from the decommissioned APs are aggregated at a central base station (cBS), which also serves as the coordinator for distributed APs. We derive closed-form expressions for uplink and downlink spectral efficiency (SE) for HCF, CF, and cellular massive MIMO under pilot contamination and correlated fading channels, considering the use of multi-antenna APs. Numerical results confirm that the hierarchical architecture achieves $95\%$-likely per-user SE comparable to CF, enhancing cell-edge user rates in cellular systems by over 100 times, while significantly reducing the complexity and cost of the fronthaul network in CF. We develop max-min fairness algorithms for joint power control of the cBS and APs in the downlink, and the users in the uplink. These algorithms not only boost fairness and system capacity but also dramatically lower transmission power, e.g., achieving over $70\%$ savings in uplink, particularly beneficial for battery-powered mobile devices.</description>

      <title>MROP: Modulated Rank-One Projections for compressive radio interferometric imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18446</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18446v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The emerging generation of radio-interferometric (RI) arrays are set to form images of the sky with a new regime of sensitivity and resolution. This implies a significant increase in visibility data volumes, scaling as $\mathcal{O}(Q^{2}B)$ for $Q$ antennas and $B$ short-time integration intervals (or batches), calling for efficient data dimensionality reduction techniques. This paper proposes a new approach to data compression during acquisition, coined modulated rank-one projection (MROP). MROP compresses the $Q\times Q$ batchwise covariance matrix into a smaller number $P$ of random rank-one projections and compresses across time by trading $B$ for a smaller number $M$ of random modulations of the ROP measurement vectors. Firstly, we introduce a dual perspective on the MROP acquisition, which can either be understood as random beamforming, or as a post-correlation compression. Secondly, we analyse the noise statistics of MROPs and demonstrate that the random projections induce a uniform noise level across measurements independently of the visibility-weighting scheme used. Thirdly, we propose a detailed analysis of the memory and computational cost requirements across the data acquisition and image reconstruction stages, with comparison to state-of-the-art dimensionality reduction approaches. Finally, the MROP model is validated in simulation for monochromatic intensity imaging, with comparison to the classical and baseline-dependent averaging (BDA) models, and using the uSARA optimisation algorithm for image formation. An extensive experimental setup is considered, with ground-truth images containing diffuse and faint emission and spanning a wide variety of dynamic ranges, and for a range of $uv$-coverages corresponding to VLA and MeerKAT observation.</description>

      <title>Improved Dwell-times for Switched Nonlinear Systems using Memory Regression Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18457</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18457v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a switched systems approach for extending the dwell-time of an autonomous agent during GPS-denied operation by leveraging memory regressor extension (MRE) techniques. To maintain accurate trajectory tracking despite unknown dynamics and environmental disturbances, the agent periodically acquires access to GPS, allowing it to correct accumulated state estimation errors. The motivation for this work arises from the limitations of existing switched system approaches, where increasing estimation errors during GPS-denied intervals and overly conservative dwell-time conditions restrict the operational efficiency of the agent. By leveraging MRE techniques during GPS-available intervals, the developed method refines the estimates of unknown system parameters, thereby enabling longer and more reliable operation in GPS-denied environments. A Lyapunov-based switched-system stability analysis establishes that improved parameter estimates obtained through concurrent learning allow extended operation in GPS-denied intervals without compromising closed-loop system stability. Simulation results validate the theoretical findings, demonstrating dwell-time extensions and enhanced trajectory tracking performance.</description>

      <title>Information Freshness in Dynamic Gossip Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18504</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18504v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a source that shares updates with a network of $n$ gossiping nodes. The network's topology switches between two arbitrary topologies, with switching governed by a two-state continuous time Markov chain (CTMC) process. Information freshness is well-understood for static networks. This work evaluates the impact of time-varying connections on information freshness. In order to quantify the freshness of information, we use the version age of information metric. If the two networks have static long-term average version ages of $f_1(n)$ and $f_2(n)$ with $f_1(n) \ll f_2(n)$, then the version age of the varying-topologies network is related to $f_1(n)$, $f_2(n)$, and the transition rates in the CTMC. If the transition rates in the CTMC are faster than $f_1(n)$, the average version age of the varying-topologies network is $f_1(n)$. Further, we observe that the behavior of a vanishingly small fraction of nodes can severely impact the long-term average version age of a network in a negative way. This motivates the definition of a typical set of nodes in the network. We evaluate the impact of fast and slow CTMC transition rates on the typical set of nodes.</description>

      <title>E-VLC: A Real-World Dataset for Event-based Visible Light Communication And Localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18521</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18521v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical communication using modulated LEDs (e.g., visible light communication) is an emerging application for event cameras, thanks to their high spatio-temporal resolutions. Event cameras can be used simply to decode the LED signals and also to localize the camera relative to the LED marker positions. However, there is no public dataset to benchmark the decoding and localization in various real-world settings. We present, to the best of our knowledge, the first public dataset that consists of an event camera, a frame camera, and ground-truth poses that are precisely synchronized with hardware triggers. It provides various camera motions with various sensitivities in different scene brightness settings, both indoor and outdoor. Furthermore, we propose a novel method of localization that leverages the Contrast Maximization framework for motion estimation and compensation. The detailed analysis and experimental results demonstrate the advantages of LED-based localization with events over the conventional AR-marker--based one with frames, as well as the efficacy of the proposed method in localization. We hope that the proposed dataset serves as a future benchmark for both motion-related classical computer vision tasks and LED marker decoding tasks simultaneously, paving the way to broadening applications of event cameras on mobile devices. https://woven-visionai.github.io/evlc-dataset</description>

      <title>Koopman Operator-Based Physics-Informed Dual Autoencoder Framework for CSI Prediction and Tracking in 5G/6G Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20123v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework for Channel State Information (CSI) tracking and prediction, integrating Physics-Informed Autoencoders (PIAE) and learned Koopman operator to represent CSI as a nonlinear dynamical system influenced by exogenous contextual inputs. The proposed method enables real-time updates to the Channel Knowledge Map (CKM), ensuring enhanced reliability and responsiveness of communication systems in dynamic environments. The architecture consists of dual autoencoders: one for CSI and another for contextual information, coupled through a lifted state space where the Koopman operator captures the linear evolution of CSI dynamics. By combining Koopman operator theory, state space representation, and real-time CSI reconstruction, this work offers a robust and scalable solution for dynamic CSI tracking. These findings highlight the potential of Physics-Informed Autoencoders to revolutionize communication systems by delivering accurate, real-time CSI predictions while maintaining stringent data privacy standards.</description>

      <title>Trade-offs in Reliability and Performance Using Selective Beamforming for Ultra-Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20135</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20135v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the optimization challenges in Ultra-Massive MIMO communication systems, focusing on array selection and beamforming in dynamic and diverse operational contexts. We introduce a novel array selection criterion that incorporates antenna health information into the optimization process, distinguishing our approach from traditional methods. Our methodology employs dual proximal-gradient ascent to effectively tackle the constrained non-convex and non-smooth nature of sparse array selection problems. A central feature of our strategy is the implementation of proportional fairness among communication users, aligning with system resource limitations while ensuring minimum rate requirements for all users. This approach not only enhances system efficiency and responsiveness but also ensures equitable resource distribution. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed solutions in optimizing Ultra-Massive MIMO system performance, demonstrating their applicability in complex communication scenarios. Our findings reveal key trade-offs influenced by the sparsity promotion weight (\(\gamma\)). As \(\gamma\) increases, spectral efficiency (SE) and communication rate (Ri) decrease, while beamforming matrix density (BMD) reduces and antenna reliability (RL) significantly improves. These results highlight the critical balance between performance and reliability, essential for the practical deployment of Ultra-Massive MIMO systems. This work advances the field by providing innovative solutions and new insights into array selection and beamforming optimization, setting a foundation for future research in Ultra-Massive MIMO communication systems.</description>

      <title>Detection of Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Events Using Millimeter-wave Radar and Pulse Oximeter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19217</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.19217v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS) is a sleep-related breathing disorder associated with significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. The gold standard for OSAHS diagnosis, polysomnography (PSG), faces challenges in popularization due to its high cost and complexity. Recently, radar has shown potential in detecting sleep apnea-hypopnea events (SAE) with the advantages of low cost and non-contact monitoring. However, existing studies, especially those using deep learning, employ segment-based classification approach for SAE detection, making the task of event quantity estimation difficult. Additionally, radar-based SAE detection is susceptible to interference from body movements and the environment. Oxygen saturation (SpO2) can offer valuable information about OSAHS, but it also has certain limitations and cannot be used alone for diagnosis. In this study, we propose a method using millimeterwave radar and pulse oximeter to detect SAE, called ROSA. It fuses information from both sensors, and directly predicts the temporal localization of SAE. Experimental results demonstrate a high degree of consistency (ICC=0.9864) between AHI from ROSA and PSG. This study presents an effective method with lowload device for the diagnosis of OSAHS.</description>

      <title>SynthSoM: A synthetic intelligent multi-modal sensing-communication dataset for Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07459</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.07459v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given the importance of datasets for sensing-communication integration research, a novel simulation platform for constructing communication and multi-modal sensory dataset is developed. The developed platform integrates three high-precision software, i.e., AirSim, WaveFarer, and Wireless InSite, and further achieves in-depth integration and precise alignment of them. Based on the developed platform, a new synthetic intelligent multi-modal sensing-communication dataset for Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), named SynthSoM, is proposed. The SynthSoM dataset contains various air-ground multi-link cooperative scenarios with comprehensive conditions, including multiple weather conditions, times of the day, intelligent agent densities, frequency bands, and antenna types. The SynthSoM dataset encompasses multiple data modalities, including radio-frequency (RF) channel large-scale and small-scale fading data, RF millimeter wave (mmWave) radar sensory data, and non-RF sensory data, e.g., RGB images, depth maps, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The quality of SynthSoM dataset is validated via statistics-based qualitative inspection and evaluation metrics through machine learning (ML) via real-world measurements. The SynthSoM dataset is open-sourced and provides consistent data for cross-comparing SoM-related algorithms.</description>

      <title>Distributed Multiple Testing with False Discovery Rate Control in the Presence of Byzantines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13242v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work studies distributed multiple testing with false discovery rate (FDR) control in the presence of Byzantine attacks, where an adversary captures a fraction of the nodes and corrupts their reported p-values. We focus on two baseline attack models: an oracle model with the full knowledge of which hypotheses are true nulls, and a practical attack model that leverages the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure locally to classify which p-values follow the true null hypotheses. We provide a thorough characterization of how both attack models affect the global FDR, which in turn motivates counter-attack strategies and stronger attack models. Our extensive simulation studies confirm the theoretical results, highlight key design trade-offs under attacks and countermeasures, and provide insights into more sophisticated attacks.</description>

      <title>Discrete Codebook Design for Self-interference Suppression in mmWave ISAC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16309</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16309v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents discrete codebook synthesis methods for self-interference (SI) suppression in a mmWave device, designed to support FD ISAC. We formulate a SINR maximization problem that optimizes the RX and TX codewords, aimed at suppressing the near-field SI signal while maintaining the beamforming gain in the far-field sensing directions. The formulation considers the practical constraints of discrete RX and TX codebooks with quantized phase settings, as well as a TX beamforming gain requirement in the specified communication direction. Under an alternating optimization framework, the RX and TX codewords are iteratively optimized, with one fixed while the other is optimized. When the TX codeword is fixed, we show that the RX codeword optimization problem can be formulated as an integer quadratic fractional programming (IQFP) problem. Using Dinkelbach's algorithm, we transform the problem into a sequence of subproblems in which the numerator and the denominator of the objective function are decoupled. These subproblems, subject to discrete constraints, are then efficiently solved by the spherical search (SS) method. This overall approach is referred to as FP-SS. When the RX codeword is fixed, the TX codeword optimization problem can similarly be formulated as an IQFP problem, whereas an additional TX beamforming constraint for communication needs to be considered. The problem is solved through Dinkelbach's transformation followed by the constrained spherical search (CSS), and we refer to this approach as FP-CSS. Finally, we integrate the FP-SS and FP-CSS methods into a joint RX-TX codebook design approach. Simulations show that, the proposed FP-SS and FP-CSS achieve the same SI suppression performance as the corresponding exhaustive search method, but with much lower complexity. Furthermore, the alternating optimization framework achieved even better SI suppression performance.</description>

      <title>Deep Optimal Transport for Domain Adaptation on SPD Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.05745v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent progress in geometric deep learning has drawn increasing attention from the machine learning community toward domain adaptation on symmetric positive definite (SPD) manifolds, especially for neuroimaging data that often suffer from distribution shifts across sessions. These data, typically represented as covariance matrices of brain signals, inherently lie on SPD manifolds due to their symmetry and positive definiteness. However, conventional domain adaptation methods often overlook this geometric structure when applied directly to covariance matrices, which can result in suboptimal performance. To address this issue, we introduce a new geometric deep learning framework that combines optimal transport theory with the geometry of SPD manifolds. Our approach aligns data distributions while respecting the manifold structure, effectively reducing both marginal and conditional discrepancies. We validate our method on three cross-session brain computer interface datasets, KU, BNCI2014001, and BNCI2015001, where it consistently outperforms baseline approaches while maintaining the intrinsic geometry of the data. We also provide quantitative results and visualizations to better illustrate the behavior of the learned embeddings.</description>

      <title>Predictability of Performance in Communication Networks Under Markovian Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13196</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13196v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: With the emergence of time-critical applications in modern communication networks, there is a growing demand for proactive network adaptation and quality of service (QoS) prediction. However, a fundamental question remains largely unexplored: how can we quantify and achieve more predictable communication systems in terms of performance? To address this gap, this paper introduces a theoretical framework for defining and analyzing predictability in communication systems, with a focus on the impact of observations for performance forecasting. We establish a mathematical definition of predictability based on the total variation distance between forecast and marginal performance distributions. A system is deemed unpredictable when the forecast distribution, providing the most comprehensive characterization of future states using all accessible information, is indistinguishable from the marginal distribution, which depicts the system's behavior without any observational input. This framework is applied to multi-hop systems under Markovian conditions, with a detailed analysis of Geo/Geo/1 queuing models in both single-hop and multi-hop scenarios. We derive exact and approximate expressions for predictability in these systems, as well as upper bounds based on spectral analysis of the underlying Markov chains. Our results have implications for the design of efficient monitoring and prediction mechanisms in future communication networks aiming to provide deterministic services.</description>

      <title>Generative AI-Powered Plugin for Robust Federated Learning in Heterogeneous IoT Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.23824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.23824v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Federated learning enables edge devices to collaboratively train a global model while maintaining data privacy by keeping data localized. However, the Non-IID nature of data distribution across devices often hinders model convergence and reduces performance. In this paper, we propose a novel plugin for federated optimization techniques that approximates Non-IID data distributions to IID through generative AI-enhanced data augmentation and balanced sampling strategy. Key idea is to synthesize additional data for underrepresented classes on each edge device, leveraging generative AI to create a more balanced dataset across the FL network. Additionally, a balanced sampling approach at the central server selectively includes only the most IID-like devices, accelerating convergence while maximizing the global model's performance. Experimental results validate that our approach significantly improves convergence speed and robustness against data imbalance, establishing a flexible, privacy-preserving FL plugin that is applicable even in data-scarce environments.</description>

      <title>Semantic Edge Computing and Semantic Communications in 6G Networks: A Unifying Survey and Research Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18199v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semantic Edge Computing (SEC) and Semantic Communications (SemComs) have been proposed as viable approaches to achieve real-time edge-enabled intelligence in sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. On one hand, SemCom leverages the strength of Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to encode and communicate the semantic information only, while making it robust to channel distortions by compensating for wireless effects. Ultimately, this leads to an improvement in the communication efficiency. On the other hand, SEC has leveraged distributed DNNs to divide the computation of a DNN across different devices based on their computational and networking constraints. Although significant progress has been made in both fields, the literature lacks a systematic view to connect both fields. In this work, we fulfill the current gap by unifying the SEC and SemCom fields. We summarize the research problems in these two fields and provide a comprehensive review of the state of the art with a focus on their technical strengths and challenges.</description>
