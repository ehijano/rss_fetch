      <title>Features of stimulated luminescence of solid nitrogen</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05861</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05861v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent results on the study of spontaneous and stimulated luminescence of solid nitrogen in the near-infrared NIR range are presented. Irradiation was performed with an electron beam of subthreshold energy in the dc mode. Three series of experiments were performed: (i) measurement of cathodoluminescence CL at different electron energies on samples of different thicknesses, (ii) measurements of thermally stimulated luminescence TSL in combination with thermally stimulated exoelectron emission TSEE from pre-irradiated samples and (iii) recording of non-stationary luminescence curves NsL at selected wavelengths during gradual heating of samples under an electron beam. Three emission bands were recorded in the NIR TSL spectra of solid N$_2$: 794, 802, and 810 nm which form the $\gamma$-group. The band at 810 nm in stimulated luminescence was detected for the first time. The positions of all three spectral features coincide in the spectra of spontaneous and stimulated luminescence, as evidenced by a comparison of the CL spectrum recorded at 5 K with the TSL spectrum recorded at the TSL maximum at 16 K. The glow curves measured for these 3 bands were found to correlate with each other and with the TSEE yield. This finding indicates common origin of these bands and their connection with the neutralization reaction. The correlation of the $\gamma$-band NsL in the range of low temperatures (5-20 K) with the NsL measured at the 0-4 band of the $a'^1\Sigma_u^- \rightarrow X^1\Sigma_g^+$ transition, which is the ''fingerprint'' of the tetranitrogen cation N$_4^+$, points to possible connection of the $\gamma$-band with the neutralization of N$_4^+$.</description>

      <title>Modeling Concentration Profiles in Electrolytes by Solving 3-D Poisson-Nernst-Planck Equations via Finite Difference Method</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Poisson-Nernst-Planck (PNP) equations are fundamental for modeling ion transport in electrochemical systems, capturing the intricate interplay of concentration gradients, electric fields, and ion fluxes essential for applications such as energy storage devices and other electrochemical devices. This study introduces a refined numerical framework employing the finite difference method to solve the 3-D PNP equations, enabling precise simulation of ion concentration distributions under realistic boundary conditions and applied electric fields. By rigorously addressing stability criteria and integrating advanced boundary constraints, including the Butler-Volmer equation for surface reactions, the model provides comprehensive insights into ion dynamics, particularly near electrode surfaces where electric field and reaction effects dominate. This framework significantly enhances traditional PNP modeling by accommodating varied boundary conditions, diffusion anisotropy, and complex electrochemical environments, offering a robust tool for investigating electrochemical processes and guiding the design of advanced electrochemical systems.</description>

      <title>Photokinetics of Photothermal Reactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06057v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Photothermal reactions, involving both photochemical and thermal reaction-steps, are the most abundant sequences in photochemistry. The derivation of their rate-laws is standardized, but the integration of these rate-laws has not yet been achieved. Indeed, the field still lacks integrated rate-laws for the description of these reactions behavior, and/or identification of their reaction-order. This made a comprehensive account of the photo-kinetics of photothermal reactions to be a gap in the knowledge. This gap is addressed in the present paper by introducing an unprecedented general model equation capable to mapping out the kinetic traces of such reactions when exposed to light or in the dark. The integrated rate-law model equation also applies when the reactive medium is exposed to either monochromatic or polychromatic light irradiation. The validity of the model equation was established against simulated data obtained by a fourth-order Runge-Kutta method. It was then used to describe and quantify several situations of photothermal reactions, such as the effects of initial concentration, spectator molecules, and incident radiation intensity, and the impact of the latter on the photonic yield. The model equation facilitated a general elucidation method to determine the intrinsic reaction parameters (quantum yields and absorptivities of the reactive species) for any photothermal mechanism whose number of species are known. This paper contributes to rationalizing photo-kinetics along the same general guidelines adopted in chemical kinetics.</description>

      <title>Efficient Transition State Searches by Freezing String Method with Graph Neural Network Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06159</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.06159v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Transition states are a critical bottleneck in chemical transformations. Significant efforts have been made to develop algorithms that efficiently locate transition states on potential energy surfaces. However, the computational cost of ab-initio potential energy surface evaluation limits the size of chemical systems that can routinely studied. In this work, we develop and fine-tune a graph neural network potential energy function suitable for describing organic chemical reactions and use it to rapidly identify transition state guess structures. We successfully refine guess structures and locate a transition state in each test system considered and reduce the average number of ab-initio calculations by 47% though use of the graph neural network potential energy function. Our results show that modern machine learning models have reached levels of reliability whereby they can be used to accelerate routine computational chemistry tasks.</description>

      <title>To jump or not to jump: Adhesion and viscous dissipation dictate the detachment of coalescing wall-attached bubbles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05532v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bubble coalescence can promote bubble departure at much smaller sizes compared to buoyancy. This can critically enhance the efficiency of gas-evolving electrochemical processes, such as water electrolysis. In this study, we integrate high-speed imaging experiments and direct numerical simulations to dissect how and under which conditions bubble coalescence on surfaces leads to detachment. Our transparent electrode experiments provide new insights into contact line dynamics, demonstrating that the bubble neck generally does not contact the surface during coalescence. We reveal that whether coalescence leads to bubble departure or not is determined by the balance between surface energy, adhesion forces, and viscous dissipation. For the previously unexplored regime at low effective Ohnesorge number, a measure of viscosity that incorporates the effect of asymmetry between the coalescing bubbles, we identify a critical dimensionless adhesion energy threshold of $\approx$15% of the released surface energy, below which bubbles typically detach. We develop a global energy balance model that successfully predicts coalescence outcomes across diverse experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Topological advantage for adsorbate chemisorption on conjugated chains</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05572v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological matter shows promise for applications in quantum information and transport. In this work, we examined the electronic and vibronic properties of a prototype molecular system adsorbed to the edges, domain walls, and the bulk of a Su-Schrieffer Hegger polyacetylene chain in the trivial, metallic, and topological phases. Our results reveal that suitable molecular observables show signatures of the topological phase transition and imply the topological phase has a significant advantage and robustness over the metallic phase for electron donation into the molecular system. This advantage persists in the presence of defects and suggests applications of topological materials in molecular catalysis and sensing.</description>

      <title>Chemistry in a cryogenic buffer gas cell</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Cryogenic buffer gas sources are ubiquitous for producing cold, collimated molecular beams for quantum science, chemistry, and precision measurements. The molecules are typically produced by laser ablating a metal target in the presence of a donor gas, where the radical of interest emerges among the reaction products due to a barrier-free process or under thermal or optical excitation. High-barrier reactions, such as between calcium and molecular hydrogen, should be precluded. Here, we study chemical reactions between Ca and three hydrogen isotopologues H$_2$, D$_2$, and HD in a cryogenic cell with helium buffer gas. Remarkably, we observe that H$_2$ can serve as both a reactant and a buffer gas, far outperforming D$_2$ and HD. Our results demonstrate a robust method for generating cold beams of alkaline-earth-metal hydrides for laser cooling and trapping. The observations are complemented by a reaction model, yielding qualitative agreement with the experiment.</description>

      <title>A reduced-temperature process for preparing atomically clean Si(100) and SiGe(100) surfaces with vapor HF</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Silicon processing techniques such as atomic precision advanced manufacturing (APAM) and epitaxial growth require surface preparations that activate oxide desorption (typically &gt;1000 $^{\circ}$C) and promote surface reconstruction toward atomically-clean, flat, and ordered Si(100)-2$\times$1. We compare aqueous and vapor phase cleaning of Si and Si/SiGe surfaces to prepare APAM-ready and epitaxy-ready surfaces at lower temperatures. Angle resolved X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (ARXPS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy indicate that vapor hydrogen fluoride (VHF) cleans dramatically reduce carbon surface contamination and allow the chemically prepared surface to reconstruct at lower temperatures, 600 $^{\circ}$C for Si and 580 $^{\circ}$C for a Si/Si$_{0.7}$Ge$_{0.3}$ heterostructures, into an ordered atomic terrace structure indicated by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). After thermal treatment and vacuum hydrogen termination, we demonstrate STM hydrogen desorption lithography (HDL) on VHF-treated Si samples, creating reactive zones that enable area-selective chemistry using a thermal budget similar to CMOS process flows. We anticipate these results will establish new pathways to integrate APAM with Si foundry processing.</description>

      <title>Impact of electron beam propagation on high-resolution quantitative chemical analysis of 1 nm-thick GaN/AlGaN quantum wells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05716v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent advancements in high-resolution spectroscopy analyses within the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) have paved the way for measuring the concentration of chemical species in crystalline materials at the atomic scale. However, several artifacts complicate the direct interpretation of experimental data. For instance, in the case of energy dispersive x-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, the linear dependency of local x-ray emission on composition is disrupted by channeling effects and cross-talk during electron beam propagation. To address these challenges, it becomes necessary to adopt an approach that combines experimental data with inelastic scattering simulations. This method aims to account for the effects of electron beam propagation on x-ray emission, essentially determining the quantity and the spatial origin of the collected signal. In this publication, we propose to assess the precision and sensitivity limits of this approach in a practical case study involving a focused ion beam (FIB)-prepared III-N multilayers device. The device features nominally pure ~1.5-nm thick GaN quantum wells surrounded by AlGaN barriers containing a low concentration of aluminum (~5 at. %). By employing atomic-scale EDX acquisitions based on the averaging of more than several thousand frames, calibrated $\zeta$-factors combined with a multi-layer x-ray absorption correction model for quantification, and by comparing the x-ray radiation obtained from the quantum well with a reference 10-nm thick structure, we demonstrate that the quantitative impact of beam propagation on chemical composition can be precisely accounted for, resulting in a composition sensitivity at the atomic scale as low as +-0.25 at.%. Finally, practical aspects to achieve this high precision level are discussed, particularly in terms of inelastic multislice simulation, uncertainty determination, and sample quality.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Long-range magnetic ordering of the orbital motion of oxygen atoms within NO$_3$$^-$ cations is identified from experimental measurements of the magnetic susceptibility $\chi$($T$) in LiNO$_3$, Ca(NO$_3$)$_2$, K$_{0.5}$Rb$_{0.5}$NO$_3$ and C(NH$_2$)$_3$NO$_3$ at their respective order-disorder, solid-solid phase transitions $T$$_N$. The observed sharp changes in $\chi$($T$) and accompanying hysteretic behavior indicate the phase transitions to be first order. A model employing the law of conservation of angular momentum is used to explain why the librations between neighboring NO$_3$$^-$ become geared below $T$$_N$. Since the periodic motions involve concerted motion of net charges, the associated magnetic moments of the NO$_3$$^-$ ions indirectly establish an antiferromagnetic structure below $T$$_N$. Our findings identify a previously unidentified type of molecular interaction which may be exploited to further increase the enthalpy of the widely-popular hydrated salts employed as energy storage devices.</description>

      <title>Witnessing non-stationary and non-Markovian environments with a quantum sensor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum sensors offer exceptional sensitivity to nanoscale magnetic field fluctuations, where non-stationary effects such as spin diffusion and non-Markovian dynamics arising from coupling to few environmental degrees of freedom play critical roles. Here, we demonstrate how quantum sensors can characterize the statistical properties of noise sources, distinguishing between stationary and non-stationary behaviors, as well as Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond as a platform, we develop a physical noise model that analytically predicts Ramsey decay curves under different noise regimes. These predictions are experimentally validated by measuring Ramsey decay for NV centers subject to injected noise of each type. Our results showcase the capability of quantum sensors to unravel complex noise behaviors induced by nanoscale environments, shedding light on their physical origins and guiding the development of strategies to mitigate decoherence. This work deepens our understanding of noise dynamics at the nanoscale and lays the foundation for enhancing the performance and robustness of quantum technologies.</description>

Abstract: The polarisation labelling spectroscopy technique was applied to study the C$^1\Pi_{\mathrm{u}}$ $\leftarrow$ X$^1\Sigma^{+}_{\mathrm{g}}$ band system in potassium dimer. About 1100 new rotationally resolved molecular lines were measured in the $22100-24100$~cm$^{-1}$ spectral range. Perturbations of the lowest vibrational levels of the C state were localised and their origin discussed. A set of Dunham coefficients was deduced to fit the unperturbed levels of the C$^1\Pi_{\mathrm{u}}$ state with $0 \le v \le 38$ and $18 \le J \le 101$ and the potential energy curve of the state was constructed.</description>

      <title>SimOS: A Python Framework for Simulations of Optically Addressable Spins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05922</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05922v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an open-source simulation framework for optically detected magnetic resonance, developed in Python. The framework allows users to construct, manipulate, and evolve multipartite quantum systems that consist of spins and electronic levels. We provide an interface for efficient time-evolution in Lindblad form as well as a framework for facilitating simulation of spatial and generalized stochastic dynamics. Further, symbolic operator construction and propagation is supported for simple model systems making the framework also ideal for use in classroom instruction of magnetic resonance. Designed to be backend-agnostic, the library leverages existing Python libraries as computational backends. We introduce the most important functionality and illustrate the syntax on a series of examples. These include systems such as the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond and photo-generated spin-correlated radical pairs for which our library offers system-specific sub-modules.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Tensor Product Functions in Representing Antisymmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05958</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.05958v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tensor product function (TPF) approximations have been widely adopted in solving high-dimensional problems, such as partial differential equations and eigenvalue problems, achieving desirable accuracy with computational overhead that scales linearly with problem dimensions. However, recent studies have underscored the extraordinarily high computational cost of TPFs on quantum many-body problems, even for systems with as few as three particles. A key distinction in these problems is the antisymmetry requirement on the unknown functions. In the present work, we rigorously establish that the minimum number of involved terms for a class of TPFs to be exactly antisymmetric increases exponentially fast with the problem dimension. This class encompasses both traditionally discretized TPFs and the recent ones parameterized by neural networks. Our proof exploits the link between the antisymmetric TPFs in this class and the corresponding antisymmetric tensors and focuses on the Canonical Polyadic rank of the latter. As a result, our findings uncover a fundamental incompatibility between antisymmetry and low-rank TPFs in high-dimensional contexts and offer new insights for further developments.</description>

      <title>Faster quantum chemistry simulations on a quantum computer with improved tensor factorization and active volume compilation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.06165v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electronic structure calculations of molecular systems are among the most promising applications for fault-tolerant quantum computing (FTQC) in quantum chemistry and drug design. However, while recent algorithmic advancements such as qubitization and Tensor Hypercontraction (THC) have significantly reduced the complexity of such calculations, they do not yet achieve computational runtimes short enough to be practical for industrially relevant use cases. In this work, we introduce several advances to electronic structure calculation for molecular systems, resulting in a two-orders-of-magnitude speedup of estimated runtimes over prior-art algorithms run on comparable quantum devices. One of these advances is a novel framework for block-invariant symmetry-shifted Tensor Hypercontraction (BLISS-THC), with which we achieve the tightest Hamiltonian factorizations reported to date. We compile our algorithm for an Active Volume (AV) architecture, a technical layout that has recently been proposed for fusion-based photonic quantum hardware. AV compilation contributes towards a lower runtime of our computation by eliminating overheads stemming from connectivity issues in the underlying surface code. We present a detailed benchmark of our approach, focusing primarily on the computationally challenging benchmark molecule P450. Leveraging a number of hardware tradeoffs in interleaving-based photonic FTQC, we estimate runtimes for the electronic structure calculation of P450 as a function of the device footprint.</description>

      <title>Bromine and Iodine in Atmospheric Mercury Oxidation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10053</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10053v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate the atmospheric oxidation of mercury Hg(0) by halogens, initiated by Br and I to yield Hg(I), and continued by I, Br, BrO, ClO, IO, NO2 and HO2 to yield Hg(II) or Hg(0), using computational methods with a focus on the creation of data for determining the impact of rising iodine levels. We calculate reaction enthalpies and Gibbs free energies using the Coupled Cluster singlets, doublets, and perturbative triplets method (CCSD(T)) with the ma-def2-TZVP basis set and effective core potential to account for relativistic effects. Additionally, we investigate the reaction kinetics using variational transition state theory based on geometric scans of bond dissociations at the CASPT2/ma-def2-TZVP level. We compare the results obtained from the CASPT2 and CCSD(T) methods to help define the uncertainty. Our results provide insights into the mechanisms of these reactions, and the data produced get us closer to determining iodine's impact on mercury depletion events and on the atmosphere as a whole. The reaction *HgBr + Br* -&gt; HgBr2 was found to be twice as fast as HgI* + I* -&gt; HgI2, with reaction rate coefficients of 8.8x10-13 and 4.2x10-13 cm3molecule-1s-1 respectively. The BrHg* + BrO* -&gt; BrHgOBr reaction was about 7.2 times faster than the *HgI + IO* -&gt; IHgOI reaction with their rates being 3.3x10-14 and 4.6x10-15 cm3molecule-1s-1 respectively. We investigate the Hg*XOY (X and Y being halogen) complexes. From the reactions investigated including iodine, the reaction with the most plausible chance of impacting the mercury lifetime in the atmosphere is HgI* + I* -&gt; HgI2.</description>

      <title>Unbiasing Fermionic Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo with Matrix Product State Trial Wavefunctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05440</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05440v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this work, we report, for the first time, an implementation of fermionic auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) using matrix product state (MPS) trial wavefunctions, dubbed MPS-AFQMC. Calculating overlaps between an MPS trial and arbitrary Slater determinants up to a multiplicative error, a crucial subroutine in MPS-AFQMC, is proven to be #P-hard. Nonetheless, we tested several promising heuristics in successfully improving fermionic phaseless AFQMC energies. We also proposed a way to evaluate local energy and force bias evaluations free of matrix product operators. This allows for larger basis set calculations without significant overhead. We showcase the utility of our approach on one- and two-dimensional hydrogen lattices, even when the MPS trial itself struggles to obtain high accuracy. Our work offers a new set of tools that can solve currently challenging electronic structure problems with future improvements.</description>

      <title>Atomic Ionization: sd energy imbalance and Perdew-Zunger self-interaction correction energy penalty in 3d atoms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07438v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: To accurately describe the energetics of transition metal systems, density functional approximations (DFAs) must provide a balanced description of s- and d- electrons. One measure of this is the sd transfer error, which has previously been defined as $E(\mathrm{3d}^{n-1}\mathrm{4s}^{1}) - E(\mathrm{3d}^{n-2}\mathrm{4s}^{2})$. Theoretical concerns have been raised about this definition due to its evaluation of excited-state energies using ground-state DFAs. A more serious concern appears to be strong correlation in the ${4s}^2$ configuration. Here we define a ground-state measure of the sd energy imbalance, based on the errors of s- and d-electron second ionization energies of the 3d atoms, that effectively circumvents the aforementioned problems. We find an improved performance as we move from LSDA to PBE to r$^2$SCAN for first-row transition metal atoms. However, we find large (~ 2 eV) ground-state sd energy imbalances when applying a Perdew-Zunger 1981 self-interaction correction. This is attributed to an "energy penalty" associated with the noded 3d orbitals. A local scaling of the self-interaction correction to LSDA results in a balance of s- and d-errors.</description>

      <title>Developing Orbital-Dependent Corrections for the Non-Additive Kinetic Energy in Subsystem Density Functional Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel route to constructing cost-efficient semi-empirical approximations for the non-additive kinetic energy in subsystem density functional theory. The developed methodology is based on the use of Slater determinants composed of non-orthogonal Kohn$\unicode{x2013}$Sham-like orbitals for the evaluation of kinetic energy expectation values and the expansion of the inverse molecular-orbital overlap matrix into a Neumann series. Applying these techniques, we derived and implemented a series of orbital-dependent approximations for the non-additive kinetic energy, which are employed self-consistently. Our proof-of-principle computations demonstrated quantitatively correct results for potential energy curves and electron densities and hinted on the applicability of the introduced empirical parameters to different types of molecular systems and intermolecular interactions. We therefore conclude that the presented study is an important step towards constructing accurate and efficient orbital-dependent approximations for the non-additive kinetic energy applicable to large molecular systems.</description>

      <title>Magnetically Induced Current Density from Numerical Positional Derivatives of Nucleus Independent Chemical Shifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02541</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02541v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Instead of computing magneticallly induced (MI) current densities (CD) via the wave function and their quatum mechanical definition one can also use the differential form of the Amp\`ere-Maxwell law to obtain them from spatial derivatives of the induced magnetic field. In magnetic molecular response calculations, the latter can be done by numerical derivativation of the so called ``nucleus-independent chemical shifts'' (NICS) which are avaialable to many standard quantum chemical programs. The resulting numerical MICD data is in contrast to other numerically obtained MICDs computed via the wave function route, virtually divergence-free.</description>

      <title>Enhanced Krylov Methods for Molecular Hamiltonians: Reduced Memory Cost and Complexity Scaling via Tensor Hypercontraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12708</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.12708v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator (MPO) construction based on the tensor hypercontraction (THC) format for ab initio molecular Hamiltonians. Such an MPO construction dramatically lowers the memory requirement and cost scaling of Krylov subspace methods. These can find low-lying eigenstates while avoiding local minima and simulate quantum time evolution with high accuracy. In our approach, the molecular Hamiltonian is represented as a sum of products of four MPOs, each with a bond dimension of only $2$. Iteratively applying the MPOs to the current quantum state in matrix product state (MPS) form, summing and re-compressing the MPS leads to a scheme with the same asymptotic memory cost as the bare MPS and reduces the computational cost scaling compared to the Krylov method based on a conventional MPO construction. We provide a detailed theoretical derivation of these statements and conduct supporting numerical experiments to demonstrate the advantage. We also propose that our method is compatible with parallel computing, which is essential for calculating large-size systems.</description>

      <title>Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.15201v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.</description>

      <title>Infinite variety of thermodynamic speed limits with general activities</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.20690v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Activity, which represents the kinetic property of dynamics, plays a central role in obtaining thermodynamic speed limits (TSLs). In this paper, we discuss a unified framework that provides the existing TSLs based on different activities such as dynamical activity and dynamical state mobility. We also derive an infinite variety of TSLs for Markov jump processes and deterministic chemical reaction networks by using different activities defined by the generalized means. The lower bound on the entropy production given by each TSL provides the minimum dissipation achievable by a conservative force. We numerically and analytically discuss the tightness of the lower bounds on the EPR in the various TSLs.</description>

      <title>Providing Machine Learning Potentials with High Quality Uncertainty Estimates</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.05250v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Computational chemistry has come a long way over the course of several decades, enabling subatomic level calculations particularly with the development of Density Functional Theory (DFT). Recently, machine-learned potentials (MLP) have provided a way to overcome the prevalent time and length scale constraints in such calculations. Unfortunately, these models utilise complex and high dimensional representations, making it challenging for users to intuit performance from chemical structure, which has motivated the development of methods for uncertainty quantification. One of the most common methods is to introduce an ensemble of models and employ an averaging approach to determine the uncertainty. In this work, we introduced Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) for uncertainty aware energy evaluation as a more principled and resource efficient method to achieve this goal. The richness of our uncertainty quantification enables a new type of hybrid workflow where calculations can be offloaded to a MLP in a principled manner.</description>
