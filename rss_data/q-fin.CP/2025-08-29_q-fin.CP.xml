      <title>Can LLMs Identify Tax Abuse?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20097v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate whether large language models can discover and analyze U.S. tax-minimization strategies. This real-world domain challenges even seasoned human experts, and progress can reduce tax revenue lost from well-advised, wealthy taxpayers. We evaluate the most advanced LLMs on their ability to (1) interpret and verify tax strategies, (2) fill in gaps in partially specified strategies, and (3) generate complete, end-to-end strategies from scratch. This domain should be of particular interest to the LLM reasoning community: unlike synthetic challenge problems or scientific reasoning tasks, U.S. tax law involves navigating hundreds of thousands of pages of statutes, case law, and administrative guidance, all updated regularly. Notably, LLM-based reasoning identified an entirely novel tax strategy, highlighting these models' potential to revolutionize tax agencies' fight against tax abuse.</description>

      <title>Agent-based model of information diffusion in the limit order book trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20672v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There are multiple explanations for stylized facts in high-frequency trading, including adaptive and informed agents, many of which have been studied through agent-based models. This paper investigates an alternative explanation by examining whether, and under what circumstances, interactions between traders placing limit order book messages can reproduce stylized facts, and what forms of interaction are required. While the agent-based modeling literature has introduced interconnected agents on networks, little attention has been paid to whether specific trading network topologies can generate stylized facts in limit order book markets. In our model, agents are strictly zero-intelligence, with no fundamental knowledge or chartist-like strategies, so that the role of network topology can be isolated. We find that scale-free connectivity between agents reproduces stylized facts observed in markets, whereas no-interaction does not. Our experiments show that regular lattices and Erdos-Renyi networks are not significantly different from the no-interaction baseline. Thus, we provide a completely new, potentially complementary, explanation for the emergence of stylized facts.</description>

      <title>QTMRL: An Agent for Quantitative Trading Decision-Making Based on Multi-Indicator Guided Reinforcement Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In the highly volatile and uncertain global financial markets, traditional quantitative trading models relying on statistical modeling or empirical rules often fail to adapt to dynamic market changes and black swan events due to rigid assumptions and limited generalization. To address these issues, this paper proposes QTMRL (Quantitative Trading Multi-Indicator Reinforcement Learning), an intelligent trading agent combining multi-dimensional technical indicators with reinforcement learning (RL) for adaptive and stable portfolio management. We first construct a comprehensive multi-indicator dataset using 23 years of S&amp;P 500 daily OHLCV data (2000-2022) for 16 representative stocks across 5 sectors, enriching raw data with trend, volatility, and momentum indicators to capture holistic market dynamics. Then we design a lightweight RL framework based on the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) algorithm, including data processing, A2C algorithm, and trading agent modules to support policy learning and actionable trading decisions. Extensive experiments compare QTMRL with 9 baselines (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM, moving average strategies) across diverse market regimes, verifying its superiority in profitability, risk adjustment, and downside risk control. The code of QTMRL is publicly available at https://github.com/ChenJiahaoJNU/QTMRL.git</description>
