      <title>Fused LASSO as Non-Crossing Quantile Regression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantile crossing has been an ever-present thorn in the side of quantile regression. This has spurred research into obtaining densities and coefficients that obey the quantile monotonicity property. While important contributions, these papers do not provide insight into how exactly these constraints influence the estimated coefficients. This paper extends non-crossing constraints and shows that by varying a single hyperparameter ($\alpha$) one can obtain commonly used quantile estimators. Namely, we obtain the quantile regression estimator of Koenker and Bassett (1978) when $\alpha=0$, the non crossing quantile regression estimator of Bondell et al. (2010) when $\alpha=1$, and the composite quantile regression estimator of Koenker (1984) and Zou and Yuan (2008) when $\alpha\rightarrow\infty$. As such, we show that non-crossing constraints are simply a special type of fused-shrinkage.</description>

      <title>A Gaussian smooth transition vector autoregressive model: An application to the macroeconomic effects of severe weather shocks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new smooth transition vector autoregressive model with a Gaussian conditional distribution and transition weights that, for a $p$th order model, depend on the full distribution of the preceding $p$ observations. Specifically, the transition weight of each regime increases in its relative weighted likelihood. This data-driven approach facilitates capturing complex switching dynamics, enhancing the identification of gradual regime shifts. In an empirical application to the macroeconomic effects of a severe weather shock, we find that in monthly U.S. data from 1961:1 to 2022:3, the impacts of the shock are stronger in the regime prevailing in the early part of the sample and in certain crisis periods than in the regime dominating the latter part of the sample. This suggests overall adaptation of the U.S. economy to increased severe weather over time.</description>

      <title>Estimating Causal Effects with Double Machine Learning -- A Method Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14385</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.14385v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The estimation of causal effects with observational data continues to be a very active research area. In recent years, researchers have developed new frameworks which use machine learning to relax classical assumptions necessary for the estimation of causal effects. In this paper, we review one of the most prominent methods - "double/debiased machine learning" (DML) - and empirically evaluate it by comparing its performance on simulated data relative to more traditional statistical methods, before applying it to real-world data. Our findings indicate that the application of a suitably flexible machine learning algorithm within DML improves the adjustment for various nonlinear confounding relationships. This advantage enables a departure from traditional functional form assumptions typically necessary in causal effect estimation. However, we demonstrate that the method continues to critically depend on standard assumptions about causal structure and identification. When estimating the effects of air pollution on housing prices in our application, we find that DML estimates are consistently larger than estimates of less flexible methods. From our overall results, we provide actionable recommendations for specific choices researchers must make when applying DML in practice.</description>

      <title>Iterative Estimation of Nonparametric Regressions with Continuous Endogenous Variables and Discrete Instruments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07812</link>
      <description>arXiv:1905.07812v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a nonparametric regression model with continuous endogenous independent variables when only discrete instruments are available that are independent of the error term. While this framework is very relevant for applied research, its implementation is cumbersome, as the regression function becomes the solution to a nonlinear integral equation. We propose a simple iterative procedure to estimate such models and showcase some of its asymptotic properties. In a simulation experiment, we discuss the details of its implementation in the case when the instrumental variable is binary. We conclude with an empirical application in which we examine the effect of pollution on house prices in a short panel of U.S. counties.</description>

      <title>Homophily in preferences or meetings? Identifying and estimating an iterative network formation model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.06694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2201.06694v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Is homophily in social and economic networks driven by a taste for homogeneity (preferences) or by a higher probability of meeting individuals with similar attributes (opportunity)? This paper studies identification and estimation of an iterative network game that distinguishes between these two mechanisms. Our approach enables us to assess the counterfactual effects of changing the meeting protocol between agents. As an application, we study the role of preferences and meetings in shaping classroom friendship networks in Brazil. In a network structure in which homophily due to preferences is stronger than homophily due to meeting opportunities, tracking students may improve welfare. Still, the relative benefit of this policy diminishes over the school year.</description>

      <title>Identification and Statistical Decision Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.11318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2204.11318v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Econometricians have usefully separated study of estimation into identification and statistical components. Identification analysis, which assumes knowledge of the probability distribution generating observable data, places an upper bound on what may be learned about population parameters of interest with finite sample data. Yet Wald's statistical decision theory studies decision making with sample data without reference to identification, indeed without reference to estimation. This paper asks if identification analysis is useful to statistical decision theory. The answer is positive, as it can yield an informative and tractable upper bound on the achievable finite sample performance of decision criteria. The reasoning is simple when the decision relevant parameter is point identified. It is more delicate when the true state is partially identified and a decision must be made under ambiguity. Then the performance of some criteria, such as minimax regret, is enhanced by randomizing choice of an action. This may be accomplished by making choice a function of sample data. I find it useful to recast choice of a statistical decision function as selection of choice probabilities for the elements of the choice set. Using sample data to randomize choice conceptually differs from and is complementary to its traditional use to estimate population parameters.</description>
