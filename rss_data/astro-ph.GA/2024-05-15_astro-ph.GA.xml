      <title>Formation channels of the diffuse lights in the groups and clusters over time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08061v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the formation of the intragroup light (IGL) and intracluster light (ICL), representing diffuse lights within groups and clusters, since $z=1.5$. For this, we perform multi-resolution cosmological N-body simulations using the ``galaxy replacement technique" (GRT) and identify the progenitors in which the diffuse light stars existed when they fell into the groups or clusters. Our findings reveal that typical progenitors contributing to diffuse lights enter the host halo with the massive galaxies containing a stellar mass of $10 &lt; \log M_{\rm{gal}}~[M_{\odot}]&lt; 11$, regardless of the mass or dynamical state of the host halos at $z=0$. In cases where the host halos are dynamically unrelaxed or more massive, diffuse lights from massive progenitors with $\log M_{\rm{gal}}~[M_{\odot}]&gt; 11$ are more prominent, with over half of them already pre-processed before entering the host halo. Additionally, we find that the main formation mechanism of diffuse lights is the stripping process of satellites, and a substantial fraction ($40-45\%$) of diffuse light stars is linked to the merger tree of the BCG. Remarkably, all trends persist for groups and clusters at higher redshifts. The fraction of diffuse lights in the host halos with a similar mass decreases as the redshift increases, but they are already substantial at $z=1.5$ ($\sim10\%$). However, it's crucial to acknowledge that detection limits related to the observable radius and faint-end surface brightness may obscure numerous diffuse light stars and even alter the main formation channel of diffuse lights.</description>

      <title>On the contribution of dwarf galaxies to reionization of the Universe</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08066</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08066v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present estimates of the ultraviolet (UV) and Lyman continuum flux density contributed by galaxies of luminosities from $M_{\rm UV}\approx -25$ to $M_{\rm UV}=-4$ at redshifts $5\leq z\leq 10$ using a galaxy formation model that reproduces properties of local dwarf galaxies down to the luminosities of the ultra-faint satellites. We characterize the UV luminosity function (LF) of galaxies and their abundance as a function of the ionizing photon emission rate predicted by our model and present accurate fitting functions describing them. Although the slope of the LF becomes gradually shallower with decreasing luminosity due to feedback-driven outflows, the UV LF predicted by the model remains quite steep at the luminosities $M_{\rm UV}\lesssim -14$. After reionization, the UV LF flattens at $M_{\rm UV}\gtrsim -12$ due to UV heating of intergalactic gas. However, before reionization, the slope of the LF remains steep and approximately constant from $M_{\rm UV}\approx -14$ to $M_{\rm UV}=-4$. We show that for a constant ionizing photon escape fraction the contribution of faint galaxies with $M_{\rm UV}&gt;-14$ to the UV flux and ionizing photon budget is $\approx 40-60\%$ at $z&gt;7$ and decreases to $\approx 20\%$ at $z=6$. Before reionization, even ultra-faint galaxies of $M_{\rm UV}&gt;-10$ contribute $\approx 10-25\%$ of ionizing photons. If the escape fraction increases strongly for fainter galaxies, the contribution of $M_{\rm UV}&gt;-14$ galaxies before reionization increases to $\approx 60-75\%$. Our results imply that dwarf galaxies fainter than $M_{\rm UV}=-14$, beyond the James Webb Space Telescope limit, contribute significantly to the UV flux density and ionizing photon budget before reionization alleviating requirements on the escape fraction of Lyman continuum photons.</description>

      <title>A JVLA, LOFAR, e-Merlin, VLBA and EVN study of RBS 797: can binary SMBHs explain the outburst history of the central radio galaxy?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08079</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08079v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a multi-frequency (144 MHz - 9 GHz) and multi-scale (5 pc - 50 kpc) investigation of the central radio galaxy in RBS 797, by means of JVLA, LOFAR (with international stations), e-Merlin, VLBA and EVN data. We investigate the morphological and spectral properties of the radio lobes, the jets, and the active core. We confirm the co-spatiality of the radio lobes with the four perpendicular X-ray cavities (see arXiv:2111.03679). The radiative ages of the E-W lobes ($31.4\pm6.6$ Myr) and of the N-S lobes ($32.1\pm9.9$ Myr) support a coeval origin of the perpendicular outbursts, that also have similar active phase duration ($\sim$12 Myr). For the inner N-S jets (on scales of $\leq10$ kpc), we (a) confirm the S-shaped jet morphology; (b) show the presence of two hotspots per jet with a similar spectral index; (c) estimate the age of the twisting jets to be less than $\sim8$ Myr. Based on these results, we determine that jet precession, with period $\sim$9 Myr, half-opening angle $\sim$24$^{\circ}$ and jet speed $\sim$0.01$c$, can explain the properties of the N-S jets. We also find that the synchrotron injection index has steepened from the large, older outbursts ($\Gamma\sim0.5$) to the younger S-shaped jets ($\Gamma\sim0.9$), possibly due to a transition from an FR I-like to an FR II-like activity. The VLBI data reveal a single, compact core at the heart of RBS 797, surrounded by extended radio emission whose orientation depends on the spatial scale sampled by the data. We explore several engine-based scenarios to explain these results. Piecing together the available evidence, we argue that RBS 797 likely hosts (or hosted) binary active SMBHs. This is still consistent with the detection of a single component in the VLBI data, since the predicted separation of the binary SMBHs ($\leq$0.6 pc) is an order of magnitude smaller than the resolution of the available radio data (5 pc).</description>

      <title>The significant contribution of supersoft X-ray Sources to the nebular HeII line emission</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08121</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08121v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nebular spectral lines provide insight into the properties of the interstellar medium and the ionizing radiation within galaxies. The presence of high-energy ionization lines, such as He II, indicates the existence of hard ionizing photons, because the second ionization energy of helium is high (54 eV). The enigma surrounding the origin of these lines observed in star-forming galaxies persists, as stellar ionization cannot account for such high energy emission. This paper proposes that supersoft X-ray sources (SSS) may produce these high energy ionization lines in star-forming galaxies. We model the spectra of such sources using blackbody radiation and then add the blackbody to stellar population spectra to represent the overall spectra of galaxies. We then use a photoionization model to predict the resulting emission lines and compare the contribution of SSS to the observation of highly ionized lines in star-forming galaxies, both at low and high redshifts. We find that incorporating a blackbody with temperatures between kT = 20-100eV can boost the He II emission line ratio to the observed level. The blackbody temperature range aligns with the observed temperatures of the SSSs. The number of SSSs in spiral galaxies listed in Chandra catalogues, and our estimates of the total population, confirms that SSSs are promising candidates for the source of the He II ionization.</description>

      <title>Probing the impact of radio-mode feedback on the properties of the cool circumgalactic medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explore the influence of radio-mode feedback on the properties of the cool circumgalactic medium (CGM). To this end, we assemble a statistical sample of approximately 30,000 radio galaxies with background quasars by combining optical spectroscopic measurements of luminous red galaxies (LRGs) and quasars from the year 1 dataset of Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI) and radio sources from the LOw-Frequency ARray Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) DR2 catalog and the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) quick look catalog. Galaxies with similar optical properties but with no radio counterparts in LoTSS and VLASS are selected as the control group. We measure the cool CGM properties of radio galaxies and their control samples traced by MgII absorption lines, including covering fraction, rest equivalent width, and gas kinematics. Our results show no significant difference in the properties of gas around radio galaxies and their control sample, indicating that the operating radio-mode feedback of massive galaxies does not produce detectable effects on the properties of the cool CGM. Finally, we show that the CGM of radio galaxies contain a non-negligible amount of cool gas with approximately 10^10 solar masses. This abundance can place a stringent constraint on the radio-mode feedback models.</description>

      <title>An ALCHEMI inspection of sulphur-bearing species towards the central molecular zone of NGC 253</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08408v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Sulphur-bearing species are detected in various environments within Galactic star-forming regions and are particularly abundant in the gas phase of outflows and shocks, and photo-dissociation regions. In this work, we aim to investigate the nature of the emission from the most common sulphur-bearing species observable at millimetre wavelengths towards the nuclear starburst of the galaxy NGC 253. We intend to understand which type of regions are probed by sulphur-bearing species and which process(es) dominate(s) the release of sulphur into the gas phase. We used the high-angular resolution (1.6" or 27 pc) observations from the ALCHEMI ALMA Large Program to image several sulphur-bearing species towards the central molecular zone (CMZ) of NGC 253. We performed local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE large velocity gradient (LVG) analyses to derive the physical conditions of the gas in which S-bearing species are emitted, and their abundance ratios across the CMZ. Finally, we compared our results with previous ALCHEMI studies and a few selected Galactic environments. We found that not all sulphur-bearing species trace the same type of gas: strong evidence indicates that H2S and part of the emission of OCS, H2CS, and SO, are tracing shocks whilst part of SO and CS emission rather trace the dense molecular gas. For some species, such as CCS and SO2, we could not firmly conclude on their origin of emission. The present analysis indicates that the emission from most sulphur-bearing species throughout the CMZ is likely dominated by shocks associated with ongoing star formation. In the inner part of the CMZ where the presence of super star clusters was previously indicated, we could not distinguish between shocks or thermal evaporation as the main process releasing the S-bearing species.</description>

      <title>Spectral characterisation of the extinction properties of NGC 3603 using JWST NIRSpec</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08445v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Context. A necessary ingredient in understanding the star formation history of a young cluster is knowledge of the extinction towards the region. This has typically been done by making use of the colour-difference method with photometry, or similar methods utilising the colour-colour diagram. Aims. The colour-excess can be independently determined by studying the decrements of the recombination lines produced by the nebular gas. Having access to many recombination lines from the same spectral series removes the need of adopting an extinction curve. Methods. Using the Micro-Shutter Assembly (MSA) on board the Near InfraRed Spectrograph (NIRSpec), multi-object spectroscopy was performed, yielding 600 nebular spectra from the Galactic massive star formation region NGC 3603. The recombination line intensity ratios were used to determine independent values of colour-excess. Results. The extinction characteristics of NGC 3603 are similar to other Galactic HII regions like Orion, as well as starburst regions such 30 Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud, in that we find a relatively large value of total-to-selective extinction of 4.8 $\pm$ 1.06, larger than the Galactic average of 3.1. We find a typical value for the colour-excess of 0.64 $\pm$ 0.27, significantly lower than values determined in previous studies. We also present a stacked nebular spectrum with a typical continuum S/N = 70. This spectrum highlights the recombination lines of the HII region, several s-process elements such as Kr III and Se IV, and molecular H2 emission lines. Conclusions. Using ratios of hydrogen recombination lines, we calculated the total-to-selective extinction, colour-excess and visual extinction for &gt; 200 lines of sight across NGC 3603. An extinction curve with a total-to-selective extinction of 4.8 $\pm$ 1.06 was found, corresponding to a colour-excess of 0.64 $\pm$ 0.27.</description>

      <title>Chemical inventory of the envelope of the Class I protostar L1551 IRS 5</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08517</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08517v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Episodic accretion in protostars leads to luminosity outbursts that end up heating their surroundings. This rise in temperature pushes the snow lines back, enabling the desorption of chemical species from dust grain surfaces, which may significantly alter the chemical history of the accreting envelope. However, a limited number of extensive chemical surveys of eruptive young stars have been performed thus far. In the present study, we carry out a large spectral survey of the binary Class I protostar L1551 IRS 5, known to be a FUor-like object, in the 3mm and 2mm bands with the IRAM-30m telescope. As a result, we detected more than 400 molecular lines. The source displays a great chemical richness with the detection of 75 species, including isotopologues. Among these species, there are 13 hydrocarbons, 25 N-bearing species, 30 O-bearing species, 15 S-bearing species, 12 deuterated molecules, and a total of 10 complex organic molecules (l-C4H2, CH3CCH, CH2DCCH, CH3CHO, CH3CN, CH3OCH3, CH3OCHO, CH3OH, CH2DOH, and HC5N). With the help of local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) and non-LTE models, we determined the column densities of most molecules as well as excitation and kinetic temperatures. While most of those molecules trace the cold envelope (. 20 K), the OCS and CH3OH emission arise from the warm (&gt; 100 K) innermost (&lt; 2'' ) regions. We compared the chemical inventory of L1551 IRS 5 and its column density ratios, including isotopic ratios, with other protostellar sources. A broad chemical diversity is seen among Class I objects. More observations with both single-dish telescopes and interferometers are needed to characterize the diversity in a larger sample of protostars, while more astrochemical models would help explain this diversity, in addition to the impact of luminosity outbursts on the chemistry of protostellar envelopes.</description>

      <title>The physical mechanism behind magnetic field alignment in interstellar clouds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the alignment mechanism between the magnetic field and interstellar clouds formed by the collision of warm atomic gas. We find that the magnetic field, initially oriented parallel to the flow, is perturbed by a fast MHD shock, which amplifies magnetic field fluctuations parallel to the shock front. Behind the shock, the compressive downstream velocity field further amplifies the magnetic field component parallel to the shock front. This mechanism causes the magnetic field to become increasingly parallel to the dense layer, and the development of a shear flow around the latter. Furthermore, the bending-mode perturbations on the dense layer are amplified by the non-linear thin-shell instability (NTSI), stretching the density structures formed by the thermal instability, and rendering them parallel to the bent field lines. By extension, we suggest that a tidal stretching velocity gradient such as that produced in gas infalling into a self-gravitating structure must straighten the field lines along the accretion flow, orienting them perpendicular to the density structures. We also find that the upstream superalfv\'enic regime transitions to a transalfv\'enic regime between the shock and the condensation front, and then to a subalfv\'enic regime inside the condensations. Our results provide a feasible physical mechanism for the observed transition from parallel to perpendicular relative orientation of the magnetic field and the density structures as the density structures become increasingly dominated by self-gravity.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Fields Observed along the E-W Outflow of IRAS 16293-2422</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Magnetic fields likely play an important role in the formation of young protostars. Multiscale and multiwavelength dust polarization observations can reveal the inferred magnetic field from scales of the cloud to core to protostar. We present continuum polarization observations of the young protostellar triple system IRAS 16293-2422 at 89 $\mu$m using HAWC+ on SOFIA. The inferred magnetic field is very uniform with an average field angle of 89$^\circ\pm$23$^\circ$ (E of N), which is different from the $\sim$170$^\circ$ field morphology seen at 850 $\mu$m at larger scales (&gt; 2000 au) with JCMT POL-2 and at 1.3 mm on smaller scales (&lt; 300 au) with ALMA. The HAWC+ magnetic field direction is aligned with the known E-W outflow. This alignment difference suggests that the shorter wavelength HAWC+ data is tracing the magnetic field associated with warmer dust likely from the outflow cavity, whereas the longer wavelength data are tracing the bulk magnetic field from cooler dust. Also, we show in this source the dust emission peak is strongly affected by the observing wavelength. The dust continuum peaks closer to source B (northern source) at shorter wavelengths and progressively moves toward the southern A source with increasing wavelength (from 22 $\mu$m to 850 $\mu$m).</description>

      <title>Stellar Characterization and a Chromospheric Activity Analysis of a K2 Sample of Planet-Hosting Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08128v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Effective temperatures, surface gravities, and iron abundances were derived for 109 stars observed by the K2 mission using equivalent width measurements of Fe I and Fe II lines. Calculations were carried out in LTE using Kurucz model atmospheres. Stellar masses and radii were derived by combining the stellar parameters with Gaia DR3 parallaxes, V-magnitudes, and isochrones. The derived stellar and planetary radii have median internal precision of 1.8%, and 2.3%, respectively. The radius gap near $\rm R_{planet}\sim 1.9 R_\oplus$ was detected in this K2 sample. Chromospheric activity was measured from the Ca II H and K lines using the Values of $\log R^\prime_{\rm HK}$ were investigated as a function of stellar rotational period (P$_{rot}$) and we found that chromospheric activity decreases with increasing P$_{rot}$, although there is a large scatter in $\log R^\prime_{\rm HK}$ ($\sim$0.5) for a given P$_{rot}$. Activity levels in this sample reveal a paucity of F &amp; G dwarfs with intermediate activity levels (Vaughan-Preston gap). The effect that stellar activity might have on the derivation of stellar parameters was investigated by including magnetically-sensitive Fe I lines in the analysis and we find no significant differences between parameters with and without magnetically-sensitive lines, although the more active stars ($\log R^\prime _{\rm HK}&gt;-5.0$) exhibit a larger scatter in the differences in $T_{\rm eff}$ and [Fe/H].</description>

      <title>Lithium, rotation and metallicity in the open cluster M35</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08166v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Lithium (Li) abundance is an age indicator for G, K, and M stellar types, as its abundance decreases over time for these spectral types. However, despite the observational efforts made over the past few decades, the role of rotation, activity, and metallicity in the depletion of Li is still unclear. We have investigated how Li depletion is affected by rotation and metallicity in G and K members of the roughly Pleiades-aged open cluster M35. To do so, we have collected a sample of 165 candidate members observed with the WIYN/Hydra spectrograph. In addition, we have taken advantage of three previous spectroscopic studies of Li in M35. As a result, we have collected a final sample of 396 stars which we have classified as members and non-members of the cluster. We have measured iron abundances, Li equivalent widths, and Li abundances for the 110 M35 members added to the existing sample by this study. Finally, rotation periods for cluster members have been obtained from the literature or derived from Zwicky Transient Facility light curves. As a result, we have confirmed that fast G and K rotators are Li-rich in comparison with slow rotators of similar effective temperature. Furthermore, while we derived subsolar metallicity for M35 from our spectra, the distribution of Li in this cluster is similar to those observed for the Pleiades and M34, which have solar metallicity and slightly different ages. In addition, we have shown that an empirical relationship proposed to remove the contribution of the Fe I line at 670.75 nm to the blended feature at 670.78 nm overestimates the contribution of this iron line for M35 members. We conclude that a 0.2-0.3 dex difference in metallicity makes little difference in the Li distributions of open clusters with ages between 100 and 250 Myr.</description>

      <title>Cloud Dissipation and Disk Wind in the Late Phase of Star Formation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08271v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform a long-term simulation of star and disk formation using three-dimensional non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics. The simulation starts from a prestellar cloud and proceeds through the long-term evolution of the circumstellar disk until $\sim 1.5\times10^5$ yr after protostar formation. The disk has size $\lesssim 50$ au and little substructure in the main accretion phase because of the action of magnetic braking and the magnetically-driven outflow to remove angular momentum. The main accretion phase ends when the outflow breaks out of the cloud, causing the envelope mass to decrease rapidly. The outflow subsequently weakens as the mass accretion rate also weakens. While the envelope-to-disk accretion continues, the disk grows gradually and develops transient spiral structures due to gravitational instability. When the envelope-to-disk accretion ends, the disk becomes stable and reaches a size $\gtrsim 300$ au. In addition, about 30% of the initial cloud mass has been ejected by the outflow. A significant finding of this work is that after the envelope dissipates, a revitalization of the wind occurs, and there is mass ejection from the disk surface that lasts until the end of the simulation. This mass ejection (or disk wind) is generated since the magnetic pressure significantly dominates both the ram pressure and thermal pressure above and below the disk at this stage. Using the angular momentum flux and mass loss rate estimated from the disk wind, the disk dissipation timescale is estimated to be $\sim10^6$ yr.</description>

      <title>Planet formation regulated by galactic-scale interstellar turbulence</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08451v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Planets form from protoplanetary discs of dust and gas that surround stars younger than a few million years. The properties of these discs dictate how planets grow, determining the nature, architecture and composition of the observed exoplanet population. The nature of (turbulent) angular momentum transport through the disc in particular is critical for planet growth and migration. While the dominant physical processes in disc evolution remain unknown, theoretical studies widely assume an isolated star-disc system. Here we challenge this conventional assumption by showing that, far from being isolated systems, discs in typical star forming environments are constantly replenished by capturing new material from the interstellar medium (ISM). We show that this in-fall alone explains observed disc masses, outer radii and stellar accretion rates as a function of time and stellar mass. ISM capture is also capable of driving disc turbulence corresponding to viscosity in the range $\alpha_\mathrm{SS} \sim 10^{-5}{-}10^{-1}$, as observationally inferred. We find that $20{-}70$~percent of discs are composed of material captured in the most recent half of their life-time, implying their properties are not direct probes of internal disc physics. Our results suggest that planet formation is driven by the turbulent cascade of energy from galactic-scales down to the protoplanetary disc and that recent evidence of in-fall from the ISM onto mature protoplanetary discs are part of an important, general process. This represents a far-reaching shift in our understanding of every stage of planet formation, from dust aggregation to the migration of giant planets through the disc.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08522v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Many galaxies contain supermassive black holes (SMBHs), whose formation and history raise many puzzles. Pulsar timing arrays have recently discovered a low-frequency cosmological "hum" of gravitational waves that may be emitted by SMBH binary systems, and the JWST and other telescopes have discovered an unexpectedly large population of high-redshift SMBHs. We argue that these two discoveries may be linked, and that they may enhance the prospects for measuring gravitational waves emitted during the mergers of massive black holes, thereby opening the way towards resolving many puzzles about SMBHs as well as providing new opportunities to probe general relativity.</description>

      <title>The evolution of stellar X-ray activity and angular momentum as seen by eROSITA, TESS, and Gaia</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.08607v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We have assembled a sample of $\sim$8200 stars with spectral types F5V-M5V, all having directly measured X-ray luminosities from eROSITA and rotation periods from TESS, and having empirically estimated ages via their membership in stellar clusters and groups identified in Gaia astrometry (ages 3-500 Myr). This is the largest such study sample yet assembled for the purpose of empirically constraining the evolution of rotationally driven stellar X-ray activity. We observe rotation-age-activity correlations that are qualitatively as expected: stars of a given spectral type spin down with age and they become less X-ray active as they do so. We provide simple functional representations of these empirical relationships that predict X-ray luminosity from basic observables to within 0.3 dex. Interestingly, we find that the rotation-activity relationship is far simpler and more monotonic in form when expressed in terms of stellar angular momentum instead of rotation period. We discuss how this finding may relate to the long-established idea that rotation-activity relationships are mediated by stellar structure (e.g., convective turnover time, surface area). Finally, we provide an empirical relation that predicts stellar angular momentum from basic observables, and without requiring a direct measurement of stellar rotation, to within 0.5 dex.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.08744v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Observations of velocity dispersions of galactic structures over a wide range of scales point to the existence of a universal acceleration scale $a_0\sim 10^{-10}$ m/s$^2$. Focusing on the fuzzy dark matter paradigm, which proposes ultralight dark matter with mass around $10^{-22}$ eV and de Broglie wavelength $\lambda\sim {\rm few}\times10^{2}$ parsecs, we highlight the emergence of the observed acceleration scale from quantum effects in a fluid-like description of the dark matter dynamics. We then suggest the possibility of a natural connection between the acceleration scale and dark energy within the same paradigm.</description>

      <title>Extremely metal-poor stars in the Fornax and Carina dwarf spheroidal galaxies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.07676v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present our analysis of VLT/UVES and X-shooter observations of six very metal-poor stars, including four stars at [Fe/H]$\approx$$-3$ in the Fornax and Carina dwarf spheroidal (dSph) galaxies. To date, this metallicity range in these two galaxies has not yet been investigated fully, or at all in some cases. The chemical abundances of 25 elements are presented, based on 1D and local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model atmospheres. We discuss the different elemental groups, and find that $\alpha$- and iron-peak elements in these two systems are generally in good agreement with the Milky Way halo at the same metallicity. Our analysis reveals that none of the six stars we studied exhibits carbon enhancement, which is noteworthy given the prevalence of carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars without s-process enhancement (CEMP-no) in the Galaxy at similarly low metallicities. Our compilation of literature data shows that the fraction of CEMP-no stars in dSph galaxies is significantly lower than in the Milky Way, and than in ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. Furthermore, we report the discovery of the lowest metallicity, [Fe/H]=$-2.92$, r-process rich (r-I) star in a dSph galaxy. This star, fnx_06_019, has $\rm[Eu/Fe]=+0.8$, and also shows enhancement of La, Nd, and Dy, $\rm[X/Fe]&gt;+0.5$. Our new data in Carina and Fornax help populate the extremely low metallicity range in dSph galaxies, and add to the evidence of a low fraction of CEMP-no stars in these systems.</description>

      <title>The PSF Smoothing Effect on Concentration-Related Parameters of High Redshift Galaxies in HST and JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02094v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform a comprehensive investigation of the PSF smoothing effect on the measurement of concentration-related parameters ($C$, Gini, $M_{20}$) of high redshift galaxies in the HST and JWST surveys. Our sample contains massive galaxies from the CANDELS/EGS survey (0 &lt; z &lt; 2), and the CEERS survey (1 &lt; z &lt; 3). The non-parametric concentration-related parameters ($C$, Gini, $M_{20}$) and the model-dependent parameters (n, Re) of these galaxies are derived from Statmorph and GALFIT, respectively. We try to evaluate the PSF smoothing effect by comparing the concentration-related parameters to the S\'{e}rsic index in both observations and mock images. We find that the concentration index is generally underestimated, especially for smaller galaxies with higher S\'{e}rsic index (eventually converging to the concentration index of the PSF). However, galaxies with lower S\'{e}rsic index ($n \leq 1$) or larger relative size are less affected by the PSF smoothing effect. The Gini coefficient and the absolute $M_{20}$ statistic also show similar behaviour as the concentration index. Caution should be taken for the possible correction of the concentration-related parameters, where both the relative size and the S\'{e}rsic index of the galaxy are important. Compared to the HST images, the PSF smoothing is much less severe for images in the CEERS survey due to the much higher spatial resolution. In fact, it is better to use the S\'{e}rsic index rather than the non-parametric morphology indicators to trace the light concentration for galaxies at high redshifts. From the single S\'{e}rsic modelling of the HST and JWST images, we also confirm that galaxies at higher redshift are more compact with smaller $R_e$. The lower mass galaxies are more disc-like ($n\sim1$) compared to the higher mass galaxies that are more spheroid dominated ($n\sim3$).</description>

      <title>Study of Complex Nitrogen and Oxygen-bearing Molecules toward the High-mass Protostar IRAS 18089$-$1732</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.02857v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The observation of oxygen (O)- and nitrogen (N)-bearing molecules gives an idea about the complex prebiotic chemistry in the interstellar medium (ISM). In this article, we present the identification of the rotational emission lines of N-bearing molecules ethyl cyanide (C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN), cyanoacetylene (HC$_{3}$N), and O-bearing molecules methyl formate (CH$_{3}$OCHO) towards high-mass protostar IRAS 18089$-$1732 using the Atacama Compact Array (ACA). We also detected the emission lines of both N- and O-bearing molecule formamide (NH$_{2}$CHO) in the envelope of IRAS 18089$-$1732. We have detected the $v$ = 0 and 1 states rotational emission lines of CH$_{3}$OCHO. We also detected the two vibrationally excited states of HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 1 and $v$7 = 2). The estimated fractional abundances of C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN, HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 1), HC$_{3}$N ($v$7 = 2), and NH$_{2}$CHO towards the IRAS 18089$-$1732 are (1.40$\pm$0.5)$\times$10$^{-10}$, (7.5$\pm$0.7)$\times$10$^{-11}$, (3.1$\pm$0.4)$\times$10$^{-11}$, and (6.25$\pm$0.82)$\times$10$^{-11}$. Similarly, the estimated fractional abundances of CH$_{3}$OCHO ($v$ = 0) and CH$_{3}$OCHO ($v$ = 1) are (1.90$\pm$0.9)$\times$10$^{-9}$ and (8.90$\pm$0.8)$\times$10$^{-10}$, respectively. We also created the integrated emission maps of the detected molecules, and the observed molecules may have originated from the extended envelope of the protostar. We show that C$_{2}$H$_{5}$CN and HC$_{3}$N are most probably formed via the subsequential hydrogenation of the CH$_{2}$CHCN and the reaction between C$_{2}$H$_{2}$ and CN on the grain surface of IRAS 18089$-$1732. We found that NH$_{2}$CHO is probably produced due to the reaction between NH$_{2}$ and H$_{2}$CO in the gas phase. Similarly, CH$_{3}$OCHO is possibly created via the reaction between radical CH$_{3}$O and radical HCO on the grain surface of IRAS 18089$-$1732.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.02930v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We perform numerical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations of the gravitational collapse and fragmentation of a cylindrical molecular cloud with the help of the FLASH code. The cloud collapses rapidly along its radius without any signs of fragmentation in the simulations without magnetic field. The radial collapse of the cloud is stopped by the magnetic pressure gradient in the simulations with parallel magnetic field. Cores with high density form at the cloud ends during further evolution. The core densities are $n \approx 1.7 \cdot 10^{8}$ and $2 \cdot 10^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$ in the cases with initial magnetic field strengths $B = 1.9 \cdot 10^{-4}$ and $6 \cdot 10^{-4}$ G, respectively. The cores move toward the cloud center with supersonic speeds $|v_{z}|=3.6$ and $5.3$ km$\cdot$s$^{-1}$. The sizes of the cores along the filaments radius and filament main axis are $d_{r} = 0.0075$ pc and $d_{z} = 0.025$ pc, $d_{r} = 0.03$ pc and $d_{z} = 0.025$ pc, respectively. The masses of the cores increase during the filament evolution and lie in range of $\approx 10-20\,M_\odot$. According to our results, the cores observed at the edges of molecular filaments can be a result of the filament evolution with parallel magnetic field.</description>

      <title>The miniJPAS Survey: The radial distribution of star formation rates in faint X-ray active galactic nuclei</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06010</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06010v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the impact of black hole nuclear activity on both the global and radial star formation rate (SFR) profiles in X-ray-selected active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the field of miniJPAS, the precursor of the much wider J-PAS project. Our sample includes 32 AGN with z &lt; 0.3 detected via the XMM-Newton and Chandra surveys. For comparison, we assembled a control sample of 71 star-forming (SF) galaxies with similar magnitudes, sizes, and redshifts.
  To derive the global properties of both the AGN and the control SF sample, we used CIGALE to fit the spectral energy distributions derived from the 56 narrowband and 4 broadband filters from miniJPAS. We find that AGN tend to reside in more massive galaxies than their SF counterparts. After matching samples based on stellar mass and comparing their SFRs and specific SFRs (sSFRs), no significant differences appear. This suggests that the presence of AGN does not strongly influence overall star formation.
  However, when we used miniJPAS as an integral field unit (IFU) to dissect galaxies along their position angle, a different picture emerges. We find that AGN tend to be more centrally concentrated in mass with respect to SF galaxies. Moreover, we find a suppression of the sSFR up to 1Re and then an enhancement beyond 1Re , strongly contrasting with the decreasing radial profile of sSFRs in SF galaxies. This could point to an inside-out quenching of AGN host galaxies. These findings suggest that the reason we do not see differences on a global scale is because star formation is suppressed in the central regions and enhanced in the outer regions of AGN host galaxies. While limited in terms of sample size, this work highlights the potential of the upcoming J-PAS as a wide-field low-resolution IFU for thousands of nearby galaxies and AGN.</description>

      <title>The Sunburst Arc with JWST: III. An Abundance of Direct Chemical Abundances</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.06631v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We measure the gas-phase abundances of the elements He, N, O, Ne, S, Ar, and Fe in the Lyman-continuum emitting region of the Sunburst Arc, a highly magnified galaxy at redshift $z=2.37$. We detect the temperature-sensitive auroral lines [SII]$\lambda\lambda4069,4076$, [OII]$\lambda\lambda7320,7330$, [SIII]$\lambda6312$, [OIII]$\lambda4363$, and [NeIII]$\lambda3343$ in a stacked spectrum of 5 multiple images of the Lyman-continuum emitter (LCE), from which we directly measure the electron temperature in the low, intermediate, and high ionization zones. We also detect the density-sensitive doublets of [OII]$\lambda\lambda3727,3729$, [SII]$\lambda\lambda6717,6731$, and [ArIV]$\lambda\lambda4713,4741$, which constrain the density in both the low- and high-ionization gas. With these temperature and density measurements, we measure gas-phase abundances with similar rigor as studies of local galaxies. We measure a gas-phase metallicity for the LCE of $12+\log(\textrm{O}/\textrm{H}) = 7.97 \pm 0.05$, and find an enhanced nitrogen abundance $\log(\textrm{N}/\textrm{O}) = -0.65^{+0.16}_{-0.25}$. This nitrogen abundance is consistent with enrichment from a population of Wolf-Rayet stars, additional signatures of which are reported in a companion paper. Abundances of sulfur, argon, neon, and iron are consistent with local low-metallicity HII regions and low-redshift galaxies. This study represents the most complete chemical abundance analysis of a galaxy at Cosmic Noon to date, which enables direct comparisons between local HII regions and those in the distant universe.</description>

      <title>The second data release from the European Pulsar Timing Array V. Search for continuous gravitational wave signals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.16226</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.16226v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present the results of a search for continuous gravitational wave signals (CGWs) in the second data release (DR2) of the European Pulsar Timing Array (EPTA) collaboration. The most significant candidate event from this search has a gravitational wave frequency of 4-5 nHz. Such a signal could be generated by a supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) in the local Universe. We present the results of a follow-up analysis of this candidate using both Bayesian and frequentist methods. The Bayesian analysis gives a Bayes factor of 4 in favor of the presence of the CGW over a common uncorrelated noise process, while the frequentist analysis estimates the p-value of the candidate to be 1%, also assuming the presence of common uncorrelated red noise. However, comparing a model that includes both a CGW and a gravitational wave background (GWB) to a GWB only, the Bayes factor in favour of the CGW model is only 0.7. Therefore, we cannot conclusively determine the origin of the observed feature, but we cannot rule it out as a CGW source. We present results of simulations that demonstrate that data containing a weak gravitational wave background can be misinterpreted as data including a CGW and vice versa, providing two plausible explanations of the EPTA DR2 data. Further investigations combining data from all PTA collaborations will be needed to reveal the true origin of this feature.</description>

      <title>A Survey for Radio Emission from White Dwarfs in the VLA Sky Survey</title>

Abstract: Radio emission has been detected from tens of white dwarfs, in particular in accreting systems. Additionally, radio emission has been predicted as a possible outcome of a planetary system around a white dwarf. We searched for 3 GHz radio continuum emission in 846,000 candidate white dwarfs previously identified in Gaia using the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) Epoch 1 Quick Look Catalogue. We identified 13 candidate white dwarfs with a counterpart in VLASS within 2". Five of those were found not to be white dwarfs in follow-up or archival spectroscopy, whereas seven others were found to be chance alignments with a background source in higher-resolution optical or radio images. The remaining source, WDJ204259.71+152108.06, is found to be a white dwarf and M-dwarf binary with an orbital period of 4.1 days and long-term stochastic optical variability, as well as luminous radio and X-ray emission. For this binary, we find no direct evidence of a background contaminant, and a chance alignment probability of only ~2 per cent. However, other evidence points to the possibility of an unfortunate chance alignment with a background radio and X-ray emitting quasar, including an unusually poor Gaia DR3 astrometric solution for this source. With at most one possible radio emitting white dwarf found, we conclude that strong (&gt; 1-3 mJy) radio emission from white dwarfs in the 3 GHz band is virtually nonexistent outside of interacting binaries.</description>

      <title>pAGN: the one-stop solution for AGN disc modeling</title>

Abstract: Models of accretion discs surrounding active galactic nuclei (AGNs) find vast applications in high-energy astrophysics. The broad strategy is to parametrize some of the key disc properties such as gas density and temperature as a function of the radial coordinate from a given set of assumptions on the underlying physics. Two of the most popular approaches in this context were presented by Sirko &amp; Goodman (2003) and Thompson et al. (2005). We present a critical reanalysis of these widely used models, detailing their assumptions and clarifying some steps in their derivation that were previously left unsaid. Our findings are implemented in the pAGN module for the Python programming language, which is the first public implementation of these accretion-disc models. We further apply pAGN to the evolution of stellar-mass black holes embedded in AGN discs, addressing the potential occurrence of migration traps.</description>

      <title>Gaia's binary star renaissance</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.12146v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Stellar multiplicity is among the oldest and richest problems in astrophysics. Binary stars are a cornerstone of stellar mass and radius measurements that underpin modern stellar evolutionary models. Binaries are the progenitors of many of the most interesting and exotic astrophysical phenomena, ranging from type Ia supernovae to gamma ray bursts, hypervelocity stars, and most detectable stellar black holes. They are also ubiquitous, accounting for about half of all stars in the Universe. In the era of gravitational waves, wide-field surveys, and open-source stellar models, binaries are coming back stronger than a nineties trend. Much of the progress in the last decade has been enabled by the Gaia mission, which provides high-precision astrometry for more than a billion stars in the Milky Way. The Gaia data probe a wider range of binary separations and mass ratios than most previous surveys, enabling both an improved binary population census and discovery of rare objects. I summarize recent results in the study of binary stars brought about by Gaia, focusing in particular on developments related to wide ($a \gtrsim 100$ au) binaries, evidence of binarity from astrometric noise and proper motion anomaly, astrometric and radial velocity orbits from Gaia DR3, and binaries containing non-accreting compact objects. Limitations of the Gaia data, the importance of ground-based follow-up, and anticipated improvements with Gaia DR4 are also discussed.</description>

      <title>Confronting Dark Matter Capture Rate with Continuous Gravitational Wave Probe of Local Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15038</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15038v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Continuous gravitational waves (CGWs) from various astrophysical sources are one of the many future probes of upcoming Gravitational Wave (GW) search missions. Neutron stars (NSs) with deformity are one of the leading sources of CGW emissions. In this work, for the first time, a novel attempt to estimate the dark matter (DM) capture rate is performed using CGW as the probe to the local NS population. Competitive bounds on DM capture from the local NS population are reported when compared with DM direct search experiments and other astrophysical observations.</description>
