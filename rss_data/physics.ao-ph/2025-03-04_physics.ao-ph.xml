      <title>Estimating All-Net Radiation using routine Meteorological data in Akure, Nigeria</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00026v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Earth's net radiation, sometimes referred to as net flux, is the balance between incoming and outgoing solar radiation energy from the atmosphere. This study utilised five years of data on tropospheric variables (solar radiation, air temperature, surface temperature, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and dew point temperature), from January 2007 to December 2011 to estimate net radiation and examine its temporal (diurnal) and daily variation. The measurement site is the old site of the Nigerian Television Authority, NTA Akure at Iju (7.15oN, 5.12oE), in Akure North Local Government area of Ondo State. The results indicate that the net radiation exhibits a radiant energy surplus during the daytime and a deficit at nighttime. The daily mean maximum of the hourly net radiation flux was about 550 Wm-2 for the dry season. The value occurred around 12:00 hrs and 380 Wm-2 for the wet season, the value occurring around 12:30 hrs. We observed a time lag between net radiation and temperature; the net radiative flux reached its maximum at 12:00 hrs while the temperature attained its peak value around 15:00 hrs. Daily averages of net radiation exhibited dual peaks with values of about 160 Wm-2day-1 around February and November and a minimum of about 50 Wm-2day-1. The daily average temperature has a singular peak in February, the hottest month. We also analysed daily net radiation values from 10 models that differ in structure and complexity, and a lot of them underestimated the standard model because they were location-dependent.</description>

      <title>Investigating the contribution of terrain-following coordinates and conservation schemes in AI-driven precipitation forecasts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) weather prediction (AIWP) models often produce ``blurry'' precipitation forecasts that overestimate drizzle and underestimate extremes. This study provides a novel solution to tackle this problem -- integrating terrain-following coordinates with global mass and energy conservation schemes into AIWP models. Forecast experiments are conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this solution using FuXi, an example AIWP model, adapted to 1.0$^\circ$ grid spacing data. Verification results show large performance gains. The conservation schemes are found to reduce drizzle bias, whereas using terrain-following coordinates improves the estimation of extreme events and precipitation intensity spectra. Furthermore, a case study reveals that terrain-following coordinates capture near-surface winds better over mountains, offering AIWP models more accurate information on understanding the dynamics of precipitation processes. The proposed solution of this study can benefit a wide range of AIWP models and bring insights into how atmospheric domain knowledge can support the development of AIWP models.</description>

      <title>ML-Physical Fusion Models Are Accelerating the Paradigm Shift in Operational Typhoon Forecasting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00424</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.00424v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this study, we develop a hybrid operational typhoon forecasting model that integrates the FuXi machine-learning (ML) model with the physics-based Shanghai Typhoon Model (SHTM) into a dual physics-data-driven framework. By employing spectral nudging, the hybrid model named FuXi-SHTM leverages FuXi's robust large-scale forecasting capabilities alongside SHTM's mesoscale strengths, significantly enhancing track, intensity, and precipitation predictions for super typhoons Yagi (2024) and Krathon (2024). Besides, this study aims to identify the sensitive regions for the hybrid model by using Conditional Nonlinear Optimal Perturbation (CNOP) method. Despite being constrained by FuXi's large-scale forecast fields, the dense assimilation of satellite observations within these sensitive regions can further enhance typhoon forecasts. Besides, this study offers key insights into the emerging paradigms that are set to shape the future development of both machine learning and physics-based modeling approaches.</description>

      <title>Gulf Stream drives Kuroshio behind the recent abnormal ocean warming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The abnormal ocean warming has manifested in coherent sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies over the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes in recent years. However, the causality remains poorly understood behind inter-basin interactions between the North Pacific and North Atlantic. Here we show that SST variability in the Gulf Stream region drives the internal SST variability in the Kuroshio region in climate model simulations, but the opposite does not hold. Anomalous SSTs in the Gulf Stream induce wind anomalies in the North Pacific, associated with the Northern Annular Mode (NAM), and facilitate oceanic Rossby wave adjustments in the Kuroshio Extension. Additionally, state-of-the-art climate models with high spatial resolution oceans capture the ``North Atlantic SST-NAM coupling'' better than models with coarse resolution oceans. These findings highlight the critical role of internal North Atlantic variability as a pacemaker of mid-latitude climate, contributing to the recent abnormal ocean warming in the Northern Hemisphere.</description>

      <title>Fire danger likely overestimated in future climate projections</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01818v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) is widely used to assess wildfire danger and relies on meteorological data at local noon. However, climate models often provide only daily aggregated data, which poses a challenge for accurate FWI calculations in climate change studies. Here, we examine how using daily approximations for FWI95d -- the annual count of extreme fire weather days exceeding the 95th percentile of local daily FWI values -- compares to the standard noon-based approach for the period 1980--2023.
  Our findings reveal that FWI95d calculated with noon-specific data increased globally by approximately 65\%, corresponding to 11.66 additional extreme fire weather days over 44 years. In contrast, daily approximations tend to overestimate these trends by 5--10\%, with combinations involving minimum relative humidity showing the largest divergences. Globally, up to 15 million km$^2$, particularly in the western United States, southern Africa, and parts of Asia, exhibit significant overestimations. Among our daily approximation methods, the least biased proxy is the one that uses daily mean data for all variables.
  We recommend (i) prioritizing the inclusion of sub-daily meteorological data in future climate model intercomparison projects to enhance FWI accuracy, and (ii) adopting daily mean approximations as the least-biased alternative if noon-specific data are unavailable.</description>

      <title>Entropic learning enables skilful forecasts of ENSO phase at up to two years lead time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01412</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.01412v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper builds on previous work in applying the entropy-optimal Sparse Probabilistic Approximation (eSPA) machine learning algorithm to the task of classifying the phase of ENSO, as determined by the Ni\~no3.4 index (Groom et al., Artif. Intell. Earth Syst., 2024). In this study, only observations and reanalyses from the satellite era are employed when training and validating the entropic learning models, and a full set of hindcasts are performed over the period from 2012 to 2022 (with a maximum lead time of 24 months) in order to determine out-of-sample skill. The features used for prediction are the leading principal components from a delay-embedded EOF analysis of global sea surface temperature, the vertical derivative of temperature at the equator in the tropical Pacific (a proxy for thermocline variability) and the zonal and meridional wind stresses in the tropical Pacific. Despite the limited number of data instances available for training (ranging from 350 monthly averages for the earliest hindcast to 520 as of December 2024), eSPA is shown to avoid overfitting in this small data regime and produces probabilistic forecasts with comparable skill to the combined (model-based) probabilistic forecasts produced from the International Research Institute for Climate and Society (IRI) ENSO prediction plume. At lead times longer than those available from the IRI plume, eSPA maintains skill out to 23 months in terms of the ranked probability skill score and 24 months in terms of the area under the ROC curve, all at a small fraction of the computational cost of running a dynamical ensemble prediction system. Furthermore, eSPA is shown to successfully forecast the 2015/16 and 2018/19 El Ni\~no events at 24 months lead time, the 2016/17, 2017/18 and 2020/21 La Ni\~na events at 24 months lead time and the 2021/22 and 2022/23 La Ni\~na events at 12 and 9 months lead time.</description>
