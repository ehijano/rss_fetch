      <title>Interpreting the suction stress profiles under steady-state conditions considering the independence of van Genuchten SWCC parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04333</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04333v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Suction stress is a fundamental component for applying the effective stress principle in unsaturated geotechnical engineering problems. The present paper aims to understand how the suction stress profiles get influenced if the $m$ and $n$ parameter of the van-Genuchten SWCC model is completely independent. Through the analysis, it is well noted that for constant air entry value, if the $m$ and $n$ relationships are varied, not only the number and the spread of the characteristic regimes get influenced, but the nature and the trend of the suction stress profiles associated with the regimes also alter significantly. A suggestion of selecting the m and n relationships is proposed for obtaining conservative solutions for geotechnical stability problems. The relevance of considering the unconstrained m parameter is established by computing the tensile crack depth of the clayey slope under steady-state infiltration conditions.</description>

      <title>Single replica spin-glass phase detection using field variation and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04567</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04567v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model used the replica symmetry method to find the phase transition of the system. In 1979-1980, Parisi proposed a solution based on replica symmetry breaking (RSB), which allowed him to identify the underlying phases of complex systems such as spin-glasses. Regardless of the method used for detection, the intrinsic phase of a system exists whether or not replicas are considered. We introduce a single replica method of spin-glass phase detection using the field's variation experienced by each spin in a system configuration. This method focuses on a single replica with quenched random couplings. Each spin inevitably observes a different field from the others. Our results show that the mean and variance of fields named "Spontaneous Configurational Field" experienced by spins are suitable indicators to explore different ferromagnetic, paramagnetic, and mixed phases. To classify different phases of the system with defined indicators we have developed an algorithm based on machine learning to analyze the desired samples.</description>

      <title>A novel splitting strategy to accelerate solving generalized eigenvalue problem from Kohn--Sham density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04661</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04661v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel eigenpair-splitting method, inspired by the divide-and-conquer strategy, for solving the generalized eigenvalue problem arising from the Kohn-Sham equation. Unlike the commonly used domain decomposition approach in divide-and-conquer, which solves the problem on a series of subdomains, our eigenpair-splitting method focuses on solving a series of subequations defined on the entire domain. This method is realized through the integration of two key techniques: a multi-mesh technique for generating approximate spaces for the subequations, and a soft-locking technique that allows for the independent solution of eigenpairs. Numerical experiments show that the proposed eigenpair-splitting method can dramatically enhance simulation efficiency, and its potential towards practical applications is also demonstrated well through an example of the HOMO-LUMO gap calculation. Furthermore, the optimal strategy for grouping eigenpairs is discussed, and the possible improvements to the proposed method are also outlined.</description>

      <title>A high-order accurate moving mesh finite element method for the radial Kohn--Sham equation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a highly accurate and efficient numerical solver for the radial Kohn--Sham equation. The equation is discretized using a high-order finite element method, with its performance further improved by incorporating a parameter-free moving mesh technique. This approach greatly reduces the number of elements required to achieve the desired precision. In practice, the mesh redistribution involves no more than three steps, ensuring the algorithm remains computationally efficient. Remarkably, with a maximum of $13$ elements, we successfully reproduce the NIST database results for elements with atomic numbers ranging from $1$ to $92$.</description>

      <title>Insight into the effect of force error on the thermal conductivity from machine-learned potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04769</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04769v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Machine-learned potentials (MLPs) have been extensively used to obtain the lattice thermal conductivity via atomistic simulations. However, the impact of force errors in various MLPs on thermal transport has not been widely recognized and remains to be fully understood. Here, we employ MLP-driven molecular dynamics (MD) and anharmonic lattice dynamics (LD) to systematically investigate how the calculated thermal conductivity varies with the force errors, using boron arsenide as a prototypical material. We consistently observe an underestimation of thermal conductivity in MD simulations with three different MLPs including the neuroevolution potential, deep potential, and moment tensor potential. We provide a robust extrapolation scheme based on controlled force noises via the Langevin thermostat to correct this underestimation. The corrected results achieve a good agreement with previous experimental measurement from 200 K to 600 K. In contrast, the thermal conductivity values from LD calculations with MLPs readily align with the experimental data, which is attributed to the much smaller effects of the force errors on the force-constant calculations.</description>

      <title>Towards Real Time Compton Imaging in Demanding Conditions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04785</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04785v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Compton cameras are radiation detectors that provide spatial information on the origin of the {\gamma}-ray sources based on the Compton scattering effect. Many applications require these detectors to be used at high counting rate. As such, the preprocessing of the detections as well as the imaging algorithms are required to be time-efficient in order for the data to be processed in real time. In this work, optimizations to the preprocessing of events in Compton cameras based on monolithic crystals, with special focus on event identification, were implemented using a parallelizable algorithm. Regarding imaging, an established 3D back projection algorithm was parallelized and implemented using SYCL. The parallel implementation of the algorithm was included without and with several optimizations such as the pre-computing values, discarding low impact contributions based on angle, and selecting an efficient shape of the image universe. The implementations were tested with Intel CPUs, GPUs, and NVIDIA GPUs. An outlook into the study of algorithms to reconstruct the position of interaction within Compton cameras based on monolithic crystals into segmented regions and other next steps is included.</description>

      <title>Quantum-Centric Study of Methylene Singlet and Triplet States</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04827</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04827v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study explores the electronic structure of the CH$_2$ molecule, modeled as a (6e, 23o) system using a 52-qubit quantum experiment, which is relevant for interstellar and combustion chemistry. We focused on calculating the dissociation energies for CH$_2$ in the ground state triplet and the first excited state singlet, applying the Sample-based Quantum Diagonalization (SQD) method within a quantum-centric supercomputing framework. We evaluated the ability of SQD to provide accurate results compared to Selected Configuration Interaction (SCI) calculations and experimental values for the singlet-triplet gap. To our knowledge, this is the first study of an open-shell system, such as the CH$_2$ triplet, using SQD. To obtain accurate energy values, we implemented post-SQD orbital optimization and employed a warm-start approach using previously converged states. While the results for the singlet state dissociation were only a few milli-Hartrees from the SCI reference values, the triplet state exhibited greater variability. This discrepancy likely arises from differences in bit-string handling within the SQD method for open- versus closed-shell systems, as well as the inherently complex wavefunction character of the triplet state. The SQD-calculated singlet-triplet energy gap matched well with experimental and SCI values. This study enhances our understanding of the SQD method for open-shell systems and lays the groundwork for future applications in large-scale electronic structure studies using quantum algorithms.</description>

      <title>Fluid flow inside slit-shaped nanopores: the role of surface morphology at the molecular scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.04882v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations of fluid flow have highlighted the peculiarities of nanoscale flows compared to classical fluid mechanics. In particular, boundary conditions can deviate from the no-slip behavior at macroscopic scales due to various factors. In this context, we investigate the influence of surface morphology in slit-shaped nanopores on the fluid flow. We demonstrate that the surface morphology effectively controls the slip length, which approaches zero when the molecular structures of the pore wall and the fluid are matched. Using boundary-driven, energy-conserving NEMD simulations with a pump-like driving mechanism, we examine two types of pore walls--mimicking a crystalline and an amorphous material--that exhibit markedly different surface resistances to flow. The resulting flow velocity profiles are consistent with Hagen-Poiseuille theory for incompressible, Newtonian fluids when adjusted for surface slip. For the two pores, we observe partial slip and no-slip behavior, respectively, which correlate with fluid layering and depletion near the surfaces. However, the confinement of the fluid gives rise to an effective viscosity that varies substantially with the pore width. Analysis of the hydrodynamic permeability shows that the simulated flows are in the Darcy regime. Additionally, the thermal isolation of the flow causes a linear increase in fluid temperature along the flow, which we relate to strong viscous dissipation and heat convection, utilizing conservation laws of fluid mechanics. Our findings underscore the need for molecular-scale modeling to accurately capture the fluid dynamics near boundaries and in nanoporous materials, where macroscopic models may not be applicable.</description>

      <title>On the Robustness of Machine Learning Models in Predicting Thermodynamic Properties: a Case of Searching for New Quasicrystal Approximants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2410.13873v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Despite an artificial intelligence-assisted modeling of disordered crystals is a widely used and well-tried method of new materials design, the issues of its robustness, reliability, and stability are still not resolved and even not discussed enough. To highlight it, in this work we composed a series of nested intermetallic approximants of quasicrystals datasets and trained various machine learning models on them correspondingly. Our qualitative and, what is more important, quantitative assessment of the difference in the predictions clearly shows that different reasonable changes in the training sample can lead to the completely different set of the predicted potentially new materials. We also showed the advantage of pre-training and proposed a simple yet effective trick of sequential training to increase stability.</description>

      <title>On the rotational invariance and hyperbolicity of shallow water moment equations in two dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.07202</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.07202v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the two-dimensional extension of a recently introduced set of shallow water models based on a regularized moment expansion of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations \cite{kowalski2017moment,koellermeier2020analysis}. We show the rotational invariance of the proposed moment models with two different approaches. The first proof involves the split of the coefficient matrix into the conservative and non-conservative parts and proves the rotational invariance for each part, while the second one relies on the special block structure of the coefficient matrices. With the aid of rotational invariance, the analysis of the hyperbolicity for the moment model in 2D is reduced to the real diagonalizability of the coefficient matrix in 1D. Then we analyze the real diagonalizability by deriving the analytical form of the characteristic polynomial. We find that the moment model in 2D is hyperbolic in most cases and weakly hyperbolic in a degenerate edge case. With a simple modification to the coefficient matrices, we fix this weakly hyperbolicity and propose a new global hyperbolic model. Furthermore, we extend the model to include a more general class of closure relations than the original model and establish that this set of general closure relations retains both rotational invariance and hyperbolicity.</description>

      <title>Mortar Thin Shell Approximation for Analysis of Superconducting Accelerator Magnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01076v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Thin layers can lead to unfavorable meshes in a finite element (FE) analysis. Thin shell approximations (TSAs) avoid this issue by removing the need for a mesh of the thin layer while approximating the physics across the layer by an interface condition. Typically, a TSA requires the mesh of both sides of the TSA interface to be conforming. To alleviate this requirement, we propose to combine mortar methods and TSAs for solving the heat equation. The mortar TSA method's formulation is derived and enables an independent discretization of the subdomains on the two sides of the TSA depending on their accuracy requirements. The method is verified by comparison with a reference FE solution of a thermal model problem of a simplified superconducting accelerator magnet.</description>

      <title>Convergence study of multi-field singular value decomposition for turbulence fields</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03739v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Convergence of a matrix decomposition technique, the multi-field singular value decomposition (MFSVD) which efficiently analyzes nonlinear correlations by simultaneously decomposing multiple fields, is investigated. Toward applications in turbulence studies, we demonstrate that SVD for an artificial matrix with multi-scale structures reproduces the power-law-like distribution in the singular value spectrum with several orthogonal modes. Then, MFSVD is applied to practical turbulence field data produced by numerical simulations. It is clarified that relative errors in the reproduction of quadratic nonlinear quantities in multi-field turbulence converge remarkably faster than the single-field case, which requires thousands of modes to converge.</description>
