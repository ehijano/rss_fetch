      <title>The curvature exponent of sub-Finsler Heisenberg groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14619v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The curvature exponent $N_{\mathrm{curv}}$ of a metric measure space is the smallest number $N$ for which the measure contraction property $\mathsf{MCP}(0,N)$ holds. In this paper, we study the curvature exponent of sub-Finsler Heisenberg groups equipped with the Lebesgue measure. We prove that $N_{\mathrm{curv}} \geq 5$, and the equality holds if and only if the corresponding sub-Finsler Heisenberg group is actually sub-Riemannian. Furthermore, we show that for every $N\geq 5$, there is a sub-Finsler structure on the Heisenberg group such that $N_{\mathrm{curv}}=N$.</description>

      <title>From sphere packing to Fourier interpolation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Viazovska's solution of the sphere packing problem in eight dimensions is based on a remarkable construction of certain special functions using modular forms. Great mathematics has consequences far beyond the problems that originally inspired it, and Viazovska's work is no exception. In this article, we'll examine how it has led to new interpolation theorems in Fourier analysis, specifically a theorem of Radchenko and Viazovska.</description>

      <title>The connectivity of Vietoris-Rips complexes of spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15818</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15818v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We survey what is known and unknown about Vietoris-Rips complexes and thickenings of spheres. Afterwards, we show how to control the homotopy connectivity of Vietoris-Rips complexes of spheres in terms of coverings of spheres and projective spaces. Let $S^n$ be the $n$-sphere with the geodesic metric, and of diameter $\pi$, and let $\delta &gt; 0$. Suppose that the first nontrivial homotopy group of the Vietoris-Rips complex $\mathrm{VR}(S^n;\pi-\delta)$ of the $n$-sphere at scale $\pi-\delta$ occurs in dimension $k$, i.e., suppose that the connectivity is $k-1$. Then $\mathrm{cov}_{S^n}(2k+2) \le \delta &lt; 2\cdot \mathrm{cov}_{\mathbb{R}P^n}(k)$. In other words, there exist $2k+2$ balls of radius $\delta$ that cover $S^n$, and no set of $k$ balls of radius $\frac{\delta}{2}$ cover the projective space $\mathbb{R}P^n$. As a corollary, the homotopy type of $\mathrm{VR}(S^n;r)$ changes infinitely many times as the scale $r$ increases.</description>

      <title>Lattice Reduced and Complete Convex Bodies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.09429</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.09429v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The purpose of this paper is to study convex bodies $C$ for which there exists no convex body $C^\prime\subsetneq C$ of the same lattice width. Such bodies shall be called ``lattice reduced'', and they occur naturally in the study of the flatness constant in integer programming, as well as other problems related to lattice width. We show that any simplex that realizes the flatness constant must be lattice reduced and prove structural properties of general lattice reduced convex bodies: they are polytopes with at most $2^{d+1}-2$ vertices and their lattice width is attained by at least $\Omega(\log d)$ independent directions. Strongly related to lattice reduced bodies are the ``lattice complete bodies'', which are convex bodies $C$ for which there exists no $C^\prime\supsetneq C$ such that $C^\prime$ has the same lattice diameter as $C$. Similar structural results are obtained for lattice complete bodies. Moreover, various construction methods for lattice reduced and complete convex bodies are presented.</description>

      <title>Spherical volume and spherical Plateau problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.10636</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.10636v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a closed oriented manifold or more generally a group homology class, we introduce the spherical Plateau problem, which is a variational problem corresponding to a topological invariant called the spherical volume. In principle, its solutions should be realized by minimal surfaces in quotients of spheres. We explain that in many geometrically interesting cases, those solutions are essentially unique. We start with a review of the Ambrosio-Kirchheim theory of metric currents, and the barycenter map method developed by Besson-Courtois-Gallot. Then, we outline the following applications: (1) the intrinsic uniqueness of spherical Plateau solutions for negatively curved, locally symmetric, closed oriented manifolds, (2) the intrinsic uniqueness of spherical Plateau solutions for all 3-dimensional closed oriented manifolds, (3) the construction of higher-dimensional analogues of hyperbolic Dehn fillings. We also propose some open questions.</description>

      <title>Augmentations of Forman's Ricci Curvature and their Applications in Community Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.06474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.06474v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The notion of curvature on graphs has recently gained traction in the networks community, with the Ollivier-Ricci curvature (ORC) in particular being used for several tasks in network analysis, such as community detection. In this work, we choose a different approach and study augmentations of the discretization of the Ricci curvature proposed by Forman (AFRC). We empirically and theoretically investigate its relation to the ORC and the un-augmented Forman-Ricci curvature. In particular, we provide evidence that the AFRC frequently gives sufficient insight into the structure of a network to be used for community detection, and therefore provides a computationally cheaper alternative to previous ORC-based methods. Our novel AFRC-based community detection algorithm is competitive with an ORC-based approach.</description>

      <title>Robust Signal Recovery in Hadamard Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.06057</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.06057v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the stability of (strong) laws of large numbers in Hadamard spaces with respect to distributional perturbations. For the inductive means of a sequence of independent, but not necessarily identically distributed random variables, we provide a concentration inequality in quadratic mean, as well as a strong law of large numbers, generalizing a classical result of K.-T. Sturm. For the Fr\'echet mean, we generalize H. Ziezold's law of large numbers in Hadamard spaces. In this case, we neither require our data to be independent, nor identically distributed; reasonably mild conditions on the first two moments of our sample are enough. Additionally, we look at data contamination via a model inspired by Huber's $\varepsilon$-contamination model, in which we replace a random portion of the data with noise. In the most general setup, we do neither require the data, nor the noise to be i.i.d., nor do we require the noise to be independent of the data. To analyze the stability of the (non-symmetric) inductive mean with respect to data loss, data permutation, and noise, a resampling scheme is introduced, and sufficient conditions for its convergence are provided. These results suggest that means in Hadamard spaces are as robust as in Euclidean spaces. This is underlined by a small simulation study, in which we compare the robustness of means on the manifold of positive definite matrices, with means on open books.</description>

      <title>Accessibility, planar graphs, and quasi-isometries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.15242v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We prove that a connected, locally finite, quasi-transitive graph which is quasi-isometric to a planar graph is necessarily accessible. This leads to a complete classification of the finitely generated groups which are quasi-isometric to planar graphs. In particular, such a group is virtually a free product of free and surface groups, and thus virtually admits a planar Cayley graph.</description>
