      <title>Detection of circular permutations by Protein Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15087</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15087v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Circular permutation in proteins is a phenomenon with significant implications in the study of protein evolution and functionality. The detection of such permutations is traditionally reliant on structural alignment methods, which, while accurate, are computationally intensive and require known three-dimensional structures. The circular permutation detection method based on sequence dependencies may be faster, but it may sacrifice some accuracy, especially for structures with low sequence similarity. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel protein language model, the plmCP, designed to detect circular permutations directly from amino acid sequences. The protein language model can help us extract structural information from sequences. Utilizing advanced embedding techniques, our model infers structural information from the linear sequence data, enabling the identification of permuted proteins with a high degree of accuracy. In case study, this model has a good result compared with traditional structural alignment methods in speed and accessibility, requiring only amino acid sequences to deliver results comparable to established techniques. In conclusion, our protein language model presents a promising tool for the efficient and accessible detection of circular permutations in proteins, with the potential to facilitate advancements in the understanding of protein evolution and engineering.

      <title>DeeperHistReg: Robust Whole Slide Images Registration Framework</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14434</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14434v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: DeeperHistReg is a software framework dedicated to registering whole slide images (WSIs) acquired using multiple stains. It allows one to perform the preprocessing, initial alignment, and nonrigid registration of WSIs acquired using multiple stains (e.g. hematoxylin \&amp; eosin, immunochemistry). The framework implements several state-of-the-art registration algorithms and provides an interface to operate on arbitrary resolution of the WSIs (up to 200k x 200k). The framework is extensible and new algorithms can be easily integrated by other researchers. The framework is available both as a PyPI package and as a Docker container.</description>

      <title>Quenching of stable pulses in slow-fast excitable media</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop linear theory for the prediction of excitation wave quenching--the construction of minimal perturbations which return stable excitations to quiescence--for localized pulse solutions of models of excitable media. The theory requires accounting for an additional degree of freedom in the formulation of the linear theory, and a reconsideration of heuristics for choosing optimal reference states from their group representation. We compare the predictions made with the linear theory to direct numerical simulations across a family of perturbations and assess the accuracy of predictions for models with distinct stable excitation structures. We find that the theory achieves qualitative predictive power with only the effort of distinguishing a root from the asymptotic case, and achieves quantitative predictive power in many circumstances. Finally, we compare the computational cost of our prediction technique to other numerical methods for the determination of transitions in extended excitable systems.</description>

      <title>A novel mathematical model for predicting the benefits of physical activity on type 2 diabetes progression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.14915v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the well-acknowledged benefits of physical activity for type 2 diabetes (T2D) prevention, the literature surprisingly lacks validated models able to predict the long-term benefits of exercise on T2D progression and support personalized risk prediction and prevention. To bridge this gap, we developed a novel mathematical model that formalizes the link between exercise and short- and long-term glucose-insulin dynamics to predict the benefits of regular exercise on T2D progression. The model quantitatively captured the dose-response relationship (larger benefits with increasing intensity and/or duration of exercise), it consistently reproduced the benefits of clinical guidelines for diabetes prevention, and it accurately predicted persistent benefits following interruption of physical activity, in line with real-world evidence from the literature. These results are encouraging and can be the basis for future development of decision support tools able to assist patients and clinicians in tailoring preventive lifestyle interventions.</description>

      <title>Improved Cryo-EM Pose Estimation and 3D Classification through Latent-Space Disentanglement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04956</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.04956v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Due to the extremely low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and unknown poses (projection angles and image shifts) in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) experiments, reconstructing 3D volumes from 2D images is very challenging. In addition to these challenges, heterogeneous cryo-EM reconstruction requires conformational classification. In popular cryo-EM reconstruction algorithms, poses and conformation classification labels must be predicted for every input cryo-EM image, which can be computationally costly for large datasets. An emerging class of methods adopted the amortized inference approach. In these methods, only a subset of the input dataset is needed to train neural networks for the estimation of poses and conformations. Once trained, these neural networks can make pose/conformation predictions and 3D reconstructions at low cost for the entire dataset during inference. Unfortunately, when facing heterogeneous reconstruction tasks, it is hard for current amortized-inference-based methods to effectively estimate the conformational distribution and poses from entangled latent variables. Here, we propose a self-supervised variational autoencoder architecture called "HetACUMN" based on amortized inference. We employed an auxiliary conditional pose prediction task by inverting the order of encoder-decoder to explicitly enforce the disentanglement of conformation and pose predictions. Results on simulated datasets show that HetACUMN generated more accurate conformational classifications than other amortized or non-amortized methods. Furthermore, we show that HetACUMN is capable of performing heterogeneous 3D reconstructions of a real experimental dataset.</description>
