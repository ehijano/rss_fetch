      <title>SyncVoice: Towards Video Dubbing with Vision-Augmented Pretrained TTS Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video dubbing aims to generate high-fidelity speech that is precisely temporally aligned with the visual content. Existing methods still suffer from limitations in speech naturalness and audio-visual synchronization, and are limited to monolingual settings. To address these challenges, we propose SyncVoice, a vision-augmented video dubbing framework built upon a pretrained text-to-speech (TTS) model. By fine-tuning the TTS model on audio-visual data, we achieve strong audiovisual consistency. We propose a Dual Speaker Encoder to effectively mitigate inter-language interference in cross-lingual speech synthesis and explore the application of video dubbing in video translation scenarios. Experimental results show that SyncVoice achieves high-fidelity speech generation with strong synchronization performance, demonstrating its potential in video dubbing tasks.</description>

      <title>EXR: An Interactive Immersive EHR Visualization in Extended Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05438</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05438v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper presents the design and implementation of an Extended Reality (XR) platform for immersive, interactive visualization of Electronic Health Records (EHRs). The system extends beyond conventional 2D interfaces by visualizing both structured and unstructured patient data into a shared 3D environment, enabling intuitive exploration and real-time collaboration. The modular infrastructure integrates FHIR-based EHR data with volumetric medical imaging and AI-generated segmentation, ensuring interoperability with modern healthcare systems. The platform's capabilities are demonstrated using synthetic EHR datasets and computed tomography (CT)-derived spine models processed through an AI-powered segmentation pipeline. This work suggests that such integrated XR solutions could form the foundation for next-generation clinical decision-support tools, where advanced data infrastructures are directly accessible in an interactive and spatially rich environment.</description>

      <title>ARGUS: Defending Against Multimodal Indirect Prompt Injection via Steering Instruction-Following Behavior</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.05745v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) are increasingly vulnerable to multimodal Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) attacks, which embed malicious instructions in images, videos, or audio to hijack model behavior. Existing defenses, designed primarily for text-only LLMs, are unsuitable for countering these multimodal threats, as they are easily bypassed, modality-dependent, or generalize poorly. Inspired by activation steering researches, we hypothesize that a robust, general defense independent of modality can be achieved by steering the model's behavior in the representation space. Through extensive experiments, we discover that the instruction-following behavior of MLLMs is encoded in a subspace. Steering along directions within this subspace can enforce adherence to user instructions, forming the basis of a defense. However, we also found that a naive defense direction could be coupled with a utility-degrading direction, and excessive intervention strength harms model performance. To address this, we propose ARGUS, which searches for an optimal defense direction within the safety subspace that decouples from the utility degradation direction, further combining adaptive strength steering to achieve a better safety-utility trade-off. ARGUS also introduces lightweight injection detection stage to activate the defense on-demand, and a post-filtering stage to verify defense success. Experimental results show that ARGUS can achieve robust defense against multimodal IPI while maximally preserving the MLLM's utility.</description>
