      <title>HODL Strategy or Fantasy? 480 Million Crypto Market Simulations and the Macro-Sentiment Effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02029v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Crypto enthusiasts claim that buying and holding crypto assets yields high returns, often citing Bitcoin's past performance to promote other tokens and fuel fear of missing out. However, understanding the real risk-return trade-off and what factors affect future crypto returns is crucial as crypto becomes increasingly accessible to retail investors through major brokerages. We examine the HODL strategy through two independent analyses. First, we implement 480 million Monte Carlo simulations across 378 non-stablecoin crypto assets, net of trading fees and the opportunity cost of 1-month Treasury bills, and find strong evidence of survivorship bias and extreme downside concentration. At the 2-3 year horizon, the median excess return is -28.4 percent, the 1 percent conditional value at risk indicates that tail scenarios wipe out principal after all costs, and only the top quartile achieves very large gains, with a mean excess return of 1,326.7 percent. These results challenge the HODL narrative: across a broad set of assets, simple buy-and-hold loads extreme downside risk onto most investors, and the miracles mostly belong to the luckiest quarter. Second, using a Bayesian multi-horizon local projection framework, we find that endogenous predictors based on realized risk-return metrics have economically negligible and unstable effects, while macro-finance factors, especially the 24-week exponential moving average of the Fear and Greed Index, display persistent long-horizon impacts and high cross-basket stability. Where significant, a one-standard-deviation sentiment shock reduces forward top-quartile mean excess returns by 15-22 percentage points and median returns by 6-10 percentage points over 1-3 year horizons, suggesting that macro-sentiment conditions, rather than realized return histories, are the dominant indicators for future outcomes.</description>

      <title>Statistical Arbitrage in Polish Equities Market Using Deep Learning Techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02037</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02037v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a systematic approach to a popular Statistical Arbitrage technique: Pairs Trading. Instead of relying on two highly correlated assets, we replace the second asset with a replication of the first using risk factor representations. These factors are obtained through Principal Components Analysis (PCA), exchange traded funds (ETFs), and, as our main contribution, Long Short Term Memory networks (LSTMs). Residuals between the main asset and its replication are examined for mean reversion properties, and trading signals are generated for sufficiently fast mean reverting portfolios.
  Beyond introducing a deep learning based replication method, we adapt the framework of Avellaneda and Lee (2008) to the Polish market. Accordingly, components of WIG20, mWIG40, and selected sector indices replace the original S&amp;P500 universe, and market parameters such as the risk free rate and transaction costs are updated to reflect local conditions.
  We outline the full strategy pipeline: risk factor construction, residual modeling via the Ornstein Uhlenbeck process, and signal generation. Each replication technique is described together with its practical implementation. Strategy performance is evaluated over two periods: 2017-2019 and the recessive year 2020.
  All methods yield profits in 2017-2019, with PCA achieving roughly 20 percent cumulative return and an annualized Sharpe ratio of up to 2.63. Despite multiple adaptations, our conclusions remain consistent with those of the original paper. During the COVID-19 recession, only the ETF based approach remains profitable (about 5 percent annual return), while PCA and LSTM methods underperform. LSTM results, although negative, are promising and indicate potential for future optimization.</description>

      <title>Visibility-Graph Asymmetry as a Structural Indicator of Volatility Clustering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.02352v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Volatility clustering is one of the most robust stylized facts of financial markets, yet it is typically detected using moment-based diagnostics or parametric models such as GARCH. This paper shows that clustered volatility also leaves a clear imprint on the time-reversal symmetry of horizontal visibility graphs (HVGs) constructed on absolute returns in physical time. For each time point, we compute the maximal forward and backward visibility distances, $L^{+}(t)$ and $L^{-}(t)$, and use their empirical distributions to build a visibility-asymmetry fingerprint comprising the Kolmogorov--Smirnov distance, variance difference, entropy difference, and a ratio of extreme visibility spans. In a Monte Carlo study, these HVG asymmetry features sharply separate volatility-clustered GARCH(1,1) dynamics from i.i.d.\ Gaussian noise and from randomly shuffled GARCH series that preserve the marginal distribution but destroy temporal dependence; a simple linear classifier based on the fingerprint achieves about 90\% in-sample accuracy. Applying the method to daily S\&amp;P500 data reveals a pronounced forward--backward imbalance, including a variance difference $\Delta\mathrm{Var}$ that exceeds the simulated GARCH values by two orders of magnitude and vanishes after shuffling. Overall, the visibility-graph asymmetry fingerprint emerges as a simple, model-free, and geometrically interpretable indicator of volatility clustering and time irreversibility in financial time series.</description>

      <title>Event-Time Anchor Selection for Multi-Contract Quoting</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05749</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.05749v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: When quoting across multiple contracts, the sequence of execution can be a key driver of implementation shortfall relative to the target spread~\cite{bergault2022multi}. We model the short-horizon execution risk from such quoting as variations in transaction prices between the initiation of the first leg and the completion of the position. Our quoting policy anchors the spread by designating one contract ex ante as a \emph{reference contract}. Reducing execution risk requires a predictive criterion for selecting that contract whose price is most stable over the execution interval. This paper develops a diagnostic framework for reference-contract selection that evaluates this stability by contrasting order-flow Hawkes forecasts with a Composite Liquidity Factor (CLF) of instantaneous limit order book (LOB) shape. We illustrate the framework on tick-by-tick data for a pair of NIFTY futures contracts. The results suggest that event-history and LOB-state signals offer complementary views of short-horizon execution risk for reference-contract selection.</description>

      <title>Coherent estimation of risk measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.05809v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop a statistical framework for risk estimation, inspired by the axiomatic theory of risk measures. Coherent risk estimators -- functionals of P&amp;L samples inheriting the economic properties of risk measures -- are defined and characterized through robust representations linked to $L$-estimators. The framework provides a canonical methodology for constructing estimators with sound financial and statistical properties, unifying risk measure theory, principles for capital adequacy, and practical statistical challenges in market risk. A numerical study illustrates the approach, focusing on expected shortfall estimation under both i.i.d. and overlapping samples relevant for regulatory FRTB model applications.</description>
