      <title>A priori bounds for certified Krawczyk homotopy tracking</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01355</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01355v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We establish the first complexity analysis for Krawczyk-based certified homotopy tracking. It consists of explicit a priori stepsize bounds ensuring the success of the Krawczyk test, and an iteration count bound proportional to the weighted length of the solution path. Our a priori bounds reduce the overhead of interval arithmetic, resulting in fewer iterations than previous methods. Experiments using a proof-of-concept implementation validate the results.</description>

      <title>Differentiable Weightless Controllers: Learning Logic Circuits for Continuous Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.01467v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate whether continuous-control policies can be represented and learned as discrete logic circuits instead of continuous neural networks. We introduce Differentiable Weightless Controllers (DWCs), a symbolic-differentiable architecture that maps real-valued observations to actions using thermometer-encoded inputs, sparsely connected boolean lookup-table layers, and lightweight action heads. DWCs can be trained end-to-end by gradient-based techniques, yet compile directly into FPGA-compatible circuits with few- or even single-clock-cycle latency and nanojoule-level energy cost per action. Across five MuJoCo benchmarks, including high-dimensional Humanoid, DWCs achieve returns competitive with weight-based policies (full precision or quantized neural networks), matching performance on four tasks and isolating network capacity as the key limiting factor on HalfCheetah. Furthermore, DWCs exhibit structurally sparse and interpretable connectivity patterns, enabling a direct inspection of which input thresholds influence control decisions.</description>

      <title>Faster Algorithms for Structured Matrix Multiplication via Flip Graph Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10786v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give explicit low-rank bilinear non-commutative schemes for multiplying structured $n \times n$ matrices with $2 \leq n \leq 5$, which serve as building blocks for recursive algorithms with improved multiplicative factors in asymptotic complexity. Our schemes are discovered over $\mathbb{F}_2$ or $\mathbb{F}_3$ and lifted to $\mathbb{Z}$ or $\mathbb{Q}$. Using a flip graph search over tensor decompositions, we derive schemes for general, upper-triangular, lower-triangular, symmetric, and skew-symmetric inputs, as well as products of a structured matrix with its transpose. These schemes improve asymptotic constants for 13 of 15 structured formats. In particular, we obtain $4 \times 4$ rank-34 schemes for both multiplying a general matrix by its transpose and an upper-triangular matrix by a general matrix, improving the asymptotic factor from 8/13 (0.615) to 22/37 (0.595). Additionally, using $\mathbb{F}_3$ flip graphs, we discover schemes over $\mathbb{Q}$ that fundamentally require the inverse of 2, including a $2 \times 2$ symmetric-symmetric multiplication of rank 5 and a $3 \times 3$ skew-symmetric-general multiplication of rank 14 (improving upon AlphaTensor's 15).</description>

      <title>Fast Matrix Multiplication via Ternary Meta Flip Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.20317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Matrix multiplication optimization remains a fundamental challenge in computational mathematics. This work introduces a novel approach that discovers matrix multiplication schemes whose coefficients are restricted to the set $\{-1, 0, 1\}$ (denoted $Z_T$), minimizing naive additive complexity for efficient hardware implementation. The core of the method is a GPU-accelerated meta flip graph algorithm that maintains ternary safety through specialized arithmetic operations and sign symmetry breaking. Key results include new best ranks for the formats $4 \times 5 \times 12$, $5 \times 6 \times 10$, and $6 \times 7 \times 9$, the independent discovery of 32 schemes in $Z_T$ that match known optimal ranks (including 8 previously known only with rational coefficients), and 30 rank improvements in the binary field. The analysis of 164 known schemes shows that 92 admit a ternary-coefficient implementation, while 72 could not be found under this constraint, defining the current boundaries of the approach. All software, results, and discovered schemes are provided as open-source.</description>

      <title>ANSR-DT: An Adaptive Neuro-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning Framework for Digital Twins</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.08561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.08561v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Neuro-Symbolic Learning and Reasoning Framework for digital twin technology called "ANSR-DT." Digital twins in industrial environments often struggle with interpretability, real-time adaptation, and human input integration. Our approach addresses these challenges by combining CNN-LSTM dynamic event detection with reinforcement learning and symbolic reasoning to enable adaptive intelligence with interpretable decision processes. This integration enhances environmental understanding while promoting continuous learning, leading to more effective real-time decision-making in human-machine collaborative applications. We evaluated ANSR-DT on synthetic industrial data, observing significant improvements over traditional approaches, with up to 99.5% accuracy for dynamic pattern recognition. The framework demonstrated superior adaptability with extended reinforcement learning training, improving explained variance from 0.447 to 0.547. Future work aims at scaling to larger datasets to test rule management beyond the current 14 rules. Our open-source implementation promotes reproducibility and establishes a foundation for future research in adaptive, interpretable digital twins for industrial applications.</description>

      <title>SpeechIQ: Speech-Agentic Intelligence Quotient Across Cognitive Levels in Voice Understanding by Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce Speech-based Intelligence Quotient (SIQ) as a new form of human cognition-inspired evaluation pipeline for voice understanding large language models, LLM Voice, designed to assess their voice understanding ability. Moving beyond popular voice understanding metrics such as word error rate (WER), SIQ examines LLM Voice across three cognitive levels motivated by Bloom's Taxonomy: (1) Remembering (i.e., WER for verbatim accuracy); (2) Understanding (i.e., similarity of LLM's interpretations); and (3) Application (i.e., QA accuracy for simulating downstream tasks). We demonstrate that SIQ not only quantifies voice understanding abilities but also provides unified comparisons between cascaded methods (e.g., ASR LLM) and end-to-end models, identifies annotation errors in existing benchmarks, and detects hallucinations in LLM Voice. Our framework represents a first-of-its-kind intelligence examination that bridges cognitive principles with voice-oriented benchmarks, while exposing overlooked challenges in multi-modal training. Our code and data will be open source to encourage future studies.</description>
