      <title>A Dense Neighborhood Lemma, with Applications to Domination and Chromatic Number</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02992v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In its Euclidean form, the Dense Neighborhood Lemma (DNL) asserts that if $V$ is a finite set of points of $\mathbb{R}^N$ such that for each $v \in V$ the ball $B(v,1)$ intersects $V$ on at least $\delta |V|$ points, then for every $\varepsilon &gt;0$, the points of $V$ can be covered with $f(\delta,\varepsilon)$ balls $B(v,1+\varepsilon)$ with $v \in V$. DNL also applies to other metric spaces and to abstract set systems, where elements are compared pairwise with respect to (near) disjointness. In its strongest form, DNL provides an $\varepsilon$-clustering with size exponential in $\varepsilon^{-1}$, which amounts to a Regularity Lemma with 0/1 densities of some trigraph.
  Trigraphs are graphs with additional red edges. For instance, in the Euclidean case the black edges would connect points at distance at most 1, and the red edges would connect points at distance between $1$ and $1+\varepsilon$. This paper is mainly a study of the generalization of Vapnik-Cervonenkis dimension to trigraphs. The main point is to show how trigraphs can sometimes explain the success of random sampling even though the VC-dimension of the underlying graph is unbounded. All the results presented here are effective in the sense of computation: they primarily rely on uniform sampling with the same success rate as in classical VC-dimension theory.
  Among some applications of DNL, we show that $\left(\frac{3t-8}{3t-5}+\varepsilon\right)\cdot n$-regular $K_t$-free graphs have bounded chromatic number. Similarly, triangle-free graphs with minimum degree $n/3-n^{1-\varepsilon}$ have bounded chromatic number (this does not hold with $n/3-n^{1-o(1)}$). For tournaments, DNL implies that the domination number is bounded in terms of the fractional chromatic number. Also, $(1/2-\varepsilon)$-majority digraphs have bounded domination, independently of the number of voters.</description>

      <title>Constant Rate Isometric Embeddings of Hamming Metric into Edit Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A function $\varphi: \{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}^N$ is called an isometric embedding of the $n$-dimensional Hamming metric space to the $N$-dimensional edit metric space if, for all $x, y \in \{0,1\}^n$, the Hamming distance between $x$ and $y$ is equal to the edit distance between $\varphi(x)$ and $\varphi(y)$. The rate of such an embedding is defined as the ratio $n/N$. It is well known in the literature how to construct isometric embeddings with a rate of $\Omega(\frac{1}{\log n})$. However, achieving even near-isometric embeddings with a positive constant rate has remained elusive until now.
  In this paper, we present an isometric embedding with a rate of 1/8 by discovering connections to synchronization strings, which were studied in the context of insertion-deletion codes (Haeupler-Shahrasbi [JACM'21]). At a technical level, we introduce a framework for obtaining high-rate isometric embeddings using a novel object called misaligners. As an immediate consequence of our constant rate isometric embedding, we improve known conditional lower bounds for various optimization problems in the edit metric, but now with optimal dependency on the dimension.
  We complement our results by showing that no isometric embedding $\varphi:\{0, 1\}^n \to \{0, 1\}^N$ can have rate greater than 15/32 for all positive integers $n$. En route to proving this upper bound, we uncover fundamental structural properties necessary for every Hamming-to-edit isometric embedding. We also prove similar upper and lower bounds for embeddings over larger alphabets.
  Finally, we consider embeddings $\varphi:\Sigma_{\text{in}}^n\to \Sigma_{\text{out}}^N$ between different input and output alphabets, where the rate is given by $\frac{n\log|\Sigma_{\text{in}}|}{N\log|\Sigma_{\text{out}}|}$. In this setting, we show that the rate can be made arbitrarily close to 1.</description>

      <title>Graph Attention for Heterogeneous Graphs with Positional Encoding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02938</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02938v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have emerged as the de facto standard for modeling graph data, with attention mechanisms and transformers significantly enhancing their performance on graph-based tasks. Despite these advancements, the performance of GNNs on heterogeneous graphs often remains complex, with networks generally underperforming compared to their homogeneous counterparts. This work benchmarks various GNN architectures to identify the most effective methods for heterogeneous graphs, with a particular focus on node classification and link prediction. Our findings reveal that graph attention networks excel in these tasks. As a main contribution, we explore enhancements to these attention networks by integrating positional encodings for node embeddings. This involves utilizing the full Laplacian spectrum to accurately capture both the relative and absolute positions of each node within the graph, further enhancing performance on downstream tasks such as node classification and link prediction.</description>

      <title>Vanishing of Schubert coefficients is in ${\sf AM}\cap {\sf coAM}$ assuming the GRH</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03004</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03004v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Schubert vanishing problem is a central decision problem in algebraic combinatorics and Schubert calculus, with applications to representation theory and enumerative algebraic geometry. The problem has been studied for over 50 years in different settings, with much progress given in the last two decades.
  We prove that the Schubert vanishing problem is in ${\sf AM}$ assuming the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis (GRH). This complements our earlier result in arXiv:2412.02064, that the problem is in ${\sf coAM}$ assuming the GRH. In particular, this implies that the Schubert vanishing problem is unlikely to be ${\sf coNP}$-hard, as we previously conjectured in arXiv:2412.02064.
  The proof is of independent interest as we formalize and expand the notion of a lifted formulation partly inspired by algebraic computations of Schubert problems, and extended formulations of linear programs. We use a result by Mahajan--Vinay to show that the determinant has a lifted formulation of polynomial size. We combine this with Purbhoo's algebraic criterion to derive the result.</description>

      <title>The Generalized Double Pouring Problem: Analysis, Bounds and Algorithms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03039v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a logical puzzle which we call double pouring problem, which was original defined for $k=3$ vessels. We generalize this definition to $k \ge 2 $ as follows. Each of the $k$ vessels contains an integer amount of water, called its value, where the values are $a_i$ for $i=1,2,\dots,k$ and the sum of values is $n$. A pouring step means pouring water from one vessel with value $a_i$ to another vessel with value $a_j$, where $ 1 \le i \not= j \le k $ and $a_i \le a_j $. After this pouring step the first vessel has value $2a_i$ and the second one value $a_j-a_i$. Now the pouring problem is to find as few pourings steps as possible to empty at least one vessel, or to show that such an emptying is not possible (which is possible only in the case $k=2$).
  For $k=2$ each pouring step is unique. We give a necessary and sufficient condition, when for a given $ (a_1,a_2)$ with $a_1+a_2=n$ the pouring problem is solvable. For $k=3$ we improve the upper bound of the pouring problem for some special cases. For $k \ge 4 $ we extend the known lower bound for $k=3$ and improve the known upper bound $\mathcal{O}((\log n)^2)$ for $k=3$ to $\mathcal{O}(\log n\log\log n)$. Finally, for $k \ge 3$, we investigate values and bounds for some functions related to the pouring problem.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.03090v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We construct constant-sized ensembles of linear error-correcting codes over any fixed alphabet that can correct a given fraction of adversarial erasures at rates approaching the Singleton bound arbitrarily closely. We provide several applications of our results:
  1. Explicit constructions of strong linear seeded symbol-fixing extractors and lossless condensers, over any fixed alphabet, with only a constant seed length and optimal output lengths;
  2. A strongly explicit construction of erasure codes on bipartite graphs (more generally, linear codes on matrices of arbitrary dimensions) with optimal rate and erasure-correction trade-offs;
  3. A strongly explicit construction of erasure codes on non-bipartite graphs (more generally, linear codes on symmetric square matrices) achieving improved rates;
  4. A strongly explicit construction of linear nearly-MDS codes over constant-sized alphabets that can be encoded and decoded in quasi-linear time.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Unique-Neighbor Codes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.10330</link>
      <description>arXiv:2203.10330v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recall that a binary linear code of length $n$ is a linear subspace $\mathcal{C} = \{x\in\mathbb{F}_2^n\mid Ax=0\}$. Here the parity check matrix $A$ is a binary $m\times n$ matrix of rank $m$. We say that $\mathcal{C}$ has rate $R=1-\frac mn$. Its distance, denoted $\delta n$ is the smallest Hamming weight of a non-zero vector in $\mathcal{C}$. The rate vs.\ distance problem for binary linear codes is a fundamental open problem in coding theory, and a fascinating question in discrete mathematics. It concerns the function $R_L(\delta)$, the largest possible rate $R$ for given $0\le\delta\le1$ and arbitrarily large length $n$. Here we investigate a variation of this fundamental question that we describe next.
  Clearly, $\mathcal{C}$ has distance $\delta n$, if and only if for every $0&lt;n'&lt;\delta n$, every $m\times n'$ submatrix of $A$ has a row of odd weight. Motivated by several problems from coding theory, we say that $A$ has the unique-neighbor property with parameter $\delta n$, if every such submatrix has a row of weight $1$. Let $R_U(\delta)$ be the largest possible asymptotic rate of linear codes with a parity check matrix that has this stronger property. Clearly, $R_U(\cdot),R_L(\cdot)$ are non-increasing functions, and $R_U(\delta)\le R_L(\delta)$ for all $\delta$. Also, $R_U(0)=R_L(0)=1$, and $R_U(1)=R_L(1)=0$, so let $0\le\delta_U \le\delta_L\le1$ be the smallest values of $\delta$ at which $R_U$ resp.\ $R_L$ vanish. It is well known that $\delta_L=\frac12$ and we conjecture that $\delta_U$ is strictly smaller than $\frac12$, i.e., the rate of linear codes with the unique-neighbor property is more strictly bounded. While the conjecture remains open, we prove here several results supporting it.
  The reader is not assumed to have any specific background in coding theory, but we occasionally point out some relevant facts from that area.</description>

      <title>Odd coloring of 2-boundary planar graphs and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.09317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2205.09317v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of 2-boundary planar graphs. A graph is 2-boundary planar if it has an embedding in the plane so that all vertices lie on the boundary of at most two faces and no edges are crossed. A proper coloring of a graph is odd if every non-isolated vertex has some color that appears an odd number of times on its neighborhood. Petru\v{s}evski and \v{S}krekovski conjectured in 2022 that every planar graph admits an odd 5-coloring. We confirm this conjecture for 2-boundary planar graphs. Moreover, we present several questions regarding 2-boundary planar graphs that are of independent interest.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.17306v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a short proof that for every apex-forest $X$ on at least two vertices, graphs excluding $X$ as a minor have layered pathwidth at most $2|V(X)|-3$. This improves upon a result by Dujmovi\'c, Eppstein, Joret, Morin, and Wood (SIDMA, 2020). Our main tool is a structural result about graphs excluding a forest as a rooted minor, which is of independent interest. We develop similar tools for treedepth and treewidth. We discuss implications for Erd\H{o}s-P\'osa properties of rooted models of minors in graphs.</description>

      <title>Flips in colorful triangulations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03783v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The associahedron is the graph $\mathcal{G}_N$ that has as nodes all triangulations of a convex $N$-gon, and an edge between any two triangulations that differ in a flip operation. A flip removes an edge shared by two triangles and replaces it by the other diagonal of the resulting 4-gon. In this paper, we consider a large collection of induced subgraphs of $\mathcal{G}_N$ obtained by Ramsey-type colorability properties. Specifically, coloring the points of the $N$-gon red and blue alternatingly, we consider only colorful triangulations, namely triangulations in which every triangle has points in both colors, i.e., monochromatic triangles are forbidden. The resulting induced subgraph of $\mathcal{G}_N$ on colorful triangulations is denoted by $\mathcal{F}_N$. We prove that $\mathcal{F}_N$ has a Hamilton cycle for all $N\geq 8$, resolving a problem raised by Sagan, i.e., all colorful triangulations on $N$ points can be listed so that any two cyclically consecutive triangulations differ in a flip. In fact, we prove that for an arbitrary fixed coloring pattern of the $N$ points with at least 10 changes of color, the resulting subgraph of $\mathcal{G}_N$ on colorful triangulations (for that coloring pattern) admits a Hamilton cycle. We also provide an efficient algorithm for computing a Hamilton path in $\mathcal{F}_N$ that runs in time $\mathcal{O}(1)$ on average per generated node. This algorithm is based on a new and algorithmic construction of a tree rotation Gray code for listing all $n$-vertex $k$-ary trees that runs in time $\mathcal{O}(k)$ on average per generated tree.</description>

      <title>Weak coloring numbers of minor-closed graph classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04588</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04588v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the growth rate of weak coloring numbers of graphs excluding a fixed graph as a minor. Van den Heuvel et al. (European J. of Combinatorics, 2017) showed that for a fixed graph $X$, the maximum $r$-th weak coloring number of $X$-minor-free graphs is polynomial in $r$. We determine this polynomial up to a factor of $\mathcal{O}(r \log r)$. Moreover, we tie the exponent of the polynomial to a structural property of $X$, namely, $2$-treedepth. As a result, for a fixed graph $X$ and an $X$-minor-free graph $G$, we show that $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G)= \mathcal{O}(r^{\mathrm{td}(X)-1}\mathrm{log}\ r)$, which improves on the bound $\mathrm{wcol}_r(G) = \mathcal{O}(r^{g(\mathrm{td}(X))})$ given by Dujmovi\'c et al. (SODA, 2024), where $g$ is an exponential function. In the case of planar graphs of bounded treewidth, we show that the maximum $r$-th weak coloring number is in $\mathcal{O}(r^2\mathrm{log}\ r$), which is best possible.</description>

      <title>Dudeney's Dissection is Optimal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.03865v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In 1907, Henry Ernest Dudeney posed a puzzle: ``cut any equilateral triangle \dots\ into as few pieces as possible that will fit together and form a perfect square'' (without overlap, via translation and rotation).
  Four weeks later, Dudeney demonstrated a beautiful four-piece solution, which today remains perhaps the most famous example of dissection.
  In this paper (over a century later), we finally solve Dudeney's puzzle, by proving that the equilateral triangle and square have no common dissection with three or fewer polygonal pieces.
  We reduce the problem to the analysis of discrete graph structures representing the correspondence between the edges and the vertices of the pieces forming each polygon.</description>

      <title>Local Constant Approximation for Dominating Set on Graphs Excluding Large Minors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01091</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.01091v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We show that graphs excluding $K_{2,t}$ as a minor admit a $f(t)$-round $50$-approximation deterministic distributed algorithm for Minimum Dominating Set. The result extends to Minimum Vertex Cover. Though fast and approximate distributed algorithms for such problems were already known for $H$-minor-free graphs, all of them have an approximation ratio depending on the size of $H$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first example of a large non-trivial excluded minor leading to fast and constant-approximation distributed algorithms, where the ratio is independent of the size of $H$. A new key ingredient in the analysis of these distributed algorithms is the use of asymptotic dimension.</description>
