      <title>Denotational semantics driven simplicial homology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11566v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We look at the proofs of a fragment of Linear Logic as a whole: in fact, Linear Logic's coherent semantics interprets the proofs of a given formula $A$ as faces of an abstract simplicial complex, thus allowing us to see the set of the (interpretations of the) proofs of $A$ as a geometrical space, not just a set. This point of view has never been really investigated. For a ``webbed'' denotational semantics -- say the relational one --, it suffices to down-close the set of (the interpretations of the) proofs of $A$ in order to give rise to an abstract simplicial complex whose faces do correspond to proofs of $A$. Since this space comes triangulated by construction, a natural geometrical property to consider is its homology. However, we immediately stumble on a problem: if we want the homology to be invariant w.r.t. to some notion of type-isomorphism, we are naturally led to consider the homology functor acting, at the level of morphisms, on ``simplicial relations'' rather than simplicial maps as one does in topology. The task of defining the homology functor on this modified category can be achieved by considering a very simple monad, which is almost the same as the power-set monad; but, doing so, we end up considering not anymore the homology of the original space, but rather of its transformation under the action of the monad. Does this transformation keep the homology invariant ? Is this transformation meaningful from a geometrical or logical/computational point of view ?</description>

      <title>Intermediate models and Kinna--Wagner Principles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.07352</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.07352v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Kinna--Wagner Principles state that every set can be mapped into some fixed iterated power set of an ordinal, and we write $\mathsf{KWP}$ to denote that there is some $\alpha$ for which this holds. The Kinna--Wagner Conjecture, formulated by the first author in [9], states that if $V$ is a model of $\mathsf{ZF+KWP}$ and $G$ is a $V$-generic filter, then whenever $W$ is an intermediate model of $\mathsf{ZF}$, that is $V\subseteq W\subseteq V[G]$, then $W=V(x)$ for some $x$ if and only if $W$ satisfies $\mathsf{KWP}$. In this work we prove the conjecture and generalise it even further. We include a brief historical overview of Kinna--Wagner Principles and new results about Kinna--Wagner Principles in the multiverse of sets.</description>

      <title>2-classifiers via dense generators and Hofmann-Streicher universe in stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.16900v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We expand the theory of 2-classifiers, that are a 2-categorical generalization of subobject classifiers introduced by Weber. The idea is to upgrade monomorphisms to discrete opfibrations. We prove that the conditions of 2-classifier can be checked just on a dense generator. The study of what is classified by a 2-classifier is similarly reduced to a study over the objects that form a dense generator. We then apply our results to the cases of prestacks and stacks, where we can thus look just at the representables. We produce a 2-classifier in prestacks that classifies all discrete opfibrations with small fibres. Finally, we restrict such 2-classifier to a 2-classifier in stacks. This is the main ingredient of a proof that Grothendieck 2-topoi are elementary 2-topoi. Our results also solve a problem posed by Hofmann and Streicher when attempting to lift Grothendieck universes to sheaves.</description>
