      <title>Minimal History-Deterministic Co-Buchi Automata: Congruences and Passive Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.14304v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Abu Radi and Kupferman (2019) demonstrated the efficient minimization of history-deterministic (transition-based) co-B\"uchi automata, building on the results of Kuperberg and Skrzypczak (2015). We give a congruence-based description of these minimal automata, and a self-contained proof of its correctness. We use this description based on congruences to create a passive learning algorithm that can learn minimal history-deterministic co-B\"uchi automata from a set of labeled example words. The algorithm runs in polynomial time on a given set of examples, and there is a characteristic set of examples of polynomial size for each minimal history-deterministic co-B\"uchi automaton.</description>

      <title>Complexity of Model Checking Second-Order Hyperproperties on Finite Structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12361</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.12361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the model checking problem of Hyper2LTL over finite structures. Hyper2LTL is a second-order hyperlogic, that extends the well-studied logic HyperLTL by adding quantification over sets of traces, to express complex hyperproperties such as epistemic and asynchronous hyperproperties. While Hyper2LTL is very expressive, its expressiveness comes with a price, and its general model checking problem is undecidable. This motivates us to study the model checking problem for Hyper2LTL over finite structures -- tree-shaped or acyclic graphs, which are particularly useful for monitoring purposes. We show that Hyper2LTL model checking is decidable on finite structures. It is in PSPACE (in the size of the model) on tree-shaped models and in EXPSPACE on acyclic models. Additionally, we show that for an expressive fragment of Hyper2LTL, namely the Fixpoint Hyper2LTLfp fragment, the model checking problem is much simpler and is P-complete on tree-shaped models and EXP-complete on acyclic models. Last, we present some preliminary results that take into account not only the size of the model, but also the formula size.</description>

      <title>Types for Grassroots Logic Programs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17957</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.17957v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP) is a concurrent logic programming language in which logic variables are partitioned into paired readers and writers. An assignment is produced at most once via a writer and consumed at most once via its paired reader, and may contain additional readers and/or writers. This enables the concise expression of rich multidirectional communication modalities.
  ``Logic Programs as Types for Logic Programs'' (LICS'91) defined types as regular sets of paths over derivable ground atoms. Here, we define types to be regular sets of moded paths, where a mode captures directionality of communication -- whether a subterm is consumed from or produced to the environment -- enabling the typing of interactive partial computations including those that eventually deadlock or fail, or never terminate. We provide a syntactic definition of well-typing and prove that a program is well-typed iff the path abstraction of its moded-atom semantics satisfies covariance and contravariance conditions with respect to its type.
  The GLP type system was implemented in Dart by AI, starting from a mathematical specification of Typed GLP (this paper), deriving from it an English spec (written by AI), and from the spec deriving Dart code (by AI). While GLP is naturally untyped, the motivation for Typed GLP comes from programming with AI: Asking AI to program complex communication modalities in GLP (and in general) and hoping for the best is a tenuous strategy. The emerging discipline we advocate and employ is for the human designer and AI to jointly develop and agree upon (1)~GLP types; (2)~GLP procedure type declarations; (3)~informal (English) descriptions of the procedures; and only then let AI attempt to write (4)~GLP code based on those.</description>
