      <title>Operating a Multi-Level Molecular Dimer Switch through Precise Tip-Molecule Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Controlling the state of molecules on surfaces is crucial for the advancement of molecular electronics. While reversible control of bistable molecule switches has been demonstrated, achieving controllable multi-state switching at the molecular scale remains a formidable challenge. In this study, we introduce a simple and effective strategy for the on-demand control of a multi-level molecular switch by creating a molecular dimer. We explore the transition behavior of a pyrrolidine dimer system on the Cu(100) surface using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy. By fine-tuning the voltage and tip-molecule distance, we can selectively determine the dominant state of the dimer system. Both intermolecular and tip-molecule interactions play a role in modifying the transition pathways, enabling precise multi-state control.</description>

      <title>Optimizing reaction and transport fluxes in temperature gradient-driven chemical reaction-diffusion systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Temperature gradients represent energy sources that can be harvested to generate steady reaction or transport fluxes. Technological developments could lead to the transfer of free energy from heat sources and sinks to chemical systems for the purpose of extraction, thermal batteries, or nonequilibrium synthesis.
  We present a theoretical study of 1D chemical systems subjected to temperature gradients. A complete theoretical framework describes the system behavior induced by various temperature profiles. An exact mathematical derivation was established for a simple two-compartment model, and generalized to arbitrary reaction-diffusion systems based on numerical models. An experimental system was eventually scaled and tuned to optimize either nonequilibrium chemical transport or reaction.
  The relevant parameters for this description were identified; they focused on the system symmetry for chemical reaction and transport. Nonequilibrium thermodynamic approaches lead to a description analogous to electric circuits. Temperature gradients lead to the onset of a steady chemical force, sustaining steady reaction-diffusion fluxes moderated by chemical resistance. The system activity was then assessed using the entropy production rate, as a measure of its dissipated power.
  The chemical characteristics of the system can be tuned for the general optimization of the nonequilibrium state or for the specific optimization of either transport or reaction processes. The temperature gradient shape can be tailored to precisely control the spatial localization of active processes, targeting either precise spatial localization or propagation over large areas. The resulting temperature-driven chemical system can in turn be used to drive secondary processes into either nonequilibrium reaction fluxes or concentration gradients.</description>

      <title>Multiconfigurational short-range on-top pair-density functional theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05213v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the theory and implementation of a novel, fully variational wave function - density functional theory (DFT) hybrid model, which is applicable to many cases of strong correlation. We denote this model the multiconfigurational self-consistent on-top pair-density functional theory model (MC-srPDFT). We have previously shown how the multi-configurational short-range DFT hybrid model (MC-srDFT) can describe many multiconfigurational cases of any spin symmetry, and also state-specific calculations on excited states. However, the srDFT part of the MC-srDFT has some deficiencies that it shares with Kohn-Sham DFT, namely that different MS states have different energies and wrong bond dissociation description of singlet and non-singlet equilibrium states to open-shell fragments. The model we present in this paper corrects these deficiencies by introducing the on-top pair density. Unlike other models in the literature, our model is fully variational and employs a long-range version of the on-top pair density. The implementation is a second-order optimization algorithm ensuring robust convergence to both ground- and excited states. We show how MC-srPDFT solves the mentioned challenges by sample calculations on the ground state singlet curve of H$_2$, N$_2$, and Cr$_2$ and the lowest triplet curves for N$_2$ and Cr$_2$. The calculations show correct degeneracy between the singlet and triplet curves at dissociation and the results are invariant to the choice of MS value for the triplet curves.</description>

      <title>Thermodynamics of 2-alkanol + polar organic solvent mixtures. I. Systems with ketones, ethers or organic carbonates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05415</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05415v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The mixtures 2-propanol or 2-butanol + n-alkanone, or + acetophenone or + linear monoether, or + cyclic ether, or + linear organic carbonate, or + propylene carbonate have been investigated using thermodynamic data, and in terms of the Flory theory, and the Kirkwood-Buff integrals. The data considered are: excess molar enthalpies ($H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$), volumes, entropies, and the temperature dependence of $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$. The enthalpy of the 2-alkanol-solvent interactions have been determined, and the different contributions to $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ are discussed. It is shown that $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values of the 2-alkanol (fixed) + n-alkanone, or + linear carbonate mixtures change in the same manner that for n-alkanone, or linear carbonate + n-alkane (fixed) systems. In contrast, $H_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values of 2-alkanol (fixed) + linear monoether or + n-alkane mixtures change similarly. This set of results suggests that solvent-solvent interactions are determinant in systems with n-alkanone or linear carbonate, while interactions between alcohol molecules are determinant in mixtures with linear monoethers. According to the Flory model, orientational effects in systems with a given 2-alkanol become weaker in the sequence: linear monoether &gt; linear organic carbonate &gt; n-alkanone, and are stronger in solutions with a cyclic monoether than in those with cyclic diethers, and in systems with acetophenone or propylene carbonate than in the mixtures with the corresponding linear solvents. Results obtained from the Kirkwood-Buff integrals are consistent with these findings. The application of Flory model reveals that orientational effects are similar in systems with 1- or 2-alkanols, with the exception of solutions with linear monoethers, where such effects are stronger in mixtures containing 1-alkanols.</description>

      <title>Density and speed of sound of (iodobenzene + n-alkane) liquid mixtures at $T$ = (288.15 to 308.15) K. Application of the Prigogine-Flory-Patterson model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05422</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05422v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: (Iodobenzene + n-alkane) liquid mixtures have been studied experimentally, in terms of densities and speeds of sound at a pressure $p$ = 0.1 MPa and in the temperature range $T$ = (288.15 to 308.15) K, and theoretically, by the application of the Prigogine-Flory-Patterson (PFP) model. The n-alkanes considered are n-heptane, n-decane, n-dodecane, and n-tetradecane. Excess molar volumes ($V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$) and excess isentropic compressibilities ($\kappa_S^{\text{E}}$) have been calculated and correlated by Redlich-Kister polynomials. ${(\partial{V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}}/\partial T)}_p$ curves at the same (p,T) conditions have been obtained from correlated $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ values. From these experimental results and the knowledge of the excess molar enthalpies and volumes of mixtures containing fluorobenzene, chlorobenzene or bromobenzene with n-alkanes, we have inferred: (i) the presence of structural effects, especially important for the n-heptane mixture and less relevant for volumetric properties as the length of the n-alkane increases; and (ii) that the interactional effects on $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ do not vary appreciably with the length of the n-alkane, so the observed $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ variation is fundamentally determined by the corresponding variation of the contribution from structural effects. The application of the PFP model supports this interpretation, providing free volume contributions to $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ that vary parallelly to $V_{\text{m}}^{\text{E}}$ with the length of the n-alkane, and interactional contributions that rest approximately constant independently of the n-alkane size.</description>

      <title>Viscosities of iodobenzene + n-alkane mixtures at (288.15-308.15) K. Measurements and results from models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05426</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05426v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Kinematic viscosities were measured for iodobenzene + n-alkane mixtures at (288.15-308.15) K and atmospheric pressure. Using our previous density data, dynamic viscosities ($\eta$), deviations in absolute viscosity ($\Delta \eta$) and quantities of viscous flow were determined. The McAllister, Grunberg-Nissan and Fang-He correlation equations and Bloomfield-Dewan's model (with residual Gibbs energies calculated using DISQUAC with interaction parameters available in the literature) were applied to iodobenzene, or 1-chloronaphthalene, or 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, or methyl benzoate or benzene or cyclohexane + n-alkane systems. The dependence of $U_{\text{m,}V}^{\text{E}}$ (isochoric molar excess internal energy) and $\Delta \eta$ with $n$ (the number of C atoms of the n-alkane) shows that the fluidization loss of mixtures containing iodobenzene, 1,2,4-trichlorobenzene, or 1-chloronaphthalene when $n$ increases is due to a decrease upon mixing of the number of broken interactions between like molecules. The breaking of correlations of molecular orientations characteristic of longer n-alkanes may explain the decreased negative $\Delta \eta$ values of benzene mixtures with $n$ =14,16. The replacement, in this type of systems of benzene by cyclohexane leads to increased positive $\Delta \eta$ values, probably due to the different shape of cyclohexane. On the other hand, binary mixtures formed by one of the aromatic polar compounds mentioned above and a short n-alkane show large structural effects and large negative $\Delta \eta$ values. From the application of the models, it seems that dispersive interactions are dominant and that size effects are not relevant on $\eta$ values. The free volume model provides good results for most of the systems considered. Results improve when, within Bloomfield-Dewan's theory, the contribution to $\eta$ of the absolute reaction rate model is also considered.</description>

      <title>Transferability of datasets between Machine-Learning Interaction Potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05590</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05590v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the emergence of Foundational Machine Learning Interatomic Potential (FMLIP) models trained on extensive datasets, transferring data between different ML architectures has become increasingly important. In this work, we examine the extent to which training data optimised for one machine-learning forcefield algorithm may be re-used to train different models, aiming to accelerate FMLIP fine-tuning and to reduce the need for costly iterative training. As a test case, we train models of an organic liquid mixture that is commonly used as a solvent in rechargeable battery electrolytes, making it an important target for reactive MLIP development. We assess model performance by analysing the properties of molecular dynamics trajectories, showing that this is a more stringent test than comparing prediction errors for fixed datasets. We consider several types of training data, and several popular MLIPs - notably the recent MACE architecture, a message-passing neural network designed for high efficiency and smoothness. We demonstrate that simple training sets constructed without any ab initio dynamics are sufficient to produce stable models of molecular liquids. For simple neural-network architectures, further iterative training is required to capture thermodynamic and kinetic properties correctly, but MACE performs well with extremely limited datsets. We find that configurations designed by human intuition to correct systematic model deficiencies transfer effectively between algorithms, but active-learned data that are generated by one MLIP do not typically benefit a different algorithm. Finally, we show that any training data which improve model performance also improve its ability to generalise to similar unseen molecules. This suggests that trajectory failure modes are connected with chemical structure rather than being entirely system-specific.</description>

      <title>Simulating Non-Markovian Dynamics in Multidimensional Electronic Spectroscopy via Quantum Algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05548</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05548v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Including the effect of the molecular environment in the numerical modeling of time-resolved electronic spectroscopy remains an important challenge in computational spectroscopy. In this contribution, we present a general approach for the simulation of the optical response of multi-chromophore systems in a structured environment and its implementation as a quantum algorithm. A key step of the procedure is the pseudomode embedding of the system-environment problem resulting in a finite set of quantum states evolving according to a Markovian quantum master equation. This formulation is then solved by a collision model integrated into a quantum algorithm designed to simulate linear and nonlinear response functions. The workflow is validated by simulating spectra for the prototypical excitonic dimer interacting with fast (memoryless) and finite-memory environments. The results demonstrate, on the one hand, the potential of the pseudomode embedding for simulating the dynamical features of nonlinear spectroscopy, including lineshape, spectral diffusion, and relaxations along delay times. On the other hand, the explicit synthesis of quantum circuits provides a fully quantum simulation protocol of nonlinear spectroscopy harnessing the efficient quantum simulation of many-body dynamics promised by the future generation of fault-tolerant quantum computers.</description>

      <title>Controlling molecular dynamics by exciting atoms in a cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Placing an atom and a molecule in a cavity opens the door to initialize molecular dynamics by exciting a level of the atom. This approach enlarges the range of choosing the light source to trigger molecular dynamics substantially. The interplay of the atomic, molecular and photonic populations gives rise to rich dynamics. The cavity photon plays the role of a mediator between the atom and the molecule and it is found that the photonic population is rather low throughout and its evolution follows that of the molecule. Cavities are known to be subject to losses. In spite of the losses it is demonstrated that the presence of the atom gives rise to a long-lived dynamics which should be of relevance for experimental investigations. The presence of more atoms and molecules is expected to further enrich the dynamics.</description>

      <title>Real-time optical gas sensing with two-dimensional materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.05693</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.05693v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are highly appealing for gas sensors, lab-on-a-chip devices and bio-sensing applications because of their strong light-matter interaction and high surface-to-volume ratio. The ability to grow these van der Waals materials on different substrates and waveguide geometries opens a horizon toward scalable on-chip photonic nanodevices. Here, we report on a versatile technique for real time remote optical gas sensing using two-dimensional TMDs. The adsorption of the gas molecules on the monolayer surface provides a gateway for gas sensing based on charge-transfer-induced photoluminescence variation. For gases that are weakly adsorbed on the surface of monolayer TMDs, purging the monolayers' surface by an inert gas like N2 can desorb gases from the monolayers at room temperature. We demonstrate CO, NO and NO2 detection by monitoring photoluminescence from semiconducting MoS2 monolayers grown on SiO2/Si chips at a level of 10 ppm with fast response time. Observations are supported by our density functional theory calculations, which predict a significant interaction between these gases and MoS2 monolayers. These findings may lead to advances in remote sensing, surface-sensitive bioanalytics and lab-on-a-chip sensors.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2309.00263v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the powerful formalism of multichannel quantum defect theory combined with a frame transformation to ultracold atom-molecule collisions in magnetic fields. By solving the coupled-channel equations with hyperfine and Zeeman interactions omitted at short range, the extended theory enables a drastically simplified description of the intricate quantum dynamics of ultracold molecular collisions in terms of a small number of short-range parameters. We apply the formalism to ultracold Mg + NH collisions in a magnetic field, achieving a 10$^4$-fold reduction in computational effort.</description>

      <title>Symbolic construction of the chemical Jacobian of quasi-steady state (QSS) chemistries for Exascale computing platforms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Quasi-Steady State Approximation (QSSA) can be an effective tool for reducing the size and stiffness of chemical mechanisms for implementation in computational reacting flow solvers. However, for many applications, stiffness remains, and the resulting model requires implicit methods for efficient time integration. In this paper, we outline an approach to formulating the QSSA reduction that is coupled with a strategy to generate C++ source code to evaluate the net species production rate, and the chemical Jacobian. The code-generation component employs a symbolic approach enabling a simple and effective strategy to analytically compute the chemical Jacobian. For computational tractability, the symbolic approach needs to be paired with common subexpression elimination which can negatively affect memory usage. Several solutions are outlined and successfully tested on a 3D multipulse ignition problem, thus allowing portable application across a chemical model sizes and GPU capabilities. The implementation of the proposed method is available at https://github.com/AMReX-Combustion/PelePhysics under an open-source license.</description>

Abstract: We report numerically exact quantum scattering calculations on magnetic Feshbach resonances in ultracold, strongly anisotropic atom-molecule [Rb($^2$S) + SrF($^2\Sigma^+$)] collisions based on state-of-the-art ab initio potential energy surfaces. We find broad resonances mediated by the intermolecular spin-exchange interaction, as well as narrow resonances due to the intramolecular spin-rotation interaction, which are unique to atom-molecule collisions. Remarkably, the density of resonances in atom-molecule collisions is not much higher than that in atomic collisions despite the presence of a dense manifold of molecular rotational states, which can be rationalized by analyzing the adiabatic states of the collision complex.</description>

      <title>FreeCG: Free the Design Space of Clebsch-Gordan Transform for Machine Learning Force Fields</title>

Abstract: Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are of great importance for chemistry, physics, materials science, and many other related fields. The Clebsch-Gordan Transform (CG transform) effectively encodes many-body interactions and is thus an important building block for many models of MLFFs. However, the permutation-equivariance requirement of MLFFs limits the design space of CG transform, that is, intensive CG transform has to be conducted for each neighboring edge and the operations should be performed in the same manner for all edges. This constraint results in reduced expressiveness of the model while simultaneously increasing computational demands. To overcome this challenge, we first implement the CG transform layer on the permutation-invariant abstract edges generated from real edge information. We show that this approach allows complete freedom in the design of the layer without compromising the crucial symmetry. Developing on this free design space, we further propose group CG transform with sparse path, abstract edges shuffling, and attention enhancer to form a powerful and efficient CG transform layer. Our method, known as FreeCG, achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in force prediction for MD17, rMD17, MD22, and is well extended to property prediction in QM9 datasets with several improvements greater than 15% and the maximum beyond 20%. The extensive real-world applications showcase high practicality. FreeCG introduces a novel paradigm for carrying out efficient and expressive CG transform in future geometric neural network designs. To demonstrate this, the recent SOTA, QuinNet, is also enhanced under our paradigm. Code will be publicly available.</description>
