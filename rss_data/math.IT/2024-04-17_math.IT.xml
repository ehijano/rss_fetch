      <title>Enhanced Low-Complexity Receiver Design for Short Block Transmission Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10065</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10065v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis and performance enhancement of short block length channel detection incorporating training information. The current communication systems' short block length channel detection typically consists of least squares channel estimation followed by quasi-coherent detection. By investigating the receiver structure, specifically the estimator-correlator, we show that the non-coherent term, often disregarded in conventional detection metrics, results in significant losses in performance and sensitivity in typical operating regimes of 5G and 6G systems. A comparison with the fully non-coherent receiver in multi-antenna configurations reveals substantial losses in low spectral efficiency operating areas. Additionally, we demonstrate that by employing an adaptive DMRS-data power adjustment, it is possible to reduce the performance loss gap, which is amenable to a more sensitive quasi-coherent receiver. However, both of the aforementioned ML detection strategies can result in substantial computational complexity when processing long bit-length codes. We propose an approach to tackle this challenge by introducing the principle of block or segment coding using First-Order RM Codes, which is amenable to low-cost decoding through block-based fast Hadamard transforms. The Block-based FHT has demonstrated to be cost-efficient with regards to decoding time, as it evolves from quadric to quasi-linear complexity with a manageable decline in performance. Additionally, by incorporating an adaptive DMRS-data power adjustment technique, we are able to bridge/reduce the performance gap with respect to the conventional maximum likelihood receiver and attain high sensitivity, leading to a good trade-off between performance and complexity to efficiently handle small payloads.</description>

      <title>The Average Spectrum Norm and Near-Optimal Tensor Completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10085v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a new tensor norm, the average spectrum norm, to study sample complexity of tensor completion problems based on the canonical polyadic decomposition (CPD). Properties of the average spectrum norm and its dual norm are investigated, demonstrating their utility for low-rank tensor recovery analysis. Our novel approach significantly reduces the provable sample rate for CPD-based noisy tensor completion, providing the best bounds to date on the number of observed noisy entries required to produce an arbitrarily accurate estimate of an underlying mean value tensor. Under Poisson and Bernoulli multivariate distributions, we show that an $N$-way CPD rank-$R$ parametric tensor $\boldsymbol{\mathscr{M}}\in\mathbb{R}^{I\times \cdots\times I}$ generating noisy observations can be approximated by large likelihood estimators from $\mathcal{O}(IR^2\log^{N+2}(I))$ revealed entries. Furthermore, under nonnegative and orthogonal versions of the CPD we improve the result to depend linearly on the rank, achieving the near-optimal rate $\mathcal{O}(IR\log^{N+2}(I))$.</description>

      <title>On the Universality of Spatially Coupled LDPC Codes Over Intersymbol Interference Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10348v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the exact input/output transfer functions of the optimal a-posteriori probability channel detector for a general ISI channel with erasures. Considering three channel impulse responses of different memory as an example, we compute the BP and MAP thresholds for regular spatially coupled LDPC codes with joint iterative detection and decoding. When we compare the results with the thresholds of ISI channels with Gaussian noise we observe an apparent inconsistency, i.e., a channel which performs better with erasures performs worse with AWGN. We show that this anomaly can be resolved by looking at the thresholds from an entropy perspective. We finally show that with spatial coupling we can achieve the symmetric information rates of different ISI channels using the same code.</description>

      <title>Robust Performance Over Changing Intersymbol Interference Channels by Spatial Coupling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10367</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10367v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that spatially coupled low-density parity- check (LDPC) codes yield robust performance over changing intersymbol interfere (ISI) channels with optimal and suboptimal detectors. We compare the performance with classical LDPC code design which involves optimizing the degree distribution for a given (known) channel. We demonstrate that these classical schemes, despite working very good when designed for a given channel, can perform poorly if the channel is exchanged. With spatially coupled LDPC codes, however, we get performances close to the symmetric information rates with just a single code, without the need to know the channel and adapt to it at the transmitter. We also investigate threshold saturation with the linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) detector and show that with spatial coupling its performance can get remarkably close to that of an optimal detector for regular LDPC codes.</description>

      <title>Polycyclic codes over serial rings and their annihilator CSS construction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10452v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the algebraic structure for polycyclic codes over a specific class of serial rings, defined as $\mathscr R=R[x_1,\ldots, x_s]/\langle t_1(x_1),\ldots, t_s(x_s) \rangle$, where $R$ is a chain ring and each $t_i(x_i)$ in $R[x_i]$ for $i\in\{1,\ldots, s\}$ is a monic square-free polynomial. We define quasi-$s$-dimensional polycyclic codes and establish an $R$-isomorphism between these codes and polycyclic codes over $\mathscr R$. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of annihilator self-dual, annihilator self-orthogonal, annihilator linear complementary dual, and annihilator dual-containing polycyclic codes over this class of rings. We also establish the CSS construction for annihilator dual-preserving polycyclic codes over the chain ring $R$ and use this construction to derive quantum codes from polycyclic codes over $\mathscr{R}$.</description>

      <title>Resilient-By-Design Framework for MIMO-OFDM Communications under Smart Jamming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Native jamming mitigation is essential for addressing security and resilience in future 6G wireless networks. In this paper a resilient-by-design framework for effective anti-jamming in MIMO-OFDM wireless communications is introduced. A novel approach that integrates information from wireless sensing services to develop anti-jamming strategies, which do not rely on any prior information or assumptions on the adversary's concrete setup, is explored. To this end, a method that replaces conventional approaches to noise covariance estimation in anti-jamming with a surrogate covariance model is proposed, which instead incorporates sensing information on the jamming signal's directions-of-arrival (DoAs) to provide an effective approximation of the true jamming strategy. The study further focuses on integrating this novel, sensing-assisted approach into the joint optimization of beamforming, user scheduling and power allocation for a multi-user MIMO-OFDM uplink setting. Despite the NP-hard nature of this optimization problem, it can be effectively solved using an iterative water-filling approach. In order to assess the effectiveness of the proposed sensing-assisted jamming mitigation, the corresponding worst-case jamming strategy is investigated, which aims to minimize the total user sum-rate. Experimental simulations eventually affirm the robustness of our approach against both worst-case and barrage jamming, demonstrating its potential to address a wide range of jamming scenarios. Since such an integration of sensing-assisted information is directly implemented on the physical layer, resilience is incorporated preemptively by-design.</description>

      <title>UAV Trajectory Optimization for Sensing Exploiting Target Location Distribution Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the trajectory optimization of a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) which aims to sense the location of a target while maintaining satisfactory communication quality with the ground base stations (GBSs). In contrast to most existing works which assumed the target's location is known, we focus on a more challenging scenario where the exact location of the target to be sensed is unknown and random, while its distribution is known a priori and stored in a novel target location distribution map. Based on this map, the probability for the UAV to successfully sense the target can be expressed as a function of the UAV's trajectory. We aim to optimize the UAV's trajectory between two pre-determined locations to maximize the overall sensing probability during its flight, subject to a GBS-UAV communication quality constraint at each time instant and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Despite the non-convexity and NP-hardness of this problem, we devise three high-quality suboptimal solutions tailored for it with polynomial complexity. Numerical results show that our proposed designs outperform various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>Bounds on Sphere Sizes in the Sum-Rank Metric and Coordinate-Additive Metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10666</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10666v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper provides new bounds on the size of spheres in any coordinate-additive metric with a particular focus on improving existing bounds in the sum-rank metric. We derive improved upper and lower bounds based on the entropy of a distribution related to the Boltzmann distribution, which work for any coordinate-additive metric. Additionally, we derive new closed-form upper and lower bounds specifically for the sum-rank metric that outperform existing closed-form bounds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:1406.0134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: To counter a general belief that all the paradoxes stem from a kind of circularity (or involve some self--reference, or use a diagonal argument) Stephen Yablo designed a paradox in 1993 that seemingly avoided self--reference. We turn Yablo's paradox, the most challenging paradox in the recent years, into a genuine mathematical theorem in Linear Temporal Logic (LTL). Indeed, Yablo's paradox comes in several varieties; and he showed in 2004 that there are other versions that are equally paradoxical. Formalizing these versions of Yablo's paradox, we prove some theorems in LTL. This is the first time that Yablo's paradox(es) become new(ly discovered) theorems in mathematics and logic.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic mutual information in quadratic estimation problems over compact groups</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10169</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10169v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by applications to group synchronization and quadratic assignment on random data, we study a general problem of Bayesian inference of an unknown ``signal'' belonging to a high-dimensional compact group, given noisy pairwise observations of a featurization of this signal. We establish a quantitative comparison between the signal-observation mutual information in any such problem with that in a simpler model with linear observations, using interpolation methods. For group synchronization, our result proves a replica formula for the asymptotic mutual information and Bayes-optimal mean-squared-error. Via analyses of this replica formula, we show that the conjectural phase transition threshold for computationally-efficient weak recovery of the signal is determined by a classification of the real-irreducible components of the observed group representation(s), and we fully characterize the information-theoretic limits of estimation in the example of angular/phase synchronization over $SO(2)$/$U(1)$. For quadratic assignment, we study observations given by a kernel matrix of pairwise similarities and a randomly permutated and noisy counterpart, and we show in a bounded signal-to-noise regime that the asymptotic mutual information coincides with that in a Bayesian spiked model with i.i.d. signal prior.</description>

      <title>Private Vector Mean Estimation in the Shuffle Model: Optimal Rates Require Many Messages</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10201v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of private vector mean estimation in the shuffle model of privacy where $n$ users each have a unit vector $v^{(i)} \in\mathbb{R}^d$. We propose a new multi-message protocol that achieves the optimal error using $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}\left(\min(n\varepsilon^2,d)\right)$ messages per user. Moreover, we show that any (unbiased) protocol that achieves optimal error requires each user to send $\Omega(\min(n\varepsilon^2,d)/\log(n))$ messages, demonstrating the optimality of our message complexity up to logarithmic factors. Additionally, we study the single-message setting and design a protocol that achieves mean squared error $\mathcal{O}(dn^{d/(d+2)}\varepsilon^{-4/(d+2)})$. Moreover, we show that any single-message protocol must incur mean squared error $\Omega(dn^{d/(d+2)})$, showing that our protocol is optimal in the standard setting where $\varepsilon = \Theta(1)$. Finally, we study robustness to malicious users and show that malicious users can incur large additive error with a single shuffler.</description>

      <title>Towards a Unification of Logic and Information Theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10414</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.10414v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This article introduces a theory of communication that covers the following generic scenario: Alice knows more than Bob about a certain set of logic propositions and Alice and Bob wish to communicate as efficiently as possible with the shared goal that, following their communication, Bob should be able to deduce a particular logic proposition that Alice knows to be true.
  We assume that our logic system is propositional logic, and we build on top of one of the legendary works in this area, namely the work of Carnap and Bar-Hillel on a theory of semantic information. Our main contribution is a collection of theorems studying various different assumptions on what Alice and Bob know and what their goal is. These theorems all provide sharp upper and lower bounds phrased in terms of an entropy-like function that we call $\Lambda$, in reference to its apparent connection to problems of communication involving logic. It turns out that when the goal is to communicate only a portion of the knowledge that Alice possesses, the optimum communication cost is lower than most people seem to assume, yet unavoidably, such optimum communication strategies end up allowing Bob to prove even more things than originally intended. Another interesting outcome is that in some scenarios, Alice need not know the logic statements that Bob knows in order to attain asymptotically the same communication efficiency as if she knew the statement, in a nod to the famous Slepian-Wolf and Wyner-Ziv results from source coding theory. Our work also introduces practical codes, which are comprised of a combination of linear codes and enumerative source codes, which turn out to be asymptotically optimal for some scenarios.</description>

      <title>Stability in Phase Retrieval: Characterizing Condition Numbers and the Optimal Vector Set</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07515</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07515v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we primarily focus on analyzing the stability property of phase retrieval by examining the bi-Lipschitz property of the map $\Phi_{\boldsymbol{A}}(\boldsymbol{x})=|\boldsymbol{A}\boldsymbol{x}|\in \mathbb{R}_+^m$, where $\boldsymbol{x}\in \mathbb{H}^d$ and $\boldsymbol{A}\in \mathbb{H}^{m\times d}$ is the measurement matrix for $\mathbb{H}\in\{\mathbb{R},\mathbb{C}\}$. We define the condition number $\beta_{\boldsymbol{A}}=\frac{U_{\boldsymbol{A}}}{L_{\boldsymbol{A}}}$, where $L_{\boldsymbol{A}}$ and $U_{\boldsymbol{A}}$ represent the optimal lower and upper Lipschitz constants, respectively. We establish the first universal lower bound on $\beta_{\boldsymbol{A}}$ by demonstrating that for any ${\boldsymbol{A}}\in\mathbb{H}^{m\times d}$, \begin{equation*} \beta_{\boldsymbol{A}}\geq \beta_0^{\mathbb{H}}=\begin{cases} \sqrt{\frac{\pi}{\pi-2}}\,\,\approx\,\, 1.659 &amp; \text{if $\mathbb{H}=\mathbb{R}$,}\\ \sqrt{\frac{4}{4-\pi}}\,\,\approx\,\, 2.159 &amp; \text{if $\mathbb{H}=\mathbb{C}$.} \end{cases} \end{equation*} We prove that the condition number of a standard Gaussian matrix in $\mathbb{H}^{m\times d}$ asymptotically matches the lower bound $\beta_0^{\mathbb{H}}$ for both real and complex cases. This result indicates that the constant lower bound $\beta_0^{\mathbb{H}}$ is asymptotically tight, holding true for both the real and complex scenarios. As an application of this result, we utilize it to investigate the performance of quadratic models for phase retrieval. Lastly, we establish that for any odd integer $m\geq 3$, the harmonic frame $\boldsymbol{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times 2}$ possesses the minimum condition number among all $\boldsymbol{A}\in \mathbb{R}^{m\times 2}$. We are confident that these findings carry substantial implications for enhancing our understanding of phase retrieval.</description>

      <title>Aleatoric and Epistemic Discrimination: Fundamental Limits of Fairness Interventions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.11781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2301.11781v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models can underperform on certain population groups due to choices made during model development and bias inherent in the data. We categorize sources of discrimination in the ML pipeline into two classes: aleatoric discrimination, which is inherent in the data distribution, and epistemic discrimination, which is due to decisions made during model development. We quantify aleatoric discrimination by determining the performance limits of a model under fairness constraints, assuming perfect knowledge of the data distribution. We demonstrate how to characterize aleatoric discrimination by applying Blackwell's results on comparing statistical experiments. We then quantify epistemic discrimination as the gap between a model's accuracy when fairness constraints are applied and the limit posed by aleatoric discrimination. We apply this approach to benchmark existing fairness interventions and investigate fairness risks in data with missing values. Our results indicate that state-of-the-art fairness interventions are effective at removing epistemic discrimination on standard (overused) tabular datasets. However, when data has missing values, there is still significant room for improvement in handling aleatoric discrimination.</description>

Abstract: This work proposes to measure the scope of a patent claim as the reciprocal of self-information contained in this claim. Self-information is calculated based on a probability of occurrence of the claim, where this probability is obtained from a language model. Grounded in information theory, this approach is based on the assumption that an unlikely concept is more informative than a usual concept, insofar as it is more surprising. In turn, the more surprising the information required to define the claim, the narrower its scope. Seven language models are considered, ranging from simplest models (each word or character has an identical probability) to intermediate models (based on average word or character frequencies), to large language models (LLMs) such as GPT2 and davinci-002. Remarkably, when using the simplest language models to compute the probabilities, the scope becomes proportional to the reciprocal of the number of words or characters involved in the claim, a metric already used in previous works. Application is made to multiple series of patent claims directed to distinct inventions, where each series consists of claims devised to have a gradually decreasing scope. The performance of the language models is then assessed through several ad hoc tests. The LLMs outperform models based on word and character frequencies, which themselves outdo the simplest models based on word or character counts. Interestingly, however, the character count appears to be a more reliable indicator than the word count.</description>

      <title>Statistical Complexity of Quantum Learning</title>

Abstract: Recent years have seen significant activity on the problem of using data for the purpose of learning properties of quantum systems or of processing classical or quantum data via quantum computing. As in classical learning, quantum learning problems involve settings in which the mechanism generating the data is unknown, and the main goal of a learning algorithm is to ensure satisfactory accuracy levels when only given access to data and, possibly, side information such as expert knowledge. This article reviews the complexity of quantum learning using information-theoretic techniques by focusing on data complexity, copy complexity, and model complexity. Copy complexity arises from the destructive nature of quantum measurements, which irreversibly alter the state to be processed, limiting the information that can be extracted about quantum data. For example, in a quantum system, unlike in classical machine learning, it is generally not possible to evaluate the training loss simultaneously on multiple hypotheses using the same quantum data. To make the paper self-contained and approachable by different research communities, we provide extensive background material on classical results from statistical learning theory, as well as on the distinguishability of quantum states. Throughout, we highlight the differences between quantum and classical learning by addressing both supervised and unsupervised learning, and we provide extensive pointers to the literature.</description>

      <title>UAV-enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication: Tracking Design and Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.03726</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.03726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) enabled by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a promising technology to facilitate target tracking applications. In contrast to conventional UAV-based ISAC system designs that mainly focus on estimating the target position, the target velocity estimation also needs to be considered due to its crucial impacts on link maintenance and real-time response, which requires new designs on resource allocation and tracking scheme. In this paper, we propose an extended Kalman filtering-based tracking scheme for a UAV-enabled ISAC system where a UAV tracks a moving object and also communicates with a device attached to the object. Specifically, a weighted sum of predicted posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) for object relative position and velocity estimation is minimized by optimizing the UAV trajectory, where an efficient solution is obtained based on the successive convex approximation method. Furthermore, under a special case with the measurement mean square error (MSE), the optimal relative motion state is obtained and proved to keep a fixed elevation angle and zero relative velocity. Numerical results validate that the obtained solution to the predicted PCRB minimization can be approximated by the optimal relative motion state when predicted measurement MSE dominates the predicted PCRBs, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed tracking scheme. Moreover, three interesting trade-offs on system performance resulted from the fixed elevation angle are illustrated.</description>

      <title>A blockBP decoder for the surface code</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.04834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.04834v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a new decoder for the surface code, which combines the accuracy of the tensor-network decoders with the efficiency and parallelism of the belief-propagation algorithm. Our main idea is to replace the expensive tensor-network contraction step in the tensor-network decoders with the blockBP algorithm - a recent approximate contraction algorithm, based on belief propagation. Our decoder is therefore a belief-propagation decoder that works in the degenerate maximal likelihood decoding framework. Unlike conventional tensor-network decoders, our algorithm can run efficiently in parallel, and may therefore be suitable for real-time decoding. We numerically test our decoder and show that for a large range of lattice sizes and noise levels it delivers a logical error probability that outperforms the Minimal-Weight-Perfect-Matching (MWPM) decoder, sometimes by more than an order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>An Information Theory Treatment of Animal Movement Tracks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16290</link>

Abstract: The two-dimensional track of an animal on a landscape has progressed over the past three decades from hourly to second-by-second recordings of locations. Track segmentation methods for analyzing the behavioral information in such relocation data has lagged somewhat behind, with scales of analysis currently at the sub-hourly to minute level. A new approach is needed to bring segmentation analysis down to a second-by-second level. Here, such an approach is presented that rests heavily on concepts from Shannon's Information Theory. In this paper, we first briefly review and update concepts relating to movement path segmentation. We then discuss how cluster analysis can be used to organize the smallest viable statistical movement elements (StaMEs), which are $\mu$ steps long, and to code the next level of movement elements called ``words'' that are $m \mu$ steps long. Centroids of these word clusters are identified as canonical activity modes (CAMs). Unlike current segmentation schemes, the approach presented here allows us to provide entropy measures for movement paths, compute the coding efficiencies of derived StaMEs and CAMs, and assess error rates in the allocation of strings of $m$ StaMEs to CAM types. In addition our approach allows us to employ the Jensen-Shannon divergence measure to assess and compare the best choices for the various parameters (number of steps in a StaME, number of StaME types, number of StaMEs in a word, number of CAM types), as well as the best clustering methods for generating segments that can then be used to interpret and predict sequences of higher order segments. The theory presented here provides another tool in our toolbox for dealing with the effects of global change on the movement and redistribution of animals across altered landscapes</description>
