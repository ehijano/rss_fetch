      <title>SynAsk: Unleashing the Power of Large Language Models in Organic Synthesis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04593</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04593v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed a transformative shift with the emergence of large language models (LLMs), revolutionizing various language tasks and applications, and the integration of LLM into specialized domains enhances their capabilities for domain-specific applications. Notably, NLP has made significant strides in organic chemistry, particularly in predicting synthetic tasks, paving the way for the development of LLMs tailored to the organic chemistry field. In this work, we introduce SynAsk, a comprehensive organic chemistry domain-specific LLM platform developed by AIChemEco Inc. By finetuning an LLM with domain-specific data and integrating it with a chain of thought approach, SynAsk seamlessly accesses our knowledge base and advanced chemistry tools in a question-and-answer format. This includes functionalities such as a basic chemistry knowledge base, molecular information retrieval, reaction performance prediction, retrosynthesis prediction, chemical literature acquisition, and more. This novel methodology synergizes fine-tuning techniques with external resource integration, resulting in an organic chemistry-specific model poised to facilitate research and discovery in the field. Accessible via http://synask.aichemeco.com, SynAsk represents a significant advancement in leveraging NLP for synthetic applications.</description>

      <title>Atomic momentum distributions in polyatomic molecules in rotational-vibrational eigenstates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04832v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report a quantum mechanical method for calculating the momentum distributions of constituent atoms of polyatomic molecules in rotational-vibrational eigenstates. Application of the present theory to triatomic molecules in the rovibrational ground state revealed that oscillatory changes appear on the proton momentum distribution in the nonlinear $\mathrm{H_2O}$ molecule, whilst no such modulation is present in the case of an oxygen atom in the linear $\mathrm{CO_2}$ molecule. The atomic momentum distributions were analyzed in detail by means of a rigid rotor model, and it was found that the oscillation originates from quantum-mechanical delocalization of the target atom with respect to the other atoms.</description>

      <title>Exceptionally Large Fluctuations in Orientational Order: The Lessons of Large-Deviation Theory for Liquid Crystalline Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04509</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04509v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The fact that simulations of condensed matter problems are limited to sizes far smaller than the macroscopic systems being emulated does have one redeeming feature: The specific dependence on N, the number of molecules being simulated, is sometimes itself a valuable piece of information. The isotropic phase of liquid crystals provides a case in point. Light scattering and 2d-IR experiments on isotropic-phase samples display increasingly large orientational fluctuations as the samples approach their nematic phase. The growing length scale of those locally ordered domains is readily seen in simulation as an ever slower convergence of the distribution of orientational order parameters with N. The rare-event character of the largest fluctuations make them difficult to sample accurately. We show in this paper how taking a large deviation theory perspective enables us to leverage simulation-derived information more effectively. A key insight of large deviation theory is that extracting the desired measurable, in our case, the extent of orientational order, is completely equivalent to finding the size of the conjugate field required to equilibrate that amount of order - and that knowing the relationship between the two gives us the relative free energy. Indeed, a variety of thermodynamic integration strategies used to evaluate free energy differences in simulation are essentially founded on this idea. However, rather than applying an artificially imposed external field, we use a priori statistical mechanical insights into the small and large-field limits of the equation of state to construct a simulation-guided, interpolated, equation of state. The free energies that result turn out to need simulation information derived mostly from the most probable configurations, rather than from the infrequent events, and therefore use simulation information far more efficiently than conventional methods.</description>

      <title>Quantum hardware demonstrations of relativistic calculations of molecular electric dipole moments: from light to heavy systems using Variational Quantum Eigensolver</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04992</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.04992v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The quantum-classical hybrid Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) algorithm is recognized to be the method of choice to obtain ground state energies of quantum many-body systems in the noisy intermediate scale quantum (NISQ) era. This study not only extends the VQE algorithm to the relativistic regime, but also calculates a property other than energy, namely the molecular permanent electric dipole moment (PDM). We carry out 18-qubit quantum simulations to obtain ground state energies as well as PDMs of single-valence diatomic molecules, ranging from the light BeH to the heavy radioactive RaH molecule. We investigate the correlation trends in these systems as well as access the precision in our results. Furthermore, we measure the PDM of the moderately heavy SrH and SrF molecules on the optimized unitary coupled cluster state, using the state-of-the-art IonQ Aria-I quantum computer in an active space of 6 qubits. The associated quantum circuits for these computations were extensively optimized in view of limitations imposed by NISQ hardware. To that end, we employ an array of techniques, including the use of point group symmetries, integrating ZX-Calculus into our pipeline-based circuit optimization, and energy sort VQE procedure. Through these methods, we compress our 6-qubit quantum circuit from 280 two-qubit gates to 37 two-qubit gates (with a marginal trade-off of 0.33 and 0.31 percent in the PDM for SrH and SrF in their respective 6-spin orbital active spaces). We anticipate that our proof-of-concept demonstration lays the groundwork for future quantum hardware calculations involving heavy atoms and molecules.</description>

      <title>Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz for the Preparation and Detection of Long-Lived Singlet States in NMR</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05015</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.05015v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Designing efficient and robust quantum control strategies is vital for developing quantum technologies. One recent strategy is the Quantum Alternating Operator Ansatz (QAOA) sequence that alternatively propagates under two noncommuting Hamiltonians, whose control parameters can be optimized to generate a gate or prepare a state. Here, we describe the design of the QAOA sequence and their variants to prepare long-lived singlet states (LLS) from the thermal state in NMR. With extraordinarily long lifetimes exceeding the spin-lattice relaxation time constant $T_1$, LLS have been of great interest for various applications, from spectroscopy to medical imaging. Accordingly, designing sequences for efficiently preparing LLS in a general spin system is crucial. Using numerical analysis, we study the efficiency and robustness of the QAOA sequences over a wide range of errors in the control parameters. Using a two-qubit NMR register, we conduct an experimental study to benchmark QAOA sequences against other prominent methods of LLS preparation and observe the significantly superior performance of the QAOA sequences.</description>

      <title>ChemReasoner: Heuristic Search over a Large Language Model's Knowledge Space using Quantum-Chemical Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10980v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of new catalysts is essential for the design of new and more efficient chemical processes in order to transition to a sustainable future. We introduce an AI-guided computational screening framework unifying linguistic reasoning with quantum-chemistry based feedback from 3D atomistic representations. Our approach formulates catalyst discovery as an uncertain environment where an agent actively searches for highly effective catalysts via the iterative combination of large language model (LLM)-derived hypotheses and atomistic graph neural network (GNN)-derived feedback. Identified catalysts in intermediate search steps undergo structural evaluation based on spatial orientation, reaction pathways, and stability. Scoring functions based on adsorption energies and reaction energy barriers steer the exploration in the LLM's knowledge space toward energetically favorable, high-efficiency catalysts. We introduce planning methods that automatically guide the exploration without human input, providing competitive performance against expert-enumerated chemical descriptor-based implementations. By integrating language-guided reasoning with computational chemistry feedback, our work pioneers AI-accelerated, trustworthy catalyst discovery.</description>

      <title>Neural Pfaffians: Solving Many Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14762</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.14762v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neural wave functions accomplished unprecedented accuracies in approximating the ground state of many-electron systems, though at a high computational cost. Recent works proposed amortizing the cost by learning generalized wave functions across different structures and compounds instead of solving each problem independently. Enforcing the permutation antisymmetry of electrons in such generalized neural wave functions remained challenging as existing methods require discrete orbital selection via non-learnable hand-crafted algorithms. This work tackles the problem by defining overparametrized, fully learnable neural wave functions suitable for generalization across molecules. We achieve this by relying on Pfaffians rather than Slater determinants. The Pfaffian allows us to enforce the antisymmetry on arbitrary electronic systems without any constraint on electronic spin configurations or molecular structure. Our empirical evaluation finds that a single neural Pfaffian calculates the ground state and ionization energies with chemical accuracy across various systems. On the TinyMol dataset, we outperform the `gold-standard' CCSD(T) CBS reference energies by 1.9m$E_h$ and reduce energy errors compared to previous generalized neural wave functions by up to an order of magnitude.</description>
