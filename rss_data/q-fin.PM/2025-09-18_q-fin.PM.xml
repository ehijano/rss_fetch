      <title>Income Disaster, Role of Income Support, and Optimal Retirement</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12874</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12874v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper investigates the interactions among consumption/savings, investment, and retirement choices with income disaster. We consider low-income people who are exposed to income disaster so that they retire involuntarily when income disaster occurs. The government provides extra income support to low-income retirees who suffer from significant income gaps. We demonstrate that the decision to enter retirement in the event of income disaster depends crucially on the level of income support. In particular, we quantitatively identify a certain income support level below which the optimal decision is to delay retirement. This implies that availability of the government's extra income support can be particularly important for the low-income people to achieve optimal retirement with income disaster.</description>

      <title>Optimal Data Splitting for Holdout Cross-Validation in Large Covariance Matrix Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.15186v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Cross-validation is a statistical tool that can be used to improve large covariance matrix estimation. Although its efficiency is observed in practical applications and a convergence result towards the error of the non linear shrinkage is available in the high-dimensional regime, formal proofs that take into account the finite sample size effects are currently lacking. To carry on analytical analysis, we focus on the holdout method, a single iteration of cross-validation, rather than the traditional $k$-fold approach. We derive a closed-form expression for the expected estimation error when the population matrix follows a white inverse Wishart distribution, and we observe the optimal train-test split scales as the square root of the matrix dimension. For general population matrices, we connected the error to the variance of eigenvalues distribution, but approximations are necessary. In this framework and in the high-dimensional asymptotic regime, both the holdout and $k$-fold cross-validation methods converge to the optimal estimator when the train-test ratio scales with the square root of the matrix dimension which is coherent with the existing theory.</description>
