      <title>Quantum Cognition Machine Learning for Forecasting Chromosomal Instability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03199v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The accurate prediction of chromosomal instability from the morphology of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) enables real-time detection of CTCs with high metastatic potential in the context of liquid biopsy diagnostics. However, it presents a significant challenge due to the high dimensionality and complexity of single-cell digital pathology data. Here, we introduce the application of Quantum Cognition Machine Learning (QCML), a quantum-inspired computational framework, to estimate morphology-predicted chromosomal instability in CTCs from patients with metastatic breast cancer. QCML leverages quantum mechanical principles to represent data as state vectors in a Hilbert space, enabling context-aware feature modeling, dimensionality reduction, and enhanced generalization without requiring curated feature selection. QCML outperforms conventional machine learning methods when tested on out of sample verification CTCs, achieving higher accuracy in identifying predicted large-scale state transitions (pLST) status from CTC-derived morphology features. These preliminary findings support the application of QCML as a novel machine learning tool with superior performance in high-dimensional, low-sample-size biomedical contexts. QCML enables the simulation of cognition-like learning for the identification of biologically meaningful prediction of chromosomal instability from CTC morphology, offering a novel tool for CTC classification in liquid biopsy.</description>

      <title>Predicting Postoperative Stroke in Elderly SICU Patients: An Interpretable Machine Learning Model Using MIMIC Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Postoperative stroke remains a critical complication in elderly surgical intensive care unit (SICU) patients, contributing to prolonged hospitalization, elevated healthcare costs, and increased mortality. Accurate early risk stratification is essential to enable timely intervention and improve clinical outcomes. We constructed a combined cohort of 19,085 elderly SICU admissions from the MIMIC-III and MIMIC-IV databases and developed an interpretable machine learning (ML) framework to predict in-hospital stroke using clinical data from the first 24 hours of Intensive Care Unit (ICU) stay. The preprocessing pipeline included removal of high-missingness features, iterative Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) imputation, z-score normalization, one-hot encoding, and class imbalance correction via the Adaptive Synthetic Sampling (ADASYN) algorithm. A two-stage feature selection process-combining Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP)-reduced the initial 80 variables to 20 clinically informative predictors. Among eight ML models evaluated, CatBoost achieved the best performance with an AUROC of 0.8868 (95% CI: 0.8802--0.8937). SHAP analysis and ablation studies identified prior cerebrovascular disease, serum creatinine, and systolic blood pressure as the most influential risk factors. Our results highlight the potential of interpretable ML approaches to support early detection of postoperative stroke and inform decision-making in perioperative critical care.</description>

      <title>UniSite: The First Cross-Structure Dataset and Learning Framework for End-to-End Ligand Binding Site Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03237</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03237v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The detection of ligand binding sites for proteins is a fundamental step in Structure-Based Drug Design. Despite notable advances in recent years, existing methods, datasets, and evaluation metrics are confronted with several key challenges: (1) current datasets and methods are centered on individual protein-ligand complexes and neglect that diverse binding sites may exist across multiple complexes of the same protein, introducing significant statistical bias; (2) ligand binding site detection is typically modeled as a discontinuous workflow, employing binary segmentation and subsequent clustering algorithms; (3) traditional evaluation metrics do not adequately reflect the actual performance of different binding site prediction methods. To address these issues, we first introduce UniSite-DS, the first UniProt (Unique Protein)-centric ligand binding site dataset, which contains 4.81 times more multi-site data and 2.08 times more overall data compared to the previously most widely used datasets. We then propose UniSite, the first end-to-end ligand binding site detection framework supervised by set prediction loss with bijective matching. In addition, we introduce Average Precision based on Intersection over Union (IoU) as a more accurate evaluation metric for ligand binding site prediction. Extensive experiments on UniSite-DS and several representative benchmark datasets demonstrate that IoU-based Average Precision provides a more accurate reflection of prediction quality, and that UniSite outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in ligand binding site detection. The dataset and codes will be made publicly available at https://github.com/quanlin-wu/unisite.</description>

      <title>Protein folding classes -- High-dimensional geometry of amino acid composition space revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01857v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this study, the distributions of protein folding classes of experimentally determined structures from a legacy dataset and a comprehensive database SCOPe are modeled with precise geometric objects as convex polytopes in the high-dimensional amino acid composition space. This is a follow-up of a previous non-statistical, geometry-motivated modeling of protein classes with ellipsoidal models, which are superseded presently in three important respects: (1) as a paradigm shift descriptive 'distribution models' of experimental data are de-coupled from, and serves as the basis for, future potential predictive 'domain models' generalizable to proteins in the same structure class for which the 3-dimensional structures have yet to be determined experimentally, (2) the geometric and analytic characteristics of class distributions are obtained via exact computational geometry calculations, and (3) the full data from a comprehensive database are included in such calculations, eschewing training set selection and biases. In contrast to statistical inference and machine-learning approaches, the analytical, non-statistical geometry models of protein class distributions demonstrated in this study, complete with precise information on the size of class distributions and their relative disposition in the high-dimensional space, and intended not principally for prediction but as accurate description of the complex relationships between amino acid composition and protein classes, suggest that they may ultimately be useful adjuncts for validating sequence-based methods for predicting protein structures and contribute to the mechanistic understanding of secondary structure formation and the folding of polypeptide chains into 3-dimensional conformation of functional protein molecules.</description>

      <title>scDataset: Scalable Data Loading for Deep Learning on Large-Scale Single-Cell Omics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01883</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.01883v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern single-cell datasets now comprise hundreds of millions of cells, presenting significant challenges for training deep learning models that require shuffled, memory-efficient data loading. While the AnnData format is the community standard for storing single-cell datasets, existing data loading solutions for AnnData are often inadequate: some require loading all data into memory, others convert to dense formats that increase storage demands, and many are hampered by slow random disk access. We present scDataset, a PyTorch IterableDataset that operates directly on one or more AnnData files without the need for format conversion. The core innovation is a combination of block sampling and batched fetching, which together balance randomness and I/O efficiency. On the Tahoe 100M dataset, scDataset achieves up to a 48$\times$ speed-up over AnnLoader, a 27$\times$ speed-up over HuggingFace Datasets, and an 18$\times$ speed-up over BioNeMo in single-core settings. These advances democratize large-scale single-cell model training for the broader research community.</description>

      <title>DLiPath: A Benchmark for the Comprehensive Assessment of Donor Liver Based on Histopathological Image Dataset</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03185</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03185v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Pathologists comprehensive evaluation of donor liver biopsies provides crucial information for accepting or discarding potential grafts. However, rapidly and accurately obtaining these assessments intraoperatively poses a significant challenge for pathologists. Features in donor liver biopsies, such as portal tract fibrosis, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning are correlated with transplant outcomes, yet quantifying these indicators suffers from substantial inter- and intra-observer variability. To address this, we introduce DLiPath, the first benchmark for comprehensive donor liver assessment based on a histopathology image dataset. We collected and publicly released 636 whole slide images from 304 donor liver patients at the Department of Pathology, the Third Xiangya Hospital, with expert annotations for key pathological features (including cholestasis, portal tract fibrosis, portal inflammation, total steatosis, macrovesicular steatosis, and hepatocellular ballooning). We selected nine state-of-the-art multiple-instance learning (MIL) models based on the DLiPath dataset as baselines for extensive comparative analysis. The experimental results demonstrate that several MIL models achieve high accuracy across donor liver assessment indicators on DLiPath, charting a clear course for future automated and intelligent donor liver assessment research.

      <title>Climate benefits of afforestation and reforestation with varying species mixtures and densities in the north-western boreal lands</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03300v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The boreal forest plays a crucial role as a global carbon sink. This study uses two 250-year simulations of Canada's Taiga Plains, an area targeted by the 2 Billion Trees Program to evaluate afforestation and reforestation strategies that vary by species mix, planting density, and surface albedo. Medium density stands, 600 to 1400 trees per hectare, composed of mixed species with approximately 25 to 40 percent deciduous trees sequestered 15 to 30 percent more net ecosystem carbon than conifer monocultures. These benefits stem from a combination of rapid early growth, long-term carbon retention, and enhanced resilience to disturbance. Replanting understocked stands with such mixtures increased long-term carbon storage by 18 to 30 percent relative to prevailing scenarios. When surface albedo was considered, pure evergreen or deciduous stands showed a reduction in climate benefit by 6 to 20 percent, while mixed stands maintained net cooling and achieved the highest sequestration rates, approximately 4.6 to 4.7 tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per hectare per year. Scenarios involving partial harvesting followed by replanting sustained or improved ecosystem carbon stocks, about 300 to 340 tons of carbon per hectare, and productivity, roughly 1.6 to 2.0 tons of carbon per hectare per year, without increasing ecological risk. Overall, integrating fast-growing deciduous species with long-lived conifers at moderate planting densities enhances the climate mitigation potential of boreal afforestation and reforestation efforts and offers guidance for reforestation policy in similar high latitude ecosystems.</description>

      <title>Internal replication as a tool for evaluating reproducibility in preclinical experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Reproducibility is central to the credibility of scientific findings, yet complete replication studies are costly and infrequent. However, many biological experiments contain internal replication, which is defined as repetition across batches, runs, days, litters, or sites that can be used to estimate reproducibility without requiring additional experiments. This internal replication is analogous to internal validation in prediction or machine learning models, but is often treated as a nuisance and removed by normalisation, missing an opportunity to assess the stability of results. Here, six types of internal replication are defined based on independence and timing. Using mice data from an experiment conducted at three independent sites, we demonstrate how to quantify and test for internal reproducibility. This approach provides a framework for quantifying reproducibility from existing data and reporting more robust statistical inferences in preclinical research.</description>

      <title>Circadian Clock Model with Sequestration Repression Motif: Existence of Periodic Orbits and Entrainment Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03649</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.03649v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Protein sequestration motifs appear in many biological regulatory networks and introduce special properties into the network dynamics. Sequestration can be described as a mode of inactivation of a given protein by its binding to a second protein to form a new complex. In this complexed form, the original protein is prevented from performing its specific functions and is thus rendered inactive. We study a mathematical model of the mammalian circadian clock with a protein sequestration motif, which generates one of the negative feedback loops that guarantees periodic behavior. First, the motif permits a time-scale separation, which can be used to simplify the model. We show that the simplified model admits a periodic orbit over a fairly large region of parameters. Second, we are able to show that the sequestration motif induces a phase response curve with a very specific form, implying that external perturbations can affect the system only in a narrow window of the periodic orbit. Finally, we compare our model with a classic Goodwin oscillator, to illustrate the dynamical and robustness properties induced by the protein sequestration motif.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2502.09775v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Building a virtual cell capable of accurately simulating cellular behaviors in silico has long been a dream in computational biology. We introduce CellFlux, an image-generative model that simulates cellular morphology changes induced by chemical and genetic perturbations using flow matching. Unlike prior methods, CellFlux models distribution-wise transformations from unperturbed to perturbed cell states, effectively distinguishing actual perturbation effects from experimental artifacts such as batch effects -- a major challenge in biological data. Evaluated on chemical (BBBC021), genetic (RxRx1), and combined perturbation (JUMP) datasets, CellFlux generates biologically meaningful cell images that faithfully capture perturbation-specific morphological changes, achieving a 35% improvement in FID scores and a 12% increase in mode-of-action prediction accuracy over existing methods. Additionally, CellFlux enables continuous interpolation between cellular states, providing a potential tool for studying perturbation dynamics. These capabilities mark a significant step toward realizing virtual cell modeling for biomedical research. Project page: https://yuhui-zh15.github.io/CellFlux/.</description>

      <title>Modular integration of neural connectomics, dynamics and biomechanics for identification of behavioral sensorimotor pathways in Caenorhabditis elegans</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.18073v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Computational approaches which emulate in-vivo nervous system are needed to investigate mechanisms of the brain to orchestrate behavior. Such approaches must integrate a series of biophysical models encompassing the nervous system, muscles, biomechanics to allow observing the system in its entirety while supporting model variations. Here we develop modWorm: a modular modeling framework for the nematode C. elegans. modWorm allows for construction of a model as an integrated series of configurable, exchangeable modules each describing specific biophysical processes across different modalities. Utilizing modWorm, we propose a base neuro-mechanical model for C. elegans built upon the complete connectome. The model integrates a series of 7 modules: i) intra-cellular dynamics, ii) electrical and iii) chemical extra-cellular neural dynamics, iv) translation of neural activity to muscle calcium dynamics, v) muscle calcium dynamics to muscle forces, vi) muscle forces to body postures and vii) proprioceptive feedback. We validate the base model by in-silico injection of constant currents into neurons known to be associated with locomotion behaviors and by applying external forces to the body. Applications of in-silico neural stimuli experimentally known to modulate locomotion show that the model can recapitulate natural behavioral responses such as forward and backward locomotion as well as mid-locomotion responses such as avoidance and turns. Furthermore, through in-silico ablation surveys, the model can infer novel neural circuits involved in sensorimotor behaviors. To further dissect mechanisms of locomotion, we utilize modWorm to introduce empirical based model variations and model optimizations to elucidate their effects on simulated locomotion. Our results show that modWorm can be utilized to identify neural circuits which control, mediate and generate natural behavior.</description>

Abstract: Monitoring wildlife is essential for ecology and ethology, especially in light of the increasing human impact on ecosystems. Camera traps have emerged as habitat-centric sensors enabling the study of wildlife populations at scale with minimal disturbance. However, the lack of annotated video datasets limits the development of powerful video understanding models needed to process the vast amount of fieldwork data collected. To advance research in wild animal behavior monitoring we present MammAlps, a multimodal and multi-view dataset of wildlife behavior monitoring from 9 camera-traps in the Swiss National Park. MammAlps contains over 14 hours of video with audio, 2D segmentation maps and 8.5 hours of individual tracks densely labeled for species and behavior. Based on 6135 single animal clips, we propose the first hierarchical and multimodal animal behavior recognition benchmark using audio, video and reference scene segmentation maps as inputs. Furthermore, we also propose a second ecology-oriented benchmark aiming at identifying activities, species, number of individuals and meteorological conditions from 397 multi-view and long-term ecological events, including false positive triggers. We advocate that both tasks are complementary and contribute to bridging the gap between machine learning and ecology.

Abstract: Drug discovery is fundamentally a process of inferring the effects of treatments on patients, and would therefore benefit immensely from computational models that can reliably simulate patient responses, enabling researchers to generate and test large numbers of therapeutic hypotheses safely and economically before initiating costly clinical trials. Even a more specific model that predicts the functional response of cells to a wide range of perturbations would be tremendously valuable for discovering safe and effective treatments that successfully translate to the clinic. Creating such virtual cells has long been a goal of the computational research community that unfortunately remains unachieved given the daunting complexity and scale of cellular biology. Nevertheless, recent advances in AI, computing power, lab automation, and high-throughput cellular profiling provide new opportunities for reaching this goal. In this perspective, we present a vision for developing and evaluating virtual cells that builds on our experience at Recursion. We argue that in order to be a useful tool to discover novel biology, virtual cells must accurately predict the functional response of a cell to perturbations and explain how the predicted response is a consequence of modifications to key biomolecular interactions. We then introduce key principles for designing therapeutically-relevant virtual cells, describe a lab-in-the-loop approach for generating novel insights with them, and advocate for biologically-grounded benchmarks to guide virtual cell development. Finally, we make the case that our approach to virtual cells provides a useful framework for building other models at higher levels of organization, including virtual patients. We hope that these directions prove useful to the research community in developing virtual models optimized for positive impact on drug discovery outcomes.</description>
