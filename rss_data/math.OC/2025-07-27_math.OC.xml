      <title>Multi-Year Maintenance Planning for Large-Scale Infrastructure Systems: A Novel Network Deep Q-Learning Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18732v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Infrastructure asset management is essential for sustaining the performance of public infrastructure such as road networks, bridges, and utility networks. Traditional maintenance and rehabilitation planning methods often face scalability and computational challenges, particularly for large-scale networks with thousands of assets under budget constraints. This paper presents a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework that optimizes asset management strategies for large infrastructure networks. By decomposing the network-level Markov Decision Process (MDP) into individual asset-level MDPs while using a unified neural network architecture, the proposed framework reduces computational complexity, improves learning efficiency, and enhances scalability. The framework directly incorporates annual budget constraints through a budget allocation mechanism, ensuring maintenance plans are both optimal and cost-effective. Through a case study on a large-scale pavement network of 68,800 segments, the proposed DRL framework demonstrates significant improvements over traditional methods like Progressive Linear Programming and genetic algorithms, both in efficiency and network performance. This advancement contributes to infrastructure asset management and the broader application of reinforcement learning in complex, large-scale environments.</description>

      <title>Relaxed and inertial nonlinear Forward-Backward algorithm</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18856</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18856v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Nonlinear Forward-Backward (NFB) algorithm, also known as warped resolvent iterations, is a splitting method for finding zeros of sums of monotone operators. In particular cases, NFB reduces to well-known algorithms such as Forward-Backward, Forward-Backward-Forward, Chambolle--Pock, and Condat-Vu. Therefore, NFB can be used to solve monotone inclusions involving sums of maximally monotone, cocoercive, monotone and Lipschitz operators as well as linear compositions terms. In this article, we study the convergence of NFB with inertial and relaxation steps. Our results recover known convergence guarantees for the aforementioned methods when extended with inertial and relaxation terms. Additionally, we establish the convergence of inertial and relaxed variants of the Forward-Backward-Half-Forward and Forward-Primal--Dual-Half-Forward algorithms, which, to the best of our knowledge, are new contributions. We consider both nondecreasing and decreasing sequences of inertial parameters, the latter being a novel approach in the context of inertial algorithms. To evaluate the performance of these strategies, we present numerical experiments on optimization problems with affine constraints and on image restoration tasks. Our results show that decreasing inertial sequences can accelerate the numerical convergence of the algorithms.</description>

      <title>Energy function approximations for differential algebraic polynomial systems of Stokes-type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18909</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18909v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Energy functions are generalizations of controllability and observability Gramians to nonlinear systems and as such find applications in both nonlinear balanced truncation and feedback control. These energy functions are solutions to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equations partial differential equations defined over spatial dimensions determined by the number of state variables in the nonlinear system. Thus, they cannot be resolved with local basis functions for problems of even modest dimension. In this paper, we extend recent results that utilize Kronecker products to generate polynomial approximations to HJB equations. Specifically, we consider the addition of linear drift terms that exhibit a Stokes-type differential-algebraic equation (DAE) structure. This extension leverages the so-called strangeness framework for DAEs to create separate sets of algebraic and differential variables with differential equations that only involve the differential variables and algebraic equations that relate them both. At this point, the existing polynomial approximations using Kronecker products can be applied to find approximations to the energy functions. This approach is demonstrated for two polynomial feedback control problems. The standard transformation destroys the sparsity in the original system. Thus, we also present a formulation that preserves the original sparsity structure and serves as the entry point for the future creation of matrix-free algorithms.</description>

      <title>Fracture propagation by using shape optimization techniques based on outer Riemannian metrics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19112</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19112v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we investigate a novel approach for the simulation of two-dimensional, brittle, quasi-static fracture problems based on a shape optimization approach. In contrast to the commonly-used phase-field approach, this proposed approach for investigating fracture paths does not require a specified `length-scale' parameter defining the diffuse interface region nor a level set function. Instead, it interprets the fracture as part of the boundary of the domain and uses shape optimization algorithms to minimize the energy in the system and therefore describes the fracture propagation directly. Embedding the problem of energy minimization in a Riemannian manifold framework formulated on a suitable shape space, together with the choice of an outer Riemannian metric, yields both advantages from an analytical as well as an applied perspective. Furthermore, an eigenvalue decomposition of the strain tensor is used to produce more realistic fracture paths (the so-called strain splitting), which only allows fracture growth from tensile loads. Numerical simulations for the commonly considered single-edge notch tension and shear test are performed and the results are evaluated in comparison to phase-field results.</description>

      <title>Existence of Strong Randomized Equilibria in Mean-Field Games of Optimal Stopping with Common Noise</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19123v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a mean-field game of optimal stopping and investigate the existence of strong solutions via a connection with the Bank-El Karoui's representation problem. Under certain continuity assumptions, where the common noise is generated by a countable partition, we show that a strong randomized mean-field equilibrium exists, in which the mean-field interaction term is adapted to the common noise and the stopping time is randomized. Furthermore, under suitable monotonicity assumptions and for a general common noise, we provide a comparative statics analysis of the set of strong mean-field equilibria with strict equilibrium stopping times.</description>

      <title>Optimal Control of Hybrid Systems via Measure Relaxations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19210</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19210v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose an approach to trajectory optimization for piecewise polynomial systems based on the recently proposed graphs of convex sets framework. We instantiate the framework with a convex relaxation of optimal control based on occupation measures, resulting in a convex optimization problem resembling the discrete shortest-paths linear program that can be solved efficiently to global optimality. While this approach inherits the limitations of semidefinite programming, scalability to large numbers of discrete modes improves compared to the NP-hard mixed-integer formulation. We use this to plan trajectories under temporal logic specifications, comparing the computed cost lower bound to a nonconvex optimization approach with fixed mode sequence. In our numerical experiments, we find that this bound is typically in the vicinity of the nonconvex solution, while the runtime speedup is significant compared to the often intractable mixed-integer formulation. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/ebuehrle/hpoc.</description>

      <title>An inexact alternating projection method with application to matrix completion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19224</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19224v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop and analyze an inexact regularized alternating projection method for nonconvex feasibility problems. Such a method employs inexact projections on one of the two sets, according to a set of well-defined conditions. We prove the global convergence of the algorithm, provided that a certain merit function satisfies the Kurdyka-Lojasiewicz property on its domain. The method is then specialized to the class of affine rank minimization problems, which includes matrix completion as a special case. We approximate the truncated Singular Value Decomposition of the matrix that has to be projected by means of a Krylov solver, and provide suitable stopping criteria for the Krylov method complying with the theoretical inexactness conditions. The information needed to implement such stopping criteria do not require an extra computational effort as they are a by-product of the Krylov method itself and avoid the so called oversolving phenomena. Results of the numerical validation of the algorithm on matrix completion problems are presented.</description>

      <title>Two-Person Additively-Separable Sum Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19325v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a subclass of bimatrix games which we refer to as two person additively separable sum games, where the sum of the payoffs of the two players is additively separable. The payoff to the row player at each pair of pure strategies, is the sum of two numbers, the first of which may be dependent on the pure strategy chosen by the column player and the second being independent of the pure strategy chosen by the column player. The payoff to the column player at each pair of pure strategies, is also the sum of two numbers, the first of which may be dependent on the pure strategy chosen by the row player and the second being independent of the pure strategy chosen by the row player. The sum of the interdependent components of the payoffs of the two players is assumed to be zero. We show that a randomized or mixed strategy pair is an equilibrium of the game if and only if there exist two other real numbers such that the three together solve a certain linear programming problem. In order to prove this result, we need to appeal to the existence of an equilibrium for the two person additively separable sum game. Before proving the desired result concerning the equivalence of the two sets, we provided a simple proof of the existence of equilibrium for two person additively separable sum games, using the strong duality theorem and the complementary slackness theorem of linear programming.</description>

      <title>Joint Inference of Trajectory and Obstacle in Mean-Field Games via Bilevel Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19344</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19344v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mean field game (MFG) is an expressive modeling framework for systems with a continuum of interacting agents. While many approaches exist for solving the forward MFG, few have studied its \textit{inverse} problem. In this work, we seek to recover optimal agent trajectories and the unseen spatial obstacle given partial observation on the former. To this end, we use a special type of generative models, normalizing flow, to represent the trajectories and propose a novel formulation of inverse MFG as a bilevel optimization (BLO) problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across various MFG scenarios, including those involving multi-modal and disjoint obstacles, highlighting its robustness with respect to obstacle complexity and dimensionality. Alternatively, our formulation can be interpreted as regularizing maximum likelihood trajectory learning with MFG assumptions, which improves generalization performance especially with scarce training data. Impressively, our method also recovers the hidden obstacle with high fidelity in this low-data regime.</description>

      <title>Linearly Convergent Algorithms for Nonsmooth Problems with Unknown Smooth Pieces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19465</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19465v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We develop efficient algorithms for optimizing piecewise smooth (PWS) functions where the underlying partition of the domain into smooth pieces is \emph{unknown}. For PWS functions satisfying a quadratic growth (QG) condition, we propose a bundle-level (BL) type method that achieves global linear convergence -- to our knowledge, the first such result for any algorithm for this problem class. We extend this method to handle approximately PWS functions and to solve weakly-convex PWS problems, improving the state-of-the-art complexity to match the benchmark for smooth non-convex optimization. Furthermore, we introduce the first verifiable and accurate termination criterion for PWS optimization. Similar to the gradient norm in smooth optimization, this certificate tightly characterizes the optimality gap under the QG condition, and can moreover be evaluated without knowledge of any problem parameters. We develop a search subroutine for this certificate and embed it within a guess-and-check framework, resulting in an almost parameter-free algorithm for both the convex QG and weakly-convex settings.</description>

      <title>Symmetry-reduced model reduction of shift-equivariant systems via operator inference</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18780</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18780v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider data-driven reduced-order models of partial differential equations with shift equivariance. Shift-equivariant systems typically admit traveling solutions, and the main idea of our approach is to represent the solution in a traveling reference frame, in which it can be described by a relatively small number of basis functions. Existing methods for operator inference allow one to approximate a reduced-order model directly from data, without knowledge of the full-order dynamics. Our method adds additional terms to ensure that the reduced-order model not only approximates the spatially frozen profile of the solution, but also estimates the traveling speed as a function of that profile. We validate our approach using the Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation, a one-dimensional partial differential equation that exhibits traveling solutions and spatiotemporal chaos. Results indicate that our method robustly captures traveling solutions, and exhibits improved numerical stability over the standard operator inference approach.</description>

      <title>Wavefront super-resolution for Adaptive Optics systems on ground-based telescopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19150</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19150v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In ground-based astronomy, Adaptive Optics (AO) is a pivotal technique, engineered to correct wavefront phase distortions and thereby enhance the quality of the observed images. Integral to an AO system is the wavefront sensor (WFS), which is crucial for detecting wavefront aberrations from guide stars, essential for phase calculations. Many models based on a single-WFS model have been proposed to obtain the high-resolution phase of the incoming wavefront. In this paper, we delve into the realm of multiple WFSs within the framework of state-of-the-art telescope setups for high-resolution phase reconstruction. We propose a model for reconstructing a high-resolution wavefront from a sequence of wavefront gradient data from multiple WFSs. Our model is based on the turbulence statistics and the Taylor frozen flow hypothesis, incorporating knowledge of the wind velocities in atmospheric turbulence layers. We also introduce an $H_2$ regularization term, especially for atmospheric characteristics under von Karman statistics, and provide a theoretical analysis for $H^2$ space within $H^{11/6}$. Numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the robustness and effectiveness of our regularization term and multi-WFS reconstruction strategy under identical experimental conditions.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Framework for Multi-Year Asset Management Under Budget Constraints</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19458v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Budget planning and maintenance optimization are crucial for infrastructure asset management, ensuring cost-effectiveness and sustainability. However, the complexity arising from combinatorial action spaces, diverse asset deterioration, stringent budget constraints, and environmental uncertainty significantly limits existing methods' scalability. This paper proposes a Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning methodology specifically tailored to multi-year infrastructure planning. Our approach decomposes the problem into two hierarchical levels: a high-level Budget Planner allocating annual budgets within explicit feasibility bounds, and a low-level Maintenance Planner prioritizing assets within the allocated budget. By structurally separating macro-budget decisions from asset-level prioritization and integrating linear programming projection within a hierarchical Soft Actor-Critic framework, the method efficiently addresses exponential growth in the action space and ensures rigorous budget compliance. A case study evaluating sewer networks of varying sizes (10, 15, and 20 sewersheds) illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Compared to conventional Deep Q-Learning and enhanced genetic algorithms, our methodology converges more rapidly, scales effectively, and consistently delivers near-optimal solutions even as network size grows.</description>

      <title>Non-Sequential Decentralized Stochastic Control Revisited: Causality and Static Reducibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.03949</link>
      <description>arXiv:2211.03949v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In decentralized stochastic control (or stochastic team theory) and game theory, if there is a pre-defined order in a system in which agents act, the system is called \textit{sequential}, otherwise it is non-sequential. Much of the literature on stochastic control theory, such as studies on the existence analysis, approximation methods, and on dynamic programming or other analytical or learning theoretic methods, have focused on sequential systems. Many complex practical systems, however, are non-sequential where the order of agents acting is random, and dependent on the realization of solution paths and prior actions taken. The study of such systems is particularly challenging as tools applicable for sequential models are not directly applicable. In this paper, we will first revisit the notion of Causality (a definition due to Witsenhausen and which has been refined by Andersland and Tekenetzis), and provide an alternative representation using imaginary agents. We show that Causality is equivalent to Causal Implementability (and Dead-Lock Freeness), thus, generalizing previous results and addressing an open question noted by Teneketzis. We show that Causality, under an absolute continuity condition, allows for an equivalent static model whose reduction is policy-independent. Since the static reduction method for sequential control problems (via change of measures or other techniques), has been shown to be very effective in arriving at existence, structural, approximation and learning theoretic results, our analysis facilitates much of the stochastic analysis available for sequential systems to also be applicable for a class of non-sequential systems.</description>

      <title>Doubly Regularized Entropic Wasserstein Barycenters</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.11844v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a general formulation of regularized Wasserstein barycenters that enjoys favorable regularity, approximation, stability and (grid-free) optimization properties. This barycenter is defined as the unique probability measure that minimizes the sum of entropic optimal transport (EOT) costs with respect to a family of given probability measures, plus an entropy term. We denote it $(\lambda,\tau)$-barycenter, where $\lambda$ is the inner regularization strength and $\tau$ the outer one. This formulation recovers several previously proposed EOT barycenters for various choices of $\lambda,\tau \geq 0$ and generalizes them. First, in spite of -- and in fact owing to -- being \emph{doubly} regularized, we show that our formulation is debiased for $\tau=\lambda/2$: the suboptimality in the (unregularized) Wasserstein barycenter objective is, for smooth densities, of the order of the strength $\lambda^2$ of entropic regularization, instead of $\max\{\lambda,\tau\}$ in general. We discuss this phenomenon for isotropic Gaussians where all $(\lambda,\tau)$-barycenters have closed form. Second, we show that for $\lambda,\tau&gt;0$, this barycenter has a smooth density and is strongly stable under perturbation of the marginals. In particular, it can be estimated efficiently: given $n$ samples from each of the probability measures, it converges in relative entropy to the population barycenter at a rate $n^{-1/2}$. And finally, this formulation lends itself naturally to a grid-free optimization algorithm: we propose a simple \emph{noisy particle gradient descent} which, in the mean-field limit, converges globally at an exponential rate to the barycenter.</description>

      <title>Stochastic Approximation for Expectation Objective and Expectation Inequality-Constrained Nonconvex Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02943</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.02943v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Stochastic Approximation has been a prominent set of tools for solving problems with noise and uncertainty. Increasingly, it becomes important to solve optimization problems wherein there is noise in both a set of constraints that a practitioner requires the system to adhere to, as well as the objective, which typically involves some empirical loss. We present the first stochastic approximation approach for solving this class of problems using the Ghost framework of incorporating penalty functions for analysis of a sequential convex programming approach together with a Monte Carlo estimator of nonlinear maps. We provide almost sure convergence guarantees and demonstrate the performance of the procedure on some representative examples.</description>

      <title>Modeling Nonlinear Control Systems via Koopman Control Family: Universal Forms and Subspace Invariance Proximity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.15368</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.15368v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper introduces the Koopman Control Family (KCF), a mathematical framework for modeling general (not necessarily control-affine) discrete-time nonlinear control systems with the aim of providing a solid theoretical foundation for the use of Koopman-based methods in systems with inputs. We demonstrate that the concept of KCF captures the behavior of nonlinear control systems on a (potentially infinite-dimensional) function space. By employing a generalized notion of subspace invariance under the KCF, we establish a universal form for finite-dimensional models, which encompasses the commonly used linear, bilinear, and linear switched models as specific instances. In cases where the subspace is not invariant under the KCF, we propose a method for approximating models in general form and characterize the model's accuracy using the concept of invariance proximity. We end by discussing how the proposed framework naturally lends itself to data-driven modeling of control systems.</description>

      <title>LMI hierarchies for stability analysis of ReLU feedback systems</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.04016v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the stability analysis of feedback systems with rectified linear unit (ReLU) activations, and model this problem with polynomial optimization. Stability can be certified by means of copositive multipliers in the framework of integral quadratic constraints. Based on a duality argument, we show how to certify instability by considering a complete hierarchy of linear matrix inequalities. This hierarchy is obtained by leveraging the specific equality constraints arising from the ReLU encoding. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach through several numerical examples.</description>

      <title>Stable gradient-adjusted root mean square propagation on least squares problem</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15877v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Root mean square propagation (abbreviated as RMSProp) is a first-order stochastic algorithm used in machine learning widely. In this paper, a stable gradient-adjusted RMSProp (abbreviated as SGA-RMSProp) with mini-batch stochastic gradient is proposed, and its properties are studied on the linear least squares problem. R-linear convergence of the algorithm is established on the consistent linear least squares problem. The algorithm is also proved to converge R-linearly to a neighborhood of the minimizer for the inconsistent case, with the region of the neighborhood being controlled by the batch size. Furthermore, numerical experiments are conducted to compare the performances of SGA-RMSProp, stochastic gradient descent (abbreviated as SGD), and the original RMSProp with different batch sizes. The faster initial convergence rate of SGA-RMSProp is observed through numerical experiments and an adaptive strategy for switching from SGA-RMSProp to SGD is proposed, which combines the benefits of these two algorithms.</description>

      <title>Examining Entropic Unbalanced Optimal Transport and Sinkhorn Divergences for Spatial Forecast Verification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16063</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.16063v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: An optimal transport (OT) problem seeks to find the cheapest mapping between two distributions with equal total density, given the cost of transporting density from one place to another. Unbalanced OT allows for different total density in each distribution. This is the typical setting for precipitation forecast and observation data, when considering the densities as accumulated rainfall, or intensity. In this work, entropic unbalanced OT and its associated Sinkhorn divergence are examined as a spatial forecast verification method for precipitation data. It offers many attractive features, such as morphing one field into another, defining a distance between fields and providing feature based optimal assignment. It is found that the Sinkhorn divergence is robust against the common double penalty problem (a form of phase error), on average aligns with expert assessments of model performance, and allows for a variety of novel pictorial illustrations of error. It provides informative summary scores, and has few limitations to its application. Combined, these findings place unbalanced entropy regularised optimal transport and the Sinkhorn divergence as an informative method which follows geometric intuition.</description>

      <title>Closed Bounded Rational Framing Motions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.18199v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a method for constructing all bounded rational motions that frame a space curve $\mathbf{r}(t)$. This means that the motion guides an orthogonal frame along the curve such that one frame axis is in direction of the curve tangent. Existence of (bounded) framing motions is equivalent to $\mathbf{r}(t)$ being a (bounded) rational Pythagorean Hodograph curve. In contrast to previous constructions that rely on polynomial curves with smooth self-intersection, our motions and curves are infinitely differentiable. To this end, we develop the theory of Pythagorean hodograph curves parameterized over the projective line. We also provide a simple geometric necessary and sufficient condition on the spherical part of the motion, given by the homogeneous quaternionic preimage of the Pythagorean hodograph curve, that ensures the existence of a corresponding bounded, rational, and even regular framing motion. The translation part comes from the speed distribution, which must be a special positive rational function. This can in practice be ensured by semidefinite optimization methods. We illustrate our findings with a number of examples.</description>

      <title>On the Linear Programming Model for Dynamic Stochastic Matching and Its Application on Pricing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09924</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09924v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Important pricing problems in centralized matching markets -- such as carpooling and food delivery platforms -- often exhibit a bi-level structure. At the upper level, the platform sets prices for different types of agents (e.g., riders with various origins and destinations, or delivery orders from diverse restaurants to customer locations). The lower level then matches converted agents to minimize operational costs, such as pooling riders with similar itineraries into the same vehicle or consolidating multiple delivery orders into a single trip. Motivated by these applications, we study the optimal value (cost) function of a linear programming model with respect to agent arrival rates, originally proposed by Aouad and Saritac (2022) for cost-minimizing dynamic stochastic matching under limited time. In particular, we investigate the concavity of this cost function. We show that weak concavity holds when there are fewer than or equal to three agent types with identical patience level. For an arbitrary number of agent types, (weak) concavity is more likely to hold when agents have high or similar patience, or when agents are more heterogeneous in their matching efficiencies. Building on these theoretical insights, we develop a Minorize-Maximization (MM) algorithm for the pricing problem that requires little stepsize tuning, and demonstrate substantial performance improvements over projected gradient-based methods on a large-scale, real-world ridesharing dataset. This makes it a compelling algorithmic choice for solving such pricing problems in practice.</description>

      <title>On exploration of an interior mirror descent flow for stochastic nonconvex constrained problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.15264v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problem defined over nonconvex constraints, where the feasible set is given by the intersection of the closure of an open set and a smooth manifold. By endowing the open set with a Riemannian metric induced by a barrier function, we obtain a Riemannian subgradient flow formulated as a differential inclusion, which remains strictly within the interior of the feasible set. This continuous dynamical system unifies two classes of iterative optimization methods, namely the Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme, by revealing that these methods can be interpreted as discrete approximations of the continuous flow. We explore the long-term behavior of the trajectories generated by this dynamical system and show that the existing deficient convergence properties of the Hessian barrier and mirror descent scheme can be unifily and more insightfully interpreted through these of the continuous trajectory. For instance, the notorious spurious stationary points \cite{chen2024spurious} observed in Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme are interpreted as stable equilibria of the dynamical system that do not correspond to real stationary points of the original optimization problem. We provide two sufficient condition such that these spurious stationary points can be avoided if the strict complementarity conditions holds. In the absence of these regularity condition, we propose a random perturbation strategy that ensures the trajectory converges (subsequentially) to an approximate stationary point. Building on these insights, we introduce two iterative Riemannian subgradient methods, form of interior point methods, that generalizes the existing Hessian barrier method and mirror descent scheme for solving nonsmooth nonconvex optimization problems.</description>

      <title>General Proximal Quasi-Newton Methods based on model functions for nonsmooth nonconvex problems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18363</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.18363v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this manuscript, we propose a general proximal quasi-Newton method tailored for nonconvex and nonsmooth optimization problems, where we do not require the sequence of the variable metric (or Hessian approximation) to be uniformly bounded as a prerequisite, instead, the variable metric is updated by a continuous matrix generator. From the respective of the algorithm, the objective function is approximated by the so-called local model function and subproblems aim to exploit the proximal point(s) of such model function, which help to achieve the sufficiently decreasing functional sequence along with the backtracking line search principle. Under mild assumptions in terms of the first-order information of the model function, every accumulation point of the generated sequence is stationary and the sequence of the variable metric is proved not to be bounded. Additionally, if the function has the Kurdyka-{\L}ojasiewicz property at the corresponding accumulation point, we find that the whole sequence is convergent to the stationary point, and the sequence of the variable metric is proved to be uniformly bounded. Through the above results, we think that the boundedness of the sequence of the variable metric should depend on the regularity of objectives, rather than being assumed as a prior for nonsmooth optimization problems. Numerical experiments on polytope feasibility problems and (sparse) quadratic inverse problems demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model-based proximal quasi-Newton method, in comparison with the associated model-based proximal gradient method.</description>

      <title>GREAT: Grassmannian REcursive Algorithm for Tracking &amp; Online System Identification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09052</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.09052v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces an online approach for identifying time-varying subspaces defined by linear dynamical systems. The approach of representing linear systems by non-parametric subspace models has received significant interest in the field of data-driven control recently. This system representation enables us to provide rigorous guarantees for linear time-varying systems, which are difficult to obtain for parametric system models. The proposed method leverages optimization on the Grassmann manifold leading to the Grassmannian Recursive Algorithm for Tracking (GREAT). We view subspaces as points on the Grassmann manifold and adapt the estimate based on online data by performing optimization on the manifold. At each time step, a single measurement from the current subspace corrupted by a bounded error is available. The subspace estimate is updated online using Grassmannian gradient descent on a cost function incorporating a window of the most recent data. Under suitable assumptions on the signal-to-noise ratio of the online data and the subspace's rate of change, we establish theoretical guarantees for the resulting algorithm. More specifically, we prove an exponential convergence rate and provide an uncertainty quantification of the estimates in terms of an upper bound on their distance to the true subspace. The applicability of the proposed algorithm is demonstrated by means of numerical examples.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we establish the It\^o-Wentzell-Lions formulae for flows of both full and conditional measures on general semimartingales. This generalizes the existing works on flows of measures on It\^o processes. The key technical components involve an appropriate approximation of random fields by cylindrical functions and localization techniques. Moreover, we present the specific formulae in two special cases, including It\^o-Wentzell-Lions formulae for time-space-measure-dependent functions and for functions driven by Poisson random measures.</description>
