      <title>Dynamical confirmation for a black hole in the X-ray transient Swift J1727.8-1613</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13310</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13310v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The X-ray transient Swift J1727.8-1613 ended its 10-month discovery outburst on June of 2024, when it reached an optical brightness comparable to pre-discovery magnitudes. With the aim of performing a dynamical study, we launched an optical spectroscopy campaign with the GTC telescope. We detect the companion star and construct its radial velocity curve, yielding a binary orbital period of Porb = 10.8041 +- 0.0010 h and a radial velocity semi-amplitude of K2 = 390 +- 4 km/s. This results in a mass function of f(M1)=2.77 +- 0.09 Msun. Combined with constraints on the binary inclination, it sets a lower limit to the compact object mass of M1 &gt; 3.12 +- 0.10 Msun, dynamically confirming the black hole nature of the accretor. Comparison of the average spectrum in the rest frame of the companion with synthetic stellar templates supports a K4V donor partially veiled (74%) by the accretion disc. A refined distance measurement of 3.7+- 0.3 kpc, together with the astrometric proper motion and the systemic velocity derived from the radial velocity curve (181 +-4 km/s), supports a natal kick velocity of 220 +30 -40 km/s, at the upper end of the observed distribution.</description>

      <title>Finding the Fuse: Prospects for the Detection and Characterization of Hydrogen-Rich Core-Collapse Supernova Precursor Emission with the LSST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13314</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13314v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Enhanced emission in the months to years preceding explosion has been detected for several core-collapse supernovae (SNe). Though the physical mechanisms driving the emission remain hotly debated, the light curves of detected events show long-lived ($\geq$50 days), plateau-like behavior, suggesting hydrogen recombination may significantly contribute to the total energy budget. The Vera C. Rubin Observatory's Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) will provide a decade-long photometric baseline to search for this emission, both in binned pre-explosion observations after an SN is detected and in single-visit observations prior to the SN explosion. In anticipation of these searches, we simulate a range of eruptive precursor models to core-collapse SNe and forecast the discovery rates of these phenomena in LSST data. We find a detection rate of ~40-130 yr$^{-1}$ for SN IIP/IIL precursors and ~110 yr$^{-1}$ for SN IIn precursors in single-epoch photometry. Considering the first three years of observations with the effects of rolling and observing triplets included, this number grows to a total of 150-400 in binned photometry, with the highest number recovered when binning in 100-day bins for 2020tlf-like precursors and in 20-day bins for other recombination-driven models from the literature. We quantify the impact of using templates contaminated by residual light (from either long-lived or separate precursor emission) on these detection rates, and explore strategies for estimating baseline flux to mitigate these issues. Spectroscopic follow-up of the eruptions preceding core-collapse SNe and detected with LSST will offer important clues to the underlying drivers of terminal-stage mass loss in massive stars.</description>

      <title>Exploring the nature of an ultraluminous X-ray source in NGC 628</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we study the X-ray spectral and temporal properties of an ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) in NGC 628 by using multi-epoch archival X-ray data. The physical parameters were estimated in each epoch in order to constrain the nature of the compact object in the system. Also, the optical counterpart candidates of the ULX were examined using the archival {\it Hubble} Space Telescope (HST)/Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) data. {\it XMM-Newton}, {\it Chandra}, and {\it Swift} data were used to create the long-term light curve (which covers a period of 22 years) and perform the spectral analysis. Lomb-Scargle periodograms of the source were constructed to examine the short-term variability in each epoch. In order to search for an optical counterpart in the HST/WFC3 images, a relative astrometric correction was initially applied to the {\it Chandra} and HST/WFC3 images. The X-ray flux of the source changes by a factor of $\sim 200$ throughout the observations. The previously detected quasi-periodic signal (in the range of 0.1$-$0.4 mHz) was confirmed by using the Lomb-Scargle method. After astrometric correction, two optical counterpart candidates were detected for the source. The obtained spectral energy distributions in the optical band for both candidates indicate that the optical emission is dominated by the irradiation of the accretion disc. Considering the best-fit model parameters of the multi-colour disc black-body model, we derived the mass of the black hole in the system as being in the range of (3$-$16) $M_{\odot}$. Nonetheless, the long-term variability and the spectral transitions in the hardness-luminosity diagram make it difficult to rule out the neutron star scenario.</description>

      <title>Gamma-ray bursts at extremely small fluence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13525v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this review we show that the space experiment with gamma-ray detector with sensitivity 2 orders of magnitude higher than existing ones will make it possible to discover up to a thousand neutron star mergers, even at those moments when gravitational wave (GW) antennas are not working. At the same time, synchronous detection of neutron stars mergers by gamma-ray and GW detectors will make it possible not only to study in detail the physical processes occurring at the time of the catastrophe, but also to determine the full gamma ray beam pattern, including the average jet divergence angle and the real energy of the explosion. A gamma detector that has the required sensitivity at a relatively low flight weight is proposed. The latter, in turn, will make it possible to clarify our ideas about the genesis of double relativistic stars in the Universe.</description>

      <title>Advancing Gamma-Ray Burst Identification through Transfer Learning with Convolutional Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13598</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13598v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Rapid and accurate identification of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is crucial for unraveling their origins. However, current burst search algorithms frequently miss low-threshold signals or lack universality for observations. In this study, we propose a novel approach utilizing transfer learning experiment based on convolutional neural network (CNN) to establish a universal GRB identification method, which validated successfully using GECAM-B data. By employing data augmentation techniques, we enhance the diversity and quantity of the GRB sample. We develop a 1D CNN model with a multi-scale feature cross fusion module (MSCFM) to extract features from samples and perform classification. The comparative results demonstrated significant performance improvements following pre-training and transferring on a large-scale dataset. Our optimal model achieved an impressive accuracy of 96.41% on the source dataset of GECAM-B, and identified three previously undiscovered GRBs by contrast with manual analysis of GECAM-B observations. These innovative transfer learning and data augmentation methods presented in this work hold promise for applications in multi-satellite exploration scenarios characterized by limited data sets and a scarcity of labeled samples in high-energy astronomy.</description>

      <title>The long-term influence of a magnetar power in stripped-envelope supernovae. Radiative-transfer modeling of He-star explosions from 1 to 10 years</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Much interest surrounds the nature of the compact remnant formed in core collapse supernovae (SNe). One means to constrain its nature is to search for signatures of power injection from the remnant in the SN observables years after explosion. In this work, we conduct a large grid of 1D nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer calculations of He-star explosions under the influence of magnetar-power injection from post-explosion age of about one to ten years. Our results for SN observables vary with He-star mass, SN age, injected power, or ejecta clumping. At high mass, the ejecta coolants are primarily O and Ne, with [OI]6330A, [OII]7325A, and [OIII]5000A dominating in the optical, and with strong [NeII]12.81micron in the infrared -- this line may carry more than half the total SN luminosity. For lower He-star masses, a greater diversity of coolants appear, in particular Fe, S, Ar, or Ni from the Si- and Fe-rich regions. All models tend to rise in ionization in time, with twice-ionized species (i.e., OIII, NeIII, SIII, or FeIII) dominating at ~10yr, although this ionization is significantly reduced if clumping is introduced. Our treatment of magnetar power in the form of high-energy electrons or X-ray irradiation yields similar results -- no X-rays emerge from our ejecta even at ten years because of high-optical depth in the keV range. An uncertainty of our work concerns the power deposition profile, which is not known from first principles, although this profile could be constrained from observations. Our magnetar-powered model he8p00 with moderate clumping yields a good match to the optical and near-infrared observations of Type Ib SN2012au at both ~300d (power of 1-2x10^41erg/s) and 2269d (power of 10^40erg/s). Unless overly ionized, we find that all massive magnetar-powered ejecta should be infrared luminous at 5-10yr through strong [NeII]12.81micron line emission.</description>

      <title>Low injection rate of cosmic-ray protons in the turbulent reacceleration model of radio halos in galaxy clusters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13846</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13846v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A giant radio halo (RH) is a diffuse synchrotron emission observed on the scale of megaparsecs (Mpc), typically found in the central region of merging galaxy clusters. Its large size and steep spectrum suggest that it originates from the re-energization of an aged population of cosmic ray electrons (CREs), while the secondary leptons produced in the $pp$ hadronic collision of cosmic ray protons (CRPs) may contribute to the emission. In this study, we investigate the reacceleration model including both primary and secondary CREs, assuming that the primary CRs originate from internal galaxies. In our new method, we follow the cosmological evolution of each cluster and calculate the energy spectra and one-dimensional spatial distributions of CRs. The primary CRE model with $\sim 3$ Gyr duration of reacceleration successfully reproduces the statistical properties of the RHs observed in the recent LOFAR survey, as well as the spectrum and profile of the Coma cluster. The gamma-ray and neutrino emissions produced by reaccelerated CRPs are consistent with the upper limits. However, if the CRP injection rate is high and the secondary CREs become significant, the model with the required $\sim 3$ Gyr reacceleration overproduces the number of RHs. The limit on the CRP injection rate, $L_{\rm p} \lesssim 10^{41}$ erg/s, is significantly lower than that expected from the early starburst activity or jets from active galactic nuclei. This discrepancy requires a revision of either the model of CR supply from galaxies or the turbulent reacceleration model.</description>

      <title>Variations in the Inferred Cosmic-Ray Spectral Index as Measured by Neutron Monitors in Antarctica</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13999</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13999v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A technique has recently been developed for tracking short-term spectral variations in Galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) using data from a single neutron monitor (NM), by collecting histograms of the time delay between successive neutron counts and extracting the leader fraction $L$ as a proxy of the spectral index. Here we analyze $L$ from four Antarctic NMs during 2015 March to 2023 September. We have calibrated $L$ from the South Pole NM with respect to a daily spectral index determined from published data of GCR proton fluxes during 2015--2019 from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) aboard the International Space Station. Our results demonstrate a robust correlation between the leader fraction and the spectral index fit over the rigidity range 2.97--16.6 GV for AMS-02 data, with uncertainty 0.018 in the daily spectral index as inferred from $L$. In addition to the 11-year solar activity cycle, a wavelet analysis confirms a 27-day periodicity in the GCR flux and spectral index corresponding to solar rotation, especially near sunspot minimum, while the flux occasionally exhibited a strong harmonic at 13.5 days, and that the magnetic field component along a nominal Parker spiral (i.e., the magnetic sector structure) is a strong determinant of such spectral and flux variations, with the solar wind speed exerting an additional, nearly rigidity-independent influence on flux variations. Our investigation affirms the capability of ground-based NM stations to accurately and continuously monitor cosmic ray spectral variations in the long-term future.</description>

      <title>Superluminal proper motion in the X-ray jet of Centaurus A</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14078v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The structure of the jet in Cen A is likely better revealed in X-rays than in the radio band, which is usually used to investigate jet proper motions. In this paper, we analyze Chandra ACIS observations of Cen A from 2000 to 2022 and develop an algorithm for systematically fitting the proper motions of its X-ray jet knots. Most of the knots had an apparent proper motion below the detection limit. However, one knot at a transverse distance of $520~\mathrm{pc}$ had an apparent superluminal proper motion of $2.7\pm0.4~\mathrm{c}$. This constrains the inclination of the jet to be $i&lt;41\pm6^{\circ}$, and the velocity of this knot to be $\beta&gt;0.94\pm0.02$. This agrees well with the inclination measured in the inner jet by the EHT, but contradicts previous estimates based on jet and counterjet brightness. It also disagrees with the proper motion of the corresponding radio knot, of $0.8\pm0.1~\mathrm{c}$, which further indicates that the X-ray and radio bands trace distinct structures in the jet. There are four prominent X-ray jet knots closer to the nucleus, but only one of these is inconsistent with being stationary. A few jet knots also have a significant proper motion component in the non-radial direction. This component is typically larger closer to the center of the jet. We also detect brightness and morphology variations at a transverse distance of $100~\mathrm{pc}$ from the nucleus.</description>

      <title>Correct criterion of crustal failure driven by intense magnetic stress in neutron stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetar outbursts are powered by an intense magnetic field. The phenomenon has recently drawn significant attention because of a connection to some fast radio bursts that has been reported. Understanding magnetar outbursts may provide the key to mysterious transient events. The elastic deformation of the solid crust due to magnetic field evolution accumulates over a secular timescale. Eventually, the crust fractures or responds plastically beyond a particular threshold. Determination of the critical limit is required to obtain the shear strain tensor in response to magnetic stress. In some studies, the tensor was substituted with an approximate expression determined algebraically from the magnetic stress. This study evaluated the validity of the approximation by comparing it with the strain tensor obtained through appropriate calculations. The differential equations for the elastic deformation driven by the magnetic field were solved. The results indicated that the approximation did not represent the correct strain tensor value, both in magnitude and spatial profile. Previous evolutionary calculations based on spurious criteria are likely to overestimate the magnitude of the strain tensor, and crustal failure occurs on a shorter timescale. Therefore, revisiting evolutionary calculations using the correct approach is necessary. This study is essential for developing the dynamics of crustal fractures and the magnetic-field evolution in a magnetar.</description>

      <title>New X-ray cataclysmic variable SRGe J194401.8+284452 in the field of the gamma-ray source 4FGL J1943.9+2841</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14136</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14136v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: SRGe J194401.8+284452 is the brightest point-like X-ray object within the position uncertainty ellipse of an unidentified $\gamma$-ray source 4FGL J1943.9+2841. We performed multi-wavelength spectral and photometric studies to determine its nature and possible association with the $\gamma$-ray source. We firmly established its optical counterpart with the Gaia based distance of about 415 pc. Our data show that the object is a cataclysmic variable with an orbital period of about 1.5 hours, a late type donor star and an accretion disk around the white dwarf. SRGe J194401.8+284452 exhibits fast spontaneous transitions between the high and low luminosity states simultaneously in the optical and X-rays, remaining relatively stable between the transitions on scales of several months/years. This can be caused by an order of magnitude changes in the accretion rate. The brightness of the source is about 17 mag and 20 mag in the 2000 - 8000~A range and $5\times 10^{-12}$ and $5\times 10^{-13}$ erg/cm$^2$/s in the 0.3 -- 10 keV range in the high and low states, respectively. We constrained the mass of the white dwarf (0.3 -- 0.9 $M_\odot$) and its temperature in the low state (14750 $\pm$ 1250 K), the mass of the donor star ($\leq$ 0.08 $\pm$ 0.01 $M_ \odot$). In the low state, we detected regular optical pulsations with an amplitude of 0.2 mag and a period of 8 min. They are likely associated with the spin of the white dwarf, rather than with its non-radial pulsations. In the high state, the object demonstrates only stochastic optical brightness variations on time scales of 1 -- 15 minutes with amplitudes of 0.2 -- 0.6 mag. We conclude, that SRGe J194401.8+284452 based on its properties can be classified as an intermediate polar, and its association with the $\gamma$-ray source is very unlikely.</description>

      <title>Soft X-ray emission from the classical nova AT 2018bej</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14171v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical novae are known to demonstrate a supersoft X-ray source (SSS) state following outbursts, which is associated with residual thermonuclear burning on the white dwarf (WD) surface. During its all-sky survey (eRASS1), the eROSITA telescope onboard the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma observatory discovered a bright new SSS, whose position is consistent with the known classical nova AT 2018bej in the Large Magellanic Cloud. There were two eROSITA spectra obtained during eRASS1 and eRASS2 monitoring epochs and one XMM-Newton grating spectrum close to the eRASS1 epoch. We aim to describe the eROSITA and XMM-Newton spectra of AT 2018bej with our local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) atmosphere models. We focused on the evolution of the hot WD properties between the eRASS1 and eRASS2 epochs, especially on the change of the carbon abundance. A grid of LTE model atmosphere spectra were calculated for different values of the effective temperature (from $T_{\rm eff}= 525$ to $700\,\rm kK$), surface gravity (six values) and chemical composition with five different values of carbon and nitrogen abundances. Both eRASS1 and XMM $0.3-0.6$ keV spectral analyses yield a temperature of the WD of $T_{\rm eff}{\sim}\,600\, \rm kK$ and a WD radius of $8000-8700\,\rm km$. Simultaneous fitting of the eROSITA spectra for two epochs (eRASS1 and eRASS2) with a common WD mass parameter demonstrates a decrease in $T_{\rm eff}$ accompanied by an increase in the WD radius and a decrease in the carbon abundance. However, these changes are marginal and coincide within errors. The derived WD mass is estimated to be $1.05-1.15\, M_\odot$. We traced a minor evolution of the source on a half-year timescale accompanied by a decrease in carbon abundance and concluded that LTE model atmospheres can be used to analyse the available X-ray spectra of classical novae during their SSS stage.</description>

      <title>Suzaku Observations of the Cold Front in A3667: a Non-Equilibrium Ionization State of the Intracluster Medium</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a systematic study of the thermodynamic properties of the intracluster medium (ICM), including the plasma conditions in the ICM, in the merging galaxy cluster A3667 using Suzaku. We analyze the X-ray spectra of the ICM between the northwestern and the southeastern radio relics across a prominent cold front in A3667 to search for the ICM in a non-equilibrium ionization (NEI) state. We find that the ICM inside the cold front exhibits an NEI state with an ionization parameter of $(2.5\pm0.7)\times10^{11}\,\mathrm{s\,cm^{-3}}$ at the $90\%$ confidence level, which is lower than that expected from a collisional ionization equilibrium (CIE) state of the ICM (i.e., $n_\mathrm{e}t &gt; 10^{12}\,\mathrm{s\,cm^{-3}}$). The timescale calculated from the ionization parameter of the ICM inside the cold front is $ 4.6\pm1.2\,\mathrm{Myr}$, which is much shorter than the thermal equilibration timescale. A weak transonic sloshing motion might explain the possibility that the ICM inside the cold front of A3667 is in the NEI state. In addition, the NEI state of the ICM in A3667 seems to be associated with the elongated radio halo bridging the region between the northwestern radio relic and the prominent cold front in A3667 across the cluster center.</description>

      <title>Tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The tidal Love numbers of self-gravitating compact objects describe their response to external tidal perturbations, such as those from a companion in a binary system, offering valuable insights into their internal structure. For static tidal fields, asymptotically flat black holes in vacuum exhibit vanishing Love numbers in general relativity, even though this property is sensitive to the presence of an external environment. In this work we study the tidal deformability of black holes surrounded by thin accretion disks, showing that the Love numbers could be large enough to mask any effect of modified gravity and to intrinsically limit tidal tests of black-hole mimickers. Furthermore, we investigate the measurability of the tidal parameters with next-generation gravitational wave experiments, like LISA and Einstein Telescope. Our findings suggest that these parameters could be measured with high precision, providing a powerful tool to probe the environment around coalescing binary systems.</description>

      <title>Cosmology and nuclear-physics implications of a subsolar gravitational-wave event</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14287</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14287v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Detecting a compact subsolar object would have profound implications in physics, the reach of which depends on the nature of the object. Here we explore such consequences for a putative subsolar-mass gravitational wave event detected by the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA Collaboration. We forecast that the nature of a subsolar binary (made of light neutron stars, primordial black holes, or more exotic compact objects) can be inferred with a great statistical confidence level already during the ongoing fourth observing run, based on the large tidal deformability effects on the signal. The detection of a primordial black hole would have implications for cosmology and dark matter scenarios, while the measurement of the tidal deformability of a subsolar neutron star could rule out or confirm the existence of strange stars made of quarks.</description>

      <title>XRISM Spectroscopy of the Fe K$_{\alpha}$ Emission Line in the Seyfert AGN NGC 4151 Reveals the Disk, Broad Line Region, and Torus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14300</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14300v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an analysis of the first two XRISM/Resolve spectra of the well-known Seyfert-1.5 active galactic nucleus in NGC 4151, obtained in December 2023. Our work focuses on the nature of the narrow Fe K$_{\alpha}$ emission line at 6.4 keV, the strongest and most common X-ray line observed in AGN. The total line is found to consist of three components. Even the narrowest component of the line is resolved with evident Fe K$_{\alpha,1}$ (6.404 keV) and K$_{\alpha,2}$ (6.391 keV) contributions in a 2:1 flux ratio, fully consistent with neutral gas with negligible bulk velocity. Subject to the limitations of our models, the narrowest and intermediate-width components are consistent with emission from optically thin gas, suggesting that they arise in a disk atmosphere and/or wind. Modeling the three line components in terms of Keplerian broadening, they are readily associated with (1) the inner wall of the ``torus,'' (2) the innermost optical ``broad line region'' (or, ``X-ray BLR''), and (3) a region with a radius of $r\simeq 100~GM/c^{2}$ that may signal a warp in the accretion disk. Viable alternative explanations of the broadest component include a fast wind component and/or scattering; however, we find evidence of variability in the narrow Fe K$_{\alpha}$ line complex on time scales consistent with small radii. The best-fit models are statistically superior to simple Voigt functions, but when fit with Voigt profiles the time-averaged lines are consistent with a projected velocity broadening of FWHM$=1600^{+400}_{-200}~{\rm km}~{\rm s}^{-1}$. Overall, the resolution and sensitivity of XRISM show that the narrow Fe K line in AGN is an effective probe of all key parts of the accretion flow, as it is currently understood. We discuss the implications of these findings for our understanding of AGN accretion, future studies with XRISM, and X-ray-based black hole mass measurements.</description>

      <title>The XRISM First Light Observation: Velocity Structure and Thermal Properties of the Supernova Remnant N132D</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an initial analysis of the XRISM first-light observation of the supernova remnant (SNR) N132D in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The Resolve microcalorimeter has obtained the first high-resolution spectrum in the 1.6-10 keV band, which contains K-shell emission lines of Si, S, Ar, Ca, and Fe. We find that the Si and S lines are relatively narrow, with a broadening represented by a Gaussian-like velocity dispersion of $\sigma_v \sim 450$ km s$^{-1}$. The Fe He$\alpha$ lines are, on the other hand, substantially broadened with $\sigma_v \sim 1670$ km s$^{-1}$. This broadening can be explained by a combination of the thermal Doppler effect due to the high ion temperature and the kinematic Doppler effect due to the SNR expansion. Assuming that the Fe He$\alpha$ emission originates predominantly from the supernova ejecta, we estimate the reverse shock velocity at the time when the bulk of the Fe ejecta were shock heated to be $-1000 \lesssim V_{\rm rs}~[{\rm km s}^{-1}] \lesssim 3300$ (in the observer frame). We also find that Fe Ly$\alpha$ emission is redshifted with a bulk velocity of $\sim 890$ km s$^{-1}$, substantially larger than the radial velocity of the local interstellar medium surrounding N132D. These results demonstrate that high-resolution X-ray spectroscopy is capable of providing constraints on the evolutionary stage, geometry, and velocity distribution of SNRs.</description>

      <title>Eighteen new fast radio bursts in the High Time Resolution Universe survey</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14384</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14384v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Current observational evidence reveals that fast radio bursts (FRBs) exhibit bandwidths ranging from a few dozen MHz to several GHz. Traditional FRB searches primarily employ matched filter methods on time series collapsed across the entire observational bandwidth. However, with modern ultra-wideband receivers featuring GHz-scale observational bandwidths, this approach may overlook a significant number of events. We investigate the efficacy of sub-banded searches for FRBs, a technique seeking bursts within limited portions of the bandwidth. These searches aim to enhance the significance of FRB detections by mitigating the impact of noise outside the targeted frequency range, thereby improving signal-to-noise ratios. We conducted a series of Monte Carlo simulations, for the $400$-MHz bandwidth Parkes 21-cm multi-beam (PMB) receiver system and the Parkes Ultra-Wideband Low (UWL) receiver, simulating bursts down to frequency widths of about $100$\,MHz. Additionally, we performed a complete reprocessing of the high-latitude segment of the High Time Resolution Universe South survey (HTRU-S) of the Parkes-Murriyang telescope using sub-banded search techniques. Simulations reveal that a sub-banded search can enhance the burst search efficiency by $67_{-42}^{+133}$ % for the PMB system and $1433_{-126}^{+143}$ % for the UWL receiver. Furthermore, the reprocessing of HTRU led to the confident detection of eighteen new bursts, nearly tripling the count of FRBs found in this survey. These results underscore the importance of employing sub-banded search methodologies to effectively address the often modest spectral occupancy of these signals.</description>

      <title>A physically modelled selection function for compact binary mergers in the LIGO-Virgo O3 run and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13383</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13383v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite the observation of nearly 100 compact binary coalescence (CBC) events up to the end of the Advanced gravitational-wave (GW) detectors' third observing run (O3), there remain fundamental open questions regarding their astrophysical formation mechanisms and environments. Population analysis should yield insights into these questions, but requires careful control of uncertainties and biases. GW observations have a strong selection bias: this is due first to the dependence of the signal amplitude on the source's (intrinsic and extrinsic) parameters, and second to the complicated nature of detector noise and of current detection methods. In this work, we introduce a new physically-motivated model of the sensitivity of GW searches for CBC events, aimed at enhancing the accuracy and efficiency of population reconstructions. In contrast to current methods which rely on re-weighting simulated signals (injections) via importance sampling, we model the probability of detection of binary black hole (BBH) mergers as a smooth, analytic function of source masses, orbit-aligned spins, and distance, fitted to accurately match injection results. The estimate can thus be used for population models whose signal distribution over parameter space differs significantly from the injection distribution. Our method has already been used in population studies such as reconstructing the BBH merger rate dependence on redshift.</description>

      <title>Does Magnetic Reconnection Change Topology?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13732v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We show that magnetic reconnection and topology-change can be understood, and distinguished, in terms of trajectories of Alfv\'enic wave-packets ${\bf x}(t)$ moving along the magnetic field ${\bf B(x}, t)$ with Alfv\'en velocity $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf V}_A({\bf x},t)$, i.e. adopting a Lagrangian formalism for virtual particles. A considerable simplification is attained, in fact, by directly employing elementary concepts from hydrodynamic turbulence without appealing to the fictitious and complicated notion of magnetic field lines moving through plasma. In incompressible flows, Alfv\'enic trajectories correspond to the dynamical system $\dot{\bf x}(t)={\bf B}$, where $\bf B$ solves the induction equation, with phase space $(\bf x,B)$. Metric topology of this phase space, at any time $t$, captures the intuitive notion that nearby wave-packets should remain nearby at a slightly different time $t\pm \delta t$, unless topology changes e.g., by dissipation. In fact, continuity conditions for magnetic field allow rapid but continuous divergence of these trajectories, i.e., reconnection, but not discontinuous divergence which would change magnetic topology. Thus topology can change only due to time-reversal symmetry breaking e.g., by dissipation or turbulence. In laminar and even chaotic flows, the separation of Alfv\'enic trajectories at all times remains proportional to their initial separation, i.e., slow reconnection, and topology changes by dissipation with a rate proportional to resistivity. In turbulence, trajectories diverge super-linearly with time independent of their initial separation, i.e., fast reconnection, and magnetic topology changes by turbulent diffusion with a rate independent of small-scale plasma effects. Our results strongly support the Lazarian-Vishniac model of stochastic reconnection and its reformulation by Eyink in terms of stochastic flux-freezing.</description>

      <title>Bipolar blobs as evidence of hidden AGN activities in the low-mass galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13841</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13841v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report the evidence of a hidden black hole (BH) in a low-mass galaxy, MaNGA 9885-9102, and provide a new method to identify active BH in low mass galaxies. This galaxy is originally selected from the MaNGA survey with distinctive bipolar H$\alpha$ blobs at the minor axis. The bipolar feature can be associated with AGN activity, while the two blobs are classified as the H II regions on the BPT diagram, making the origins confusing. The Swift UV continuum shows that the two blobs do not have UV counterparts, suggesting that the source of ionization is out of the blobs. Consistent with this, the detailed photoionization models prefer to AGN rather than star-forming origin with a significance of 5.8$\sigma$. The estimated BH mass is $M_{\rm BH}\sim$7.2$\times 10^5 M_\odot$ from the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma_*$ relationship. This work introduces a novel method for detecting the light echo of BHs, potentially extending to intermediate mass, in low metallicity environments where the traditional BPT diagram fails.</description>

      <title>Implications of Fermionic Dark Matter Interactions on Anisotropic Neutron Stars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The presence of Dark matter (DM) within a neutron star (NS) can substantially influence the macroscopic properties. It is commonly assumed that the pressure inside an NS is isotropic, but in reality, pressure is locally anisotropic. This study explores the properties of anisotropic NS with a subfraction of DM (isotropic) trapped inside. Implementing a two-fluid formalism with three Equations of State (EOS): AP3 (a realistic nucleon-nucleon interaction model), BSk22 (modeling atomic nuclei and neutron-matter), and MPA1 (considering relativistic effects in nuclear interactions). The properties of NS, such as mass ($M$), radius ($R$), and dimensionless tidal deformability ($\Lambda$), for various DM-anisotropic configurations, have been rigorously tested against observational constraints. These constraints include data from the binary NS merger GW170817, NICER x-ray measurements, and pulsar mass-radius observations. We observe that with increasing DM subfraction, higher anisotropies could also satisfy the observational constraints. Furthermore, increasing the coupling ($g$) between DM and its mediator leads to the formation of a core-halo structure, with a DM halo surrounding the baryonic matter (BM). Specifically, for coupling values of $g = 10^{-4}$, $10^{-3.7}$, and $10^{-3.5}$, we observe that the maximum radius ($R_{max}$) decreases with increasing anisotropy, which contrasts with the behavior at $g = 10^{-5}$ and in scenarios with no DM. Our analysis indicates that binary pulsar systems could potentially constrain the extent of admixed anisotropic NS or, more optimistically, provide evidence for the existence of DM-admixed anisotropic NS.</description>

      <title>Parametrized tests of general relativity using eccentric compact binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14132</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14132v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Astrophysical population simulations predict that a subset of dynamically formed binary black holes (BBHs) may possess eccentricity $\gtrsim 0.1$ at a gravitational wave (GW) frequency of $10 \,\text{Hz}$. Presently, the LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA (LVK) Collaboration tests general relativity (GR) assuming that the binary eccentricity has decayed well before it enters the detector's frequency band. Previous works have shown that binary eccentricity can bias GR tests if unaccounted for. Here we develop two methods to extend parametrized tests of GR to eccentric binaries. The first method extends the standard null parametrized test for quasicircular binaries by adding fractional deviations at each post-Newtonian (PN) order in the eccentric part of the GW phasing (assuming the small-eccentricity limit). Simultaneous measurement of the circular and eccentric deviation parameters ($\delta\hat{\varphi}, \delta\hat{\varphi}^e$) allows us to constrain deviations from GR for eccentric binaries. While strong constraints on the deviation parameters are not achievable with LIGO's projected sensitivity, the multibanding of LISA and CE observations can constrain these deviations to $|\delta\hat{\varphi}_2| \lesssim 3 \times 10^{-3}$ and $|\delta\hat{\varphi}^e_2|\lesssim 2\times 10^{-2}$. The second method looks for GR deviations in the rate of periastron advance ($\Delta\alpha$). The parameter $\Delta\alpha$ ($\Delta\alpha^{\rm GR} \to 0$) can be constrained with LIGO to $|\Delta\alpha|\lesssim 4 \times 10^{-2}$ (with $1 \sigma$ confidence). Multiband sources observed by LISA and CE provide an improved constraint of $|\Delta\alpha|\lesssim 3\times 10^{-5}$. The space-based detector DECIGO provides the best constraint on $\Delta\alpha$ with $|\Delta\alpha|\lesssim 8 \times 10^{-6}$.</description>

      <title>X-ray AGN in Bo\"otes: Black Hole - Galaxy assembly in massive populations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Supermassive Black Holes (BHs) are known to efficiently grow through gas accretion, but even sustained and intense mass build-up through this mechanism struggles to explain the assembly of the most massive BHs observed in the local Universe. Using the Chandra Deep-Wide Field Survey (CDFWS) in the Bo\"otes field, we measure BH-galaxy assembly in massive galaxies ($M_\star\gtrsim10^{10}\, \rm M_\odot$) through the AGN fraction and specific Black Hole accretion rate (sBHAR) distribution as a function of redshift and stellar mass. We determine stellar masses and star formation rates for a parent sample of optically selected galaxies as well as those with X-ray detections indicating the presence of an AGN through Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) fitting. We derive a redshift-dependent mass completeness limit and extract X-ray information for every galaxy as to identify AGN in various types of galaxies at low and high redshift providing a comprehensive picture of the AGN population in massive galaxies. While X-ray AGN samples are dominated by moderately massive host galaxies of $M_{\star} \geqslant 10^{10}\, \rm M_{\odot}$, we do not find a strong stellar mass dependence in AGN fraction (to limits in sBHAR) or sBHAR distribution above this mass threshold, indicating a bias towards massive galaxies in the observed samples. A mild increase in AGN fraction is seen towards high stellar mass for low sBHAR AGN, as well as a suppression of high sBHAR events in the most massive galaxies. We derive BH-galaxy growth tracks over time, which reveal that while most BH mass has been accumulated since $z=4$ for lower mass BHs, the assembly of the most massive BHs is more complex, with little to no relative mass gain since $z=4$, implying that rapid and intense growth episodes prior to $z=4$ were necessary to form these massive BHs.</description>

      <title>Convergence of the hydrodynamic gradient expansion in relativistic kinetic theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14316</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14316v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We rigorously prove that, in any relativistic kinetic theory whose non-hydrodynamic sector has a finite gap, the Taylor series of all hydrodynamic dispersion relations has a finite radius of convergence. Furthermore, we prove that, for shear waves, such radius of convergence cannot be smaller than $1/2$ times the gap size. Finally, we prove that the non-hydrodynamic sector is gapped whenever the total scattering cross-section (expressed as a function of the energy) is bounded below by a positive non-zero constant. These results, combined with well-established covariant stability criteria, allow us to derive a rigorous upper bound on the shear viscosity of relativistic dilute gases.</description>

      <title>Can supernova from runaway stars mimic the signs of absorbing `super-virial' gas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14351</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14351v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The recent detection of large column density absorption lines from highly ionized gas in a few directions through the circumgalactic medium (CGM) of the Milky Way (MW) has been puzzling. The inferred temperature from these absorption lines far exceeds the virial temperature of the MW, and the column densities are also too large to be easily explained. In this paper, we propose a novel idea to explain these observations and claim that they may not have originated from the CGM, but from a totally different type of source, namely, stellar ejecta from supernovae (SNe) above the Galactic disk that happen to lie in the line of sight to the background quasars. About $\sim 20\%$ of massive OB stars (progenitors of core-collapse supernovae) are known to be runaway stars that have high ejection velocities near the Galactic plane and can end up exploding as SNe above the Galactic disk. We show that the associated reverse shock in the supernova remnant in the early non-radiative phase can heat the ejecta to temperatures of $\gtrsim 10^7\,{\rm K}$ and can naturally explain the observed high column density of ions in the observed `super-virial' phase along with $\alpha$-enriched super-solar abundance that is typical of core-collapse supernovae. However, SNe from runaway stars has a covering fraction of $\lesssim 0.7 \%$ and thus can only explain the observations along limited sightlines.</description>

      <title>Constraints on primordial black holes in dSphs using radio observations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.14353v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Primordial black holes (PBHs) are hypothetical objects formed at the early epoch of the universe, which could be a type of dark matter (DM) candidate without the need for new particles. The abundance of PBH DM has been constrained strictly by many observations.In this work, with the radio observations of Fornax and Segue I, we constrain the abundance of PBH in dwarf spheroidal galaxies through the synchrotron self-Compton (SSC) effect of Hawking radiation electrons. By selecting optimal sources, we obtain the constraints on the fraction of PBH DM down to $\sim10^{-3}$ for Segue I and $\sim10^{-5}$ for Fornax at asteroidal mass. We also predict that, with 100 hours of future observation by the Square Kilometer Array, the SSC approach could place constraints comparable to the current strictest results for PBHs of $&lt;5\times10^{15}\,{\rm g}$. Better projected constraints can be obtained by including the inverse Compton scattering on cosmic microwave background photons.</description>

      <title>The Curious Case of ASASSN-20hx: A Slowly-Evolving, UV and X-ray Luminous, Ambiguous Nuclear Transient</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03245</link>
      <description>arXiv:2108.03245v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present observations of ASASSN-20hx, a nearby ambiguous nuclear transient (ANT) discovered in NGC 6297 by the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae (ASAS-SN). We observed ASASSN-20hx from $-$30 to 275 days relative to peak UV/optical emission using high-cadence, multi-wavelength spectroscopy and photometry. From Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) data, we determine that the ANT began to brighten on 2020 June 22.8 with a linear rise in flux for at least the first week. ASASSN-20hx peaked in the UV/optical 30 days later on 2020 July 22.8 (MJD = 59052.8) at a bolometric luminosity of $L = (3.15 \pm 0.04) \times 10^{43}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The subsequent decline is slower than any TDE observed to date and consistent with many other ANTs. Compared to an archival X-ray detection, the X-ray luminosity of ASASSN-20hx increased by an order of magnitude to $L_{x} \sim 1.5 \times 10^{42}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and then slowly declined over time. The X-ray emission is well-fit by a power law with a photon index of $\Gamma \sim 2.3 - 2.6$. Both the optical and near infrared spectra of ASASSN-20hx lack emission lines, unusual for any known class of nuclear transient. While ASASSN-20hx has some characteristics seen in both tidal disruption events (TDEs) and active galactic nuclei (AGNs), it cannot be definitively classified with current data.</description>

      <title>SCAT Uncovers ATLAS's First Tidal Disruption Event ATLAS18mlw: A Faint and Fast TDE in a Quiescent Balmer Strong Galaxy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.05281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2202.05281v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the discovery that ATLAS18mlw was a tidal disruption event (TDE) in the galaxy WISEA J073544.83+663717.3, at a luminosity distance of 334 Mpc. Initially discovered by the Asteroid Terrestrial Impact Last Alert System (ATLAS) on 2018 March 17.3, the TDE nature of the transient was uncovered only recently with the re-reduction of a SuperNova Integral Field Spectrograph (SNIFS) spectrum. This spectrum, taken by the Spectral Classification of Astronomical Transients (SCAT) survey, shows a strong blue continuum and a broad H$\alpha$ emission line. Here we present roughly six years of optical survey photometry beginning before the TDE to constrain AGN activity, optical spectroscopy of the transient, and a detailed study of the host galaxy properties through analysis of archival photometry and a host spectrum. ATLAS18mlw was detected in ground-based light curves for roughly two months. From a blackbody fit to the transient spectrum and bolometric correction of the optical light curve, we conclude that ATLAS18mlw is best explained by a low-luminosity TDE with a peak luminosity of log(L [erg s$^{-1}$]) = $43.5 \pm 0.2$. The TDE classification is further supported by the quiescent Balmer strong nature of the host galaxy. We also calculated the TDE decline rate from the bolometric light curve and find $\Delta L_{40} = -0.7 \pm 0.2$ dex, making ATLAS18mlw a member of the growing class of ``faint and fast'' TDEs with low peak luminosities and fast decline rates.</description>

      <title>Mid-Infrared Echoes of Ambiguous Nuclear Transients Reveal High Dust Covering Fractions: Evidence for Dusty Tori</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15681</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15681v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Alongside the recent increase in discoveries of tidal disruption events (TDEs) have come an increasing number of ambiguous nuclear transients (ANTs). These ANTs are characterized by hot blackbody-like UV/optical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and smooth photometric evolution, often with hard powerlaw-like X-ray emission. ANTs are likely exotic TDEs or smooth flares originating in active galactic nuclei (AGNs). While their emission in the UV/optical and X-ray has been relatively well-explored, their infrared (IR) emission has not been studied in detail. Here we use the NEOWISE mission and its low-cadence mapping of the entire sky to study mid-infrared dust reprocessing echoes of ANTs. We study 19 ANTs, finding significant MIR flares in 18 objects for which we can estimate an IR luminosity and temperature evolution. The dust reprocessing echoes show a wide range in IR luminosities ($\sim10^{42} - 10^{45}$ erg s$^{-1}$) with blackbody temperatures largely consistent with sublimation temperature of graphite grains. Excluding the two sources possibly associated with luminous supernovae (ASASSN-15lh and ASASSN-17jz), the dust covering fractions (f$_c$) for detected IR flares lie between 0.05 and 0.91, with a mean of f$_c$ = 0.29 for all ANTs (including limits) and f$_c$ = $0.38 \pm 0.04$ for detections. These covering fractions are much higher than optically-selected TDEs and similar to AGNs. We interpret the high covering fractions in ANT host galaxies as evidence for the presence of a dusty torus.</description>

      <title>Coronal Line Emitters are Tidal Disruption Events in Gas-Rich Environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.05525</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.05525v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Some galaxies show little to no sign of active galactic nucleus (AGN) activity, yet exhibit strong coronal emission lines (CLs) relative to common narrow emission lines. Many of these CLs have ionization potentials of $\geq 100$ eV, thus requiring strong extreme UV and/or soft X-ray flux. It has long been thought that such events are powered by tidal disruption events (TDEs), but owing to a lack of detailed multi-wavelength follow-up, such a connection has not been firmly made. Here we compare coronal line emitters (CLEs) and TDEs in terms of their host-galaxy and transient properties. We find that the mid-infrared (MIR) colors of CLE hosts in quiescence are similar to TDE hosts. Additionally, many CLEs show evidence of a large dust reprocessing echo in their mid-infrared colors, a sign of significant dust in the nucleus. The stellar masses and star formation rates of the CLE hosts are largely consistent with TDE hosts, with many CLEs residing within the green valley. The blackbody properties of CLEs and TDEs are similar, with some CLEs showing hot (T $\geq 40,000$ K) blackbody temperatures. Finally, the location of CLEs on the peak-luminosity/decline-rate parameter space is much closer to TDEs than many other major classes of nuclear transients. Combined, these provide strong evidence to confirm the previous claims that CLEs are indeed TDEs in gas-rich environments. We additionally propose a stricter threshold of CL flux $\geq 1/3$ $\times$ [O III] flux to better exclude AGNs from the sample of CLEs.</description>

      <title>Do All Fast Radio Bursts Repeat? Constraints from CHIME/FRB Far Side-Lobe FRBs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05261</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.05261v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report ten fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected in the far side-lobe region (i.e., $\geq 5^\circ$ off-meridian) of the Canadian Hydrogen Intensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) from 2018 August 28 to 2021 August 31. We localize the bursts by fitting their spectra with a model of the CHIME/FRB synthesized beam response. We find that the far side-lobe events have on average ~500 times greater fluxes than events detected in CHIME's main lobe. We show that the side-lobe sample is therefore statistically ~20 times closer than the main-lobe sample. We find promising host galaxy candidates (P$_{\rm cc}$ &lt; 1%) for two of the FRBs, 20190112B and 20210310B, at distances of 38 and 16 Mpc, respectively. CHIME/FRB did not observe repetition of similar brightness from the uniform sample of 10 side-lobe FRBs in a total exposure time of 35580 hours. Under the assumption of Poisson-distributed bursts, we infer that the mean repetition interval above the detection threshold of the far side-lobe events is longer than 11880 hours, which is at least 2380 times larger than the interval from known CHIME/FRB detected repeating sources, with some caveats, notably that very narrow-band events could have been missed. Our results from these far side-lobe events suggest one of two scenarios: either (1) all FRBs repeat and the repetition intervals span a wide range, with high-rate repeaters being a rare subpopulation, or (2) non-repeating FRBs are a distinct population different from known repeaters.</description>

      <title>Constraints on the Intergalactic and Local Dispersion Measure of Fast Radio Bursts with the CHIME/FRB far side-lobe events</title>

      <description>arXiv:2307.05262v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the 10 fast radio bursts (FRBs) detected in the far side-lobe region of the CHIME telescope from 2018 August 28 to 2021 August 31. We find that the far side-lobe events have on average $\sim$500 times greater fluxes than events detected in CHIME's main lobe. We show that the side-lobe sample is therefore statistically $\sim$20 times closer than the main-lobe sample. The median dispersion measure (DM) excess, after removing the Galactic disk component using the NE2001 for the free electron density distribution of the Milky Way, of the 10 far side-lobe and 471 non-repeating main-lobe FRBs in the first CHIME/FRB catalog is 183.0 and 433.9 pc\;cm$^{-3}$, respectively. By comparing the DM excesses of the two populations under reasonable assumptions, we statistically constrain that the local degenerate contributions (from the Milky Way halo and the host galaxy) and the intergalactic contribution to the excess DM of the 471 non-repeating main-lobe FRBs for the NE2001 model are 131.2$-$158.3 and 302.7$-$275.6 pc cm$^{-3}$, respectively, which corresponds to a median redshift for the main-lobe FRB sample of $\sim$0.3. These constraints are useful for population studies of FRBs, and in particular for constraining the location of the missing baryons.</description>

      <title>A Swift Fix II: Physical Parameters of Type I Superluminous Supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.03270</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.03270v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In November 2020, the Swift team announced a major update to the calibration of the UltraViolet and Optical Telescope (UVOT) data to correct for the gradual loss of sensitivity over time. Beginning in roughly 2015, the correction affected observations in the three near ultraviolet (UV) filters, reaching levels of up to 0.3 mag immediately prior to the correction. Over the same time period, an increasing number of Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe-I) were discovered and studied. Many SLSNe-I are hot (T$_\textrm{eff}$ $\approx 10,000$ K) near peak, and therefore accurate UV data are imperative towards properly understanding their physical properties and energetics. We re-compute Swift UVOT photometry for SLSNe-I discovered between 2014 and 2021 with at least 5 Swift observations in 2015 or later. We calculate host-subtracted magnitudes for each SLSN and fit their spectral energy distributions with modified blackbodies to obtain the radius and temperature evolution. We also fit multi-band photometry using the Modular Open Source Fitter for Transients (MOSFiT) to obtain key parameters such as the spin period (P), magnetic field strength (B), ejecta mass (M$_\textrm{ej}$), and kinetic energy (E$_\textrm{kin}$). From our MOSFiT modeling, we also estimate the peak UV/optical luminosity (L$_\textrm{peak}$) and total radiative energy (E$_\textrm{rad}$). Under the assumption of magnetar-powered SLSNe we find several strong trends, including anti-correlations between P and both L$_\textrm{peak}$ and E$_\textrm{rad}$, a correlation between E$_\textrm{kin}$ and E$_\textrm{rad}$, and an anti-correlation between B and E$_\textrm{rad}$.</description>

Abstract: We present an extensive analysis of the optical and UV properties of AT2023clx, the closest TDE to date, that occurred in the nucleus of the interacting LINER galaxy, NGC3799 (z=0.01107). After correcting for the host reddening (E(B-V) = 0.179 mag), we find its peak absolute g-band magnitude to be -18.03{+/-}0.07 mag, and its peak bolometric luminosity to be L=(1.57{+/-}0.19)x10^43 erg/s. AT2023clx displays several distinctive features: first, it rose to peak within 10.4{+/-}2.5 days, making it the fastest rising TDE to date. Our SMBH mass estimate of M_BH ~ 10^6 Msol rules out the possibility of an intermediate-mass BH as the reason for the fast rise. Dense spectral follow-up reveals a blue continuum that cools slowly and broad Balmer and HeII lines as well as weak HeI 5876,6678 emission features that are typically seen in TDEs. The early, broad (width ~ 15000 km/s) profile of Ha matches theoretical expectations from an optically thick outflow. A flat Balmer decrement (~ 1.58) suggests that the lines are collisionally excited rather than being produced via photoionisation, in contrast to typical active galactic nuclei. A second distinctive feature, seen for the first time in TDE spectra, is a sharp, narrow emission peak at a rest wavelength of ~ 6353 A. This feature is clearly visible up to 10d post-peak; we attribute it to clumpy material preceding the bulk outflow, which manifests as a high-velocity component of Ha (-9584 km/s). Its third distinctive feature is the rapid cooling during the first ~ 20 days after peak, reflected as a break in the temperature evolution. Combining these findings, we propose a scenario for AT2023clx involving the disruption of a very low-mass star (&lt;=0.1 Msol) with an outflow launched in our line of sight and with disruption properties that led to efficient circularisation and prompt accretion disc formation, observed through a low-density photosphere.</description>

      <title>Stringent Tests of Lorentz Invariance Violation from LHAASO Observations of GRB 221009A</title>

Abstract: Very recently, the Large High Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) reported the observation of the very early TeV afterglow of the brightest-of-all-time GRB 221009A, recording the highest photon statistics in the TeV band ever from a gamma-ray burst. We use this unique observation to place stringent constraints on an energy dependence of the speed of light in vacuum, a manifestation of Lorentz invariance violation (LIV) predicted by some quantum gravity (QG) theories. Our results show that the 95% confidence level lower limits on the QG energy scales are $E_{\mathrm{QG},1}&gt;10$ times of the Planck energy $E_\mathrm{Pl}$ for the linear, and $E_{\mathrm{QG},2}&gt;6\times10^{-8}E_\mathrm{Pl}$ for the quadratic LIV effects, respectively. Our limits on the quadratic LIV case improve previous best bounds by factors of 5--7.</description>

      <title>Jetlike structures in low-mass binary neutron star merger remnants</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.03705v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: GW170817 and GRB 170817A provided direct evidence that binary neutron star (NSNS) mergers can produce short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). However, questions remain about the nature of the central engine. Depending on the mass, the remnant from a NSNS merger may promptly collapse to a black hole (BH), form a hypermassive neutron star (HMNS) which undergoes a delayed collapse to a BH, a supramassive neutron star (SMNS) with a much longer lifetime, or an indefinitely stable NS. There is strong evidence that a BH with an accretion disk can launch a sGRB-compatible jet via the Blandford-Znajek mechanism, but whether a supramassive star can do the same is less clear. We have performed general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the merger of both irrotational and spinning, equal-mass NSNSs constructed from a piecewise polytropic representation of the SLy equation of state, with a range of gravitational masses that yield remnants with mass above and below the supramassive limit. Each NS is endowed with a dipolar magnetic field extending from the interior into the exterior, as in a radio pulsar. We examine cases with different initial binary masses, including a case which produces a HMNS which collapses to a BH, and lower mass binaries that produce SMNS remnants. We find similar jetlike structures for both the SMNS and HMNS remnants that meet our basic critera for an incipient jet. The outflow for the HMNS case is consistent with a Blandford-Znajek (BZ) jet. There is sufficient evidence that such BZ-powered outflows can break out and produce ulrarelativistic jets so that we can describe the HMNS system as a sGRB progenitor. However, the incipient jets from the SMNS remnants have much more baryon pollution and we see indications of inefficient acceleration and mixing with the surrounding debris. Therefore, we cannot conclude that SMNS outflows are the progenitors of sGRBs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.05395v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Modern inference schemes for the neutron star equation of state (EoS) require large numbers of stellar models constructed with different EoS, and these stellar models must capture all the behavior of stable stars. I introduce termination conditions for sequences of stellar models for cold, non-rotating neutron stars that can identify all stable stellar configurations up to arbitrarily large central pressures along with an efficient algorithm to build accurate interpolators for macroscopic properties. I explore the behavior of stars with both high- and low-central pressures. Interestingly, I find that EoS with monotonically increasing sound-speed can produce multiple stable branches (twin stars) and that large phase transitions at high densities can produce stable branches at nearly any mass scale, including sub-solar masses, while still supporting stars with $M &gt; 2\,M_\odot$. I conclude with some speculation about the astrophysical implications of this behavior.</description>

      <title>Gamma Ray AGNs: Estimating Redshifts and Blazar Classification using traditional Neural Networks with smart initialization and self-supervised learning</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.03782v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Redshift estimation and the classification of gamma-ray AGNs represent crucial challenges in the field of gamma-ray astronomy. Recent efforts have been made to tackle these problems using traditional machine learning methods. However, the simplicity of existing algorithms, combined with their basic implementations, underscores an opportunity and a need for further advancement in this area. Our approach begins by implementing a Bayesian model for redshift estimation, which can account for uncertainty while providing predictions with the desired confidence level. Subsequently, we address the classification problem by leveraging intelligent initialization techniques and employing soft voting. Additionally, we explore several potential self-supervised algorithms in their conventional form. Lastly, in addition to generating predictions for data with missing outputs, we ensure that the theoretical assertions put forth by both algorithms mutually reinforce each other.</description>

      <title>Explaining muon excess in cosmic rays using the gluon condensation model</title>

      <description>arXiv:2406.14822v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays are often characterized indirectly by analyzing the properties of secondary cosmic ray particles produced in the collisions with air nuclei. The particle number $N_\mu$ of muon and the depth of shower maximum $X_\mathrm{max}$ after air shower cascade are mostly studied to infer the energy and mass of the incident cosmic rays. Research have shown that there is a significant excess in the observed number of muons arriving at the ground from extensive air showers (EAS) compared to the simulations using the existing cosmic ray hadronic interaction model. To explain this muon excess phenomenon, a new theoretical model, the gluon condensation model (GC model), is introduced in this paper and simulated by using the AIRES engine. We assume that the GC effect appears mainly in the first collision of the cascade leading to a significant increase in the strangeness production, consequently, the production rate of kaons is increased and $n_K/n_\pi$ is greater than the value of the usual hadronic interaction process. In the calculation, the model assumes that only pions and kaons are produced in GC state. The increase of strange particle yield would mean that the energy transferred from the hadronic cascade to electromagnetic cascade through $\pi^{0} \rightarrow 2\gamma$ decay is reduced. This would in turn increase the number of muons at the ground level due to meson decays.Our model provides a new theoretical possibility to explain the muon excess puzzle.</description>

      <title>A New Perspective on the Diffuse Gamma-Ray Emission Excess</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.15474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.15474v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Large High-Altitude Air Shower Observatory (LHAASO) recently published measurements of diffuse Galactic gamma-ray emission (DGE) in the 10-1000 TeV energy range. The measured DGE flux is significantly higher than the expectation from hadronic interactions between cosmic rays (CRs) and the interstellar medium. This excess has been proposed to originate from unknown extended sources produced by electron radiation, such as pulsar wind nebulae or pulsar halos (PWNe/halos). In this study, we propose a new perspective to explain the DGE excess observed by LHAASO. The masking regions used in the LHAASO DGE measurement may not fully encompass the extended signals of PWNe/halos. By employing a two-zone diffusion model for electrons around pulsars, we find that the DGE excess in most regions of the Galactic plane can be well explained by the signal leakage model under certain parameters. Our results indicate that the signal leakage from known sources and contributions from unresolved sources should be considered complementary in explaining the DGE excess.</description>

      <title>Ejecta masses in Type Ia Supernovae -- Implications for the Progenitor and the Explosion Scenario</title>

      <description>arXiv:2408.11928v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The progenitor system(s) as well as the explosion mechanism(s) of thermonuclear (Type Ia) supernovae are long-standing issues in astrophysics. Here we present ejecta masses and other physical parameters for 28 recent Type Ia supernovae inferred from multiband photometric and optical spectroscopic data. Our results confirm that the majority of SNe Ia show {\it observable} ejecta masses below the Chandrasekhar-limit (having a mean $M_{\rm ej} \approx 1.1 \pm 0.3$ M$_\odot$), consistent with the predictions of recent sub-M$_{\rm Ch}$ explosion models. They are compatible with models assuming either single- or double-degenerate progenitor configurations. We also recover a sub-sample of supernovae within $1.2 $ M$_\odot$ $&lt; M_{\rm {ej}} &lt; 1.5$ M$_\odot$ that are consistent with near-Chandrasekhar explosions. Taking into account the uncertainties of the inferred ejecta masses, about half of our SNe are compatible with both explosion models. We compare our results with those in previous studies, and discuss the caveats and concerns regarding the applied methodology.</description>

      <title>Testing the Speed of Gravity with Black Hole Ringdown</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.10272v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate how the speed of gravitational waves, $c_{GW}$, can be tested by upcoming black hole ringdown observations. We do so in the context of hairy black hole solutions, where the hair is associated with a new scalar degree of freedom, forecasting that LISA and TianQin will be able to constrain deviations of $c_{GW}$ from the speed of light at the ${\cal O}(10^{-4})$ level from a single supermassive black hole merger. We discuss how these constraints depend on the nature of the scalar hair, what different aspects of the underlying physics they are sensitive to in comparison with constraints derived from gravitational wave propagation effects, which observable systems will place the most stringent bounds, and that constraints are expected to improve by up to two orders of magnitude with multiple observations. This is especially interesting for dark energy-related theories, where existing bounds from GW170817 need not apply at lower frequencies and where upcoming bounds from lower-frequency missions will therefore be especially powerful. As such, we also forecast analogous bounds for the intermediate-frequency AEDGE and DECIGO missions. Finally, we discuss and forecast analogous black hole ringdown constraints at higher frequencies (so from LVK, the Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer) and in what circumstances they can yield new information on top of existing constraints on $c_{GW}$. All calculations performed in this paper are reproducible via a companion Mathematica notebook.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2307.09213v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Joint observations in electromagnetic and gravitational waves shed light on the physics of objects and surrounding environments with extreme gravity that are otherwise unreachable via siloed observations in each messenger. However, such detections remain challenging due to the rapid and faint nature of counterparts. Protocols for discovery and inference still rely on human experts manually inspecting survey alert streams and intuiting optimal usage of limited follow-up resources. Strategizing an optimal follow-up program requires adaptive sequential decision-making given evolving light curve data that (i) maximizes a global objective despite incomplete information and (ii) is robust to stochasticity introduced by detectors/observing conditions. Reinforcement learning (RL) approaches allow agents to implicitly learn the physics/detector dynamics and the behavior policy that maximize a designated objective through experience. To demonstrate the utility of such an approach for the kilonova follow-up problem, we train a toy RL agent for the goal of maximizing follow-up photometry for the true kilonova among several contaminant transient light curves. In a simulated environment where the agent learns online, it achieves 3x higher accuracy compared to a random strategy. However, it is surpassed by human agents by up to a factor of 2. This is likely because our hypothesis function (Q that is linear in state-action features) is an insufficient representation of the optimal behavior policy. More complex agents could perform at par or surpass human experts. Agents like these could pave the way for machine-directed software infrastructure to efficiently respond to next generation detectors, for conducting science inference and optimally planning expensive follow-up observations, scalably and with demonstrable performance guarantees.</description>

      <title>Effects of Phi and $\sigma^{*}$-meson on properties of hyperon stars including $\Delta$ resonance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.00007</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.00007v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this work, we study the properties of neutron stars using the linear Relativistic Mean-Field (RMF) theory and consider multiple degrees of freedom inside neutron stars, including hyperons and $\Delta$ resonances. We investigate different coupling parameters $x_{\sigma \Delta}$ between $\Delta$ resonances and nucleons and compare the differences between neutron stars with and without strange mesons $\sigma^*$ and $\phi$. These effects include particle number distributions, equations of state (EOS), mass-radius relations, and tidal deformabilities. To overcome the "hyperon puzzle," we employ the $\sigma-cut$ scheme to obtain neutron stars with masses up to $2M_{\odot}$. We find that strange mesons appear at around 3$\rho_0$ and reduce the critical density of baryons in the high-density region. With increasing coupling parameter $x_{\sigma \Delta}$, the $\Delta$ resonances suppress hyperons, leading to a shift of the critical density towards lower values. The early appearance of $\Delta$ resonances may play a crucial role in the stability of neutron stars. Strange mesons soften the EOS slightly, while $\Delta$ resonances predominantly soften the EOS in the low-density region. By calculating tidal deformabilities and comparing with astronomical observation GW170817, we find that the inclusion of $\Delta$ resonances decreases the radius of neutron stars.</description>

      <title>The Anomalous Acceleration of PSR J2043+1711: Long-Period Orbital Companion or Stellar Flyby?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06482v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the rate of change of its orbital period, PSR J2043+1711 has a substantial peculiar acceleration of 3.5 $\pm$ 0.8 mm/s/yr, which deviates from the acceleration predicted by equilibrium Milky Way models at a $4\sigma$ level. The magnitude of the peculiar acceleration is too large to be explained by disequilibrium effects of the Milky Way interacting with orbiting dwarf galaxies ($\sim$1 mm/s/yr), and too small to be caused by period variations due to the pulsar being a redback. We identify and examine two plausible causes for the anomalous acceleration: a stellar flyby, and a long-period orbital companion. We identify a main-sequence star in \textit{Gaia} DR3 and Pan-STARRS DR2 with the correct mass, distance, and on-sky position to potentially explain the observed peculiar acceleration. However, the star and the pulsar system have substantially different proper motions, indicating that they are not gravitationally bound. However, it is possible that this is an unrelated star that just happens to be located near J2043+1711 along our line of sight (chance probability of 1.6\%). Therefore, we also constrain possible orbital parameters for a circumbinary companion in a hierarchical triple system with J2043+1711; the changes in the spindown rate of the pulsar are consistent with an outer object that has an orbital period of 80 kyr, a companion mass of 0.3 $M_\odot$ (indicative of a white dwarf or low-mass star), and a semi-major axis of 2000 AU. Continued timing and/or future faint optical observations of J2043+1711 may eventually allow us to differentiate between these scenarios.</description>

      <title>Galactic Gas Models Strongly Affect the Determination of the Diffusive Halo Height</title>

Abstract: The height of the Milky Way diffusion halo, above which cosmic-rays can freely escape the galaxy, is among the most critical, yet poorly known, parameters in cosmic-ray physics. Measurements of radioactive secondaries, such as $^{10}$Be or $^{26}$Al, which decay equivalently throughout the diffusive volume, are expected to provide the strongest constraints. This has motivated significant observational work to constrain their isotopic ratios, along with theoretical work to constrain the cross-section uncertainties that are thought to dominate radioactive secondary fluxes. In this work, we show that the imprecise modelling of the Milky Way spiral arms significantly affects our ability to translate $^{10}$Be and $^{26}$Al fluxes into constraints on the diffusive halo height, biasing our current results. Utilizing state-of-the-art spiral arms models we produce new predictions for the $^{10}$Be and $^{26}$Al fluxes that motivate upcoming measurements by AMS-02 and HELIX.</description>
