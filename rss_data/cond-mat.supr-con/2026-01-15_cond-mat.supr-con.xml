      <title>Vanishing Phase Stiffness and Fluctuation-Dominated Superconductivity: Evidence for Inter-Band Pairing in UTe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09138v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Superconductivity in three dimensions is almost universally governed by Ginzburg-Landau mean field theory, with critical fluctuations typically confined to within a few percent of the transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$). We report that the heavy-Fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ exhibits a fluctuation regime that extends over a temperature range as wide as $T_{\rm c}$ itself -- the largest observed for any three-dimensional superconductor. Through ultrasound measurements of the elastic moduli and sound attenuation, we find that UTe$_2$ transitions from a mean-field-like state at ambient pressure to a fluctuation dominated state at higher pressures. This regime is marked by elastic softening and an increase in sound attenuation that onsets well above $T_{\rm c}$, with the attenuation remaining anomalously high deep in the superconducting state. Our analysis shows that these features stem from an extremely low superfluid phase stiffness. This results in a kinetic inductance as high as that of granular aluminum, but achieved in the clean limit. We propose that this exotic state is driven by dominant inter-band pairing mediated by ferromagnetic fluctuations, leading to "local" cooper pairs with a coherence length of only a few lattice constants.</description>

      <title>Interactions of composite magnetic skyrmion-superconducting vortex pairs in ferromagnetic superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09396</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09396v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study composite topological excitations in ferromagnetic superconductors consisting of bound states of magnetic spin textures (skyrmions) and superconducting vortices. Using a Ginzburg--Landau framework with Zeeman coupling between the magnetization and superconducting magnetic field, we demonstrate that skyrmion-vortex pairs (SVPs) form energetically stable bound states. By analyzing their asymptotic interactions, we identify regimes in which SVPs exhibit both short-range repulsion and long-range attraction, leading to clustering phenomena. Our results provide a field-theoretical basis for understanding suggest pathways for controlling hybrid topological matter through long-range interactions.</description>

      <title>Nanoscale Spatial Tuning of Superconductivity in Cuprate Thin Films via Direct Laser Writing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09513</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09513v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Cuprate high-temperature superconductors, such as Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO), are extremely promising for emerging technologies such as low-power computing, data storage, quantum sensors and superconducting electronics. However, the realization of high-performance functional nanostructures presents formidable challenges due to the difficulty of applying conventional nanofabrication methods to such sensitive materials, making the search for alternative methods a key enabling factor. Since YBCO's superconducting and normal-state properties are highly dependent on oxygen stoichiometry, precise nanoscale control of the oxygen content represents a highly appealing approach for creating advanced nanoengineered devices. In this work, we demonstrate the precise fabrication of sub-micrometer, grayscale patterns over large areas in epitaxial YBCO thin films, achieving finely tuned optical and superconducting transport properties by locally controlling the stoichiometry through maskless direct laser writing under ambient conditions. Cryogenic magneto-optical imaging and transport measurements in irradiated devices directly demonstrate the spatial tuning of the critical temperature and carrier density with the patterning conditions. Correlated Raman microscopy and reflectometry of the patterned regions indicate a laser-power dependent oxygen depletion in the irradiated regions. The proposed laser-controlled stoichiometry approach provides a direct and scalable method to navigate the phase diagram of high-Tc superconducting oxides, offering new possibilities for integrating functional nanostructures into superconducting devices.</description>

      <title>Submicrometer tunnel ferromagnetic Josephson junctions with transmon energy scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have realized submicron tunnel ferromagnetic Al/AlO$_x$/Al/Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$/Al Josephson junctions (JJs) in Manhattan-style configuration for qubit applications. These junctions have been designed to lie within the energy range of transmons. The current-voltage characteristics of these junctions are comparable with those of standard JJs implemented in state-of-the-art transmons, thus confirming the high quality of the devices and marking a significant step toward the realization of the ferrotransmon. Low-frequency characterization confirms that our junctions operate in the quantum phase diffusion limit, as tunnel JJs in conventional transmons with similar characteristic energies. Ultimately, mitigation of quantum phase fluctuations will represent a key for advancing the entire field of superconducting quantum circuit architectures.</description>

      <title>Electronic layer decoupling driven by density-wave order in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08997</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.08997v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We probe the density-wave transition of the trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ with polarization-resolved infrared spectroscopy. The low-energy electrodynamics is strongly anisotropic, with metallic in-plane and insulating out-of-plane character. In the ordered phase, the anisotropy grows more than an order of magnitude as the out-of-plane conductivity is sharply suppressed. We interpret this enhancement as an effective electronic decoupling of the Ni-O layers, driven by a spin-density-wave-induced redistribution of Ni-$d_{z^2}$ occupation within the trilayers. This electronic response is accompanied by clear shifts and splittings of the out-of-plane phonons, compatible with a density-wave instability of electronic origin.</description>

      <title>Magneto-optical Kerr effect measurements under bipolar pulsed magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09221v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is a powerful probe of magnetism. Its contact-free optical nature makes it potentially well suitable for measurements under pulsed magnetic fields if various difficulties are overcome. In this paper, we report the establishment of MOKE measurements under bipolar pulsed magnetic fields up to 13.1 T. The accuracy of the setup was demonstrated by the excellent agreement with static-field results on the (001) surface of a Fe3O4 single crystal. Furthermore, clear hysteresis loops of various commercial permanent magnets were successfully observed. The capability for rapid characterization of hysteretic properties highlights the versatility of our pulsed-field MOKE setup for both fundamental materials science and engineering applications.</description>

      <title>Evolution from three-dimensional charge density wave to one-dimensional stripe order in CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09257</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09257v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Understanding intertwined phases near quantum criticality is a central challenge in correlated electron systems. The kagome metal CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$ provides a fertile platform to investigate the interplay between charge-density-wave (CDW) and superconductivity. Here, combining x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), we uncover a dimensional evolution of the CDW upon Ti substitution. We find that even infinitesimal Ti doping (x = 0.009) completely suppresses the three-dimensional 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 4 CDW present in pristine CsV3Sb5, while reducing the remaining 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 CDW to a quasi-two-dimensional order. With further Ti substitution, although no CDW transition is discernible in resistivity measurements, our XRD and STM data reveal the emergence of a (quasi-)one-dimensional CDW with a short correlation length of $\sim$ 20 $\AA$ at x = 0.2. The stripelike CDW undergoes a continuous second-order phase transition, characterized by a gradual increase in intensity and correlation length below $\sim$ 56 K. Our results elucidate the dimensional evolution of CDW order in CsV$_{3-x}$Ti$_x$Sb$_5$ and provide new insight into understanding the unconventional CDWs and their role in kagome superconductors.</description>

      <title>Characterization of Silicon-Membrane TES Microcalorimeters for Large-Format X-ray Spectrometers with Integrated Microwave SQUID Readout</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09629</link>
      <description>arXiv:2601.09629v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the electro-thermal characterization of transition-edge sensor (TES) detectors suspended on Si membranes fabricated using a silicon-on-insulator (SOI) wafer. The use of an all-silicon fabrication platform, in contrast to the more commonly used silicon nitride membranes, is compatible with monolithic fabrication of integrated TES and SQUID circuits. The all-silicon architecture additionally allows efficient use of focal plane area; the readout circuitry may be positioned out of the focal plane by bending a thinned portion of the chip. Compatibility with integrated fabrication and efficient use of focal plane area provide a path to an efficient soft X-ray spectrometer.
  This work is motivated by our goal to develop a 10,000-pixel TES spectrometer to overcome critical measurement limitations in catalysis research. The characterization of fragile, carbon-based intermediates via techniques like Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering (RIXS) is often precluded by the slow, high-flux nature of existing technologies. The new instrument will allow for fast RIXS measurements to be made without causing sample damage. We verify the detector models and measure the energy resolution using a pulsed optical laser, demonstrating the viability of this approach for the final instrument to be deployed at the National Synchrotron Light Source II (NSLS-II).</description>

      <title>The interplay of phase fluctuations and nodal quasiparticles: ubiquitous Fermi arcs in two-dimensional d-wave superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.05376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2310.05376v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose that the pseudogap and Fermi arcs can universally emerge due to thermal (static) phase fluctuations in the normal state of 2D nodal superconductors. By considering a minimal phenomenological model with spatially fluctuating superconducting pairings, we theoretically investigate the role of superconducting phase fluctuations in generic 2D superconductors with disorder-average technique. It is shown for nodal d-wave superconductors that phase fluctuations mediate the scattering of d-wave quasiparticles, smearing out the nodal quasiparticle gap and further leading to pseudogap and Fermi arcs. Moreover, the evolution of Fermi arcs is quantitatively described by two emergent characteristic length scales of the system: one is the finite superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)$, and another the nodal BCS coherence length $\xi_\text{BCS}(k)$. To support our theoretical findings, we numerically report the observation of Fermi arcs in a Hubbard-like model, proposed originally by X. Y. Xu and T. Grover in Phys. Rev. Lett. $\textbf{126}$, 217002 (2021), with sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) calculations. As far as we noticed, it is the first time in a correlated model that phase-fluctuating Fermi arcs are identified with unbiased simulations. The numerical results for the scattering rate $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ of Cooper pairs exhibit excellent agreements with our theoretical predictions, where $\Gamma_\text{pf}$ is expected to scale linearly with the inverse superconducting correlation length $\xi(T)^{-1}$. This convergence of theory and numerics thereby strongly validates the universal connection between phase fluctuations and Fermi arcs in 2D nodal superconductors.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional flat band on the (011) surface of UTe$_2$: Implication for STM measurements with a superconducting tip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.16166v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements have been extensively performed on the easily cleavable (011) surface of UTe$_2$, using both normal-metal and superconducting tips. Motivated by these experiments, we theoretically investigate the topological surface states on the (011) surface of UTe$_2$. We find that a two-dimensional nearly flat band emerges in the $B_{3u}$ state, giving rise to a pronounced zero-energy peak in the surface density of states. This flat band is supported by two key mechanisms: (i)~nontrivial Berry phases defined at multiple momenta give rise to low-energy in-gap states, and (ii)~weak spin conservation allows the gap function to acquire phase winding. Furthermore, to investigate the relation between the zero-bias peak observed in recent STM experiments with a superconducting tip and the topological surface states, we calculate the nonequilibrium dc tunneling current in a junction between an $s$-wave superconductor and the (011) surface of UTe$_2$. Our results provide crucial insights into the superconducting pairing symmetry realized in UTe$_2$.</description>

      <title>Pressure and doping control of magnetic order and metallization in Ruddlesden-Popper La2NiO4</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.03277v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in multilayer nickelates under pressure has intensified interest in understanding the magnetic and electronic properties of Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates. Using density functional theory with Hubbard corrections, we investigate the magnetic ground state, electronic structure evolution under pressure, and Sr-doping effects in La$_2$NiO$_4$. We find that at ambient pressure, tetragonal La$_2$NiO$_4$ exhibits G-type antiferromagnetic order with negligible interlayer magnetic coupling. Under hydrostatic pressure, the system undergoes a continuous insulator-metal transition at ~50 GPa while maintaining robust magnetic order up to 75 GPa, contrasting sharply with the rapid magnetic suppression in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Sr doping induces a systematic evolution from G-type to A-type, to striped antiferromagnetic orders, and eventually to ferromagnetic order, accompanied by metallization. Furthermore, LaSrNiO$_4$ displays weak charge and orbital orders. These results reveal the unique pressure and doping effects of single-layer nickelates and provide insights into the magnetic mechanisms underlying nickelate superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Euler band topology in superfluids and superconductors</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.06406v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Real band topology often appears in systems with space-time inversion symmetry and is characterized by invariants such as the Euler and second Stiefel-Whitney classes. Here, we examine the generic band topology of Bogoliubov de-Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonians with $C_{2z}T$ symmetry, where $C_{2z}$ and $T$ are twofold rotation about the $z$ axis and time-reversal symmetries, respectively. We discuss the Euler band topology of superfluids and superconductors in the DIII and CI Altland-Zirnbauer symmetry classes, where the Euler class serves as an integer-valued topological invariant of the $4\times4$ BdG Hamiltonian. Using expressions for the Euler class under $n$-fold rotational symmetry, we derive formulas relating the Euler class to previously known topological invariants of class DIII and CI systems. We demonstrate that three-dimensional class DIII topological phases with an odd winding number, including the B phase of superfluid Helium 3, are topological superconductors or superfluids with a nontrivial Euler class. We refer to these as Euler superconductors or superfluids. Specifically, the $^3$He-B superfluid in a magnetic field is identified as an Euler superfluid. Three-dimensional class CI topological phases with twice an odd winding number are also Euler superconductors or superfluids. When spatial inversion symmetry is present, class CI superconductors with a nontrivial Euler class exhibit superconducting nodal lines with a linking structure. This phenomenon is demonstrated using a model of a three-dimensional $s_\pm$-wave superconductor. These findings provide a unified framework for exploring Euler band topology in superfluids and superconductors, connecting various phenomena associated with $T$-breaking perturbations, including Majorana Ising susceptibility and higher-order topology.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the Casimir force between superconductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13759v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Casimir force follows from quantum fluctuations of the electromagnetic field and yields a nonlinear attractive force between closely spaced conductive objects. Its magnitude depends on the conductivity of the objects up to optical frequencies. Measuring the Casimir force in superconductors should allow to isolate frequency-specific contributions to the Casimir effect, as frequencies below the superconducting gap energy are expected to contribute differently than those above it. There is significant interest in this contribution as it is suspected to contribute to an unexplained discrepancy between predictions and measurements of the Casimir force between normal metals, which questions the basic principles on which estimates of the magnitude are based. Here, we observe the Casimir force between superconducting objects through the nonlinear dynamics it imparts to a superconducting drum resonator in a microwave optomechanical system. There is excellent agreement between the experiment and the Casimir force magnitude computed for this device across three orders of magnitude of displacement. Furthermore, the Casimir nonlinearity is intense enough that, with a modified design, this device type should operate in the single-phonon nonlinear regime. Accessing this regime has been a long-standing goal that would greatly facilitate quantum operations of mechanical resonators.</description>
