      <title>Signals as submanifolds, and configurations of points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15375</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15375v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: For the purposes of abstract theory of signal propagation, a signal is a submanifold of a Riemannian manifold. We obtain energy inequalities, or upper bounds, lower bounds on energy in a number of specific cases, including parameter spaces of Gaussians and spaces of configurations of points. We discuss the role of time as well as graph embeddings.</description>

      <title>New quantum codes from constacyclic codes over finite chain rings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15558</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15558v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $R$ be the finite chain ring $\mathbb{F}_{p^{2m}}+{u}\mathbb{F}_{p^{2m}}$, where $\mathbb{F}_{p^{2m}}$ is the finite field with $p^{2m}$ elements,
  $p$ is a prime, $m$ is a non-negative integer and ${u}^{2}=0.$ In this paper, we firstly define a class of Gray maps, which changes the Hermitian self-orthogonal property of linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}+{u}\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}$ into the Hermitian self-orthogonal property of linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}$. Applying the Hermitian construction, a new class of $2^{m}$-ary
  quantum codes are obtained from Hermitian constacyclic self-orthogonal codes over $\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}+{u}\mathbb{F}_{2^{2m}}.$ We secondly define another class of maps, which changes the Hermitian self-orthogonal property of linear codes over $R$ into the trace self-orthogonal property of linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_{p^{2m}}$. Using the Symplectic construction, a new class of $p^{m}$-ary quantum codes are obtained from Hermitian constacyclic self-orthogonal codes over $R.$</description>

      <title>$r$-Minimal Codes with Respect to Rank Metric</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15592</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15592v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we propose and study $r$-minimal codes, a natural extension of minimal codes which have been extensively studied with respect to Hamming metric, rank metric and sum-rank metric. We first propose $r$-minimal codes in a general setting where the ambient space is a finite dimensional left module over a division ring and is supported on a lattice. We characterize minimal subcodes and $r$-minimal codes, derive a general singleton bound, and give existence results for $r$-minimal codes by using combinatorial arguments. We then consider $r$-minimal rank metric codes over a field extension $\mathbb{E}/\mathbb{F}$ of degree $m$, where $\mathbb{E}$ can be infinite. We characterize these codes in terms of cutting $r$-blocking sets, generalized rank weights of the codes and those of the dual codes, and classify codes whose $r$-dimensional subcodes have constant rank support weight. Next, with the help of the evasiveness property of cutting $r$-blocking sets and some upper bounds for the dimensions of evasive subspaces, we derive several lower and upper bounds for the minimal length of $r$-minimal codes. Furthermore, when $\mathbb{E}$ is finite, we establish a general upper bound which generalizes and improves the counterpart for minimal codes in the literature. As a corollary, we show that if $m=3$, then for any $k\geqslant2$, the minimal length of $k$-dimensional minimal codes is equal to $2k$. To the best of our knowledge, when $m\geqslant3$, there was no known explicit formula for the minimal length of $k$-dimensional minimal codes for arbitrary $k$ in the literature.</description>

      <title>Hybrid OTFS/OFDM Design in Massive MIMO</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15652</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15652v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider a downlink (DL) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system, where different users have different mobility profiles. To support this system, we categorize the users into two disjoint groups according to their mobility profile and implement a hybrid orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS)/orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation scheme. Building upon this framework, two precoding designs, namely full-pilot zero-forcing (FZF) precoding and partial zero-forcing (PZF) precoding are considered. To shed light on the system performance, the spectral efficiency (SE) with a minimum-mean-square-error (MMSE)-successive interference cancellation (SIC) detector is investigated. Closed-form expressions for the SE are obtained using some tight mathematical approximations. To improve fairness among different users, we consider max-min power control for both precoding schemes based on the closed-form SE expression. However, by noting the large performance gap for different groups of users with PZF precoding, the per-user SE will be compromised when pursuing overall fairness. Therefore, we propose a weighted max-min power control scheme. By introducing a weighting coefficient, the trade-off between the per-user performance and fairness can be enhanced. Our numerical results confirm the theoretical analysis and reveal that with mobility-based grouping, the proposed hybrid OTFS/OFDM modulation significantly outperforms the conventional OFDM modulation for high-mobility users.</description>

      <title>Movable Antennas Meet Intelligent Reflecting Surface: When Do We Need Movable Antennas?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15668v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA)/fluid antenna (FA) techniques have both received increasing attention in the realm of wireless communications due to their ability to reconfigure and improve wireless channel conditions. In this paper, we investigate the integration of MAs/FAs into an IRS-assisted wireless communication system. In particular, we consider the downlink transmission from a multi-MA base station (BS) to a single-antenna user with the aid of an IRS, aiming to maximize the user's received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), by jointly optimizing the BS/IRS active/passive beamforming and the MAs' positions. Due to the similar capability of MAs and IRS for channel reconfiguration, we first conduct theoretical analysis of the performance gain of MAs over conventional fixed-position antennas (FPAs) under the line-of-sight (LoS) BS-IRS channel and derive the conditions under which the performance gain becomes more or less significant. Next, to solve the received SNR maximization problem, we propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that decomposes it into two subproblems and solve them alternately. Numerical results are provided to validate our analytical results and evaluate the performance gains of MAs over FPAs under different setups.</description>

      <title>Neural Network Equalizers and Successive Interference Cancellation for Bandlimited Channels with a Nonlinearity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15767</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15767v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Neural networks (NNs) inspired by the forward-backward algorithm (FBA) are used as equalizers for bandlimited channels with a memoryless nonlinearity. The NN-equalizers are combined with successive interference cancellation (SIC) to approach the information rates of joint detection and decoding (JDD) with considerably less complexity than JDD and other existing equalizers. Simulations for short-haul optical fiber links with square-law detection illustrate the gains.</description>

      <title>220 GHz Urban Microcell Channel Measurement and Characterization on a University Campus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15772</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15772v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Owning abundant bandwidth resources, the Terahertz (THz) band (0.1-10~THz) is envisioned as a key technology to realize ultra-high-speed communications in 6G and beyond wireless networks. To realize reliable THz communications in urban microcell (UMi) environments, propagation analysis and channel characterization are still insufficient. In this paper, channel measurement campaigns are conducted in a UMi scenario at 220~GHz, using a correlation-based time domain channel sounder. 24 positions are measured along a road on the university campus, with distances ranging from 34~m to 410~m. Based on the measurement results, the spatial consistency and interaction of THz waves to the surrounding environments are analyzed. Moreover, the additional loss due to foliage blockage is calculated and an average value of 16.7~dB is observed. Furthermore, a full portrait of channel characteristics, including path loss, shadow fading, K-factor, delay and angular spreads, as well as cluster parameters, is calculated and analyzed. Specifically, an average K-factor value of 17.5 dB is measured in the line-of-sight (LoS) case, which is nearly two times larger than the extrapolated values from the 3GPP standard, revealing weak multipath effects in the THz band. Additionally, 2.5 clusters on average are observed in the LoS case, around one fifth of what is defined in the 3GPP model, which uncovers the strong sparsity in THz UMi. The results and analysis in this work can offer guidance for system design for future THz UMi networks.</description>

      <title>Explicit Folded Reed-Solomon and Multiplicity Codes Achieve Relaxed Generalized Singleton Bound</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15925</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15925v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that any `appropriate' folded Reed-Solomon and univariate multiplicity codes achieve relaxed generalized Singleton bound for list size $L\ge1.$ More concretely, we show the following: (1) Any $(s,\gamma)$-folded RS code over the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_q^s$ of block length $n$ and rate $R$ with pair-wise distinct evaluation points $\{\gamma^i\alpha_j\}_{(i,j)\in\left(\{0\}\sqcup[s-1],[n]\right)}\subset\mathbb{F}_q$ are $\left(\frac{L}{L+1}\left(1-\frac{sR}{s-L+1}\right),L\right)$ (average-radius) list-decodable for list size $L\in[s]$. (2) Any $s$-order univariate multiplicity code over the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_p^s$ ($p$ is a prime) of block length $n$ and rate $R$ with pair-wise distinct evaluation points $\{\alpha_i\}_{i\in[n]}\subset\mathbb{F}_p$ are $\left(\frac{L}{L+1}\left(1-\frac{sR}{s-L+1}\right),L\right)$ (average-radius) list-decodable for list size $L\in[s]$.
  Choose $s=\Theta(1/\epsilon^2)$ and $L=O(1/\epsilon)$, our results imply that both explicit folded RS codes and explicit univariate multiplicity codes achieve list decoding capacity $1-R-\epsilon$ with evidently optimal list size $O(1/\epsilon)$, which exponentially improves the previous state-of-the-art $(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ established by Kopparty, Ron-Zewi, Saraf, and Wootters (FOCS 2018 or SICOMP, 2023) and Tamo (IEEE TIT, 2024). In particular, our results on folded Reed--Solomon codes fully resolve a long-standing open problem originally proposed by Guruswami and Rudra (STOC 2006 or IEEE TIT, 2008). Furthermore, our results imply the first explicit constructions of $(1-R-\epsilon,O(1/\epsilon))$ (average-radius) list-decodable codes of rate $R$ with polynomial-sized alphabets in the literature.</description>

      <title>Concentric UCAs Based Low-Order OAM for High Capacity in Radio Vortex Wireless Communications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15273v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to the potential capacity-boosting for wireless communications, the Radio vOrtex Wireless COMMunication (RowComm) over orthogonal states/modes of Orbital Angular Momentum (OAM) has been paid much attention in recent years. Uniform circular array (UCA), as an efficient and convenient antenna structure, can transmit/receive multiple OAM beams with different OAM-modes simultaneously when the transmitter and receiver are aligned. However, for high-order OAM-modes, the OAM beams are divergent accompanied by severe attenuations. Thus, it is difficult to directly use high-order OAM-modes to achieve high capacity for RowComms. To obtain high capacity potentially offered by OAM-modes, in this paper we transform the singular UCA into the concentric UCAs, where high capacity can be achieved using multiple parallel low-order OAM-modes instead of all high-order OAM-modes, to increase the capacity of transmitter-receiver aligned RowComms. In particular, we study two cases: 1). Concentric UCAs based RowComms without co-mode interference; 2). Concentric UCAs based RowComms with co-mode interference. We propose a co-mode-interference-free and a co-mode-interference-contained mode-decomposition schemes to recover transmit signals for these two cases, respectively. Also, we develop the optimal power allocation schemes to maximize the capacity for these two cases. Numerical simulations are presented to validate and evaluate that our developed concentric UCAs based low-order RowComms can significantly increase the capacity as compared with that of singular UCA based RowComms.</description>

      <title>An eBPF-Based Trace-Driven Emulation Method for Satellite Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15581v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: System-level performance evaluation over satellite networks often requires a simulated or emulated environment for reproducibility and low cost. However, the existing tools may not meet the needs for scenarios such as the low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks. To address the problem, this paper proposes and implements a trace-driven emulation method based on Linux's eBPF technology. Building a Starlink traces collection system, we demonstrate that the method can effectively and efficiently emulate the connection conditions, and therefore provides a means for evaluating applications on local hosts.</description>

      <title>Shot Segmentation Based on Von Neumann Entropy for Key Frame Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15844v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Video key frame extraction is important in various fields, such as video summary, retrieval, and compression. Therefore, we suggest a video key frame extraction algorithm based on shot segmentation using Von Neumann entropy. The segmentation of shots is achieved through the computation of Von Neumann entropy of the similarity matrix among frames within the video sequence. The initial frame of each shot is selected as key frames, which combines the temporal sequence information of frames. The experimental results show the extracted key frames can fully and accurately represent the original video content while minimizing the number of repeated frames.</description>

      <title>Cartan-Schouten metrics for information geometry and machine learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15854</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15854v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study Cartan-Schouten metrics, explore invariant dual connections, and propose them as models for Information Geometry.
  Based on the underlying Riemannian barycenter and the biinvariant mean of Lie groups, we subsequently propose a new parametric mean for data science and machine learning which comes with several advantages compared to traditional tools such as the arithmetic mean, median, mode, expectation, least square method, maximum likelihood, linear regression. We call a metric on a Lie group, a Cartan-Schouten metric, if its Levi-Civita connection is biinvariant, so every 1-parameter subgroup through the unit is a geodesic.
  Except for not being left or right invariant in general, Cartan-Schouten metrics enjoy the same geometry as biinvariant metrics, since they share the same Levi-Civita connection. To bypass the non-invariance apparent drawback, we show that Cartan-Schouten metrics are completely determined by their value at the unit. We give an explicit formula for recovering them from their value at the unit, thus making them much less computationally demanding, compared to general metrics on manifolds. Furthermore, Lie groups with Cartan-Schouten metrics are complete Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifolds. We give a complete characterization of Lie groups with Riemannian or Lorentzian Cartan-Schouten metrics. Cartan-Schouten metrics are in abundance on 2-nilpotent Lie groups. Namely, on every 2-nilpotent Lie group, there is a 1-1 correspondence between the set of left invariant metrics and that of Cartan-Schouten metrics.</description>

      <title>Many-Help-One Problem for Gaussian Sources with a Tree Structure on their Correlation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/0901.1988</link>
      <description>arXiv:0901.1988v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper we consider the separate coding problem for $L+1$ correlated Gaussian memoryless sources. We deal with the case where $L$ separately encoded data of sources work as side information at the decoder for the reconstruction of the remaining source. The determination problem of the rate distortion region for this system is the so called many-help-one problem and has been known as a highly challenging problem. The author determined the rate distortion region in the case where the $L$ sources working as partial side information are conditionally independent if the remaining source we wish to reconstruct is given. This condition on the correlation is called the CI condition. In this paper we extend the author's previous result to the case where $L+1$ sources satisfy a kind of tree structure on their correlation. We call this tree structure of information sources the TS condition, which contains the CI condition as a special case. In this paper we derive an explicit outer bound of the rate distortion region when information sources satisfy the TS condition. We further derive an explicit sufficient condtion for this outer bound to be tight. In particular, we determine the sum rate part of the rate distortion region for the case where information sources satisfy the TS condition. For some class of Gaussian sources with the TS condition we derive an explicit recursive formula of this sum rate part.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates covert communications in an integrated sensing and communications system, where a dual-functional base station (called Alice) covertly transmits signals to a covert user (called Bob) while sensing multiple targets, with one of them acting as a potential watcher (called Willie) and maliciously eavesdropping on legitimate communications. To shelter the covert communications, Alice transmits additional dual-functional artificial noise (DFAN) with a varying power not only to create uncertainty at Willie's signal reception to confuse Willie but also to sense the targets simultaneously. Based on this framework, the weighted sum of the sensing beampattern means square error (MSE) and cross correlation is minimized by jointly optimizing the covert communication and DFAN signals subject to the minimum covert rate requirement. The robust design considers both cases of imperfect Willie's CSI (WCSI) and statistical WCSI. Under the worst-case assumption that Willie can adaptively adjust the detection threshold to achieve the best detection performance, the minimum detection error probability (DEP) at Willie is analytically derived in the closed-form expression. The formulated covertness constrained optimization problems are tackled by a feasibility-checking based difference-of-convex relaxation (DC) algorithm utilizing the S-procedure, Bernstein-type inequality, and the DC method. Simulation results validate the feasibility of the proposed scheme and demonstrate the covertness performance gains achieved by our proposed design over various benchmarks.</description>

      <title>Revisit the Arimoto-Blahut algorithm: New Analysis with Approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06013</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06013v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: By the seminal paper of Claude Shannon \cite{Shannon48}, the computation of the capacity of a discrete memoryless channel has been considered as one of the most important and fundamental problems in Information Theory. Nearly 50 years ago, Arimoto and Blahut independently proposed identical algorithms to solve this problem in their seminal papers \cite{Arimoto1972AnAF, Blahut1972ComputationOC}. The Arimoto-Blahut algorithm was proven to converge to the capacity of the channel as $t \to \infty$ with the convergence rate upper bounded by $O\left(\log(m)/t\right)$, where $m$ is the size of the input distribution, and being inverse exponential when there is a unique solution in the interior of the input probability simplex \cite{Arimoto1972AnAF}. Recently it was proved, in \cite{Nakagawa2020AnalysisOT}, that the convergence rate is at worst inverse linear $O(1/t)$ in some specific cases.
  In this paper, we revisit this fundamental algorithm looking at the rate of convergence to the capacity and the time complexity, given $m,n$, where $n$ is size of the output of the channel, focusing on the approximation of the capacity. We prove that the rate of convergence to an $\varepsilon$-optimal solution, for any constant $\varepsilon &gt; 0$, is inverse exponential $O\left(\log(m)/c^t\right)$, for a constant $c &gt; 1$ and $O\left(\log \left(\log (m)/\varepsilon\right)\right)$ at most iterations, implying $O\left(m n\log \left(\log (m)/\varepsilon\right)\right)$ total complexity of the algorithm.</description>

      <title>An Efficient Convex-Hull Relaxation Based Algorithm for Multi-User Discrete Passive Beamforming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.20914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.20914v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an emerging technology to enhance spatial multiplexing in wireless networks. This letter considers the discrete passive beamforming design for IRS in order to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among multiple users in an IRS-assisted downlink network. The main design difficulty lies in the discrete phase-shift constraint. Differing from most existing works, this letter advocates a convex-hull relaxation of the discrete constraints which leads to a continuous reformulated problem equivalent to the original discrete problem. This letter further proposes an efficient alternating projection/proximal gradient descent and ascent algorithm for solving the reformulated problem. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the state-of-the-art methods significantly.</description>

      <title>Codes Correcting Two Bursts of Exactly $b$ Deletions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03113</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.03113v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we explore constructions for codes that correct two bursts of deletions, with each burst having length exactly $b$. Previously, the best known construction, derived using the syndrome compression technique, achieved a redundancy of at most $7\log n+O\left(\log n/\log\log n\right)$ bits. In this work, we develop new idea idea to construct $q$-ary codes that achieve redundancy at most $6\log n+O(\log\log n)$ when $b&gt;1$. At last, for $b=1$, we provide a new construction of $q$-ary two-deletion correcting codes with redundancy $5\log n+O(\log\log n)$ for all $q&gt;2$.</description>

      <title>Symplectic Bregman divergences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12961</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.12961v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a generalization of Bregman divergences in symplectic vector spaces that we term symplectic Bregman divergences. Symplectic Bregman divergences are derived from a symplectic generalization of the Fenchel-Young inequality which relies on the notion of symplectic subdifferentials. The symplectic Fenchel-Young inequality is obtained using the symplectic Fenchel transform which is defined with respect to the symplectic form. Since symplectic forms can be generically built from pairings of dual systems, we get a generalization of Bregman divergences in dual systems obtained by equivalent symplectic Bregman divergences. In particular, when the symplectic form is derived from an inner product, we show that the corresponding symplectic Bregman divergences amount to ordinary Bregman divergences with respect to composite inner products. Some potential applications of symplectic divergences in geometric mechanics, information geometry, and learning dynamics in machine learning are touched upon.</description>

      <title>Modeling and Statistical Characterization of Large-Scale Automotive Radar Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.13645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.13645v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The impact of discrete clutter and co-channel interference on the performance of automotive radar networks has been studied using stochastic geometry, in particular, by leveraging two-dimensional Poisson point processes (PPPs). However, such characterization does not take into account the impact of street geometry and the fact that the location of the automotive radars are restricted to the streets as their domain rather than the entire Euclidean plane. In addition, the structure of the streets may change drastically as a vehicle moves out of a city center towards the outskirts. Consequently, not only the radar performance change but also the radar parameters and protocols must be adapted for optimum performance. In this paper, we propose and characterize line and Cox process-based street and point models to analyze large-scale automotive radar networks. We consider the classical Poisson line process (PLP) and the newly introduced Binomial line process (BLP) model to emulate the streets and the corresponding PPP-based Cox process to emulate the vehicular nodes. In particular, the BLP model effectively considers the spatial variation of street geometry across different parts of the city. We derive the effective interference set experienced by an automotive radar, the statistics of distance to interferers, and characterize the detection probability of the ego radar as a function of street and vehicle density. Finally, leveraging the real-world data on urban streets and vehicle density across different cities of the world, we present how the radar performance varies in different parts of the city as well as across different times of the day. Thus, our study equips network operators and automotive manufacturers with essential system design insights to plan and optimize automotive radar networks.</description>

      <title>Myocardial Infarction Detection from ECG: A Gramian Angular Field-based 2D-CNN Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.13011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2302.13011v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for inferior myocardial infarction (MI) detection using lead II of electrocardiogram (ECG). We evaluate our proposed method on a public dataset, namely, Physikalisch Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) ECG dataset from Physionet. Under our proposed method, we first clean the noisy ECG signals using db4 wavelet, followed by an R-peak detection algorithm to segment the ECG signals into beats. We then translate the ECG timeseries dataset to an equivalent dataset of gray-scale images using Gramian Angular Summation Field (GASF) and Gramian Angular Difference Field (GADF) operations. Subsequently, the gray-scale images are fed into a custom two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) which efficiently differentiates between a healthy subject and a subject with MI. Our proposed approach achieves an average classification accuracy of 99.68%, 99.80%, 99.82%, and 99.84% under GASF dataset with noise and baseline wander, GADF dataset with noise and baseline wander, GASF dataset with noise and baseline wander removed, and GADF dataset with noise and baseline wander removed, respectively. Most importantly, this work opens the floor for innovation in wearable devices to measure lead II ECG (e.g., by a smart watch worn on right wrist, along with a smart patch on left leg), in order to do accurate, real-time and early detection of inferior wall MI.</description>

      <title>Blind Bistatic Radar Parameter Estimation for AFDM Systems in Doubly-Dispersive Channels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.05328v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a novel method for blind bistatic radar parameter estimation (RPE), which enables integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) by allowing passive (receive) base stations (BSs) to extract radar parameters (ranges and velocities of targets), without requiring knowledge of the information sent by an active (transmit) BS to its users. The contributed method is formulated with basis on the covariance of received signals, and under a generalized doubly-dispersive channel model compatible with most of the waveforms typically considered for ISAC, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM). The original non-convex problem, which includes an $\ell_0$-norm regularization term in order to mitigate clutter, is solved not by relaxation to an $\ell_1$-norm, but by introducing an arbitrarily-tight approximation then relaxed via fractional programming (FP). Simulation results show that the performance of the proposed method approaches that of an ideal system with perfect knowledge of the transmit signal covariance with an increasing number of transmit frames.</description>

      <title>Coprime Bivariate Bicycle Codes and their Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.10001v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This work (1) proposes a novel numerical algorithm to accelerate the search process for good Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes and (2) defines a new subclass of BB codes suitable for quantum error correction. The proposed acceleration search algorithm reduces the search space by excluding some equivalent codes from the search space, as well as setting thresholds to drop bad codes at an early stage. A number of new BB codes found by this algorithm are reported. The proposed subclass of BB codes employs coprimes to construct groups via polynomials as the basis for the BB code, rather than using the standard BB codes with unconstrained constructors. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown.</description>
