      <title>A Caveat on Metrizing Convergence in Distribution on Hilbert Spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13427</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13427v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider Sobolev-type distances on probability measures over separable Hilbert spaces involving the Schatten-$p$ norms, which include as special cases a distance first introduced by Bourguin and Campese (2020) when $p=2$, and a distance introduced by Gin\'e and Leon (1980) when $p=\infty$. Our analysis shows that, unless $p=\infty$, these distances fail to metrize convergence in distribution in infinite dimensions. This clarifies several inconsistencies and misconceptions in the recent literature that arose from confusion between different types of distances.</description>

      <title>Reinforced dynamics for interacting agents in competitive or cooperative environments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13493</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13493v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study systems of interacting reinforced stochastic processes, where agents' decisions evolve under reinforcement, network-mediated interactions, and environmental influences. In competitive environments with irreducible networks, we prove almost sure convergence of agents' states, with bipartite graphs leading to non-deterministic limits and non-bipartite graphs to deterministic ones. These results are extended to reducible networks with cooperative or competitive substructures, using a hierarchical graph representation in which higher-level agents perceive lower-level agents as forcing inputs. A general framework for interacting agents under external forcing is also provided, offering a rigorous characterization of long-term behavior and synchronization phenomena in such systems.</description>

      <title>Well-Posedness and Ergodicity of Functional Stochastic Partial Differential Equations with Markovian Switching</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13665</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This work focuses on a class of semi-linear functional stochastic partial differential equations with Markovian switching, in which the switching component may have finite or countably infinite states. The well-posedness of the underlying process is obtained by Skorokhod's representation of the switching component. Then, the exponential mixing of such processes in a finite state space is derived by using the so-called remote start method proposed firstly by Prato and Zabczyk in [10]. Finally, the corresponding result in a countable infinite state space is further obtained via the finite partition method.</description>

      <title>Parameterized Controls and Isomorphic Representations of G-Expectations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13675</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13675v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper establishes a fundamental isomorphism between the abstract framework of $G$-expectation and a concrete parameterized family of classical stochastic processes, providing a unified framework for nonlinear stochastic calculus under model uncertainty. We demonstrate that $G$-Brownian motion and related stochastic differential equations (SDEs) can be intrinsically represented as controlled processes $\{B_t^\theta\}_{\theta \in \mathcal{A}^\Theta}$, where $\theta$ denotes an admissible control process taking values in a compact convex parameter set $\Theta$ encoding volatility uncertainty. The core contribution is the construction of a complete algebraic and analytic isomorphism $\Phi$ that preserves all operations including addition, multiplication, function composition, and limit transitions. This isomorphism provides a rigorous mathematical foundation for understanding $G$-martingales, with a distinction between symmetric martingales (fair in all volatility scenarios) and asymmetric martingales (favorable but fair only in the worst-case scenario). We develop a comprehensive theory for solving $G$-SDEs through their parameterized representations, establishing existence and uniqueness results under standard Lipschitz and growth conditions. The framework reveals how bounded control sets preserve these classical conditions while capturing volatility uncertainty. The parameterized control perspective offers both mathematical rigor and computational practicality, enabling the transfer of classical stochastic calculus results to the $G$-expectation framework while maintaining the essential sublinear structure of model uncertainty.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13748v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper studies the limiting behavior of a closed queueing network with multiple single-server and infinite-server stations. Under a heavy traffic asymptotic regime -- where the number of jobs and single-server service rates grow large while infinite-server rates remain fixed -- we prove a weak convergence result for the queue length and idleness process vector, providing an approximation for the original system.</description>

      <title>Large $N$ limit of the Langevin dynamics for the spin $O(N)$ model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13817</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13817v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we prove that the large $N$ limit of the Langevin dynamics for the spin $O(N)$ model is given by a mean-field stochastic differential equation (SDE) in both finite and infinite volumes. We establish uniform in $N$ bounds for the dynamics, which enable us to demonstrate convergence to the mean-field SDE with polynomial interactions. Furthermore, the mean-field SDE is shown to be globally well-posed for suitable initial distributions. We also prove the existence of stationary measures for the mean-field SDE. For small inverse temperatures, we characterize the large $N$ limit of the spin $O(N)$ model through stationary coupling. Additionally, we establish the uniqueness of the stationary measure for the mean-field SDE.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13918v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let ${\mathbf M}$ be the recurrent symmetric (relativistic) $\alpha$-stable process on ${\mathbb R}^d$. Let ${\mathcal H}^{\mu + F} (:= {\mathcal H} + \mu + F)$ be a Schr\"odinger type operator with local and non-local perturbations $\mu$ and $F$. If $\mu$ and $F$ satisfy suitable conditions associated with Kato class, we prove the existence of ground state for a Schr\"odinger type operator relating to ${\mathcal H}^{\mu + F}$. Furthermore, we prove the ground state becomes a probabilistically harmonic function of the Schr\"odinger operator generated by ${\mathcal H}^{\mu + F}$.</description>

      <title>A Chinese restaurant process for multiset permutations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13979v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multisets are like sets, except that they can contain multiple copies of their elements. If there are $n_i$ copies of $i$, $1\leq i\leq t$, in multiset $M_t$, then there are $\binom{n_1+\cdots+n_t}{n_1,\ldots, n_t}$ possible permutations of $M_t$. Knuth showed how to factor any multiset permutation into cycles. For fixed $n_i$, $i\geq 1$, we show how to adapt the Chinese restaurant process, which generates random permutations on $n$ elements with weighting $\theta^{\# \, {\rm cycles}}$, $\theta&gt;0$, sequentially for $n=1,2,\ldots$, to the multiset case, where we fix the $n_i$ and build permutations on $M_t$ sequentially for $t=1,2,\ldots$. The number of cycles of a multiset permutation chosen uniformly at random, i.e.~$\theta=1$, has distribution given by the sum of independent negative hypergeometric distributed random variables. For all $\theta&gt;0$, and under the assumption that $n_i=O(1)$, we show a central limit theorem as $t\to\infty$ for the number of cycles.</description>

      <title>Local limit theorems for conditioned random walks by the heat kernel approximation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the random walk $(S_n)_{n\geq 1}$ with independent and identically distributed real-valued increments having zero mean and an absolute moment of order $2 + \delta$ for some $\delta &gt; 0$. For any starting point $x \in \mathbb{R}$, let $\tau_x = \inf\{k \geq 1 : x + S_k &lt; 0\}$ denote the first exit time of the random walk $x + S_n$ from the half-line $[0, \infty)$. In the previous work [25], we established a Gaussian heat kernel approximation for both the persistence probability $\mathbb{P}(\tau_x &gt; n)$ and the joint distribution $\mathbb{P}(x + S_n \leq \cdot, \tau_x &gt; n)$, uniformly over $x \in \mathbb{R}$ as $n \to \infty$. In this paper, we leverage these results to establish a novel conditioned local limit theorem for the walk $(x + S_n)_{n \geq 1}$. For $\mathbb{Z}$-valued random walks, we prove that the joint probability $\mathbb{P}(x + S_n = y, \tau_x &gt; n)$ is uniformly approximated by a distribution governed by the Gaussian heat kernel over all $x, y \in \mathbb{Z}$ as $n \to \infty$. Our new asymptotic unifies into a single comprehensive formula the classical local limit theorem by Caravenna [6], as well as various results relying on specific assumptions on $x$ and $y$. As a corollary, we obtain a new uniform-in-$x$ asymptotic formula for the local probability $\mathbb{P}(\tau_x = n)$. We also extend our analysis to non-lattice random walks.</description>

      <title>Conditions for equality and stability in Shannon's and Tao's entropy power inequalities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We show that there is equality in Shannon's Entropy Power Inequality (EPI) if and only if the random variables involved are Gaussian, assuming nothing beyond the existence of differential entropies. This is done by justifying de Bruijn's identity without a second moment assumption. Part of the proof also relies on a re-examination of an example of Bobkov and Chistyakov (2015), which shows that there exists a random variable $X$ with finite differential entropy $h(X),$ such that $h(X+Y) = \infty$ for any independent random variable $Y$ with finite entropy. We prove that either $X$ has this property, or $h(X+Y)$ is finite for any independent $Y$ that does not have this property. Using this, we prove the continuity of $t \mapsto h(X+\sqrt{t}Z)$ at $t=0$, where $Z \sim \mathcal{N}(0,1)$ is independent of $X$, under minimal assumptions. We then establish two stability results: A qualitative stability result for Shannon's EPI in terms of weak convergence under very mild moment conditions, and a quantitative stability result in Tao's discrete analogue of the EPI under log-concavity. The proof for the first stability result is based on a compactness argument, while the proof of the second uses the Cheeger inequality and leverages concentration properties of discrete log-concave distributions.</description>

      <title>Disconnection probability of Brownian motion on an annulus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We derive an exact formula for the probability that a Brownian path on an annulus does not disconnect the two boundary components of the annulus. The leading asymptotic behavior of this probability is governed by the disconnection exponent obtained by Lawler-Schramm-Werner (2001) using the connection to Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE). The derivation of our formula is based on this connection and the coupling with Liouville quantum gravity (LQG). As byproducts of our proof, we obtain a precise relation between Brownian motion on a disk stopped upon hitting the boundary and the SLE$_{8/3}$ loop measure on the disk; we also obtain a detailed description of the LQG surfaces cut by the outer boundary of stopped Brownian motion on a $\sqrt{8/3}$-LQG disk.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14100v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the steady-state maximum overlap time distribution in a single-server queue by introducing a dependence structure between service and interarrival times under the Farlie-Gumber-Morgenstern copula. We provide explicit expressions by indicating the effect of dependence. We also focus on the steady-state distribution of the minimum overlap time of a customer with its two adjacent customers. A more general dependence structure is also investigated. A numerical example illustrates the effect of dependence on the maximum/minimum overlap times.</description>

      <title>Edge homogenization of Dyson Brownian motion and applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14192v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove a homogenization result for the difference of two coupled Dyson Brownian motions started from generalized Wigner matrix initial data. We prove an optimal order, high probability estimate that is valid throughout the spectrum, including up to the spectral edges. Prior homogenization results concerned only the bulk of the spectrum.
  We apply our estimate to address the question of quantifying edge universality. Here, we have two results. We show that the Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance of the distribution of the gap between the largest two eigenvalues of a generalized Wigner matrix (with smooth entry distribution) and its GOE/GUE counterpart is $\mathcal{O}(N^{-1+\varepsilon})$. On the other hand, we show that, for the distribution of the largest eigenvalue, there are Wigner matrices so that the analogous Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance is bounded below by $N^{-1/3-\varepsilon}$.</description>

      <title>Large deviations for probability graphons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14204v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We establish a large deviation principle (LDP) for probability graphons, which are symmetric functions from the unit square into the space of probability measures. This notion extends classical graphons and provides a flexible framework for studying the limit behavior of large dense weighted graphs. In particular, our result generalizes the seminal work of Chatterjee and Varadhan (2011), who derived an LDP for Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs via graphon theory. We move beyond their binary (Bernoulli) setting to encompass arbitrary edge-weight distributions. Specifically, we analyze the distribution on probability graphons induced by random weighted graphs in which edges are sampled independently from a common reference probability measure supported on a compact Polish space. We prove that this distribution satisfies an LDP with a good rate function, expressed as an extension of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between probability graphons and the reference measure. This theorem can also be viewed as a Sanov-type result in the graphon setting. Our work provides a rigorous foundation for analyzing rare events in weighted networks and supports statistical inference in structured random graph models under distributional edge uncertainty.</description>

      <title>Spectra of random graphs with discrete scale invariance</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12407</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.12407v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Random graphs defined by an occurrence probability that is invariant under node aggregation have been identified recently in the context of network renormalization. The invariance property requires that edges are drawn with a specific probability that, in the annealed case, depends on a necessarily infinite-mean node fitness. The diverging mean determines many properties that are uncommon in models with independent edges, but at the same time widespread in real-world networks. Here we focus on the leading eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the adjacency matrix of the model, where the n nodes are assigned a Pareto($\alpha$)-distributed fitness with 0 &lt; $\alpha$ &lt; 1. We find that the leading eigenvalues are all of order square root of n, alternate in sign and are located at the intersection between the real axis and a logarithmic spiral in the complex plane, which we characterize analytically in terms of the Gamma function. We also calculate the associated eigenvectors, finding that they display complexvalued scaling exponents and log-periodicity, which are signatures of discrete scale invariance. In contrast with the typical finite-rank behaviour of random graphs with finite-mean variables, we find that a growing number of the leading eigenvalues emerges from the bulk, whose edge extends up to order square root of n and therefore reaches the same scale as that of the structural eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Purification of quantum trajectories in infinite dimensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13377v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this work we exhibit a class of examples that show that the characterization of purification of quantum trajectories in terms of 'dark' subspaces that was proved for finite dimensional systems fails to hold in infinite dimensional ones. Moreover, we prove that the new phenomenon emerging in our class of models and preventing purification to happen is the only new possibility that emerges in infinite dimensional systems. Our proof strategy points out that the emergence of new phenomena in infinite dimensional systems is due to the fact that the set of orthogonal projections is not sequentially compact. Having in mind this insight, we are able to prove that the finite dimensional extends to a class of infinite dimensional models.</description>

      <title>Nucleation regions in the Large-Scale Structure II: Morphology and dynamical state of supercluster cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This work explores the morphology and dynamical properties of cores within rich superclusters, highlighting their role as transitional structures in the large-scale structure of the Universe. Using projected and radial velocity distributions of member galaxies, we identify cores as dense structures that, despite being gravitationally bound, are not yet dynamically relaxed. However, they exhibit a tendency toward virialisation, evolving in a self-similar manner to massive galaxy clusters but on a larger scale. Morphological analysis reveals that cores are predominantly filamentary, reflecting quasi-linear formation processes consistent with the Zeldovich approximation. Our estimates of the entropy confirm their intermediate dynamical state, with relaxation levels varying across the sample. Mass estimates indicate efficient accretion processes, concentrating matter into gravitationally bound systems. We conclude that cores are important environments where galaxy evolution and hierarchical assembly occur, bridging the gap between supercluster-scale structures and virialised clusters.</description>

      <title>Robust, sub-Gaussian mean estimators in metric spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13606v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Estimating the mean of a random vector from i.i.d. data has received considerable attention, and the optimal accuracy one may achieve with a given confidence is fairly well understood by now. When the data take values in more general metric spaces, an appropriate extension of the notion of the mean is the Fr\'echet mean. While asymptotic properties of the most natural Fr\'echet mean estimator (the empirical Fr\'echet mean) have been thoroughly researched, non-asymptotic performance bounds have only been studied recently.
  The aim of this paper is to study the performance of estimators of the Fr\'echet mean in general metric spaces under possibly heavy-tailed and contaminated data. In such cases, the empirical Fr\'echet mean is a poor estimator. We propose a general estimator based on high-dimensional extensions of trimmed means and prove general performance bounds. Unlike all previously established bounds, ours generalize the optimal bounds known for Euclidean data. The main message of the bounds is that, much like in the Euclidean case, the optimal accuracy is governed by two "variance" terms: a "global variance" term that is independent of the prescribed confidence, and a potentially much smaller, confidence-dependent "local variance" term.
  We apply our results for metric spaces with curvature bounded from below, such as Wasserstein spaces, and for uniformly convex Banach spaces.</description>

      <title>Rare Event Simulation of Quantum Error-Correcting Circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13678v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe a practical approach for accessing the logical failure rates of quantum error-correcting (QEC) circuits under low physical (component) failure rate regimes. Standard Monte Carlo is often the de facto approach for studying the failure rates of quantum circuits. However, in the study of fault-tolerant error-correcting circuits, the ability to extend this approach to low physical failure rates is limited. In particular, the use of Monte Carlo to access circuits that are relatively large or have high correcting power becomes more difficult as we lower the input failure rates of the individual components (gates) in the circuit. For these reasons, many simulations studying the circuit model go no lower than end-to-end logical failure rates in the 10^{-6} regime. In this report, we outline an approach that borrows from earlier work by Bravyi and Vargo to the more complex circuit noise model. Earlier works studied both the capacity and phenomenological noise models, but the work is insufficient for generating similar simulations in the circuit-noise model. To the best of our knowledge, our team is the first to develop a full prescription of the rare event simulation by splitting technique for the circuit-based noise model. We have also generated promising results that are confirmed by standard Monte Carlo simulation under an accessible regime. This work shows that we can access noise in the circuit-model prescription of quantum error-correcting code to failure rates below 10^{-20} regime.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13806v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a stochastic heat equation with $\gamma\sin(\beta u)$ nonlinearity on one-dimensional torus. We show an Eyring--Kramers law for the jump rate between potential wells in the small-noise limit, and that the transition state undergoes a bifurcation at $\gamma\beta = 1$. The argument follows the potential-theoretic approach of Berglund and Gentz [Electron. J. Probab. 2013].</description>

      <title>Bridging Control Variates and Regression Adjustment in A/B Testing: From Design-Based to Model-Based Frameworks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13944</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.13944v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A B testing serves as the gold standard for large scale, data driven decision making in online businesses. To mitigate metric variability and enhance testing sensitivity, control variates and regression adjustment have emerged as prominent variance reduction techniques, leveraging pre experiment data to improve estimator performance. Over the past decade, these methods have spawned numerous derivatives, yet their theoretical connections and comparative properties remain underexplored. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of their statistical properties, establish a formal bridge between the two frameworks in practical implementations, and extend the investigation from design based to model-based frameworks. Through simulation studies and real world experiments at ByteDance, we validate our theoretical insights across both frameworks. Our work aims to provide rigorous guidance for practitioners in online controlled experiments, addressing critical considerations of internal and external validity. The recommended method control variates with group specific coefficient estimates has been fully implemented and deployed on ByteDance's experimental platform.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.13981v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper concerns fundamental identities in the study of age of information (AoI) in gossip networks. We recover known recursive identities for arbitrary kth moments of the age process based on the recent connection between AoI and first passage percolation. Apart from the connection to percolation, our proofs are more concise and can be followed using only elementary facts from probability. Our argument generalizes some techniques known in the statistical physics community, and we remark on connections to the Eden model.</description>

      <title>Propagation of chaos for first-order mean-field systems with non-attractive moderately singular interaction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.14022v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider particle systems that evolve by inertialess binary interaction through general non-attractive kernels of singularity $|x|^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha&lt;d-1$. We prove a quantitative mean-field limit in terms of Wasserstein distances under certain conditions on the initial configuration while maintaining control of the particle configuration in the form of the minimal distance and certain singular sums of the particle distances. As a corollary, we show propagation of chaos for $\alpha&lt;\frac{d-1}{2}$ for $d\ge 3$ and $\alpha&lt;\frac 13=\frac{2d-3}{3}$ for $d=2$. This extends the results of Hauray (https://doi.org/10.1142/S0218202509003814), which yield propagation of chaos for $\alpha &lt; \frac{d-2}{2}$ without an assumption on the sign of the interaction. The main novel ingredient is that due to the non-attraction property it is enough to control the distance to the next-to-nearest neighbour particle.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.14071v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Links between uniform Aztec diamonds and random matrices are numerous in the literature. In particular \cite{johansson2006eigenvalues,Forrester} established that, under correct rescaling, the probability density function of a certain subclass of dominos converges to the GUE-corners (GUE minor) process in the large size limit. We are interested to see whether this result holds when we modify the probability measure on the space of configurations. In the first part, we look at the case of biased Aztec diamonds, where different weights are associated to vertical and horizontal dominos. In the second part, we examine the case of two-periodic weightings. In both situations, we observe the convergence to GUE-corners with a rescaling that depends on the weighting.</description>

Our method establishes criteria to determine when such conditional measures arise from a metric measure foliation. Additionally, we provide a concrete example demonstrating how this framework can be applied to study deformations (or perturbations) of disintegration-induced foliations.</description>

Abstract: We show the existence of a stationary measure for a class of multidimensional stochastic Volterra systems of affine type. These processes are in general not Markovian, a shortcoming which hinders their large-time analysis. We circumvent this issue by lifting the system to a measure-valued stochastic evolution equation introduced by Cuchiero and Teichmann~\cite{CT18}, whence we retrieve the Markov property. Leveraging on the associated generalised Feller property, we extend the Krylov-Bogoliubov theorem to this infinite-dimensional setting and thus establish an approach to the existence of invariant measures. We present concrete examples, including the rough Heston model from Mathematical Finance.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the well-posedness of stochastic S-KdV driven by multiplicative noises in $H_x^1\times H_x^1$. To get the local well-posedness, we first develop the bilinear and trilinear Bourgain norm estimates of the nonlinear terms with $b\in\left(0,1/2\right)$. Then, to overcome regularity problems, we introduce a series of approximation equations with localized nonlinear terms, which are also cutted-off in both the physical and the frequency space. By limitations, these approximation equations will help us get a priori estimate in the Bourgain space and finish the proof of the global well-posedness of the initial system.</description>

      <title>Group-averaged Markov chains: mixing improvement</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.02996v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For Markov kernels $P$ on a general state space $\mathcal{X}$, we introduce a new class of averaged Markov kernels $P_{da}(G,\nu)$ of $P$ induced by a group $G$ that acts on $\mathcal{X}$ and a probability measure $\nu$ on $G \times G$. Notable special cases are the group-orbit average $\overline{P}$, left-average $P_{la}$, right-average $P_{ra}$ and the independent-double-average $(P_{la})_{ra}$. For $\pi$-stationary $P$ in which $\pi$ is invariant with respect to $G$, we show that in general $P_{da}$ enjoys favorable convergence properties than $P$ based on metrics such as spectral gap or asymptotic variance, and within the family of $P_{da}$ the most preferable kernel is in general $(P_{la})_{ra}$. We demonstrate that $P_{la}, P_{ra}, (P_{la})_{ra}$ are comparable in terms of mixing times, which supports the use of $P_{la}, P_{ra}$ in practice as computationally cheaper alternatives over $(P_{la})_{ra}$. These averaged kernels also admit natural geometric interpretations: they emerge as unique projections of $P$ onto specific $G$-invariant structures under the Kullback-Leibler divergence or the Hilbert-Schmidt norm and satisfy Pythagorean identities. On the other hand, in the general case if $\pi$ is not invariant with respect to $G$, we propose and study a technique that we call state-dependent averaging of Markov kernels which generalizes the earlier results to this setting. As examples and applications, this averaging perspective not only allows us to recast state-of-the-art Markov chain samplers such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo or piecewise-deterministic Markov processes as specific cases of $P_{da}$, but also enables improvements to existing samplers such as Metropolis-Hastings, achieving rapid mixing in some toy models or when $\pi$ is the discrete uniform distribution.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.08560v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Substantial progress has recently been made in the understanding of the cutoff phenomenon for Markov processes, using an information-theoretic statistics known as varentropy [Sal23; Sal24; Sal25a; PS25]. In the present paper, we propose an alternative approach which bypasses the use of varentropy and exploits instead a new W-TV transport inequality, combined with a classical parabolic regularization estimate [BGL01; OV01]. While currently restricted to non-negatively curved processes on smooth spaces, our argument no longer requires the chain rule, nor any approximate version thereof. As applications, we recover the main result of [Sal25a] establishing cutoff for the log-concave Langevin dynamics, and extend the conclusion to a widely-used discrete-time sampling algorithm known as the Proximal Sampler.</description>

Abstract: Given an orthogonally invariant probability measure on $GL(d,\mathbb{R})$, Mike Shub asked whether the average product of the $k$ top eigenvalues in the ensemble can be lower bounded by the average distortion along $k$ dimensional Grassmanians. Recently, Armentano, Chinta, Sahi, and Shub provided partial progress, however they attach a constant $c_{d,k} \to 0 as d \to \infty$. In this paper, by invoking the Single Ring Theorem and sequels, we show the conjecture asymptotically for the spectral radius, in particular, $c_{d,k} \to 1$ as $d \to \infty$, and $k = 1$.</description>

Abstract: Fix a smooth Morse function $U\colon \mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}$ with finitely many critical points, and consider the solution of the stochastic differential equation \[ d\boldsymbol{x}_{\epsilon}(t)=-\nabla U(\boldsymbol{x}_{\epsilon}(t))\,dt \,+\,\sqrt{2\epsilon}\, d\boldsymbol{w}_{t}\,, \] where $(\boldsymbol{w}_{t})_{t\ge0}$ represents a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion, and $\epsilon&gt;0$ a small parameter. Denote by $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ the space of probability measures on $\mathbb{R}^d$, and by $\mathcal{I}_{\epsilon} \colon \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\to[0,\,\infty]$ the Donsker--Varadhan level two large deviations rate functional. We express $\mathcal{I}_\epsilon$ as $\mathcal{I}_\epsilon = \epsilon^{-1} \mathcal{J}^{(-1)} + \mathcal{J}^{(0)} + \sum_{1\le p\le \mathfrak{q}} (1/\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon) \, \mathcal{J}^{(p)}$, where $\mathcal{J}^{(p)}\colon \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^d) \to [0,+\infty]$ stand for rate functionals independent of $\epsilon$ and $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$ for sequences such that $\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon \to\infty$, $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon / \theta^{(p+1)}_\epsilon \to 0$ for $1\le p&lt; \mathfrak{q}$. The speeds $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$ correspond to the time-scales at which the diffusion $\boldsymbol{x}_{\epsilon}(\cdot)$ exhibits a metastable behaviour, while the functional $\mathcal{J}^{(p)}$ represent the level two, large deviations rate functionals of the finite-state, continuous-time Markov chains which describe the evolution of the diffusion $\boldsymbol{x}_{\epsilon}(\cdot)$ among the wells in the time-scale $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$.</description>

      <title>Spectral Independence and Local-to-Global Techniques for Optimal Mixing of Markov Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.13826</link>
      <description>arXiv:2307.13826v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This monograph is an exposition on an exciting new technique known as spectral independence, which has been instrumental in analyzing the convergence rate of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms. For a high-dimensional distribution defined on labelings of the vertices of an n-vertex graph, the spectral independence condition, introduced by Anari, Liu, and Oveis Gharan (2020), is a bound on the maximum eigenvalue of the nxn influence matrix whose entries capture the influence between pairs of vertices (closely related to the covariance between the variables). In the first part of the monograph, we present results showing that spectral independence (and related techniques) imply fast mixing of simple Markov chains such as the Gibbs sampler. These proofs utilize local-to-global theorems which we will detail in this work.
  We focus on two applications: the hard-core model on independent sets of a graph (which is a binary graphical model) and random bases of a matroid. We demonstrate several methods for establishing spectral independence, including the correlation decay approach introduced by Weitz (2006) and the analytic approach introduced by Barvinok (2015) using zero-freeness of the associated complex-valued partition function. As a consequence of the techniques presented in this monograph we obtain fast mixing of the Gibbs sampler on general graphs in the so-called tree-uniqueness region, polynomial-time mixing on general graphs at the critical point for the uniqueness threshold, and polynomial-time mixing on random regular graphs beyond the uniqueness threshold. We also utilize the local-to-global framework of spectral independence and the Trickle-Down theorem of Oppenheim (2018) to prove fast mixing of the bases-exchange walk for generating a random basis of an arbitrary matroid, which was established by Anari, Liu, Oveis Gharan and Vinzant (2019).</description>

      <title>Stationary measures and random walks on $\tilde{A}_2$-buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18821v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider a non-elementary group action $G \curvearrowright X$ of a locally compact second countable group $G$ on a possibly exotic non-discrete affine building $X$ of type $\tilde{A}_2$. We prove that if $\mu$ is an admissible symmetric probability measure on $G$, there is a unique $\mu$-stationary measure supported on the chambers of the spherical building at infinity. We use this result to study random walks induced by the $G$-action, and we prove that if $\mu$ has finite second moment, $(Z_n o)$ converges almost surely to a regular point of the boundary and the Lyapunov spectrum of the random walk is simple. Applied to Bruhat-Tits buildings, these results extend some classical theorems due to H.~Furstenberg.</description>

      <title>Random time-shift approximation enables hierarchical Bayesian inference of mechanistic within-host viral dynamics models on large datasets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02884</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.02884v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Mechanistic mathematical models of within-host viral dynamics are tools for understanding how a virus' biology and its interaction with the immune system shape the infectivity of a host. The biology of the process is encoded by the structure and parameters of the model that can be inferred statistically by fitting to viral load data. The main drawback of mechanistic models is that this inference is computationally expensive because the model must be repeatedly solved. This limits the size of the datasets that can be considered or the complexity of the models fitted. In this paper we develop a much cheaper inference method by implementing a novel approximation of the model dynamics that uses a combination of random and deterministic processes. This approximation also properly accounts for process noise early in the infection when cell and virion numbers are small, which is important for the viral dynamics but often overlooked. Our method runs on a consumer laptop and is fast enough to facilitate a full hierarchical Bayesian treatment of the problem with sharing of information to allow for individual level parameter differences. We apply our method to simulated datasets and a reanalysis of COVID-19 monitoring data in an National Basketball Association cohort of 163 individuals.</description>

Abstract: We prove that for a standard Lebesgue space $X$, the strong operator closure of the semigroup generated by conditional expectations on $L^\infty(X)$ contains the group of measure-preserving automorphisms. This is based on a solution to the following puzzle: given $n$ full water tanks, each containing one unit of water, and $n$ empty ones, how much water can be transferred from the full tanks to the empty ones by repeatedly equilibrating the water levels between pairs of tanks?</description>

      <title>Linear Convergence of Gradient Descent for Quadratically Regularized Optimal Transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.08547</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.08547v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In optimal transport, quadratic regularization is an alternative to entropic regularization when sparse couplings or small regularization parameters are desired. Here quadratic regularization means that transport couplings are penalized by the squared $L^2$ norm, or equivalently the $\chi^2$ divergence. While a number of computational approaches have been shown to work in practice, quadratic regularization is analytically less tractable than entropic, and we are not aware of a previous theoretical convergence rate analysis. We focus on the gradient descent algorithm for the dual transport problem in continuous and semi-discrete settings. This problem is convex but not strongly convex; its solutions are the potential functions that approximate the Kantorovich potentials of unregularized optimal transport. The gradient descent steps are straightforward to implement, and stable for small regularization parameter -- in contrast to Sinkhorn's algorithm in the entropic setting. Our main result is that gradient descent converges linearly; that is, the $L^2$ distance between the iterates and the limiting potentials decreases exponentially fast. Our analysis centers on the linearization of the gradient descent operator at the optimum and uses functional-analytic arguments to bound its spectrum. These techniques seem to be novel in this area and are substantially different from the approaches familiar in entropic optimal transport.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.11309v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We develop an inductive approach to obtaining stochastic estimates for the $\varphi^{4}_2$-equation when the coefficient field is correlated with the driving noise. Our method is based on (infinite-dimensional) Gaussian integration by parts with respect to Wick products of Gaussian random variables (more precisely, mollifications of space-time white noise)</description>
