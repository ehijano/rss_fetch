      <title>Coupling Magnons to an Opto-Electronic Parametric Oscillator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid magnonic systems have emerged as versatile modular components for quantum signal transduction and sensing applications owing to their capability of connecting distinct quantum platforms. To date, the majority of the magnonic systems have been explored in a local, near-field scheme, due to the close proximity required for realizing a strong coupling between magnons and other excitations. This constraint greatly limits the applicability of magnons in developing remotely-coupled, distributed quantum network systems. On the contrary, opto-electronic architectures hosting self-sustained oscillations has been a unique platform for longhaul signal transmission and processing. Here, we integrated an opto-electronic oscillator with a magnonic oscillator consisting of a microwave waveguide and a Y3Fe5O12(YIG) sphere, and demonstrated strong and coherent coupling between YIG's magnon modes and the opto-electronic oscillator's characteristic photon modes - revealing the hallmark anti-crossing gap in the measured spectrum. In particular, the photon mode is produced on-demand via a nonlinear, parametric process as stipulated by an external seed pump. Both the internal cavity phase and the external pump phase can be precisely tuned to stabilize either degenerate or nondegenerate auto-oscillations. Our result lays out a new, hybrid platform for investigating long-distance coupling and nonlinearity in coherent magnonic phenomena, which may be find useful in constructing future distributed hybrid magnonic systems.</description>

      <title>Even-denominator fractional quantum Hall states with spontaneously broken rotational symmetry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01482v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between the fractional quantum Hall effect and nematicity is intriguing as it links emerging topological order and spontaneous symmetry breaking. Anisotropic fractional quantum Hall states (FQHSs) have indeed been reported in GaAs quantum wells but only in tilted magnetic fields, where the in-plane field explicitly breaks the rotational symmetry. Here we report the observation of FQHSs with highly anisotropic longitudinal resistances in purely perpendicular magnetic fields at even-denominator Landau level (LL) fillings {\nu} = 5/2 and 7/2 in ultrahigh-quality GaAs two-dimensional hole systems. The coexistence of FQHSs and spontaneous symmetry breaking at half fillings signals the emergence of nematic FQHSs which also likely harbor non-Abelian quasiparticle excitations. By gate tuning the hole density, we observe a phase transition from an anisotropic, developing FQHS to an isotropic composite fermion Fermi sea at {\nu} = 7/2. Our calculations suggest that the mixed orbital components in the partially occupied LL play a key role in the competition and interplay between topological and nematic orders.</description>

      <title>Coupling free-surface geometry and localized ion dose for continuum models of radiation-induced nanopatterning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01503</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01503v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A first-principles understanding of the self-organization of highly regular, nanometer-scale structures atop irradiated semiconductor surfaces has been sought for decades. While numerous models exist which explain certain aspects of this phenomenon, a unified, physical model capable of explaining all details of pattern formation has remained elusive. However, it is increasingly apparent that such a model will require understanding the dual influence of the collision cascade initiated by ion implantation: first, as a source of material transport by sputtering and atomic displacements occurring over short time scales, and, second, as a source of defects permitting viscous flow within the thin, amorphous layer that results from sustained irradiation over longer time scales. To better understand the latter, we develop several asymptotic approximations for coupling the localized ion dose with an evolving free interface. We then show how theoretical predictions of quantities commonly used for comparison with experimental observations -- such as ripple wavelengths, critical irradiation angle for patterning onset, and surface roughening -- exhibit surprising sensitivity to the details of this coupling.</description>

      <title>Electric spin and valley Hall effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01714</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01714v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The electric Hall effect (EHE) is a newly identified Hall effect characterized by a perpendicular electric field inducing a transverse charge current in two-dimensional (2D) systems. Here, we propose a spin and valley version of EHE. We demonstrate that the transverse spin and valley currents can be generated in an all-in-one tunnel junction based on a buckled 2D hexagonal material in response to a perpendicular electric field, referred to as the electric spin Hall effect and electric valley Hall effect, respectively. These effects arise from the perpendicular-electric-field-induced backreflection phase of electrons in the junction spacer, independent of Berry curvature. The valley Hall conductance exhibits an odd response to the perpendicular electric field, whereas the spin Hall conductance shows an even one. The predicted effects can further enable the transverse separation of a pair of pure spin-valley-locked states with full spin-valley polarization while preserving time-reversal symmetry, as manifested by equal spin and valley Hall angles. Our findings present a new mechanism for realizing the spin and valley Hall effects and provide a novel route to the full electric-field manipulation of spin and valley degrees of freedom, with significant potential for future applications in spintronics and valleytronics.</description>

      <title>Orbital Magnetization in Correlated States of Twisted Bilayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01727</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01727v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations of quantum anomalous Hall effects in moir\'e systems have revealed the emergence of interaction-driven ferromagnetism with significant orbital contributions. To capture this physics, we extend the modern theory of orbital magnetization to Hartree-Fock states and show that the standard expression remains valid with Hartree-Fock orbitals and Hamiltonians. We then benchmark our theory against the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model in a weak field, which yields excellent agreement with direct numerical calculations. Applying our theory to twisted MoTe$_2$ bilayers, we find orbital magnetization of order one Bohr magneton per moir\'e cell with a non-monotonic twist-angle dependence. Our work establishes a general theory of orbital magnetization in interacting moir\'e systems and provides quantitative guidance for interpreting recent experiments.</description>

      <title>Tunable Wigner Molecules in a Germanium Quantum Dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01786</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01786v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The interplay between Coulomb interactions and kinetic energy underlies many exotic phases in condensed matter physics. In a two-dimensional electronic system, If Coulomb interaction dominates over kinetic energy, electrons condense into a crystalline phase which is referred as Wigner crystal. This ordered state manifests as Wigner molecule for few electrons at the microscopic scale. Observation of Wigner molecules has been reported in quantum dot and moire superlattice systems. Here we demonstrate hole Wigner molecules can be formed in a gate-defined germanium quantum dot with high tunability. By varying voltages applied to the quantum dot device, we can precisely tune the hole density by either changing the hole occupancy or the quantum dot size. For densities smaller than a certain critical value, Coulomb interaction localizes individual holes into ordered lattice sites, forming a Wigner molecule. By increasing the densities, melting process from a Wigner molecule to Fermi liquid-like particles is observed. An intermediate configuration which indicates the coexistence of ordered structure and disordered structure can be formed within a narrow effective density range. Our results provide a new platform for further exploration of the microscopic feature of strong correlated physics and open an avenue to exploit the application of Wigner molecules for quantum information in a very promising spin qubit platform.</description>

      <title>Intermediate diffusive-ballistic electron conduction around mesoscopic defects in graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01821</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01821v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Non-diffusive effects in charge transport become relevant as device sizes and features become comparable to the electronic mean free path. As a model system, we investigate the electric transport around mesoscopic defects in graphene with scanning tunneling potentiometry. Diffusive and ballistic contributions to the scattering dipole are probed by simultaneously resolving the nanoscale topography of pits in the graphene layer and measuring the local electrochemical potential in the surrounding area. We find evidence of transport in the intermediate regime between the diffusive and ballistic limits, such that the magnitude of the electrochemical potential around the defects is substantially underestimated by diffusive models. Our experiments and modeling are supported by lattice Boltzmann simulations, which highlight the importance of the ratio between defect size and mean free path in the intermediate transport regime. The magnitude of the scattering dipole depends on the shape of the pits in both the ballistic and diffusive transport modes. Remarkably, ballistic contributions to the electron transport are found at feature sizes larger than the mean free path and rapidly increase at lower sizes, having a noticeable impact already at mesoscopic length scales.</description>

      <title>Band Gap Engineering of Nitrogen-Doped Monolayer WSe$_2$ Superlattice and its application to Field Effect Transistor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We systematically investigate the electronic structures of pristine monolayer WSe$_2$ and WSe$_2$ superlattices with periodic nitrogen substitution. Unlike random doping, which often introduces in-gap impurity states, periodic nitrogen doping primarily modulates the band gap, thereby facilitating effective band gap engineering for electronic and optoelectronic applications. The gap narrows monotonically with increasing dopant density (pristine $&gt;$ 8-row $&gt;$ 6-row $&gt;$ 4-row), directly influencing device switching. We also evaluate the FET performance of nanojunctions created by these configurations by examining the contour plot of current density as a function of temperature and gate voltage, which quantifies how bandgap engineering affects switching characteristics. Our calculations clarify the classical-quantum crossover in sub-10 nm 2D FETs: as $T$ rises, $J$ approaches the thermionic current; as $T$ falls, quantum tunneling dominates, and the steep energy dependence of $\tau(E)$ may break the classical limit of subthreshold swing imposed by the Boltzmann tyranny. The optimal gating range ($V_g^\mathrm{ON}$, $V_g^\mathrm{OFF}$) is investigated for each temperature, insensitive to temperature in the high-temperature regime, confirming the good thermal stability of the FET devices. A comparison study demonstrates that the 4-row structure, with large $J_\mathrm{OFF}$ and restricted operation range, is inappropriate for realistic FET applications. The pristine structure has a high $V_g^\mathrm{OFF}$ ($\sim$1.1 V) makes it less practical, since such a large threshold voltage may promote time-dependent dielectric breakdown (TDDB) of the oxide layer, reducing device dependability. The 6-row and 8-row structures exhibit more favorable $V_g^\mathrm{OFF}$ values ($\sim$0.75 V), achieving compromise, making them more promising candidates for future FET integration.</description>

      <title>Electrically tunable ultrafast dynamics and interactions of hybrid excitons in a 2D semiconductor bilayer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01921</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01921v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Extended efforts have been devoted to the study of strongly-interacting excitons and their dynamics, towards macroscopic quantum states of matter such as Bose-Einstein condensates of excitons and polaritons. Momentum-direct layer-hybridized excitons in transition metal dichalcogenides have attracted considerable attention due to their high oscillator strength and dipolar nature. However, the tunability of their interactions and dynamics remains unexplored. Here, we achieve an unprecedented control over the nonlinear properties of dipolar layer-hybridized excitons in an electrically gated van der Waals homobilayer monitored by transient optical spectroscopy. By applying a vertical electric field, we reveal strong Coulomb interactions of dipolar hybrid excitons, leading to opposite density-dependent energy shifts of the two main hybrid species based on their dipolar orientation, together with a strongly enhanced optical saturation of their absorption. Furthermore, by electrically tuning the interlayer tunneling between the hybridized carriers, we significantly extend the formation time of hybrid excitons, while simultaneously increasing their decay times. Our findings have implications for the search on quantum blockade and condensation of excitons and dipolaritons in two-dimensional materials.</description>

      <title>Measuring the measurement problem: controlling decoherence with measurement duration in molecular MCB junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate the influence of the measurement duration on quantum coherence in molecular mechanically controlled break junctions operating in a tetrahydrofuran (THF) partially wet phase. These systems represent a distinct class of enclosed open quantum systems with unusually long decoherence times at ambient conditions, on the order of 1-20 ms. By tuning the integration time of the current measurement in current-voltage (IV) characteristics, relative to the decoherence time, we observe a transition from quantum interference patterns, manifested as structured bands of data points, to classical behavior characterized by a single averaged response. This demonstrates that the duration of a measurement acts as a controllable parameter for probing quantum behavior in molecular junctions, offering new insights into decoherence dynamics in quantum mechanics.</description>

      <title>Pulsed-laser induced gold microparticle fragmentation by thermal strain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02011</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02011v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Laser fragmentation of suspended microparticles is an upcoming alternative to laser ablation in liquid (LAL) that allows to streamline the the delivery process and optimize the irradiation conditions for best efficiency. Yet, the structural basis of this process is not well understood to date. Herein we employed ultrafast x-ray scattering upon picosecond laser excitation of a gold microparticle suspension in order to understand the thermal kinetics as well as structure evolution after fragmentation. The experiments are complemented by simulations according to the two-temperature model to verify the spatiotemporal temperature distribution. It is found that above a fluence threshold of 750 J/m$^2$ the microparticles are fragmented within a nanosecond into several large pieces where the driving force is the strain due to a strongly inhomogenous heat distribution on the one hand and stress confinement due to the ultrafast heating compared to stress propagation on the other hand. The additional limited formation of small clusters is attributed to photothermal decomposition on the front side of the microparticles at the fluence of 2700 J/m$^2$.</description>

      <title>Phonon Spin Selective One-Way Axial Phonon Transport in Chiral Nanohelix</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Selectively exciting and manipulating phonons at nanoscale becomes more and more important but still remains challenging in modern nano-energy control and information sensing. Here, we show that the phonon spin angular momentum provides an extra degree of freedom to achieve versatile manipulation of axial phonons in nanomaterials via coupling to spinful multi-physical fields, such as circularly polarized infrared absorption. In particular, we demonstrate the nanoscale one-way axial phonon excitation and routing in chiral nanomaterials, by converting the photon spin in circularly polarized optical fields into the collective interference phonon spin. As exemplified in the smallest chiral carbon nanotube, we show that the rectification rate can reach nearly 100\%, achieving an ideal one-way phonon router, which is verified by molecular dynamics simulations. Our results shed new light on the flexible phonon manipulation via phonon spin degree of freedom, paving the way for future spin phononics.</description>

      <title>Emergent Hierarchy in Localized States of Organic Quantum Chains</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02231</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02231v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Organic Quantum Chains (OQCs) represent a newly synthesized class of carbon-based nanostructures whose quasi-one-dimensional nature gives rise to unconventional electronic and transport phenomena. Here we investigate the electronic and transport properties of recently synthesized OQCs [Nature Communications, 12, 5895 (2021)]. Structural stability was first assessed through molecular dynamics relaxation combined with density functional theory (DFT). The optimized coordinates are then used in a tight-binding model with exponentially decaying hopping parameterization, which reproduces the DFT results with high accuracy. Our calculations reveal a robust and nearly constant energy gap across several OQC configurations, in agreement with experimental data. We also identify emergent hierarchical states, characterized by distinct localization behaviors within sets of localized bands. Finally, we analyze different transport responses in scenarios involving the one-dimensional OQC coupled to carbon corrals, as observed in the experimental data, highlighting their potential as promising systems for application in carbon nanodevices.</description>

      <title>Quantum gates in coupled quantum dots controlled by coupling modulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02267</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02267v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We studied the dynamics of a pair of single-electron double quantum dots (DQD) under longitudinal and transverse static magnetic fields and time-dependent harmonic modulation of their interaction couplings. We propose to modulate the tunnel coupling between the QDs to produce one-qubit gates and the exchange coupling between DQDs to generate entangling gates, the set of operations required for quantum computing. We developed analytical approximations to set the conditions to control the qubits and applied them to numerical calculations to test the accuracy and robustness of the analytical model. The results shows that the unitary evolution of the two-electron state performs the designed operations even under conditions shifted from the ideal ones.</description>

      <title>Chiral quantum state circulation from photon lattice topology</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01306</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01306v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Chiral quantum state circulation is the unidirectional transfer of a quantum state from one subsystem to the next. It is essential to the working of a quantum computer; for instance, for state preparation and isolation. We propose a cavity-QED architecture consisting of three cavities coupled to a qubit, in which \emph{any} photonic state of cavity 1 with sufficiently many photons circulates to cavity 2 after a fixed time interval, and then to cavity 3 and back to 1. Cavity-state circulation arises from topologically protected chiral boundary states in the associated photon lattice and is thus robust to perturbation. We compute the circulation period in the semi-classical limit, demonstrate that circulation persists for time-scales diverging with the total photon number, and provide a Floquet protocol to engineer the desired Hamiltonian. Superconducting qubits offer an ideal platform to build and test these devices in the near term.</description>

      <title>Machine-learning-enabled methodology for the ab-initio simulations of sub-$\mu$m-wide nanoribbons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01802</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01802v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Simulation of mesoscopic nanostructures is a central challenge in condensed matter physics and device applications. First-principles methods provide accurate electronic structures but are computationally prohibitive for large systems, while empirical band theories are efficient yet limited by parameter fitting that neglects wavefunction information and often yields non-transferable parameters. We propose a methodology that bridges these approaches, achieving first-principles-level reliability with computational efficiency through a machine-learning-enabled tight-binding framework. Our approach starts with Wannier tight-binding (WTB) parameters from small nanostructures, which serve as training data for machine learning (ML). To remove the gauge freedom of Wannier functions that obscures size- and geometry-dependent parameter trends, we construct gauge-independent (GI) bases and transform the WTB model into a gauge-independent WTB (GI-WTB) model. This enables robust parameter fitting and ML prediction of parameter variations, yielding the machine-learning GI-WTB (ML-GI-WTB) model. Applied to MoS2 armchair-edge nanoribbons, the ML-GI-WTB model shows excellent agreement with first-principles results and enables reliable simulations of sub-$\mu$m-wide nanoribbons. This framework provides a scalable tool for predicting electronic properties of realistic nanostructures beyond the reach of conventional first-principles methods.</description>

      <title>Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation from CsPbBr$_3$ quantum dots in in-situ selected Laguerre-Gaussian modes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01837v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Single photons in Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) beams, which carry orbital angular momentum (OAM), could enable more robust and efficient photonic quantum communication and information processing, as well as enhanced sensitivity in quantum metrology and imaging. However, as most implementations are indirect or require additional mode-shaping elements, direct generation of single photons with OAM has received growing interest. Colloidal lead halide perovskite quantum dots (QDs) have recently emerged as a versatile material that can produce indistinguishable single photons quasi-deterministically at high rate. Here, we integrate single CsPbBr$_3$ QDs into an open Fabry-Perot microcavity with a nanofabricated Gaussian-shaped deformation, demonstrating Purcell-enhanced single-photon generation into individual cavity modes with up to 18.1 $\pm$ 0.2 times accelerated decay, down to tens of picoseconds. By in-situ tuning of the cavity resonance, we can selectively couple a single QD to different LG modes carrying OAM and observe the spatial patterns of the generated single-photon beams emitted from the cavity. Our findings open the door to high photon rate sources that directly generate single-photon LG beams for advanced quantum photonic applications.</description>

Abstract: The vibrational structure of chromium germanium telluride (Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$, CGT) is investigated and a strong spin-phonon coupling is revealed. The measured high-resolution Raman scattering (RS) spectra are composed of the 10 Raman-active modes: 5A$_\textrm{g}$ and 5E$_\textrm{g}$, predicted by calculation using the density functional theory and identified using polarization-resolved RS measurements. We also studied the effect of temperature on the RS spectra of CGT from 5~K to 300~K. A strong magneto-phonon coupling in CGT is revealed at temperatures of about 150~K and 60~K, which are associated with the appearance of the local magnetic order in the material and the transition to the complete ferromagnetic phase, respectively. Moreover, a unique shape of the A$_g^5$ mode composed of a set of very narrow Raman peaks is simulated using a model that takes into account vibrations of Ge-Ge pseudo-molecules for various Ge isotopes.</description>

      <title>Amplified magnetic catalysis in non-Hermitian Euclidean and hyperbolic Dirac liquids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02304v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Due to their iconic linearly vanishing density of states near the zero-energy, half-filled two-dimensional Dirac materials in flat Euclidean and negatively-curved hyperbolic spaces exhibit dynamic mass generation only once a critical interaction strength is surpassed. Application of external magnetic fields onto these systems can, however, trigger the formation of such ordered phases yielding isotropic insulation near the band-center at arbitrarily weak coupling, a phenomenon known as magnetic catalysis. Recently, it has been proposed that a specific type of non-Hermiticity, allowing the system to feature an all-real eigenvalue spectrum otherwise squeezed toward the zero-energy, can bring down the requisite critical coupling of a specific family of ordered phases, commuting class masses, to a desired lower finite value in Dirac systems, a phenomenon known as non-Hermitian catalysis (arXiv:2501.18591). Here, we predict that a confluence of external magnetic fields and such a non-Hermiticity can amplify the magnitude of commuting class masses for subcritical strengths of interactions in Dirac liquids, an emergent phenomenon named non-Hermitian amplification of magnetic catalysis. We anchor this prediction from numerical self-consistent mean-field solutions of the commuting class mass charge-density-wave (antiferromagnetic) order displaying a staggered pattern of average electronic density (magnetization) between the nearest neighboring sites of the half-filled Euclidean honeycomb and hyperbolic {10, 3} and {14, 3} lattices, all featuring emergent non-Hermitian Dirac quasiparticles, after decomposing the nearest-neighbor Coulomb (on-site Hubbard) repulsion in the Hartree channel. We discuss the scaling behavior of these two orders with magnetic field and non-Hermiticity over a wide range of subcritical interactions.. Possible experimental setups to test our predictions are discussed.</description>

      <title>Reducing strain fluctuations in quantum dot devices by gate-layer stacking</title>

      <description>arXiv:2312.09235v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Nanofabricated metal gate electrodes are commonly used to confine and control electrons in electrostatically defined quantum dots. However, these same gates impart strain-induced potential fluctuations that can potentially impair device functionality. Here we investigate strain fluctuations in Si/SiGe heterostructures, caused by (i) lattice mismatch, (ii) materials-dependent thermal contraction, and (iii) depositional stress in the metal gates. By simulating gate geometries, ranging from simple to realistically complicated, we identify two opposing effects in overlapping gate structures: (a) gate-driven behavior arising from isolated gates vs (b) oxide-driven behavior arising from the thin oxides separating the gates in an overlapping geometry. These limiting behaviors induce strains of opposite sign, pointing towards the possibility of suppressing strain fluctuations through careful design. Here, we demonstrate nearly total suppression of short-range strain fluctuation through device optimization. These results suggest that strain fluctuations should not pose an insurmountable challenge to qubit uniformity, provided that oxide and overlapping gate thicknesses can be tuned.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04048v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We formulate the problem of near-field radiative heat transfer as an effective quantum scattering theory for excitations of the matter. Built from the same ingredients as the semiclassical fluctuational electrodynamics, the standard tool to handle this problem, our construction makes manifest its relation to the Landauer-B\"uttiker scattering framework, which appears only implicitly in the fluctuational electrodynamics. We show how to construct the scattering matrix for the matter excitations and give a general expression for the energy current in terms of this scattering matrix. We show that the energy current has an important non-dissipative contribution that can dominate the finite-frequency noise while being absent in the average current. Our construction provides a unified description of near-field radiative heat transfer in diverse physical systems.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the secondary low-energy electron emission induced by inelastic electron scattering from graphene and layered materials thereof. By applying a coincidence detection of the primary scattered and the emitted secondary electron we unravel pronounced resonance features otherwise overshadowed by the largely structureless secondary electron energy distribution. Supported by density functional theory calculations we show that these structures are the signature of prominent Feshbach resonances above the vacuum threshold which originate from interlayer states acting as a doorway state for electron emission. Remarkably, some of these doorway states open up only for samples with more than five layers.</description>

      <title>Retrieval of fundamental material parameters of monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides from experimental exciton energies: An analytical approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14187</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.14187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a straightforward and highly accurate method for extracting material parameters such as screening length, bandgap energy, exciton reduced mass, and the dielectric constant of the surrounding medium from experimental magnetoexciton energies available for monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs). Our approach relies on analytical formulations that allow us to calculate the screening length $r_0$ and bandgap energy $E_g$ directly from the experimental $s$-state exciton energies $E_{1s}$, $E_{2s}$, and $E_{3s}$. We also establish a relationship between the surrounding dielectric constant $\kappa$ and the exciton reduced mass $\mu$. This relationship simplifies the Schr{\"o}dinger equation for a magnetoexciton in a TMDC monolayer, transforming it into a one-parameter equation that depends solely on the single material parameter $\mu$. Furthermore, we develop an analytical formula with high accuracy for magnetoexciton energies as a function of the exciton reduced mass: $E(B,\mu)$. Then, the inverse of this formula allows us to calculate the exciton reduced mass from experimental data on magnetoexciton energies. By applying this method, we extract key material parameters, $E_g$, $r_0$, $\mu$, and $\kappa$, from the magnetoexciton energies of monolayer TMDCs, including WSe$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and MoS$_2$, encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) slabs in various current experiments. The material properties we retrieve complement and correct existing experimental and theoretical data. Additionally, we develop an analytical method for calculating diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii with high accuracy compared to numerical calculations. Based on this method, we provide diamagnetic coefficients and exciton radii computed using the extracted material parameters.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.16176v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a way to generate a one-dimensional topological superconductor from a monolayer of a transition metal dichalcogenide coupled to a Bernal-stacked bilayer of graphene under a displacement field. With proper gating, this structure may be tuned to form three parallel pads of superconductors creating two planar Josephson junctions in series, in which normal regions separate the superconductors. Two characteristics of the system which are essential for our discussion are spin orbit coupling induced by the transition metal dichalcogenides and the variation of the Fermi velocities along the Fermi surface. We demonstrate that these two characteristics lead to one-dimensional topological superconductivity occupying large parts in the parameter space defined by the two phase differences across the two junctions and the relative angle between the junctions and the lattice. An angle-shaped device in which this angle varies in space, combined with proper phase tuning, can lead to the formation of domain walls between topological and trivial phases, supporting a zero-energy Majorana mode, within the bulk of carefully designed devices. We derive the spectrum of the Andreev bound states and show that Ising spin-orbit coupling leaves the topological superconductor gapless, and the Rashba spin-orbit coupling opens a gap in its spectrum. Our analysis shows that the transition to a gapped topological state is a result of the band inversion of Andreev states.</description>

      <title>Magnetic Interactions and Cluster Formation: Boosting Surface Thermopower in Topological Insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.11652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a theoretical investigation of the thermoelectric properties of three-dimensional magnetic topological insulators (TIs), with a focus on the role of exchange interactions between magnetic dopants. The presence of these magnetic atoms on the TI surface modulates the local magnetic order, which in turn alters the electronic band structure and surface transport phenomena. Magnetic correlations, such as those arising from ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic exchange, promote cluster formation, magnetic domain structures, and spin fluctuations, all of which critically influence thermoelectric responses. Using extensive Monte Carlo simulations based on Ising and Heisenberg models of these surface exchange interactions, we analyze how magnetic clustering, particularly near the surface critical temperature, affects relaxation dynamics, electrical and thermal resistivity, the Seebeck coefficient, and the thermoelectric figure of merit. Our results demonstrate that exchange-driven magnetic clustering enhances the scattering of Dirac surface states, thereby increasing the thermoelectric power factor. Specifically, optimized interlayer and intralayer exchange interactions can elevate the surface thermopower beyond levels observed in conventional spin-based thermoelectric materials. These findings highlight the significant potential of magnetic TIs for thermoelectric applications and provide a foundation for future experimental and theoretical studies of magnetic correlations in topologically nontrivial systems.</description>

      <title>Disentangling contributions to longitudinal magnetoconductivity for Kramers-Weyl nodes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07913</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07913v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We set out to compute the longitudinal magnetoconductivity for an isolated and isotropic Kramers-Weyl node (KWN), existing in chiral crystals, which forms an exotic cousin of the conventional Weyl nodes resulting from band-inversions. The peculiarities of KWNs are many, the principal one being the presence of two concentric Fermi surfaces at any positive chemical potential ($\mu$) with respect to the nodal point. This is caused by a dominant quadratic-in-momentum dispersion, with the linear-in-momentum Dirac- or Weyl-like terms relegated to a secondary status. In a KWN, the chirally-conjugate node typically serves as a mere doppelg\"anger, being significantly separated in energy. Hence, when $\mu$ is set near such a node, the signatures of a lone node are probed in the transport-measurements. The intrinsic topological quantities in the forms of Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment contribute to the linear response, which we determine by exactly solving the semiclassical Bolzmann equations. Another crucial feature is that the two bands at the same KWN node carry actual spin-quantum numbers, thus providing an additional coupling to an external magnetic field ($\boldsymbol B$), and affecting the conductivity. We take this into account as well, and demonstrate that it causes a linear-in-$B$ dependence, on top of the usual $B^2$-dependence.</description>

Abstract: Topological features of possible three-dimensional (3D) states in \alpha-type layered organic conductors are investigated within a unified framework based on Wannier charge centers (WCCs), aiming to identify their actual topological states. Among the 3D Dirac/Weyl semimetal states of multilayered \alpha-(ET)2I3, the type-I Dirac semimetal state, induced by interlayer spin-orbit coupling (SOC), most effectively explains the observed chiral transport phenomena attributed to the chiral magnetic effect, which originates from the spiral structures of the WCC sheets. In multilayered \alpha-(BETS)2I3, a 3D weak topological insulator (TI) state consistently emerges, irrespective of the presence of interlayer SOC and/or inversion symmetry breaking. The strong TI state suggested by experimental observations appears unlikely to be realized.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2402.16960v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We analyze the implementation of high-fidelity, phonon-mediated gate operations and quantum simulation schemes for spin qubits associated with silicon vacancy centers in diamond. Specifically, we show how the application of continuous dynamical decoupling techniques can substantially boost the coherence of the qubit states while increasing at the same time the variety of effective spin models that can be implemented in this way. Based on realistic models and detailed numerical simulations, we demonstrate that this decoupling technique can suppress gate errors by more than two orders of magnitude and enable gate infidelities below $\sim 10^{-4}$ for experimentally relevant noise parameters. Therefore, when generalized to phononic lattices with arrays of implanted defect centers, this approach offers a realistic path toward moderate- and large-scale quantum devices with spins and phonons, at a level of control that is competitive with other leading quantum-technology platforms.</description>

      <title>Solution of the mean-field Hubbard model of graphene rectangulenes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04085</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.04085v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We present a complete analytical solution of the mean-field Hubbard model of undoped and doped graphene rectangulenes. These are non-chiral ribbons of arbitrary length and width, whose dimensions range from simple short acene molecules all the way up to the bulk limit. We rewrite the Hubbard model in the basis of bulk and edge non-interacting eigen-states, and provide explicit expressions for the Coulomb matrix elements. We present a general mean-field decoupling of the Hamiltonian, and discuss in detail the paramagnetic, ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic mean-field solutions. We calculate the eigen-energies, occupations, spin densities and addition energies of rectangulenes with lengths and widths ranging from a nanometer to several hundreds of them. We rewrite the exact mean-field tight-binding Hamiltonian back in the site-occupation basis, that can be used to model electronic, thermo-electric, transport and optical properties of experimental-size graphene flakes.</description>

      <title>Emergence of coexisting topological spin textures in an all-magnetic van der Waals heterostructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15974</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.15974v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Magnetic solitons such as skyrmions and bimerons show great promise for both fundamental research and spintronic applications. Stabilizing and controlling topological spin textures in atomically thin van der Waals (vdW) materials has gained tremendous attention due to high tunability, enhanced functionality, and miniaturization. Here, we present an efficient spin-spiral approach based on first-principles, a method for mapping magnetic interactions from collective models onto arbitrary lattice symmetries, such as hexagonal and honeycomb lattices. Using atomistic spin models parametrized from first-principles, we predict the emergence of multiple topological spin textures in an all-magnetic vdW heterostructure Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$/Cr$_2$Ge$_2$Te$_6$ (FGT/CGT) -- an experimentally feasible system. Interestingly, the FGT layer favors out-of-plane magnetization, whereas the CGT layer prefers in-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy. N\'eel-type nanoscale skyrmions are formed at zero field in the FGT layer due to interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), while nanoscale bimerons and antibimerons can co-exist in the CGT layer by the interplay between exchange frustration and DMI. Using the collective approach we apply, we reveal significant discretization effects in hexagonal and honeycomb geometries. In particular, we demonstrate that the lifting of geometric exchange frustration on the honeycomb significantly affects soliton barriers and pinning energetics. These fundamental results not only highlight the importance of spin simulations in discrete models for topological magnetism, especially in 2D materials, but may also help to pave the way for solitonic devices based on atomically thin vdW heterostructures.</description>

      <title>Multimode Phonon-Polaritons in Lead-Halide Perovskites in the Ultrastrong Coupling Regime</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04505</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04505v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Phonons play a central role in fundamental solid-state phenomena, including superconductivity, Raman scattering, and symmetry-breaking phases. Harnessing phonons to control these effects and enable quantum technologies is therefore of great interest. However, most existing phonon control strategies rely on external driving fields or anharmonic interactions, limiting their applicability. Here, we realize multimode ultrastrong light--matter coupling and theoretically show the modulation of phonon emission. This regime is realized by coupling two optical phonon modes in lead halide perovskites to a nanoslot array functioning as a single-mode cavity. The small mode volume of the nanoslots enables high coupling strengths in the phonon-polariton system. We show theoretically that the nanoslot resonator mediates an effective interaction between phonon modes, leading to superthermal phonon bunching in thermal equilibrium between distinct modes. Our findings are well described by a multimode Hopfield model. This work establishes a pathway for engineering phononic properties for light-harvesting and light-emitting technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum jumps in amplitude bistability: Tracking a coherent and invertible state localization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11260</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11260v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum jumps occurring between macroscopic metastable states of light in the open driven Jaynes-Cummings model. We find that, in the limit of zero spontaneous emission considered in [H. J. Carmichael, Phys. Rev. X 5, 031028 (2015)], the jumps from a high-photon state to the vacuum state entail two stages. The first part is coherent and modelled by the localization of a state superposition, in the example of a null-measurement record predicted by quantum trajectory theory. The underlying evolution is mediated by an unstable state (which often splits to a complex of states), identified by the conditioned density matrix and the corresponding quasiprobability distribution of the cavity field. The unstable state subsequently decays to the vacuum to complete the jump. Coherence in the localization allows for inverting the null-measurement photon average about its initial value, to account for the full switch which typically lasts a small fraction of the cavity lifetime; an asymptotic law for the jump time is established in high-amplitude bistability. This mechanism is contrasted to the jumps leading from the vacuum to the high-photon state in the bistable signal. Spontaneous emission degrades coherence in the localization, and prolongs the jumps.</description>

      <title>Photonic crystal cavities based on suspended yttrium iron garnet nanobeams</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.05361v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report the fabrication and optical characterization of an air-suspended photonic crystal nanobeam cavity in yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) realized by focused-ion-beam milling. YIG's combination of low optical loss and ferrimagnetism makes it highly attractive for quantum technologies, yet prior work has largely been focused on millimeter-scale spheres and simple microstructures, hindering true on-chip integration. Demonstrating nanometer-scale patterning in a suspended geometry therefore represents an important advance. Finite-element simulations predict that the same structure supports a flapping-type mechanical mode at $\Omega / 2\pi \approx 1.52 \,\text{GHz}$ and a backward-volume spin-wave mode at $\Omega / 2\pi = 11.59 \,\text{GHz}$ under an in-plane bias field. Although we measure only the photonic resonance (intrinsic $Q \sim 2 \times 10^{3}$) in this study, the device lays the groundwork for future exploration of coupled photon-phonon-magnon dynamics once higher optical quality factors are achieved.</description>

      <title>Inequivalence of the low-density insulating state and quantum Hall insulating states in a strongly correlated two-dimensional electron system</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.02738v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We find that the behaviors of the voltage-current characteristics as one enters the low-density insulating state and integer quantum Hall insulating states in the ultra-clean two-dimensional electron system in SiGe/Si/SiGe quantum wells are qualitatively different. The double-threshold voltage-current curves, representative of the electron solid formation at low densities, are not observed in the quantum Hall regime, which does not confirm the existence of a quasi-particle quantum Hall Wigner solid and indicates that quasi-particles near integer filling do not form an independent subsystem.</description>

      <title>Higgs mode in superconducting Titanium nanostructures</title>

      <description>arXiv:2509.15327v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report observations of Higgs modes in superconducting Titanium nanostructures at very low temperature. They appear as anomalies in the microwave complex impedance of the samples revealed by the presence of a dc supercurrent. By varying the sample geometry and contact material, we probe how the Higgs modes are sensitive to the dimensionality of superconductivity, the penetration of the dc and ac current densities in the sample and the dissipation in the contacts.</description>
