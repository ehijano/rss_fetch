      <title>Knowledge-guided machine learning for disentangling Pacific sea surface temperature variability across timescales</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.08490v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Global weather patterns and regimes are heavily influenced by the dominant modes of Pacific sea surface temperature (SST) variability, including the El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), Tropical Pacific Decadal Variability (TPDV), North Pacific Meridional Mode (NPMM), and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO). However, separating these modes of variability remains challenging due to their spatial overlap and possible nonlinear coupling, which violates the assumptions of traditional linear methods. We develop a Knowledge-Guided AutoEncoder (KGAE) that uses spectral constraints to identify physically interpretable modes, without the need for predefined temporal filters or thresholds. The KGAE separates ENSO-like modes on 2- and 3-7-year timescales and a decadal mode with characteristics reminiscent of the PDO and the NPMM, each with distinct spatial patterns. We demonstrate that the decadal mode modulates ENSO diversity (central Pacific versus eastern Pacific), and that a quasibiennial mode leads and follows the interannual mode, suggesting a role in ENSO onset and decay. When applied to climate model output, KGAEs reveal model-specific biases in ENSO diversity and seasonal timing. Finally, residual training isolates a primarily equatorial decadal mode, which may be a component of TPDV-related decadal variability, likely originating from advection linked to upwelling near the Gal\'apagos Islands and the South Equatorial Current. Our results highlight how machine learning can uncover physically meaningful modes of Earth system variability and improve the representation and evaluation of variability across models and timescales.</description>

      <title>A Case Study of the Tornadic Supercell in the Province of Pampanga, Philippines (27 May 2024)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20559</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.20559v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study provides an integrated damage assessment, visual evaluation, environmental context, and remote sensing analysis of the tornado event that struck the suburb of Candating in Arayat, Pampanga on 27 May 2024. Satellite imagery and ground-level damage photographs reveal a $\sim$2 km path, with damage reaching EF2 intensity at one point along the track, based on the Enhanced Fujita (EF) scale. Videos of the tornado and its parent storm reveal a well-defined wall cloud and low-level mesocyclone. Subsequent radar analysis supports these and other features of a tornadic supercell. Synoptic-scale ascent in the mid- and upper-troposphere was subtle, influenced by the approach of Tropical Cyclone Ewiniar. However, a modest meridional flow aloft provided sufficient deep-layer shear to support supercell development. The southwest monsoon acted as a low-level jet, promoting warm, moist advection into western Luzon. The supercell developed around midday and was characterized by large-undiluted instability, attributed to steep low-level lapse rates. Although low-level shear and the associated near-surface horizontal vorticity were weak, the latter is highly streamwise, allowing for efficient ingestion, tilting, and stretching into vertical vorticity, which aided in tornadogenesis. Both satellite and radar data suggest that storm interactions, such as a nudging mechanism and terrain effects from nearby Mt. Arayat may have contributed to the initiation and intensification of the supercell through lee-side convergence and vorticity enhancement. The complex tropical environment of the Candating, Arayat tornado exhibits several similarities to well-documented tornadic events in North America. These findings highlight the need for further research into the atmospheric conditions conducive to tornadic activity in the Philippines.</description>

      <title>Democracy of AI Numerical Weather Models: An Example of Global Forecasting with FourCastNetv2 Made by a University Research Lab Using GPU</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17028</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.17028v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of democratizing AI-driven global weather forecasting models among university research groups by leveraging Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and freely available AI models, such as NVIDIA's FourCastNetv2. FourCastNetv2 is an NVIDIA's advanced neural network for weather prediction and is trained on a 73-channel subset of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) Reanalysis v5 (ERA5) dataset at single levels and different pressure levels. Although the training specifications for FourCastNetv2 are not released to the public, the training documentation of the model's first generation, FourCastNet, is available to all users. The training had 64 A100 GPUs and took 16 hours to complete. Although NVIDIA's models offer significant reductions in both time and cost compared to traditional Numerical Weather Prediction (NWP), reproducing published forecasting results presents ongoing challenges for resource-constrained university research groups with limited GPU availability. We demonstrate both (i) leveraging FourCastNetv2 to create predictions through the designated application programming interface (API) and (ii) utilizing NVIDIA hardware to train the original FourCastNet model. Further, this paper demonstrates the capabilities and limitations of NVIDIA A100's for resource-limited research groups in universities. We also explore data management, training efficiency, and model validation, highlighting the advantages and challenges of using limited high-performance computing resources. Consequently, this paper and its corresponding GitHub materials may serve as an initial guide for other university research groups and courses related to machine learning, climate science, and data science to develop research and education programs on AI weather forecasting, and hence help democratize the AI NWP in the digital economy.</description>

      <title>Mj\"olnir: A Deep Learning Parametrization Framework for Global Lightning Flash Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19822</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19822v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Recent advances in AI-based weather forecasting models, such as FourCastNet, Pangu-Weather, and GraphCast, have demonstrated the remarkable ability of deep learning to emulate complex atmospheric dynamics. Building on this momentum, we propose Mj\"olnir, a novel deep learning-based framework for global lightning flash density parameterization. Trained on ERA5 atmospheric predictors and World Wide Lightning Location Network (WWLLN) observations at a daily temporal resolution and 1 degree spatial resolution, Mj\"olnir captures the nonlinear mapping between large-scale environmental conditions and lightning activity. The model architecture is based on the InceptionNeXt backbone with SENet, and a multi-task learning strategy to simultaneously predict lightning occurrence and magnitude. Extensive evaluations yield that Mollnir accurately reproduces the global distribution, seasonal variability, and regional characteristics of lightning activity, achieving a global Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.96 for annual mean fields. These results suggest that Mj\"olnir serves not only as an effective data-driven global lightning parameterization but also as a promising AI-based scheme for next-generation Earth system models (AI-ESMs).</description>
