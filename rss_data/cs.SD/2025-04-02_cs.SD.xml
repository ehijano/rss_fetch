      <title>Are you really listening? Boosting Perceptual Awareness in Music-QA Benchmarks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large Audio Language Models (LALMs), where pretrained text LLMs are finetuned with audio input, have made remarkable progress in music understanding. However, current evaluation methodologies exhibit critical limitations: on the leading Music Question Answering benchmark, MuchoMusic, text-only LLMs without audio perception capabilities achieve surprisingly high accuracy of up to 56.4%, on par or above most LALMs. Furthermore, when presented with random Gaussian noise instead of actual audio, LALMs still perform significantly above chance. These findings suggest existing benchmarks predominantly assess reasoning abilities rather than audio perception. To overcome this challenge, we present RUListening: Robust Understanding through Listening, a framework that enhances perceptual evaluation in Music-QA benchmarks. We introduce the Perceptual Index (PI), a quantitative metric that measures a question's reliance on audio perception by analyzing log probability distributions from text-only language models. Using this metric, we generate synthetic, challenging distractors to create QA pairs that necessitate genuine audio perception. When applied to MuchoMusic, our filtered dataset successfully forces models to rely on perceptual information-text-only LLMs perform at chance levels, while LALMs similarly deteriorate when audio inputs are replaced with noise. These results validate our framework's effectiveness in creating benchmarks that more accurately evaluate audio perception capabilities.</description>

      <title>User authentication on earable devices via bone-conducted occlusion sounds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00435</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00435v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the rapid development of mobile devices and the fast increase of sensitive data, secure and convenient mobile authentication technologies are desired. Except for traditional passwords, many mobile devices have biometric-based authentication methods (e.g., fingerprint, voiceprint, and face recognition), but they are vulnerable to spoofing attacks. To solve this problem, we study new biometric features which are based on the dental occlusion and find that the bone-conducted sound of dental occlusion collected in binaural canals contains unique features of individual bones and teeth. Motivated by this, we propose a novel authentication system, TeethPass+, which uses earbuds to collect occlusal sounds in binaural canals to achieve authentication. First, we design an event detection method based on spectrum variance to detect bone-conducted sounds. Then, we analyze the time-frequency domain of the sounds to filter out motion noises and extract unique features of users from four aspects: teeth structure, bone structure, occlusal location, and occlusal sound. Finally, we train a Triplet network to construct the user template, which is used to complete authentication. Through extensive experiments including 53 volunteers, the performance of TeethPass+ in different environments is verified. TeethPass+ achieves an accuracy of 98.6% and resists 99.7% of spoofing attacks.</description>

      <title>$C^2$AV-TSE: Context and Confidence-aware Audio Visual Target Speaker Extraction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00750</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00750v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Audio-Visual Target Speaker Extraction (AV-TSE) aims to mimic the human ability to enhance auditory perception using visual cues. Although numerous models have been proposed recently, most of them estimate target signals by primarily relying on local dependencies within acoustic features, underutilizing the human-like capacity to infer unclear parts of speech through contextual information. This limitation results in not only suboptimal performance but also inconsistent extraction quality across the utterance, with some segments exhibiting poor quality or inadequate suppression of interfering speakers. To close this gap, we propose a model-agnostic strategy called the Mask-And-Recover (MAR). It integrates both inter- and intra-modality contextual correlations to enable global inference within extraction modules. Additionally, to better target challenging parts within each sample, we introduce a Fine-grained Confidence Score (FCS) model to assess extraction quality and guide extraction modules to emphasize improvement on low-quality segments. To validate the effectiveness of our proposed model-agnostic training paradigm, six popular AV-TSE backbones were adopted for evaluation on the VoxCeleb2 dataset, demonstrating consistent performance improvements across various metrics.</description>

      <title>A Survey on Music Generation from Single-Modal, Cross-Modal, and Multi-Modal Perspectives: Data, Methods, and Challenges</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00837v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-modal music generation, using multiple modalities like images, video, and text alongside musical scores and audio as guidance, is an emerging research area with broad applications. This paper reviews this field, categorizing music generation systems from the perspective of modalities. It covers modality representation, multi-modal data alignment, and their utilization to guide music generation. We also discuss current datasets and evaluation methods. Key challenges in this area include effective multi-modal integration, large-scale comprehensive datasets, and systematic evaluation methods. Finally, we provide an outlook on future research directions focusing on multi-modal fusion, alignment, data, and evaluation.</description>

      <title>Whispering Under the Eaves: Protecting User Privacy Against Commercial and LLM-powered Automatic Speech Recognition Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00858</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00858v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The widespread application of automatic speech recognition (ASR) supports large-scale voice surveillance, raising concerns about privacy among users. In this paper, we concentrate on using adversarial examples to mitigate unauthorized disclosure of speech privacy thwarted by potential eavesdroppers in speech communications. While audio adversarial examples have demonstrated the capability to mislead ASR models or evade ASR surveillance, they are typically constructed through time-intensive offline optimization, restricting their practicality in real-time voice communication. Recent work overcame this limitation by generating universal adversarial perturbations (UAPs) and enhancing their transferability for black-box scenarios. However, they introduced excessive noise that significantly degrades audio quality and affects human perception, thereby limiting their effectiveness in practical scenarios. To address this limitation and protect live users' speech against ASR systems, we propose a novel framework, AudioShield. Central to this framework is the concept of Transferable Universal Adversarial Perturbations in the Latent Space (LS-TUAP). By transferring the perturbations to the latent space, the audio quality is preserved to a large extent. Additionally, we propose target feature adaptation to enhance the transferability of UAPs by embedding target text features into the perturbations. Comprehensive evaluation on four commercial ASR APIs (Google, Amazon, iFlytek, and Alibaba), three voice assistants, two LLM-powered ASR and one NN-based ASR demonstrates the protection superiority of AudioShield over existing competitors, and both objective and subjective evaluations indicate that AudioShield significantly improves the audio quality. Moreover, AudioShield also shows high effectiveness in real-time end-to-end scenarios, and demonstrates strong resilience against adaptive countermeasures.</description>

      <title>STONE: Self-supervised Tonality Estimator</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07408</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07408v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Although deep neural networks can estimate the key of a musical piece, their supervision incurs a massive annotation effort. Against this shortcoming, we present STONE, the first self-supervised tonality estimator. The architecture behind STONE, named ChromaNet, is a convnet with octave equivalence which outputs a key signature profile (KSP) of 12 structured logits. First, we train ChromaNet to regress artificial pitch transpositions between any two unlabeled musical excerpts from the same audio track, as measured as cross-power spectral density (CPSD) within the circle of fifths (CoF). We observe that this self-supervised pretext task leads KSP to correlate with tonal key signature. Based on this observation, we extend STONE to output a structured KSP of 24 logits, and introduce supervision so as to disambiguate major versus minor keys sharing the same key signature. Applying different amounts of supervision yields semi-supervised and fully supervised tonality estimators: i.e., Semi-TONEs and Sup-TONEs. We evaluate these estimators on FMAK, a new dataset of 5489 real-world musical recordings with expert annotation of 24 major and minor keys. We find that Semi-TONE matches the classification accuracy of Sup-TONE with reduced supervision and outperforms it with equal supervision.</description>

      <title>S-KEY: Self-supervised Learning of Major and Minor Keys from Audio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12907</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.12907v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: STONE, the current method in self-supervised learning for tonality estimation in music signals, cannot distinguish relative keys, such as C major versus A minor. In this article, we extend the neural network architecture and learning objective of STONE to perform self-supervised learning of major and minor keys (S-KEY). Our main contribution is an auxiliary pretext task to STONE, formulated using transposition-invariant chroma features as a source of pseudo-labels. S-KEY matches the supervised state of the art in tonality estimation on FMAKv2 and GTZAN datasets while requiring no human annotation and having the same parameter budget as STONE. We build upon this result and expand the training set of S-KEY to a million songs, thus showing the potential of large-scale self-supervised learning in music information retrieval.</description>

      <title>Heterogeneous bimodal attention fusion for speech emotion recognition</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06405</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.06405v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations is a challenging problem due to the complex and complementary interactions between different modalities. Audio and textual cues are particularly important for understanding emotions from a human perspective. Most existing studies focus on exploring interactions between audio and text modalities at the same representation level. However, a critical issue is often overlooked: the heterogeneous modality gap between low-level audio representations and high-level text representations. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called Heterogeneous Bimodal Attention Fusion (HBAF) for multi-level multi-modal interaction in conversational emotion recognition. The proposed method comprises three key modules: the uni-modal representation module, the multi-modal fusion module, and the inter-modal contrastive learning module. The uni-modal representation module incorporates contextual content into low-level audio representations to bridge the heterogeneous multi-modal gap, enabling more effective fusion. The multi-modal fusion module uses dynamic bimodal attention and a dynamic gating mechanism to filter incorrect cross-modal relationships and fully exploit both intra-modal and inter-modal interactions. Finally, the inter-modal contrastive learning module captures complex absolute and relative interactions between audio and text modalities. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed HBAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.</description>

      <title>Enabling Auditory Large Language Models for Automatic Speech Quality Evaluation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16644</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16644v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Speech quality assessment typically requires evaluating audio from multiple aspects, such as mean opinion score (MOS) and speaker similarity (SIM) \etc., which can be challenging to cover using one small model designed for a single task. In this paper, we propose leveraging recently introduced auditory large language models (LLMs) for automatic speech quality assessment. By employing task-specific prompts, auditory LLMs are finetuned to predict MOS, SIM and A/B testing results, which are commonly used for evaluating text-to-speech systems. Additionally, the finetuned auditory LLM is able to generate natural language descriptions assessing aspects like noisiness, distortion, discontinuity, and overall quality, providing more interpretable outputs. Extensive experiments have been performed on the NISQA, BVCC, SOMOS and VoxSim speech quality datasets, using open-source auditory LLMs such as SALMONN, Qwen-Audio, and Qwen2-Audio. For the natural language descriptions task, a commercial model Google Gemini 1.5 Pro is also evaluated. The results demonstrate that auditory LLMs achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art task-specific small models in predicting MOS and SIM, while also delivering promising results in A/B testing and natural language descriptions. Our data processing scripts and finetuned model checkpoints can be found at https://github.com/bytedance/SALMONN.</description>

      <title>QualiSpeech: A Speech Quality Assessment Dataset with Natural Language Reasoning and Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20290</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.20290v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper explores a novel perspective to speech quality assessment by leveraging natural language descriptions, offering richer, more nuanced insights than traditional numerical scoring methods. Natural language feedback provides instructive recommendations and detailed evaluations, yet existing datasets lack the comprehensive annotations needed for this approach. To bridge this gap, we introduce QualiSpeech, a comprehensive low-level speech quality assessment dataset encompassing 11 key aspects and detailed natural language comments that include reasoning and contextual insights. Additionally, we propose the QualiSpeech Benchmark to evaluate the low-level speech understanding capabilities of auditory large language models (LLMs). Experimental results demonstrate that finetuned auditory LLMs can reliably generate detailed descriptions of noise and distortion, effectively identifying their types and temporal characteristics. The results further highlight the potential for incorporating reasoning to enhance the accuracy and reliability of quality assessments. The dataset will be released at https://huggingface.co/datasets/tsinghua-ee/QualiSpeech.</description>
