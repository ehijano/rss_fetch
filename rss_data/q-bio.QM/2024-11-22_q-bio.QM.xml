      <title>Long-term predictive models for mosquito borne diseases: a narrative review</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13680v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In face of climate change and increasing urbanization, the predictive mosquito-borne diseases (MBD) transmission models require constant updates. Thus, is urgent to comprehend the driving forces of this non stationary behavior, observed through spatial and incidence expansion. We observed that temperature is a critical driver in predictive models for MBD transmission, also being consistently used in multiple reviewed papers with considerable incidence predictive capacity. Rainfall, however, have more subtle importance as moderate precipitation creates breeding sites for mosquitoes, but excessive rainfall can reduce larvae populations. We highlight the frequent use of mechanistic models, particularly those that integrate temperature-dependent biological parameters of disease transmission in incidence proxies as the Vectorial Capacity (VC) and temperature-based basic reproduction number $R_0(t)$, for example. These models show the importance of climate variables, but the socio-demographic factors are often not considered. This gap is a significant opportunity for future research to incorporate socio-demographic data into long-term predictive models for more comprehensive and reliable forecasts. With this survey, we outline the most promising paths to be followed by long-term MBD transmission research and highlighting the potential facing challenges. Thus, we offer a valuable foundation for enhancing disease forecasting models and supporting more effective public health interventions, specially in the long term.</description>

      <title>DrugGen: Advancing Drug Discovery with Large Language Models and Reinforcement Learning Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14157</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14157v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Traditional drug design faces significant challenges due to inherent chemical and biological complexities, often resulting in high failure rates in clinical trials. Deep learning advancements, particularly generative models, offer potential solutions to these challenges. One promising algorithm is DrugGPT, a transformer-based model, that generates small molecules for input protein sequences. Although promising, it generates both chemically valid and invalid structures and does not incorporate the features of approved drugs, resulting in time-consuming and inefficient drug discovery. To address these issues, we introduce DrugGen, an enhanced model based on the DrugGPT structure. DrugGen is fine-tuned on approved drug-target interactions and optimized with proximal policy optimization. By giving reward feedback from protein-ligand binding affinity prediction using pre-trained transformers (PLAPT) and a customized invalid structure assessor, DrugGen significantly improves performance. Evaluation across multiple targets demonstrated that DrugGen achieves 100% valid structure generation compared to 95.5% with DrugGPT and produced molecules with higher predicted binding affinities (7.22 [6.30-8.07]) compared to DrugGPT (5.81 [4.97-6.63]) while maintaining diversity and novelty. Docking simulations further validate its ability to generate molecules targeting binding sites effectively. For example, in the case of fatty acid-binding protein 5 (FABP5), DrugGen generated molecules with superior docking scores (FABP5/11, -9.537 and FABP5/5, -8.399) compared to the reference molecule (Palmitic acid, -6.177). Beyond lead compound generation, DrugGen also shows potential for drug repositioning and creating novel pharmacophores for existing targets. By producing high-quality small molecules, DrugGen provides a high-performance medium for advancing pharmaceutical research and drug discovery.</description>

      <title>Approximate Constrained Lumping of Chemical Reaction Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14242</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14242v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Gaining insights from realistic dynamical models of biochemical systems can be challenging given their large number of state variables. Model reduction techniques can mitigate this by decreasing complexity by mapping the model onto a lower-dimensional state space. Exact constrained lumping identifies reductions as linear combinations of the original state variables in systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, preserving specific user-defined output variables without error. However, exact reductions can be too stringent in practice, as model parameters are often uncertain or imprecise -- a particularly relevant problem for biochemical systems. We propose approximate constrained lumping. It allows for a relaxation of exactness within a given tolerance parameter $\varepsilon$, while still working in polynomial time. We prove that the accuracy, i.e., the difference between the output variables in the original and reduced model, is in the order of $\varepsilon$. Furthermore, we provide a heuristic algorithm to find the smallest $\varepsilon$ for a given maximum allowable size of the lumped system. Our method is applied to several models from the literature, resulting in coarser aggregations than exact lumping while still capturing the dynamics of the original system accurately.</description>

      <title>Accelerating DNA Read Mapping with Digital Processing-in-Memory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03832</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03832v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Genome analysis has revolutionized fields such as personalized medicine and forensics. Modern sequencing machines generate vast amounts of fragmented strings of genome data called reads. The alignment of these reads into a complete DNA sequence of an organism (the read mapping process) requires extensive data transfer between processing units and memory, leading to execution bottlenecks. Prior studies have primarily focused on accelerating specific stages of the read-mapping task. Conversely, this paper introduces a holistic framework called DART-PIM that accelerates the entire read-mapping process. DART-PIM facilitates digital processing-in-memory (PIM) for an end-to-end acceleration of the entire read-mapping process, from indexing using a unique data organization schema to filtering and read alignment with an optimized Wagner Fischer algorithm. A comprehensive performance evaluation with real genomic data shows that DART-PIM achieves a 5.7x and 257x improvement in throughput and a 92x and 27x energy efficiency enhancement compared to state-of-the-art GPU and PIM implementations, respectively.</description>
