      <title>A Formalism for the Transport and Matching of Coupled Beams in Accelerators</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08987</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.08987v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding transverse coupling dynamics is crucial for beam physics, accelerator design, and operations. Currently, most accelerators are designed for uncoupled beams, and coupling is treated as an error or perturbation. Many transverse ($x$-$y$) coupling parametrizations exist: Edward-Teng, Mais-Ripken, Levedev-Bogacz, and others. Here, we present an explicit and complete formalism for transporting coupled beam optics functions based on Mais-Ripken and Lebedev-Bogacz formalism. The formalism allows for matching generally coupled beam optics functions but applies to uncoupled optics as well. A complete transformation method for coupled optics provides easy matching routines that can be added to known beam optics codes that lack this feature. For fully coupled lattices, we present methods for extracting eigenmode emittances and other beam parameters from observables that can be measured, which is essential to diagnose and characterize the beam in a real machine.</description>

      <title>Post Long Shutdown 2 CERN Proton Synchrotron Transverse Impedance Model: Description and Beam-Based Validation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09328</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.09328v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the framework of the LHC Injectors Upgrade project, the CERN Proton Synchrotron underwent hardware changes during the Long Shutdown 2. These changes required an update of the CERN Proton Synchrotron impedance model and an assessment of their impact on beam quality. In the following, the updated CERN Proton Synchrotron impedance model is presented and then validated with beam-based measurements, comparing impedance-induced tune shifts and instability growth rates with simulations performed with a macroparticle tracking code, PyHEADTAIL, which includes the effects of beam-coupling impedance, betatron motion, non-linear synchrotron motion, and space charge. The interplay between first and second-order chromaticity, space-charge forces, and their effect on beam observables is thus studied in detail. Their respective impacts have been assessed and benchmarked with measurements to validate the PS transverse impedance model.</description>

      <title>N-dimensional maximum-entropy tomography via particle sampling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17915</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.17915v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a modified maximum-entropy (MENT) algorithm for six-dimensional phase space tomography. The algorithm uses particle sampling and low-dimensional density estimation to approximate large sets of high-dimensional integrals in the original MENT formulation. We implement this approach using Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling techniques and demonstrate convergence of six-dimensional MENT on both synthetic and measured data.</description>

      <title>Measurement of the mean excitation energy of liquid argon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.10550v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean excitation energy (I-value) of liquid argon is a critical input for energy estimation in neutrino oscillation experiments. It is measured to be 199$^{+4}_{-5}$eV using the range of 402.2 MeV protons from the Fermilab Linac. This compares to the author's recent evaluation of (197 $\pm$ 7) eV based on a combination of an oscillator strength distribution analysis, gaseous argon range measurements, sparse stopping power data on solid argon, and an extrapolation of data on the effect of phase from other substances. Using all sources of information, we recommend a value of (198 $\pm$ 4) eV for liquid argon, which is significantly higher than 188 eV, from ICRU-37's gaseous argon evaluation, commonly used in Monte Carlo codes such as Geant4.</description>

      <title>Analytical theory of the skewed wake effect</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10122</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.10122v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recently, the experimental discovery of a new type of wakefield effect, the "skewed wake effect", has been reported. We provide an explanation of the nature of the skewed wake effect based on a simple three-particle model that we have developed. Taking a step forward, we analyze this effect for the case of a highly elliptical beam, provide a simple estimate of the skew angle, and analyze the wake amplitude effects associated with this effect.</description>

      <title>Neutrinos from Stored Muons (nuSTORM)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06137</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.06137v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The Neutrinos from Stored Muons, nuSTORM, facility has been designed to deliver a definitive neutrino-nucleus scattering programme using beams of ,{\nu}e- and ,{\nu}{\mu}- from the decay of muons confined within a storage ring. The facility is unique, it will be capable of storing {\mu} beams with a central momentum of between 1 GeV/c and 6 GeV/c and a momentum spread of 16%. This specification will allow neutrino-scattering measurements to be made over the kinematic range of interest to the DUNE and Hyper-K collaborations. At nuSTORM, the flavour composition of the beam and the neutrino-energy spectrum are both precisely known. The storage-ring instrumentation will allow the neutrino flux to be determined to a precision of 1% or better. With its existing proton-beam infrastructure, CERN is uniquely well-placed to implement nuSTORM. A summary of the proposed implementation of nuSTORM at CERN is presented below.</description>
