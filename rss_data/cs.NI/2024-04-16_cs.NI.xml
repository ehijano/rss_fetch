      <title>Smart Pilot Assignment for IoT in Massive MIMO Systems: A Path Towards Scalable IoT Infrastructure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10188v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: 5G sets the foundation for an era of creativity with its faster speeds, increased data throughput, reduced latency, and enhanced IoT connectivity, all enabled by Massive MIMO (M-MIMO) technology. M-MIMO boosts network efficiency and enhances user experience by employing intelligent user scheduling. This paper presents a user scheduling scheme and pilot assignment strategy designed for IoT devices, emphasizing mitigating pilot contamination, a key obstacle to improving spectral efficiency (SE) and system scalability in M-MIMO networks. We utilize a user clustering-based pilot allocation scheme to boost IoT device scalability in M-MIMO systems. Additionally, our smart pilot allocation minimizes interference and enhances SE by treating pilot assignment as a graph coloring problem, optimizing it through integer linear programming (ILP). Recognizing the computational complexity of ILP, we introduced a binary search-based heuristic predicated on interference threshold to expedite the computation, while maintaining a near-optimal solution. The simulation results show a significant decrease in the required pilot overhead (about 17%), and substantial enhancement in SE (about 8-14%).</description>

      <title>Learning Wireless Data Knowledge Graph for Green Intelligent Communications: Methodology and Experiments</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10365</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10365v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intelligent communications have played a pivotal role in shaping the evolution of 6G networks. Native artificial intelligence (AI) within green communication systems must meet stringent real-time requirements. To achieve this, deploying lightweight and resource-efficient AI models is necessary. However, as wireless networks generate a multitude of data fields and indicators during operation, only a fraction of them imposes significant impact on the network AI models. Therefore, real-time intelligence of communication systems heavily relies on a small but critical set of the data that profoundly influences the performance of network AI models. These challenges underscore the need for innovative architectures and solutions. In this paper, we propose a solution, termed the pervasive multi-level (PML) native AI architecture, which integrates the concept of knowledge graph (KG) into the intelligent operational manipulations of mobile networks, resulting in the establishment of a wireless data KG. Leveraging the wireless data KG, we characterize the massive and complex data collected from wireless communication networks and analyze the relationships among various data fields. The obtained graph of data field relations enables the on-demand generation of minimal and effective datasets, referred to as feature datasets, tailored to specific application requirements. Consequently, this architecture not only enhances AI training, inference, and validation processes but also significantly reduces resource wastage and overhead for communication networks. To implement this architecture, we have developed a specific solution comprising a spatio-temporal heterogeneous graph attention neural network model (STREAM) as well as a feature dataset generation algorithm. Experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed architecture.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10556v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: With the impressive achievements of chatGPT and Sora, generative artificial intelligence (GAI) has received increasing attention. Not limited to the field of content generation, GAI is also widely used to solve the problems in wireless communication scenarios due to its powerful learning and generalization capabilities. Therefore, we discuss key applications of GAI in improving unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication and networking performance in this article. Specifically, we first review the key technologies of GAI and the important roles of UAV networking. Then, we show how GAI can improve the communication, networking, and security performances of UAV systems. Subsequently, we propose a novel framework of GAI for advanced UAV networking, and then present a case study of UAV-enabled spectrum map estimation and transmission rate optimization based on the proposed framework to verify the effectiveness of GAI-enabled UAV systems. Finally, we discuss some important open directions.</description>

      <title>A Calibrated and Automated Simulator for Innovations in 5G</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10643</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10643v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The rise of 5G deployments has created the environment for many emerging technologies to flourish. Self-driving vehicles, Augmented and Virtual Reality, and remote operations are examples of applications that leverage 5G networks' support for extremely low latency, high bandwidth, and increased throughput. However, the complex architecture of 5G hinders innovation due to the lack of accessibility to testbeds or realistic simulators with adequate 5G functionalities. Also, configuring and managing simulators are complex and time consuming. Finally, the lack of adequate representative data hinders the data-driven designs in 5G campaigns. Thus, we calibrated a system-level open-source simulator, Simu5G, following 3GPP guidelines to enable faster innovation in the 5G domain. Furthermore, we developed an API for automatic simulator configuration without knowing the underlying architectural details. Finally, we demonstrate the usage of the calibrated and automated simulator by developing an ML-based anomaly detection in a 5G Radio Access Network (RAN).</description>

      <title>Electric Vehicles Limit Equitable Access to Essential Services During Blackouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) link mobility and electric power availability, posing a risk of making transportation unavailable during blackouts. We develop a computational framework to quantify the impact of EVs on mobility and access to services and find that existing access issues are exacerbated by EVs. Our results demonstrate that larger batteries reduce mobility constraints but their effectiveness is dependent on the geographic distribution of services and households. We explore the trade-offs between mobility and quality-of-life improvements presented by Vehicle-to-Grid technologies and the feasibility and trade-offs of public charging infrastructure as a solution to access inequalities. Equitable access to essential services (e.g. supermarkets, schools, parks, etc.) is the most important aspect of community resilience and our results show vehicle electrification can hinder access to essential services unless properly incorporated into policy and city-scale decision-making.</description>

      <title>Exploring Post Quantum Cryptography with Quantum Key Distribution for Sustainable Mobile Network Architecture Design</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10602</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The proliferation of mobile networks and their increasing importance to modern life, combined with the emerging threat of quantum computing, present new challenges and opportunities for cybersecurity. This paper addresses the complexity of protecting these critical infrastructures against future quantum attacks while considering operational sustainability. We begin with an overview of the current landscape, identify the main vulnerabilities in mobile networks, and evaluate existing security solutions with new post-quantum cryptography (PQC) methods. We then present a quantum-secure architecture with PQC and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) tailored explicitly for sustainable mobile networks and illustrate its applicability with several use cases that emphasize the need for advanced protection measures in this new era. In addition, a comprehensive analysis of PQC algorithm families is presented, focusing on their suitability for integration in mobile environments, with particular attention to the trade-offs between energy consumption and security improvements. Finally, recommendations for strengthening mobile networks against quantum threats are provided through a detailed examination of current challenges and opportunities.</description>

      <title>Remote Estimation of Gauss-Markov Processes over Multiple Channels: A Whittle Index Policy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2305.04809v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study a sampling and transmission scheduling problem for multi-source remote estimation, where a scheduler determines when to take samples from multiple continuous-time Gauss-Markov processes and send the samples over multiple channels to remote estimators. The sample transmission times are i.i.d. across samples and channels. The objective of the scheduler is to minimize the weighted sum of the time-average expected estimation errors of these Gauss-Markov sources. This problem is a continuous-time Restless Multi-armed Bandit (RMAB) problem with a continuous state space. We prove that the bandits are indexable and derive an exact expression of the Whittle index. To the extent of our knowledge, this is the first Whittle index policy for multi-source signal-aware remote estimation of Gauss-Markov processes. Our results unite two theoretical frameworks that were used for remote estimation and AoI minimization: threshold-based sampling and Whittle index-based scheduling. In the single-source, single-channel scenario, we demonstrate that the optimal solution to the sampling and scheduling problem can be equivalently expressed as both a threshold-based sampling strategy and a Whittle index-based scheduling policy. Notably, the Whittle index is equal to zero if and only if two conditions are satisfied: (i) the channel is idle, and (ii) the estimation error is precisely equal to the threshold in the threshold-based sampling strategy. Moreover, the methodology employed to derive threshold-based sampling strategies in the single-source, single-channel scenario plays a crucial role in establishing indexability and evaluating the Whittle index in the more intricate multi-source, multi-channel scenario. Our numerical results show that the proposed policy achieves high-performance gain over the existing policies when some of the Gauss-Markov processes are highly unstable.</description>

      <title>Off-Path TCP Hijacking in Wi-Fi Networks: A Packet-Size Side Channel Attack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.12716</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.12716v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we unveil a fundamental side channel in Wi-Fi networks, specifically the observable frame size, which can be exploited by attackers to conduct TCP hijacking attacks. Despite the various security mechanisms (e.g., WEP and WPA2/WPA3) implemented to safeguard Wi-Fi networks, our study reveals that an off path attacker can still extract sufficient information from the frame size side channel to hijack the victim's TCP connection. Our side channel attack is based on two significant findings: (i) response packets (e.g., ACK and RST) generated by TCP receivers vary in size, and (ii) the encrypted frames containing these response packets have consistent and distinguishable sizes. By observing the size of the victim's encrypted frames, the attacker can detect and hijack the victim's TCP connections. We validate the effectiveness of this side channel attack through two case studies, i.e., SSH DoS and web traffic manipulation. Precisely, our attack can terminate the victim's SSH session in 19 seconds and inject malicious data into the victim's web traffic within 28 seconds. Furthermore, we conduct extensive measurements to evaluate the impact of our attack on real-world Wi-Fi networks. We test 30 popular wireless routers from 9 well-known vendors, and none of these routers can protect victims from our attack. Besides, we implement our attack in 80 real-world Wi-Fi networks and successfully hijack the victim's TCP connections in 75 (93.75%) evaluated Wi-Fi networks. We have responsibly disclosed the vulnerability to the Wi-Fi Alliance and proposed several mitigation strategies to address this issue.</description>

      <title>SAWEC: Sensing-Assisted Wireless Edge Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.10021v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Emerging mobile virtual reality (VR) systems will require to continuously perform complex computer vision tasks on ultra-high-resolution video frames through the execution of deep neural networks (DNNs)-based algorithms. Since state-of-the-art DNNs require computational power that is excessive for mobile devices, techniques based on wireless edge computing (WEC) have been recently proposed. However, existing WEC methods require the transmission and processing of a high amount of video data which may ultimately saturate the wireless link. In this paper, we propose a novel Sensing-Assisted Wireless Edge Computing (SAWEC) paradigm to address this issue. SAWEC leverages knowledge about the physical environment to reduce the end-to-end latency and overall computational burden by transmitting to the edge server only the relevant data for the delivery of the service. Our intuition is that the transmission of the portion of the video frames where there are no changes with respect to previous frames can be avoided. Specifically, we leverage wireless sensing techniques to estimate the location of objects in the environment and obtain insights about the environment dynamics. Hence, only the part of the frames where any environmental change is detected is transmitted and processed. We evaluated SAWEC by using a 10K 360$^{\circ}$ with a Wi-Fi 6 sensing system operating at 160 MHz and performing localization and tracking. We considered instance segmentation and object detection as benchmarking tasks for performance evaluation. We carried out experiments in an anechoic chamber and an entrance hall with two human subjects in six different setups. Experimental results show that SAWEC reduces both the channel occupation and end-to-end latency by more than 90% while improving the instance segmentation and object detection performance with respect to state-of-the-art WEC approaches.</description>
