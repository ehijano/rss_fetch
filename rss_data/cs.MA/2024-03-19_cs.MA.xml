      <title>MARPF: Multi-Agent and Multi-Rack Path Finding</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12376v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In environments where many automated guided vehicles (AGVs) operate, planning efficient, collision-free paths is essential. Related research has mainly focused on environments with static passages, resulting in space inefficiency. We define multi-agent and multi-rack path finding (MARPF) as the problem of planning paths for AGVs to convey target racks to their designated locations in environments without passages. In such environments, an AGV without a rack can pass under racks, whereas an AGV with a rack cannot pass under racks to avoid collisions. MARPF entails conveying the target racks without collisions, while the other obstacle racks are positioned without a specific arrangement. AGVs are essential for relocating other racks to prevent any interference with the target racks. We formulated MARPF as an integer linear programming problem in a network flow. To distinguish situations in which an AGV is or is not loading a rack, the proposed method introduces two virtual layers into the network. We optimized the AGVs' movements to move obstacle racks and convey the target racks. The formulation and applicability of the algorithm were validated through numerical experiments. The results indicated that the proposed algorithm addressed issues in environments with dense racks.</description>

      <title>Online Multi-Agent Pickup and Delivery with Task Deadlines</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12377</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12377v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Managing delivery deadlines in automated warehouses and factories is crucial for maintaining customer satisfaction and ensuring seamless production. This study introduces the problem of online multi-agent pickup and delivery with task deadlines (MAPD-D), which is an advanced variant of the online MAPD problem incorporating delivery deadlines. MAPD-D presents a dynamic deadline-driven approach that includes task deadlines, with tasks being added at any time (online), thus challenging conventional MAPD frameworks. To tackle MAPD-D, we propose a novel algorithm named deadline-aware token passing (D-TP). The D-TP algorithm is designed to calculate pickup deadlines and assign tasks while balancing execution cost and deadline proximity. Additionally, we introduce the D-TP with task swaps (D-TPTS) method to further reduce task tardiness, enhancing flexibility and efficiency via task-swapping strategies. Numerical experiments were conducted in simulated warehouse environments to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods. Both D-TP and D-TPTS demonstrate significant reductions in task tardiness compared to existing methods, thereby contributing to efficient operations in automated warehouses and factories with delivery deadlines.</description>

      <title>Information Compression in Dynamic Information Disclosure Games</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12204</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12204v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider a two-player dynamic information design problem between a principal and a receiver -- a game is played between the two agents on top of a Markovian system controlled by the receiver's actions, where the principal obtains and strategically shares some information about the underlying system with the receiver in order to influence their actions. In our setting, both players have long-term objectives, and the principal sequentially commits to their strategies instead of committing at the beginning. Further, the principal cannot directly observe the system state, but at every turn they can choose randomized experiments to observe the system partially. The principal can share details about the experiments to the receiver. For our analysis we impose the truthful disclosure rule: the principal is required to truthfully announce the details and the result of each experiment to the receiver immediately after the experiment result is revealed. Based on the received information, the receiver takes an action when its their turn, with the action influencing the state of the underlying system. We show that there exist Perfect Bayesian equilibria in this game where both agents play Canonical Belief Based (CBB) strategies using a compressed version of their information, rather than full information, to choose experiments (for the principal) or actions (for the receiver). We also provide a backward inductive procedure to solve for an equilibrium in CBB strategies.</description>

      <title>Embodied LLM Agents Learn to Cooperate in Organized Teams</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as integral tools for reasoning, planning, and decision-making, drawing upon their extensive world knowledge and proficiency in language-related tasks. LLMs thus hold tremendous potential for natural language interaction within multi-agent systems to foster cooperation. However, LLM agents tend to over-report and comply with any instruction, which may result in information redundancy and confusion in multi-agent cooperation. Inspired by human organizations, this paper introduces a framework that imposes prompt-based organization structures on LLM agents to mitigate these problems. Through a series of experiments with embodied LLM agents and human-agent collaboration, our results highlight the impact of designated leadership on team efficiency, shedding light on the leadership qualities displayed by LLM agents and their spontaneous cooperative behaviors. Further, we harness the potential of LLMs to propose enhanced organizational prompts, via a Criticize-Reflect process, resulting in novel organization structures that reduce communication costs and enhance team efficiency.</description>

      <title>Detection of Malicious Agents in Social Learning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social learning is a non-Bayesian framework for distributed hypothesis testing aimed at learning the true state of the environment. Traditionally, the agents are assumed to receive observations conditioned on the same true state, although it is also possible to examine the case of heterogeneous models across the graph. One important special case is when heterogeneity is caused by the presence of malicious agents whose goal is to move the agents towards a wrong hypothesis. In this work, we propose an algorithm that allows to discover the true state of every individual agent based on the sequence of their beliefs. In so doing, the methodology is also able to locate malicious behavior.</description>
