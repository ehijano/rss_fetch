      <title>A Lock-free Binary Trie</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A binary trie is a sequential data structure for a dynamic set on the universe $\{0,\dots,u-1\}$ supporting Search with $O(1)$ worst-case step complexity, and Insert, Delete, and Predecessor operations with $O(\log u)$ worst-case step complexity.
  We give a wait-free implementation of a relaxed binary trie, using read, write, CAS, and ($\log u$)-bit AND operations. It supports all operations with the same worst-case step complexity as the sequential binary trie. However, Predecessor operations may not return a key when there are concurrent update operations. We use this as a component of a lock-free, linearizable implementation of a binary trie. It supports Search with $O(1)$ worst-case step complexity and Insert, Delete and Predecessor with $O(c^2 + \log u)$ amortized step complexity, where $c$ is a measure of the contention.
  A lock-free binary trie is challenging to implement as compared to many other lock-free data structures because Insert and Delete operations perform a non-constant number of modifications to the binary trie in the worst-case to ensure the correctness of Predecessor operations.</description>

      <title>Fast and Slow Mixing of the Kawasaki Dynamics on Bounded-Degree Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06209</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06209v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the worst-case mixing time of the global Kawasaki dynamics for the fixed-magnetization Ising model on the class of graphs of maximum degree $\Delta$. Proving a conjecture of Carlson, Davies, Kolla, and Perkins, we show that below the tree uniqueness threshold, the Kawasaki dynamics mix rapidly for all magnetizations. Disproving a conjecture of Carlson, Davies, Kolla, and Perkins, we show that the regime of fast mixing does not extend throughout the regime of tractability for this model: there is a range of parameters for which there exist efficient sampling algorithms for the fixed-magnetization Ising model on max-degree $\Delta$ graphs, but the Kawasaki dynamics can take exponential time to mix. Our techniques involve showing spectral independence in the fixed-magnetization Ising model and proving a sharp threshold for the existence of multiple metastable states in the Ising model with external field on random regular graphs.</description>

      <title>A $(\frac32+\frac1{\mathrm{e}})$-Approximation Algorithm for Ordered TSP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06244</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06244v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a new $(\frac32+\frac1{\mathrm{e}})$-approximation algorithm for the Ordered Traveling Salesperson Problem (Ordered TSP). Ordered TSP is a variant of the classical metric Traveling Salesperson Problem (TSP) where a specified subset of vertices needs to appear on the output Hamiltonian cycle in a given order, and the task is to compute a cheapest such cycle. Our approximation guarantee of approximately $1.868$ holds with respect to the value of a natural new linear programming (LP) relaxation for Ordered TSP. Our result significantly improves upon the previously best known guarantee of $\frac52$ for this problem and thereby considerably reduces the gap between approximability of Ordered TSP and metric TSP. Our algorithm is based on a decomposition of the LP solution into weighted trees that serve as building blocks in our tour construction.</description>

      <title>Beyond Bell sampling: stabilizer state learning and quantum pseudorandomness lower bounds on qudits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06357v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Bell sampling is a simple yet powerful measurement primitive that has recently attracted a lot of attention, and has proven to be a valuable tool in studying stabiliser states. Unfortunately, however, it is known that Bell sampling fails when used on qu\emph{d}its of dimension $d&gt;2$. In this paper, we explore and quantify the limitations of Bell sampling on qudits, and propose new quantum algorithms to circumvent the use of Bell sampling in solving two important problems: learning stabiliser states and providing pseudorandomness lower bounds on qudits. More specifically, as our first result, we characterise the output distribution corresponding to Bell sampling on copies of a stabiliser state and show that the output can be uniformly random, and hence reveal no information. As our second result, for $d=p$ prime we devise a quantum algorithm to identify an unknown stabiliser state in $(\mathbb{C}^p)^{\otimes n}$ that uses $O(n)$ copies of the input state and runs in time $O(n^4)$. As our third result, we provide a quantum algorithm that efficiently distinguishes a Haar-random state from a state with non-negligible stabiliser fidelity. As a corollary, any Clifford circuit on qudits of dimension $d$ using $O(\log{n}/\log{d})$ auxiliary non-Clifford single-qudit gates cannot prepare computationally pseudorandom quantum states.</description>

      <title>Fast Mixing in Sparse Random Ising Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.06616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Motivated by the community detection problem in Bayesian inference, as well as the recent explosion of interest in spin glasses from statistical physics, we study the classical Glauber dynamics for sampling from Ising models with sparse random interactions. It is now well-known that when the interaction matrix has spectral diameter less than $1$, Glauber dynamics mixes in $O(n\log n)$ steps. Unfortunately, such criteria fail dramatically for interactions supported on arguably the most well-studied sparse random graph: the Erd\H{o}s--R\'{e}nyi random graph $G(n,d/n)$, due to the presence of almost linearly many outlier eigenvalues of unbounded magnitude.
  We prove that for the \emph{Viana--Bray spin glass}, where the interactions are supported on $G(n,d/n)$ and randomly assigned $\pm\beta$, Glauber dynamics mixes in $n^{1+o(1)}$ time with high probability as long as $\beta \le O(1/\sqrt{d})$, independent of $n$. We further extend our results to random graphs drawn according to the $2$-community stochastic block model, as well as when the interactions are given by a "centered" version of the adjacency matrix. The latter setting is particularly relevant for the inference problem in community detection. Indeed, we build on this result to demonstrate that Glauber dynamics succeeds at recovering communities in the stochastic block model in an upcoming paper.
  The primary technical ingredient in our proof is showing that with high probability, a sparse random graph can be decomposed into two parts --- a \emph{bulk} which behaves like a graph with bounded maximum degree and a well-behaved spectrum, and a \emph{near-forest} with favorable pseudorandom properties. We then use this decomposition to design a localization procedure that interpolates to simpler Ising models supported only on the near-forest, and then execute a pathwise analysis to establish a modified log-Sobolev inequality.</description>

      <title>Online Sampling and Decision Making with Low Entropy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.13203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2111.13203v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Consider the problem: we are given $n$ boxes, labeled $\{1,2,\ldots, n\}$ by an adversary, each containing a single number chosen from an unknown distribution; these $n$ distributions are not necessarily identical. We are also given an integer $k \leq n$. We have to choose an order in which we will sequentially open these boxes, and each time we open the next box in this order, we learn the number in the box. Once we reject a number in a box, the box cannot be recalled. Our goal is to accept $k$ of these numbers, without necessarily opening all boxes, such that the accepted numbers are the $k$ largest numbers in the boxes (thus their sum is maximized).
  A natural approach to solve such problems is to use randomness to sample randomly ordered elements, however, as indicated in several sources, e.g., Turan et al. NIST'15, Bierhorst et al. Nature'18, pure randomness is hard to get in reality.
  We present an algorithm for this problem, which is provably and simultaneously near-optimal with respect to the achieved competitive ratio and the used amount of randomness. In particular, we construct a distribution on the orders with entropy $\Theta(\log\log n)$ such that a deterministic multiple-threshold algorithm gives a competitive ratio $1-O(\sqrt{\log k/k})$, for $k &lt; \log n/\log \log n$. Our competitive ratio is simultaneously optimal and uses optimal entropy $\Theta(\log\log n)$, improving in three ways the previous best known algorithm, whose competitive ratio is $1 - O(1/k^{1/3}) - o(1)$.</description>

      <title>Detecting Disjoint Shortest Paths in Linear Time and More</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15916</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.15916v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the $k$-Disjoint Shortest Paths ($k$-DSP) problem, we are given a weighted graph $G$ on $n$ nodes and $m$ edges with specified source vertices $s_1, \dots, s_k$, and target vertices $t_1, \dots, t_k$, and are tasked with determining if $G$ contains vertex-disjoint $(s_i,t_i)$-shortest paths. For any constant $k$, it is known that $k$-DSP can be solved in polynomial time over undirected graphs and directed acyclic graphs (DAGs). However, the exact time complexity of $k$-DSP remains mysterious, with large gaps between the fastest known algorithms and best conditional lower bounds. In this paper, we obtain faster algorithms for important cases of $k$-DSP, and present better conditional lower bounds for $k$-DSP and its variants.
  Previous work solved 2-DSP over weighted undirected graphs in $O(n^7)$ time, and weighted DAGs in $O(mn)$ time. For the main result of this paper, we present linear time algorithms for solving 2-DSP on weighted undirected graphs and DAGs. Our algorithms are algebraic however, and so only solve the detection rather than search version of 2-DSP.
  For lower bounds, prior work implied that $k$-Clique can be reduced to $2k$-DSP in DAGs and undirected graphs with $O((kn)^2)$ nodes. We improve this reduction, by showing how to reduce from $k$-Clique to $k$-DSP in DAGs and undirected graphs with $O((kn)^2)$ nodes. A variant of $k$-DSP is the $k$-Disjoint Paths ($k$-DP) problem, where the solution paths no longer need to be shortest paths. Previous work reduced from $k$-Clique to $p$-DP in DAGs with $O(kn)$ nodes, for $p= k + k(k-1)/2$. We improve this by showing a reduction from $k$-Clique to $p$-DP, for $p=k + \lfloor k^2/4\rfloor$. Under the $k$-Clique Hypothesis from fine-grained complexity, our results establish better conditional lower bounds for $k$-DSP for all $k\ge 4$, and better conditional lower bounds for $p$-DP for all $p\le 4031$.</description>

      <title>Individual Fairness under Varied Notions of Group Fairness in Bipartite Matching - One Framework to Approximate Them All</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09951v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the probabilistic assignment of items to platforms that satisfies both group and individual fairness constraints. Each item belongs to specific groups and has a preference ordering over platforms. Each platform enforces group fairness by limiting the number of items per group that can be assigned to it. There could be multiple optimal solutions that satisfy the group fairness constraints, but this alone ignores item preferences. Our approach explores a `best of both worlds fairness' solution to get a randomized matching, which is ex-ante individually fair and ex-post group-fair. Thus, we seek a `probabilistic individually fair' distribution over `group-fair' matchings where each item has a `high' probability of matching to one of its top choices. This distribution is also ex-ante group-fair. Users can customize fairness constraints to suit their requirements. Our first result is a polynomial-time algorithm that computes a distribution over `group-fair' matchings such that the individual fairness constraints are approximately satisfied and the expected size of a matching is close to OPT. We empirically test this on real-world datasets. We present two additional polynomial-time bi-criteria approximation algorithms that users can choose from to balance group fairness and individual fairness trade-offs.
  For disjoint groups, we provide an exact polynomial-time algorithm adaptable to additional lower `group fairness' bounds. Extending our model, we encompass `maxmin group fairness,' amplifying underrepresented groups, and `mindom group fairness,' reducing the representation of dominant groups.'</description>

      <title>Rethink Decision Tree Traversal</title>

      <description>arXiv:2209.04825v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We will show how to implement binary decision tree traversal in the language of matrix computation. Our main contribution is to propose some equivalent algorithms of binary tree traversal based on a novel matrix representation of the hierarchical structure of the decision tree. Our key idea is to travel the binary decision tree by maximum inner product search. We not only implement decision tree methods without the recursive traverse but also delve into the partitioning nature of tree-based methods.</description>

      <title>Perturbation results for distance-edge-monitoring numbers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2301.02507v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Foucaud et al. recently introduced and initiated the study of a new graph-theoretic concept in the area of network monitoring. Given a graph $G=(V(G), E(G))$, a set $M \subseteq V(G)$ is a distance-edge-monitoring set if for every edge $e \in E(G)$, there is a vertex $x \in M$ and a vertex $y \in V(G)$ such that the edge $e$ belongs to all shortest paths between $x$ and $y$. The smallest size of such a set in $G$ is denoted by $\operatorname{dem}(G)$. Denoted by $G-e$ (resp. $G \backslash u$) the subgraph of $G$ obtained by removing the edge $e$ from $G$ (resp. a vertex $u$ together with all its incident edges from $G$). In this paper, we first show that $\operatorname{dem}(G-e)- \operatorname{dem}(G)\leq 2$ for any graph $G$ and edge $e \in E(G)$. Moreover, the bound is sharp. Next, we construct two graphs $G$ and $H$ to show that $\operatorname{dem}(G)-\operatorname{dem}(G\setminus u)$ and $\operatorname{dem}(H\setminus v)-\operatorname{dem}(H)$ can be arbitrarily large, where $u \in V(G)$ and $v \in V(H)$. We also study the relation between $\operatorname{dem}(H)$ and $\operatorname{dem}(G)$, where $H$ is a subgraph of $G$. In the end, we give an algorithm to judge whether the distance-edge monitoring set still remain in the resulting graph when any edge of the graph $G$ is deleted.</description>

      <title>Conformal Hypergraphs: Duality and Implications for the Upper Clique Transversal Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.00098v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Given a hypergraph $\mathcal{H}$, the dual hypergraph of $\mathcal{H}$ is the hypergraph of all minimal transversals of $\mathcal{H}$. The dual hypergraph is always Sperner, that is, no hyperedge contains another. A special case of Sperner hypergraphs are the conformal Sperner hypergraphs, which correspond to the families of maximal cliques of graphs. All these notions play an important role in many fields of mathematics and computer science, including combinatorics, algebra, database theory, etc. In this paper we study conformality of dual hypergraphs and prove several results related to the problem of recognizing this property. In particular, we show that the problem is in co-NP and can be solved in polynomial time for hypergraphs of bounded dimension. In the special case of dimension $3$, we reduce the problem to $2$-Satisfiability. Our approach has an implication in algorithmic graph theory: we obtain a polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing graphs in which all minimal transversals of maximal cliques have size at most $k$, for any fixed $k$.</description>

      <title>Deterministic Search on Complete Bipartite Graphs by Continuous Time Quantum Walk</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.01640</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.01640v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper presents a deterministic search algorithm on complete bipartite graphs. Our algorithm adopts the simple form of alternating iterations of an oracle and a continuous-time quantum walk operator, which is a generalization of Grover's search algorithm. We address the most general case of multiple marked states, so there is a problem of estimating the number of marked states. To this end, we construct a quantum counting algorithm based on the spectrum structure of the search operator. To implement the continuous-time quantum walk operator, we perform Hamiltonian simulation in the quantum circuit model. We achieve simulation in constant time, that is, the complexity of the quantum circuit does not scale with the evolution time.</description>
