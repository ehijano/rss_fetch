      <title>Circling crystals in chiral active matter with self-alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09761</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09761v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study a crystal composed of active units governed by self-alignment and chirality. The first mechanism acts as an effective torque that aligns the particle orientation with its velocity, while the second drives individual particles along circular orbits. We find that even a weak degree of chirality, when coupled with self-alignment, induces collective motion of the entire crystal along circular trajectories in space. We refer to this phase as a circling crystal. When chirality outweigh self-alignment, the circular global motion is suppressed in favor of vortex-like regions of coordinated motion. This state is characterized by oscillating spatial velocity correlations, a power law decay of the energy spectrum, and oscillatory temporal correlations. Our findings can be tested experimentally in systems ranging from epithelial tissues to swarming robots, governed by chirality and self-alignment.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear morphoelastic energy based theory for stimuli responsive elastic shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10324v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large deformations play a central role in the shape transformations of slender active and biological structures. A classical example is the eversion of the Volvox embryo, which demonstrates the need for shell theories that can describe large strains, rotations, and the presence of incompatible stimuli. In this work, a reduced two-dimensional morphoelastic energy is derived from a fully nonlinear three-dimensional formulation. The resulting model describes the mechanics of naturally curved shells subjected to non-elastic stimuli acting through the thickness, thereby extending previous morphoelastic theories developed for flat plates to curved geometries. Two representative constitutive laws, corresponding to incompressible Neo-Hookean and compressible Ciarlet-Geymonat materials, are examined to highlight the influence of both geometric and constitutive nonlinearities. The theory is applied to the eversion of open and closed spherical shells and to vesiculation processes in biological systems. The results clarify how compressibility, curvature, and through-the-thickness kinematics govern snap-through and global deformation, extending classical morphoelastic shell models. The framework provides a consistent basis for analyzing large deformations in elastic and biological shells driven by non-mechanical stimuli.</description>

      <title>Flocking transition in phoretically interacting active particles with pinning disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10386v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent studies in the collective behavior of active colloids have shown that a global polar order may emerge due to long-ranged chemo-repulsive interactions between them. Here, we report the role of pinning disorder in the flocking transition for such a system. To this end, we study the problem of chemically interacting active colloids with some fraction of the colloids randomly pinned over space such that they can only rotate while phoretically interacting with other particles. Using this model, we investigate the sustenance of global polar order in the presence of quenched disorder. We quantify the flocking transition by studying the global polarization, and the role of finite-size effects. We find that in the crystalline flocking phase, even a small fraction of pinning can destroy spatial crystalline order, although polar order in the form of a liquid phase is maintained. It is observed that polar order is sustained in a system with a higher pinning fraction if the long-ranged repulsive force is subsequently increased. However, in absence of chemo-repulsive forces between particles, polar order drastically decreases even with a smaller pinning fraction. Overall, this work suggests a novel route of solid-to-liquid transition that can be induced via "translationally inert" obstacles, that rotate but do not translate whilst interacting with the bulk.</description>

      <title>Routes to the density profile and structural inconsistency</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10433</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10433v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (DFT) is the primary method for investigations of inhomogeneous fluids in external fields. It requires the excess Helmholtz free energy functional as input to an Euler-Lagrange equation for the one-body density. A variant of this methodology, the force-DFT, uses instead the Yvon-Born-Green equation to generate density profiles. It is known that the latter are consistent with the virial route to the thermodynamics, while DFT is consistent with the compressibility route. In this work we will show an alternative DFT scheme using the Lovett-Mou-Buff-Wertheim (LMBW) equation to obtain density profiles, that are shown to be also consistent with the compressibility route. However, force-DFT and LMBW DFT can both be implemented using a closure relation on the level of the two-body correlation functions. This is proven to be an advantageous feature, opening the possibility of an optimisation scheme in which the structural inconsistency between different routes to the density profile is minimized. (Structural inconsistency is a generalization of the notion of thermodynamic inconsistency, familiar from bulk integral equation studies.) Numerical results are given for the density profiles of two-dimensional systems of hard-core Yukawa particles with a repulsive or an attractive tail, in planar geometry.</description>

      <title>pH Regulates Ion Dynamics in Carboxylated Mixed Conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09671</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09671v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Coupled ionic and electronic transport underpins processes as diverse as electrochemical energy conversion, biological signaling, and soft adaptive electronics. Yet, how chemical environments such as pH modulate this coupling at the molecular scale remains poorly understood. Here, we show that the protonation state of carboxylated polythiophenes provides precise chemical control over ion dynamics, doping efficiency, solvent uptake and mechanical response. The findings establish molecular acidity as a general strategy to program ionic preference and mechanical stability, offering design principles for pH-responsive mixed conductors and soft electronic materials that couple ionic, electronic, and mechanical functionality.</description>

      <title>Rotational Jamming of Optical Matter Driven by Chiral Light</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10170</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10170v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Optical matter (OM), composed of optically bound metallic particles, can be rotated by transferring the spin angular momentum (SAM) of chiral light to the assembly. Rotating OM is a promising platform for optical micromachines, with potential applications in plasmofluidics and soft robotics. Understanding the dynamic states of such Brownian, micro-mechanical systems is a relevant issue. One key problem is understanding kinetic jamming and clogging. Studies of driven multiparticle systems have revealed that under suboptimal driving, the systems can stop moving, showing jamming transitions. It is important to identify dynamic regimes where crowding competes with driving and is susceptible to jamming in the context of optical micromachines. Through experiments supported by numerical simulations, we reveal assemblies with well-defined hexagonal or triangular symmetry that efficiently harness the SAM of incident chiral light, resulting in stable rotation. However, as the plasmonic-particle assembly grows and its dimensions approach the beam waist, new particles can disrupt this order. This causes a transition to a fluid-like state with less-defined symmetry, correlated with a significant reduction in transferred torque, causing rotation to stagnate or cease. We suggest this behaviour is analogous to a rotational jamming transition, where the rotational motion is arrested. Our findings establish a clear relationship between the structural symmetry of the OM assembly and its ability to harness SAM, providing new insights into controlling chiral light-matter interactions and offering a novel platform for studying jamming transitions.</description>

      <title>M3Scope a 3D multimode multiplane microscope for imaging nanoscale dynamics in soft matter</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10174</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10174v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Fast, volumetric imaging that integrates multiple imaging modalities is essential for probing dynamic, heterogeneous soft and biological matter. Here, we present the M3Scope, a simple yet versatile multiplane microscope that extends widefield detection with a modular multimode cube to enable dual color fluorescence, polarization-resolved, and correlative brightfield fluorescence imaging while (i) preserving simultaneous 3D acquisition at high frame rates (100 fps) and (ii) requiring minimal realignment. We demonstrate its potential by investigating polymer dynamics across multiple spatial and temporal scales. In an acrylamide type polymerizing network, dual color tracking of 100 nm and 300 nm fluorescent probes revealed size dependent viscosities diverging from 15 mPa.s to 40 mPa.s after gelation. Polarization resolved rotational tracking of gold bipyramids yielded viscosities within 10 percent of theoretical values in 80 to 95 percent glycerol and remained accurate in the high-viscosity regime (bigger than 400 mPa.s) where translational motion is undetectable. Fluorescence brightfield imaging correlated structural changes during poly(isopropyl acrylamide) (pNIPAM) phase separation as well as variations in tracer diffusivity, linking morphology and dynamics in 3D. Taken together, these results show that the M3Scope delivers high speed volumetric imaging with flexible modality switching, providing a powerful platform for studying dynamic, heterogeneous systems across disciplines, from polymer physics to cell mechanobiology.</description>

      <title>Novel design strategies for modulating conductive stretchable system response based on periodic assemblies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2101.12600v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Soft electronics have recently gathered considerable interest thanks to their bio-mechanical compatibility. An important feature of such deformable conductors is their electrical response to strain. While development of stretchable materials with high gauge factors has attracted considerable attention, there is a growing need for stretchable conductors whose response to deformation can be accurately engineered to provide arbitrary resistance-strain relationships. The rare studies addressing this issue have focused on deterministic geometries of single rigid materials, limiting the scope of such strategies. Herein, we introduce the novel concept of periodic stretchable patterns combining multiple conductive materials to produce tailored responses. Using shortest-path algorithms, we establish a computationally efficient selection method to obtain required resistance-strain relationship. Using this algorithm, we identify and experimentally demonstrate constant resistance-strain responses up to 50% elongation using a single micro-textured material. Finally, we demonstrate counter-intuitive sinusoidal responses by integrating three materials, with interesting applications in sensing and soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Three-dimensional Optical Reconstruction of colloidal electrokinetics via multiplane imaging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23839</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23839v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Sorting, filtering, moving and controlling colloidal particles is crucial in many fields, ranging from chemistry to biology and physics. Dielectrophoresis is an outstanding tool for the manipulation of small particles by AC electric fields, due to its high selectivity and the absence of the need for labels. We use a new theoretical-experimental approach to study the dynamics of fluorescently labeled polystyrene nanoparticles of 200 nm under positive and negative dielectrophoresis conditions. Our multiplane widefield microscopy technique combined with single particle tracking offers real-time ($&gt;$ 100 fps) superresolved visualization of colloidal dynamics in three spatial dimensions. This real-time 3D imaging technique allows the reconstruction of superresolved trajectories, enabling the visualisation of local forces with unprecedented detail. To interpret this data, a dedicated multiscale modeling approach was developed, targeting a direct comparison between theory and experiment. In the current model DEP and electro-osmotic forces were considered. Under positive DEP conditions, this resulted in a very good agreement with experiment. Under negative DEP conditions, the agreement is less clear, indicating the importance of other effects. This illustrates the potential of this combined 3D imaging and modeling approach to validate and refine our theoretical understanding of AC field induced colloidal dynamics. This framework is broadly applicable to other complex fluid or microfluidic motion.</description>

      <title>Nonmonotonic diffusion in sheared active suspensions of squirmers</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.09457v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate how shear influences the dynamics of active particles in dilute to concentrated suspensions. Using apolar active suspensions of squirmers as model systems, we show how their long-time diffusive dynamics can surprisingly slow down and vary nonmonotonically with the shear rate arising from an interplay between the activity-induced persistent motion and shear-induced reorientation and diffusion. Further simulations of self-propelled particles with tunable persistence exhibit richer dynamics and confirm the observed coupling, suggesting that nonmonotonic diffusion may be a general feature of fluids endowed with an underlying microstructure and large persistence. Our results reveal a nonlinear effect of shear on diffusion in active suspensions, elucidate how internal and external forcing interact, and provide new possibilities to modulate transport in active fluids.</description>

Abstract: Finding process pathways in molecular simulations such as the unbinding paths of small molecule ligands from their binding sites at protein targets in a set of trajectories via unsupervised learning approaches requires the definition of a suitable similarity measure between trajectories. We here evaluate the performance of four such measures with varying degree of sophistication, i.e., Euclidean and Wasserstein distances, Procrustes analysis and dynamical time warping, when analyzing trajectory data from two different biased simulation driving protocols in the form of constant velocity constraint targeted MD and steered MD. In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters.</description>

      <title>pH-dependent interfacial rheology of polymer membranes assembled at liquid-liquid interfaces using hydrogen bonds</title>

      <description>arXiv:2507.17355v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Self-assembly of polymers at liquid interfaces using non-covalent interactions has emerged as a promising technique to reversibly produce self-healing membranes. Besides the assembly process, it is also crucial to control the mechanical properties of these membranes. Here, we measure the interfacial rheological properties of PMAA-PPO (polymethacrylic acid - polypropylene oxide) polymer membranes assembled using hydrogen bonds at the interface between water and a polar oil, Mygliol. Varying the pH enables us to modify the degree of ionization of the PMAA chains, and hence their ability to establish hydrogen interactions with PPO. Frequency sweeps of the interfacial layers show a crossover between a viscous regime at low frequencies and an elastic regime at high frequencies. The crossover elastic modulus, measured one hour after the two phases were put into contact, decreases by a half over the pH range investigated, which can be accounted for by a decrease of the layer thickness as pH increases. Furthermore, we find that the crossover frequency varies exponentially with the degree of ionization of PMAA. To account for these observations, we propose a simple picture where the short PPO chains behave as non-covalent cross-linkers that bridge several PMAA chains. The dissociation rate and hence the crossover frequency are controlled by the number of PO units per PPO chain involved in the hydrogen bonds.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.05643v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report on an experimental active matter system with motion restricted to four cardinal directions. Our particles are magnetite-doped colloidal spheres driven by the Quincke electrorotational instability. The absence of a magnetic field ($|\bm{B}|=0$) leads to circular trajectories interspersed with short spontaneous runs. Intermediate fields ($|\bm{B}| \lesssim 20$ mT) linearize the motion along the axis perpendicular to $\bm{B}$. At high magnetic fields, we observe the surprising emergence of a second, distinct linearization along the axis parallel to $\bm{B}$. With numerical simulations, we show that this behavior can be explained by anisotropic magnetic susceptibility.</description>

Abstract: We develop a replicated liquid theory for structural glasses which exhibit spatial variation of physical quantities along one axis, say $z$-axis. The theory becomes exact with infinite transverse dimension $d-1 \to \infty$. It provides an exact free-energy functional with space-dependent glass order parameter $\Delta_{ab}(z)$. As a first application of the scheme, we study diverging lengths associated with dynamic/static glass transitions of hardspheres with/without confining cavity. The exponents agree with those obtained in previous studies on related mean-field models. Moreover, it predicts a non-trivial spatial profile of the glass order parameter $\Delta_{ab}(z)$ within the cavity which exhibits a scaling feature approaching the dynamical glass transition.</description>

      <title>Force-induced Elastic Softening and Conformational Transitions in a Polyampholyte Chain</title>

Abstract: The mechanical response of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) and polyampholyte (PA) chains is vital for understanding their biological functions and designing functional materials. We investigate the force-extension behavior of a PA chain with distinct charge sequences using molecular dynamics simulations and a theoretical approach based on the generalized random-phase approximation (GRPA). A diblock PA chain under extensional force undergoes a continuous coil-to-stretch transition at weak electrostatic coupling, which sharpens into a globule-coil-like transition at stronger coupling. The GRPA theory quantitatively captures these behaviors, including the sharp conformational transition and its dependence on electrostatic strength. Simulations reveal pronounced hysteresis during the force-extension and relaxation processes. Additionally, the elastic modulus exhibits four regimes: an initial plateau, stress stiffening, an exponential stress-softening behavior, and a stress stiffening regime. Using the theoretical model and structural input of the PA chain, we have demonstrated that the elastic modulus in the elastic softening regime decreases exponentially, $E\sim \exp(-\alpha_0 f/\Gamma_e)$, as a function of $f$, which aligns with the simulation results. The elastic response of the PA chain is further examined across different charge sequences, where both elastic softening and sharp transitions are absent at smaller block lengths. Finally, coarse-grained models of IDPs such as LAF-1 and DDX4 exhibit similar nonlinear elasticity, highlighting the universality of these mechanisms. Our results establish a fundamental link between electrostatic correlations, charge sequence, and nonlinear elasticity, bridging molecular interactions and macroscopic mechanics.</description>

      <title>Physics of droplet regulation in biological cells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13639</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13639v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Droplet formation has emerged as an essential concept for the spatiotemporal organisation of biomolecules in cells. However, classical descriptions of droplet dynamics based on passive liquid-liquid phase separation cannot capture the complex situation inside cells. This review discusses three distinct aspects that are crucial in cells: (i) biomolecules are diverse and individually complex, implying that cellular droplets possess complex internal behaviour, e.g., in terms of their material properties; (ii) the cellular environment contains many solid-like structures that droplets can wet; (iii) cells are alive and use fuel to drive processes out of equilibrium. We illustrate how these principles control droplet nucleation, growth, position, and count to unveil possible regulatory mechanisms in biological cells and other applications of phase separation.</description>

      <title>Critical Motility-Induced Phase Separation in Three Dimensions is Consistent with Ising Universality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09069</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.09069v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Identifying the universality class of critical active phase transitions has been the subject of recent interest and controversy. Resolving these controversies will require robust numerical investigations to determine whether active critical exponents point to novel universality classes or are consistent with established ones. Here, we conduct large-scale computer simulations and a finite-size scaling analysis of the motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) of active Brownian hard spheres in three dimensions (3D), finding that the static and dynamic critical exponents all closely match those of the 3D Ising universality class with a conserved scalar order parameter. This finding is corroborated by a fluctuating hydrodynamic description of the critical dynamics of the order parameter field which flows to the Wilson-Fisher fixed point in three dimensions. Our work suggests that 3D MIPS and likely the entire phase diagram of active Brownian hard spheres is similar to that of molecular passive fluids despite the absence of Boltzmann statistics.</description>

      <title>High-Throughput Mechanical Characterization of Giant Unilamellar Vesicles by Real-Time Deformability Cytometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.15341v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Real-time deformability cytometry (RT-DC) enables high-throughput, contact-free mechanical characterization of soft microscopic objects.
  Here we apply this technique to giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs). To interpret vesicle deformation in RT-DC, we present a simulation-based model taking into account the area expansion modulus as the dominant mechanical parameter. Using phase-field simulations over a wide parameter space, we find GUV deformation to depend linearly on GUV area.
  Based on these results, we derive two complementary fitting strategies for extracting the area expansion modulus K from RT-DC data: a direct model-based fit for single-vesicle characterization and a noise-resistant collective approach that enables robust population-level estimates. Furthermore, we introduce a combined fitting method that integrates both approaches to filter outliers and improve accuracy in heterogeneous or noisy datasets. All methods scale across varying flow rates, channel geometries and buffer viscosities, and produce predictions of K consistent with literature values for different lipid compositions. Compared to traditional techniques such as micropipette aspiration, our approach offers orders of magnitude higher throughput without mechanical contact, making it particularly suitable for GUV population studies. Beyond mechanical phenotyping, this framework opens new avenues for sorting vesicle populations based on membrane mechanics, a capability of growing interest in synthetic biology and soft matter research.</description>

      <title>Amorphous Solid Model of Vectorial Hopfield Neural Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22787</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.22787v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a three-dimensional vectorial extension of the Hopfield associative-memory model in which each neuron is a unit vector on $S^2$ and synaptic couplings are $3\times 3$ blocks generated through a vectorial Hebbian rule. The resulting block-structured operator is mathematically analogous to the Hessian of amorphous solids and induces a rigid energy landscape with deep minima for stored patterns. Simulations and spectral analysis show that the vectorial network substantially outperforms the classical binary Hopfield model. For moderate connectivity, the critical storage ratio $\gamma_c$ grows approximately linearly with the coordination number $Z$, while for $Z\gtrsim 40$ a high-connectivity regime emerges in which $\gamma_c$ systematically exceeds the extrapolated low-$Z$ linear fit. At the same time, a persistent spectral gap separates pattern modes from the bulk and basins of attraction enlarge, yielding enhanced robustness to initialization noise. Thus geometric constraints combined with amorphous-solid-inspired structure produce associative memories with superior storage and retrieval performance, especially in the high-connectivity ($Z \gtrsim 20$-$30$) regime.</description>
