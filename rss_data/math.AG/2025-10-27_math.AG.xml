      <title>Grauert's Approximation Theorem in any Characteristic and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21001</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21001v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In his fundamental Inventiones paper from 1972 Grauert proved the existence of a semi-universal deformation of an arbitrary complex analytic isolated singularity. The existence of a formal semi-universal deformation was proved before already by Schlessinger. To prove convergence Grauert had to solve a system of analytic equations, where a "nested" formal solution needed to be approximated by a nested analytic one. Grauert invented such an approximation theorem under special assumptions, which is now called Grauert's approximation theorem. In order to prove the theorem, Grauert introduced standard bases for ideals in power series rings and proved a generalized Weiertra{\ss} division theorem. All this was done for convergent power series over the complex numbers.
  The purpose of this article is to extend Grauert's division and approximation theorem to convergent power series over arbitrary real valued fields of any characteristic. As an application we deduce the existence of a convergent semi-universal deformation for an isolated singularity and a splitting lemma for not necessarily isolated hypersurface singularities over any real valued field.</description>

      <title>Quasi-ordinary hypersurfaces, multiplier ideals and local tropicalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21009</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21009v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we describe the multiplier ideals and jumping numbers associated with an irreducible germ of quasi-ordinary hypersurface $(D, 0) \subset (\mathbb{C}^{d+1}, 0)$ by using a toroidal embedded resolution. The approach is motivated by Howald's description of the multiplier ideals of monomial ideals. We show that the multiplier ideals of $D$ can be expressed in terms of a finite sequence of Newton polyhedra associated with the total transform of $D$ in the toroidal resolution process. We prove that the multiplier ideals are generalized monomial ideals with respect to a complete sequence of semi-roots. This is a finite sequence of functions which determines a system of generators of the semigroup of the quasi-ordinary hypersurface. We express these results in terms of the local tropicalization associated with the embedding of $\mathbb{C}^{d+1}$ defined by this sequence. We prove that the local tropicalization is the support of a fan of the lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{d+g+1}$, which is determined by the embedded topological type of $(D, 0) \subset (\mathbb{C}^{d+1}, 0)$.</description>

      <title>Classification of Fano fourfolds with large anticanonical base locus</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21216</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21216v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We give a classification of smooth Fano fourfolds such that the base scheme of the anticanonical system is a smooth surface. As a consequence we show that there are exactly 22 deformation families of such manifolds and they are all obtained by the same geometric construction. These 22 families are closely related to the list of smooth Fano threefolds that admit a $\mathbb P^1$-bundle structure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21222v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this article, we study how the rationality of a Fano threefold is reflected in its standard mirror Landau-Ginzburg model and its deformations. The main result is that a Fano threefold is rational if and only if the monodromy around every reducible fiber of its generic mirror Landau-Ginzburg model is unipotent.</description>

      <title>A Mapping Theorem for Derived Foliations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21497v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we construct in characteristic zero a derived foliation on derived mapping stacks $\underline{\mathbf{Map}}_S(X,Y)$, for $S$ a base derived stack, $X$ a proper schematic, flat, and local complete intersection derived stack over $S$, and $Y$ a relative derived Deligne-Mumford stack over $S$, when $Y$ is equipped with a derived foliation relative to $S$. In the process, given a relative derived Deligne-Mumford stack $Z$ over a derived stack $X$, we will first show that the $\infty$-category of derived foliations over $Z$ relative to $X$ embeds as a full subcategory of derived stacks over $Z$ equipped with extra structure, and describe its essential image explicitly. We will then show that given a proper schematic, flat, and local complete intersection map of derived stacks $f : X \to Y$, the push-forward functor $f_*$ from derived stacks over $X$ to derived stacks over $Y$ preserves the preceding essential images, and thus defines a push-forward, from derived foliations over $Z$ relative to $X$, to derived foliations over $f_* Z$ relative to $Y$. The aforementioned result on derived mapping stacks is obtained as a special case of this statement. As example applications, given a smooth projective scheme $X$ equipped with a derived folation, we obtain derived folations on the derived moduli stacks $\mathbb R \overline{\mathbf M}_{g,n}(X)$ and $\mathbb R \mathbf{Hilb}^{lci}(X)$, which are respectively the derived enhancements of the moduli stack of families of stable curves of genus $g$ with $n$ marked points on $X$, and of the Hilbert scheme of closed subschemes of $X$.</description>

      <title>Products of Chern Classes and Chern Numbers on the Permutohedral Variety</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21528</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21528v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A root system $\Phi$ of rank $n$ determines an $n$-dimensional smooth projective toric variety $X(\Phi)$ associated with the fan of its Weyl chambers. For the root system of type $A_n$, this variety is the well-known permutohedral variety $X_{A_n}$. Using purely combinatorial methods, we obtain an explicit closed formula expressing the product of Chern classes $c_k c_{n-k}$ as a multiple of the top Chern class $c_n$ in the rational cohomology ring $H^*(X_{A_n};\mathbb{Q})$. The resulting coefficient, which depends only on $k$ and $n$, is given by a closed-form expression. As an application, we compute the Chern number $\langle c_k c_{n-k}, [X_{A_n}] \rangle$.</description>

      <title>Standard conjecture of Hodge type for powers of abelian varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21562</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21562v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We prove that the standard conjecture of Hodge type holds for powers of abelian threefolds. Along the way, we also prove the conjecture for powers of simple abelian variety of prime dimension over finite fields, and in other related cases based on the notion of Frobenius rank of Lenstra-Zarhin. The main tool is a result comparing two real fiber functors on tannakian categories. A second tool is a new an explicit description of simple Lefschetz motives over finite fields, in terms of ''enriched'' Frobenius eigenvalues.</description>

      <title>Integrals of stable envelopes for cotangent bundles to Grassmannians</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21573v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We consider cohomological stable envelopes for a natural torus action $\mathsf{T}$ on $X=T^*Gr(k,n)$, introduced by Maulik-Okounkov. We define the $\mathbb{C}^*_\hbar$-equivariant integral of the stable envelope using equivariant localization over the subtorus $\mathbb{C}^*_\hbar\subset\mathsf{T}$, and compute the integral as a non-equivariant limit of the localization over the full torus, $\mathsf{T}$. The integral of such a class is an integer times a power of $\hbar$, and the main result of this paper is a combinatorial formula for these integers. In 3d mirror symmetry, these non-equivariant limits are expected to reflect some curve counting phenomena on the 3d mirror dual, $X^\vee$. When $k=1$, we obtain the binomial coefficients, and we study some of the combinatorics of the integers for higher $k$, which haven't appeared in the literature before. We give some conjectures and interpretations on extending this phenomena to type A quiver and bow varieties.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21594</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.21594v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The Koras-Russell threefolds are a certain family of smooth, affine contractible threefolds exhibiting "exotic" behavior in the algebro-geometric context. Our goal in this note is to extend its $\mathbb{A}^1$-contractibility from a field to a general base scheme. As a consequence, we also give a general strategy to extend the $\mathbb{A}^1$-contractibility of Koras-Russell prototypes in higher dimensions over a general base scheme. As a major consequence, we establish the existence of "exotic" motivic spheres in all dimensions at least 4 over infinite perfect fields.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.21677v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We solve a non-Archimedean Monge-Amp\`ere equation on the Berkovich analytification of a complex log Calabi-Yau pair whose dual complex is a standard simplex, answering a question of Collins-Li and offering a non-Archimedean analog of Ricci-flat metric potentials on complex affine varieties. This work builds on the solution to a complex Monge-Amp\`ere equation obtained by Collins-Li and Collins-Tong-Yau. We also show the suitably rescaled limits of the complex potentials coincide with their non-Archimedean counterparts in some situations, strengthening their connections.</description>

      <title>Generalized Brieskorn Modules III. The algebra $\tilde{\mathcal{A}}\_{conv.}$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20879v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper we introduce and study the ''convergent'' algebra (containing ''a'' and ''b'' and acting on holomorphic germs in ''a'') which naturally acts on the ''generalized Brieskorn modules'' associated to the Gauss-Manin connections of the germs at each point of the singular set of a holomorphic function on a complex manifold. We generalize to this convergent setting the results previously obtained (see 8], [9], [15] and [16]) in the formal case, and we show that, in suitable global situations (for instance when f is projective) we obtain also generalized (geometric) Brieskorn modules. So the question of the relationship between the left module structure on this algebra (which defines several interesting filtrations) and the mixte Hodge structure is raised</description>

      <title>Two-parameter Langlands Correspondence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20948</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20948v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In our paper arXiv:1701.03146 we established, for every simply-laced Lie algebra g, a canonical isomorphism between the spaces of deformed conformal blocks of the deformed W-algebra and the quantum affine algebra corresponding to g, which we view as a q-deformation of the quantum Langlands correspondence. This was done by realizing the deformed conformal blocks of these algebras via the quantum K-theory of the Nakajima quiver varieties. We also linked this isomorphism to a duality emerging from the 6d little string theory. Here, we give a brief survey of these results and propose an extension to the non-simply laced case, which exhibits a Langlands-type duality.</description>

Abstract: We study a class of Grassmannians of sub-bimodules over the path algebras of quivers. Our quiver Grassmannians include Escobar's brick manifolds as well as Labelle's generalizations. We give an explicit construction of the varieties in question, provide examples and clarify connection with the quiver representation spaces. We also prove smoothness of our Grassmannians, construct cellular decompositions and derive a realization as framed moduli spaces. The framed moduli realization leads to a recursive formula for the motives.</description>

Abstract: We consider quantum difference equation (QDE) for equivariant quantum K-theory of the Grassmannian. In this paper we obtain a solution to the QDE and use the solution to asymptotically derive the Bethe ansatz equations. In the limit, we obtain similar results for the cohomological analogue. For both cases, we describe the nonequivariant solutions as well. As an application, we identify the quantum K-theory ring of $\mathrm{Gr}(k,n)$ with a quantum 5 vertex XXZ integrable spin chain.</description>

      <title>Integral differential forms for superelliptic curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.12357</link>
      <description>arXiv:2003.12357v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Given a superelliptic curve $Y_K : y^n = f(x)$ over a local field $K$, we describe the theoretical background and an implementation of a new algorithm for computing the $\mathcal{O}_K$-lattice of integral differential forms on $Y_K$. We build on the results of Obus and the second author, which describe arbitrary regular models of the projective line using only valuations. One novelty of our approach is that we construct an $\mathcal{O}_K$-model of $Y_K$ with only rational singularities, but which may not be regular.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.01735v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We extend the definition of the unramified curve-tame cohomology groups to $\mathbb{A}^1$-invariant \'etale sheaves under some additional hypotheses. We define a pairing of this group with the Suslin homology satisfying desirable properties and using this, we show that the unramified curve-tame cohomology of a smooth geometrically connected variety over a field of positive characteristic agrees with the cohomology of the base field.</description>

      <title>Bridgeland/Weak Stability Conditions under Spherical Twist Associated to A Torsion Sheaf</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18554</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.18554v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the action of an autoequivalence, the spherical twist associated to a torsion sheaf, on the standard Bridgeland stability conditions and a generalized weak stability condition on the derived category of a K3 surface. As a special case, we construct a Bridgeland stability condition associated to a non-nef divisor, which conjecturally lies in the geometric component but outside the geometric chamber. We also discuss the destabilizing objects and stability of certain line bundles at the weak stability condition associated to a nef divisor.</description>

      <title>On the topology of real algebraic stacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02720</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.02720v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Motivated by questions arising in the theory of moduli spaces in real algebraic geometry, we develop a range of methods to study the topology of the real locus of a Deligne-Mumford stack over the real numbers. As an application, we verify in several cases the Smith-Thom type inequality for stacks that we conjectured in an earlier work. This requires combining techniques from group theory, algebraic geometry, and topology.</description>

      <title>Topological triviality and link-constancy in deformations of inner Khovanskii non-degenerate maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18816</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.18816v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: For real polynomial maps and mixed polynomial maps $f=(f^1,\dots,f^p)$, with $f(0)=0$, we introduce the notion of Inner Khovanskii Non-Degeneracy (IKND), which generalize a previous non-degeneracy condition for complex polynomial functions introduced by Wall (J. Reine Angew. Math. 509 (1999), 1-19.). We prove that IKND is a sufficient condition that ensures the link of the singularity of $f$ at the origin is smooth and well-defined. We then study one-parameter deformations of an IKND map $f$, given by $F(x,\varepsilon)=f(x)+\theta(x,\varepsilon), F(0,\varepsilon)=0$. We prove that the deformation is link-constant under suitable conditions on $f$ and $\theta$, meaning that the ambient isotopy type of the link remains unchanged along the deformation. Furthermore, by employing a strong version of this non-degeneracy, Strong Inner Khovanskii Non-Degeneracy (SIKND), we obtain results on topological triviality. In the last section, inspired by the results of Ara\'ujo dos Santos et al. (Bull. Braz. Math. Soc. (N.S.) 55 (2024), no. 3, Paper No. 34.), we explore deformations of mixed polynomial functions in two variables and provide a characterization of the link appearing in a special class of these deformations.</description>

      <title>Comparison of motives with rational coefficients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17194</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17194v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study rational motives over an arbitrary base scheme $S$ and identify a natural criterion guaranteeing that the principal models of rational motives agree. Starting from the free $\mathbb{Q}$-linearization $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb S]$ of the motivic sphere spectrum and from the motivic rational Eilenberg MacLane spectrum $\mathbf H\mathbb{Q}$ built from rational finite correspondences, we analyse the canonical ring map $\Phi_S:\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb S]\to\mathbf H\mathbb{Q}$. Our first main result shows that $\Phi_S$ is a stable motivic equivalence as soon as motivic cohomology groups computed in Ayoub's framework agree, for all smooth $S$-schemes $X$ of finite type and all bidegrees, with those computed in Voevodsky's (Nisnevich) theory. From this identification of stable homotopy sheaves we deduce several consequences: for every excellent geometrically unibranch base the map $\Phi_S$ is an equivalence; modules over $\mathbb{Q}[\mathbb S]$ recover the usual Beilinson/Ayoub/Morel incarnations of rational motives; and under the hypothesis that $\Phi_-$ is an equivalence formation of $\mathbf H\mathbb{Q}$ commutes with base change. Our last results shows that if motivic rational homology Whitewhead theorem over $S$ is true, then $\Phi_S$ is a stable motivic equivalence.</description>

      <title>Tyurin Degenerations, Derived Lagrangians and Categorification of DT Invariants</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20325</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.20325v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the moduli space of rigidified perfect complexes with support on a general complete intersection Calabi-Yau threefold $X$ and its Tyurin degeneration $X\rightsquigarrow X_1\cup_SX_2$ to a complete intersection of Fano threefolds $X_1,X_2$ meeting along their anti-canonical divisor $S$. The corresponding derived dg moduli scheme over the generic fiber degenerates to the (Fano) moduli spaces $\mathcal{M}_{1}, \mathcal{M}_{2},$ of perfect complexes supported on each Fano which glue after derived restriction to the relative divisor $S$. We prove that the total moduli space of the degeneration family carries a relative Lagrangian foliation structure, which implies the existence of a flat Gauss-Manin connection on periodic cyclic homology of the category of the matrix factorizations associated with fiber-wise moduli spaces, realized locally as the derived critical loci of suitable potential functions. The Fano moduli spaces each define derived Lagrangians in the (ambient) moduli space of restricted complexes to the relative divisor $S$. The flatness of the Gauss-Manin connection implies the derived geometric deformation invariance of the categorified DT-invariants associated to fiberwise matrix factorization categories, hence, the categorified DT-invariants of the generic fiber are expressed in terms of a derived intersection cohomology of the corresponding Fano moduli spaces on the special fiber.</description>

      <title>Bi-$\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-structures on Hermitian symmetric spaces and quadratic relations between CM periods</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10488</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.10488v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the notion of a bi-$\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-structure on the tangent space at a CM point on a locally Hermitian symmetric domain. We prove that this bi-$\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-structure decomposes into the direct sum of $1$-dimensional bi-$\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-subspaces, and make this decomposition explicit for the moduli space of abelian varieties $\mathbb{A}_g$.
  We propose an Analytic Subspace Conjecture, which is the analogue of the W\"{u}stholz's Analytic Subgroup Theorem in this context. We show that this conjecture, applied to $\mathbb{A}_g$, implies that all quadratic $\overline{\mathbb{Q}}$-relations among the holomorphic periods of CM abelian varieties arise from elementary ones.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.03789v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce a technique for proving lower bounds on the essential dimension of split reductive groups. As an application, we strengthen the best previously known lower bounds for various split simple algebraic groups, most notably for the exceptional group $E_8$. In the case of the projective linear group $\operatorname{PGL}_n$, we recover A. Merkurjev's celebrated lower bound with a simplified proof. Our technique relies on decompositions of loop torsors over valued fields due to P. Gille and A. Pianzola.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2411.05096v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We give a counting formula in terms of modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials and the chromatic quasisymmetric function for the number of points on an arbitrary Hessenberg variety over a finite field. As a consequence, we express the Poincar\'e polynomials of complex Hessenberg varieties in terms of a Hall scalar product involving the symmetric functions above. We use these results to give a new proof of a combinatorial formula for the modified Hall-Littlewood polynomials.</description>

Abstract: We show that the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of the d-dimensional non-degenerate quadric hypersurface of characteristic p &gt; 2 is a rational function of p composed from the Ehrhart polynomials of integer polytopes. In consequence, we prove that the Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity of quadrics of fixed characteristic is a decreasing function of dimension and recover results of Trivedi and Gessel-Monsky on the behaviour of said Hilbert-Kunz multiplicity as a function of characteristic.</description>
