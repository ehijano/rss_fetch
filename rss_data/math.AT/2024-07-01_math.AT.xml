      <title>The Dual Degree Cech Bifiltration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In topological data analysis (TDA), a longstanding challenge is to recognize underlying geometric structures in noisy data. One motivating examples is the shape of a point cloud in Euclidean space given by image. Carlsson et al. proposed a method to detect topological features in point clouds by first filtering by density and then applying persistent homology. Later more refined methods have been developed, such as the degree Rips complex of Lesnick and Wright and the multicover bifiltration. In this paper we introduce the dual Degree Cech bifiltration, a Prohorov stable bicomplex of a point cloud in a metric space with the point cloud itself as vertex set. It is of the same homotopy type as the Measure Dowker bifiltration of Hellmer and Spali\'nski but it has a different vertex set.
  The dual Degree Cech bifiltration can be constructed both in an ambient and an intrinsic way. The intrinsic dual Degree Cech bifiltration is a $(1,2)$-intereaved with the ambent dual Degree Cech bifiltration in the distance parameter. This interleaving can be used to leverage a stability result for the intrinsically defined dual Degree Cech bifiltration. This stability result recently occured in work by Hellmer and Spali\'nski.</description>

      <title>Formality of $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras and cochains on spheres</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00790</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00790v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the loop and suspension functors on the category of augmented $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebras. One application is to the formality of the cochain algebra of the $n$-sphere. We show that it is formal as an $\mathbb{E}_n$-algebra, also with coefficients in general commutative ring spectra, but rarely $\mathbb{E}_{n+1}$-formal unless the coefficients are rational. Along the way we show that the free functor from operads in spectra to monads in spectra is fully faithful on a nice subcategory of operads which in particular contains the stable $\mathbb{E}_n$-operads for finite $n$. We use this to interpret our results on loop and suspension functors of augmented algebras in operadic terms.</description>

      <title>Descent spectral sequences through synthetic spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01507</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01507v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The synthetic analogue functor $\nu$ from spectra to synthetic spectra does not preserve all limits. In this paper, we give a necessary and sufficient criterion for $\nu$ to preserve the global sections of a derived stack. Even when these conditions are not satisfied, our framework still yields synthetic spectra that implement the descent spectral sequence for the structure sheaf, thus placing descent spectral sequences on good footing in the $\infty$-category of synthetic spectra. As an example, we introduce a new $\mathrm{MU}$-synthetic spectrum $\mathrm{Smf}$.</description>

      <title>The Braid Indices of Pretzel Links: A Comprehensive Study, Part II</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00238</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00238v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is the second part of our comprehensive study on the braid index problem of pretzel links. Our ultimate goal is to completely determine the braid indices of all pretzel links, alternating or non alternating. In our approach, we divide the pretzel links into three types as follows. Let $D$ be a standard diagram of an oriented pretzel link $\mathcal{L}$, $S(D)$ be the Seifert circle decomposition of $D$, and $C_1$, $C_2$ be the Seifert circles in $S(D)$ containing the top and bottom long strands of $D$ respectively, then $\mathcal{L}$ is classified as a Type 1 (Type 2) pretzel link if $C_1\not=C_2$ and $C_1$, $C_2$ have different (identical) orientations. In the case that $C_1=C_2$, then $\mathcal{L}$ is classified as a Type 3 pretzel link. In our previous paper, we succeeded in reaching our goal for all Type 1 and Type 2 pretzel links. That is, we successfully derived precise braid index formulas for all Type 1 and Type 2 pretzel links. In this paper, we present the results of our study on Type 3 pretzel links. In this case, we are very close to reaching our goal. More precisely, with the exception of a small percentage of Type 3 pretzel links, we are able to determine the precise braid indices for the majority of Type 3 pretzel links. Even for those exceptional ones, we are able to determine their braid indices within two consecutive integers. With some numerical evidence, we conjecture that in such a case, the braid index of the Type 3 pretzel link is given by the larger of the two consecutive integers given by our formulas.</description>

      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00395</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00395v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that for any element in the $\gamma$-completion of the space of smooth compact exact Lagrangian submanifolds of a cotangent bundle, if its $\gamma$-support is a smooth Lagrangian submanifold, then the element itself is a smooth Lagrangian. We also prove that if the $\gamma$-support of an element in the completion is compact, then it is connected.</description>

      <title>Circular symmetry-breaking and topological Noether currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00672</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.00672v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We propose a toy model for the algebraic topology of bubbling as circular symmetry-breaking, in terms of asymptotic expressions for Noether currents and cobordism of manifolds with circle actions free along boundaries. This leads to an interpretation of Planck's radiation law as the loss of a Noether symmetry when a bubble $[S^2/\mathbb{T}] \to {\rm pt}$ (analogous to blowing up or down in projective geometry) collapses, much like the von K\'arm\'an street of sparks left when a candle flame wisps out.</description>

      <title>Segal K-theory of vector spaces with an automorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01482</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.01482v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We describe the Segal $K$-theory of the symmetric monoidal category of finite-dimensional vector spaces over a perfect field $\mathbb{F}$ together with an automorphism, or, equivalently, the group-completion of the $E_\infty$-algebra of maps from $S^1$ to the disjoint union of classifying spaces $\mathrm{BGL}_d(\mathbb F)$, in terms of the $K$-theory of finite field extensions of $\mathbb{F}$. A key ingredient for this is a computation of the Segal $K$-theory of the category of finite-dimensional vector spaces with a nilpotent endomorphism, which we do over any field $\mathbb F$. We also discuss the topological cases of $\mathbb F =\mathbb C,\mathbb R$.</description>

      <title>Polyhedral products over finite posets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.07951</link>
      <description>arXiv:1903.07951v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Polyhedral products were defined by Bahri, Bendersky, Cohen and Gitler, to be spaces obtained as unions of certain product spaces indexed by the simplices of an abstract simplicial complex. In this paper we give a very general homotopy theoretic construction of polyhedral products over arbitrary pointed posets. We show that under certain restrictions on the poset $\calp$, that include all known cases, the cohomology of the resulting spaces can be computed as an inverse limit over $\calp$ of the cohomology of the building blocks. This motivates the definition of an analogous algebraic construction - the polyhedral tensor product. We show that for a large family of posets, the cohomology of the polyhedral product is given by the polyhedral tensor product. We then restrict attention to polyhedral posets, a family of posets that include face posets of simplicial complexes, and simplicial posets, as well as many others. We define the Stanley-Reisner ring of a polyhedral poset and show that, like in the classical cases, these rings occur as the cohomology of certain polyhedral products over the poset in question. For any pointed poset $\calp$ we construct a simplicial poset $s(\calp)$, and show that if $\calp$ is a polyhedral poset then polyhedral products over $\calp$ coincide up to homotopy with the corresponding polyhedral products over $s(\calp)$.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.00990v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We study the double homology associated to triangulated spheres and present two results. First, we explicitly compute the double homology for minimum degree sphere triangulations. Using a spectral sequence argument, we compute the effect of removing a maximal simplex of a non-neighborly sphere triangulation. Using these results and computational aid we generate complexes with exotic double homology rank. We also relate the double homology of a complex with how neighborly it is.</description>

      <title>Core Bifiltration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.01214v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The motivation of this paper is to recognize a geometric shape from a noisy sample in the form of a point cloud. Inspired by the HDBSCAN clustering algorithm, we introduce the core dissimilarity, from which we construct the core bifiltration. We also consider the alpha-core bifiltration by intersecting with Voronoi cells, giving us a filtered simplicial complex of smaller size. A major advantage of the (alpha-)core bifiltration is that, for each filtration value, it admits a good cover of balls. By the persistent nerve theorem, the nerve of this cover is homotopy equivalent to the (alpha-)core bifiltration. We show that the multicover-, core- and alpha-core bifiltrations are all interleaved, and that they enjoy similar stability properties with respect to the Prohorov distance. We have performed experiments with the core and the alpha-core bifiltrations where we have calculated their persistent homology along lines in the two-dimensional persistence parameter space.</description>

Abstract: We define an enrichment of the logarithmic derivative of the zeta function of a variety over a finite field to a power series with coefficients in the Grothendieck--Witt group. We show that this enrichment is related to the topology of the real points of a lift. For cellular schemes over a field, we prove a rationality result for this enriched logarithmic derivative of the zeta function as an analogue of part of the Weil conjectures. We also compute several examples, including toric varieties, and show that the enrichment is a motivic measure.</description>

Abstract: We show that the sets of $d$-dimensional Latin hypercubes over a non-empty set $X$, with $d$ running over the positive integers, determine an operad which is isomorphic to a sub-operad of the endomorphism operad of $X$.
