      <title>Exact solution for a quantum SIR model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09951</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.09951v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Based on the classical continuous system initially proposed by Bailey in 1975, we present a novel Susceptible--Infected--Removed (SIR) model defined in quantum time, where the temporal evolution is governed by a non-uniform time grid. An explicit analytical solution is derived, and the long-term behavior of the susceptible, infected, and removed individuals is analyzed. Moreover, we prove the model preserves dynamic consistency with its continuous counterpart, as evidenced by the non-negativity of solutions and their corresponding qualitative agreement with the continuous dynamics. All results are further supported by illustrative examples.</description>

      <title>Degree growth of skew pentagram maps</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10062</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10062v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Skew pentagram maps act on polygons by intersecting diagonals of different lengths. They were introduced by Khesin-Soloviev in 2015 as conjecturally non-integrable generalizations of the pentagram map, a well-known integrable system. In this paper, we show that certain skew pentagram maps have exponential degree growth and no preserved fibration. To formalize this, we introduce a general notion of first dynamical degree for lattice maps, or shift-invariant self-maps of $(\mathbb{P}^N)^\mathbb{Z}$. We show that the dynamical degree of any equal-length pentagram map is 1, but that there are infinitely many skew pentagram maps with dynamical degree 4.</description>

      <title>Curvature-Weighted Contact Networks: Spectral Reduction and Global Stability in a Markovian SIR Model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10331</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10331v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a new network-based SIR epidemic model in which transmission is modulated by a curvature-weighted contact matrix that encodes structural and geometric features of the underlying graph. The formulation encompasses both adjacency-driven and Markovian mixing, allowing heterogeneous interactions to be shaped by curvature-sensitive topological properties. We prove that the basic reproduction number satisfies \[ R_0=\frac{\beta}{\gamma}\lambda_{\max}(M), \] where $M$ is the curvature-weighted transmission operator. Using Perron--Frobenius theory together with linear and nonlinear Lyapunov functionals, we establish: (i) global asymptotic stability of the disease-free equilibrium when $R_0&lt;1$, and (ii) existence and global asymptotic stability of a unique endemic equilibrium when $R_0&gt;1$. Our results show that curvature acts as a geometric regularizer of connectivity, lowering spectral radii, raising effective epidemic thresholds, and organizing the long-term dynamics through monotone contraction toward the endemic state. This framework generalizes classical network epidemiology by integrating geometric information directly into transmission operators, providing a rigorous foundation for epidemic dynamics on structurally heterogeneous networks.</description>

      <title>Global dynamics of three-dimensional Lotka-Volterra competition models with seasonal succession: II. Uniqueness of positive fixed points</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10456</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10456v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this second part of the series, we investigate the uniqueness of positive fixed points of the Poincare map associated with the 3-dimensional Lotka-Volterra competition model with seasonal succession. Building on our first part of the series on the classification of 33 dynamical equivalence classes (regardless of the uniqueness of positive fixed points), we demonstrate in this paper that classes 26 and 27 may indeed exhibit multiple positive fixed points. This reveals a fundamental distinction from both its 2-dimensional analogue and the classical 3-dimensional competitive Lotka-Volterra model. More concretely, by focusing on the model with identical growth and death rates, we establish an equivalent characterization for the (non)uniqueness of positive fixed points. Based on this characterization, we further show that classes 19-25 and 28-33 admit a unique positive fixed point and exhibit trivial dynamics: all trajectories converge to some fixed point (corresponding to harmonic solutions). In contrast, classes 26 and 27 possess richer dynamical scenarios: there can contain a continuum of invariant closed curves, on which orbits may be periodic (corresponding to subharmonic solutions), dense (corresponding to quasi-periodic solutions), or may even consist entirely of positive fixed points (which exhibits the nonuniqueness of positive fixed points).</description>

      <title>A Three-Dimensional SFT with Sparse Columns</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10499</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10499v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We construct a nontrivial three-dimensional subshift of finite type whose projective $\Z$-subdynamics, or $\Z$-trace, is 2-sparse, meaning that there are at most two nonzero symbols in any vertical column. The subshift is deterministic in the direction of the subdynamics, so it is topologically conjugate to the set of spacetime diagrams of a partial cellular automaton. We also present a variant of the subshift that is defined by Wang cubes, and one whose alphabet is binary.</description>

      <title>Twisted homoclinic orbits in Lorenz and Chen systems: rigorous proofs from universal normal form</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The properties common to the Lorenz and Chen attractors, as well as their fundamental differences, have been studied for many years in a vast number of works and remain a topic far from a rigorous and complete description. In this paper we take a step towards solving this problem by carrying out a rigorous study of the so-called universal normal form to which we have reduced the systems of both of these families. For this normal form, we prove the existence of infinite set of homoclinic orbits with different topological structure defined by the number of rotations around axis of symmetry. We show that these rotational topological features are inherited by the attractors of Chen-type systems and give rise to their twisted nature - the generic difference from attractors of Lorenz type.</description>

      <title>On forward attractors for nonautonomous dynamical systems with application to the asymptotically autonomous Chafee-Infante equation</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10759v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, for nonautonomous dynamical systems, we give first general conditions ensuring that a pullback attractor is a forward attractor as well in both the single and multivalued frameworks. In particular, we consider asymptotically autonomous systems. After that, and this is the main result of this paper, we apply these abstract theorems to the asymptotically autonomous Chafee-Infante equation. Finally, applications to ordinary and parabolic differential inclusions are given.</description>

      <title>Global stabilization of the planar Ricker system with noisy PBC</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10919v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We apply Prediction-Based control (PBC) in order to stabilize globally a positive equilibrium of a planar Ricker's equation. We construct a closed invariant set in a strictly positive domain for the controlled map and derive conditions on control parameters ensuring that the increments of a specially constructed Lyapunov function are nonpositive on this set. By stochastic perturbation of the parameters we decrease the average values of controls providing global, as well as local, stabilization. Computer simulations illustrate our results.</description>

      <title>An improved approach for estimating the dimension of inertial manifolds in chaotic distributed dynamical systems via analysis of angles between tangent subspaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10030</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10030v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: While a previously proposed method for estimating inertial manifold dimension, based on explicitly computing angles between pairs of covariant Lyapunov vectors (CLVs), employs efficient algorithms, it remains computationally demanding due to its substantial resource requirements. In this work, we introduce an improved method to determine this dimension by analyzing the angles between tangent subspaces spanned by the CLVs. This approach builds upon a fast numerical technique for assessing chaotic dynamics hyperbolicity. Crucially, the proposed method requires significantly less computational effort and minimizes memory usage by eliminating the need for explicit CLV computation. We test our method on two canonical systems: the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation and a diffusively coupled chain of Lorenz oscillators. For the former, the results confirm the accuracy of the new approach by matching prior dimension estimates. For the latter, the analysis demonstrates the absence of a low-dimensional inertial manifold, highlighting a complex regime that merits further investigation. The presented method offers a practical and efficient tool for characterizing high-dimensional attractors in extended dynamical systems.</description>

      <title>Error Analysis of Generalized Langevin Equations with Approximated Memory Kernels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze prediction error in stochastic dynamical systems with memory, focusing on generalized Langevin equations (GLEs) formulated as stochastic Volterra equations. We establish that, under a strongly convex potential, trajectory discrepancies decay at a rate determined by the decay of the memory kernel and are quantitatively bounded by the estimation error of the kernel in a weighted norm. Our analysis integrates synchronized noise coupling with a Volterra comparison theorem, encompassing both subexponential and exponential kernel classes. For first-order models, we derive moment and perturbation bounds using resolvent estimates in weighted spaces. For second-order models with confining potentials, we prove contraction and stability under kernel perturbations using a hypocoercive Lyapunov-type distance. This framework accommodates non-translation-invariant kernels and white-noise forcing, explicitly linking improved kernel estimation to enhanced trajectory prediction. Numerical examples validate these theoretical findings.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10455v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Using valuative techniques, we show that a smooth affine surface with a non-elementary automorphism group and completable by a cycle of rational curves is either the algebraic torus or a smooth cubic affine surface of Markov type. Furthermore we show that smooth cubic affine surfaces of Markov type do no admit dominant endomorphisms which are not automorphisms.</description>

      <title>Algebraic approach to the inverse spectral problem for rational matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider the problem of reconstruction of an $n\times n$ matrix with coefficients depending rationally on $x\in \mathbb P^1$ from the data of: (a) its characteristic polynomial and (b) a line bundle of degree $g+n-1$, with $g$ the geometric genus of the spectral curve, represented by a choice of $g+n+1$ points forming a (non-positive) divisor of the given degree.
  We thus provide a reconstruction formula that does not involve transcendental functions; this includes formulas for the spectral projectors and for the change of line bundle, thus integrating the isospectral flows.
  The formula is a single residue formula which depends rationally on the coordinates of the points involved, the coefficients of the spectral curve, and the position of the finite poles of $L$. We also discuss the canonical bi-differential associated with the Lax matrix and its relationship with other bi-differentials that appear in Topological Recursion and integrable systems.</description>

Abstract: This paper establishes robust obstructions to representing Hamiltonian diffeomorphisms as $k$-th powers ($k \geq 2$) or embedding them in flows for certain higher-dimensional symplectic manifolds $(M,\omega)$, including surface bundles. We prove that in the Hamiltonian group $(\mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega), d_H)$ equipped with the Hofer metric, there exist arbitrarily large balls that are disjoint from the set of $k$-th powers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the free group on two generators embeds into every asymptotic cone of $(\mathrm{Ham}(M,\omega), d_H)$, revealing the large-scale geometric complexity of the Hamiltonian group.</description>

Abstract: We prove the holding of chaos in the sense of Li-Yorke for a family of four-dimensional discrete dynamical systems that are naturally associated to ODEs systems describing coupled oscillators subject to an external nonconservative force, also giving an example of a discrete map that is Li-Yorke chaotic but not topologically transitive. Analytical results are generalized to a modular definition of the problem and to a system of nonlinear oscillators described by polynomial potentials in one coordinate. We perform numerical simulations looking for a strange attractor of the system; furthermore, we present the bifurcation diagram and perform a bifurcation analysis of the system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10569v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present analytical and numerical results on integrability and transition to chaotic motion for a generalized Ziegler pendulum, a double pendulum subject to an angular elastic potential and a follower force. Several variants of the original dynamical system, including the presence of gravity and friction, are considered, in order to analyze whether the integrable cases are preserved or not in presence of further external forces, both potential and non-potential. Particular attention is devoted to the presence of dissipative forces, that are analyzed in two different formulations. Furthermore, a study of the discrete version is performed. The analysis of periodic points, that is presented up to period 3, suggests that the discrete map associated to the dynamical system has not dense sets of periodic points, so that the map would not be chaotic in the sense of Devaney for a choice of the parameters that corresponds to a general case of chaotic motion for the original system.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10612v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research investigates the coupled dynamics of behavior and infectious disease using a mathematical model. We integrate a two-state q-voter opinion process with SIS-type infection dynamics, where transmission rates are influenced by the opinion and an infection-induced switching mechanism represents individuals reassessing their behav- ior upon infection. Analytically, we derive conditions for the stability of endemic and disease-free equilibria. Numerical simulations reveal complex dynamics: above a certain infectivity threshold, the system can exhibit alternative basins of attraction leading to a balanced endemic fixed point or stable limit cycles. Notably, the dominant asymptotic opinion and resulting epidemiological outcomes show non-monotonic relationships with infectivity, highlighting the potential for adaptive behavior to induce complex system dynamics. These findings underscore the critical role of social interventions; shifts in behavioral norms and trust can permanently alter epidemic outcomes, suggesting that such interventions are as crucial as biomedical controls</description>

      <title>Melnikov Method for a Class of Generalized Ziegler Pendulums</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.10682v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Melnikov method is applied to a class of generalized Ziegler pendulums. We find an analytical form for the separatrix of the system in terms of Jacobian elliptic integrals, holding for a large class of initial conditions and parameters. By working in Duffing approximation, we apply the Melnikov method to the original Ziegler system, showing that the first non-vanishing Melnikov integral appears in the second order. An explicit expression for the Melnikov integral is derived in the presence of a time-periodic external force and for a suitable choice of the parameters, as well as in the presence of a dissipative term acting on the lower rod of the pendulum. These results allow us to define fundamental relationships between the Melnikov integral and a proper control parameter that distinguishes between regular and chaotic orbits for the original dynamical system. Finally, in the appendix, we present proof of a conjecture concerning the non-validity of Devaney's chaoticity definition for a discrete map associated with the system.</description>

      <title>Two-Dimensional Projective Collapse and Sharp Distortion Bounds for Products of Positive Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.10872v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We introduce an elementary framework that captures the mechanism driving the alignment of rows and columns in products of positive matrices. All worst-case misalignment occurs already in dimension two, leading to an explicit collapse principle and a sharp nonlinear bound for finite products. The proof avoids Hilbert-metric and cone-theoretic techniques, relying instead on basic calculus. In the Hilbert metric, the classical Birkhoff-Bushell contraction captures only the linearized asymptotic regime, whereas our nonlinear envelope function gives the exact worst-case behavior for finite products.</description>

      <title>Khintchine dichotomy for self-similar measures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08061</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.08061v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We establish the analogue of Khintchine's theorem for all self-similar probability measures on the real line. When specified to the case of the Hausdorff measure on the middle-thirds Cantor set, the result is already new and provides an answer to an old question of Mahler. The proof consists in showing effective equidistribution in law of expanding upper-triangular random walks on $\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})/\text{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{Z})$, a result of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Almost sure convergence of differentially positive systems on a globally orderable Riemannian manifold</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.11895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differentially positive systems are the nonlinear systems whose linearization along trajectories preserves a cone field on a smooth Riemannian manifold. One of the embryonic forms for cone fields in reality is originated from the general relativity. Out of a set of measure zero, we show that almost every orbits will converge to equilibrium. This solved a reduced version (from a measure-theoretic perspective) of Forni-Sepulchre's conjecture in 2016 for globally orderable manifolds.</description>

      <title>Threshold Graphs Are Globally Synchronizing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12646</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.12646v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The Kuramoto model describes phase oscillators on the unit circle whose interactions are encoded by a graph. Each edge acts like a spring that pulls the two adjacent oscillators toward each other whenever their phases differ. A central question is to determine which graphs are globally synchronizing, meaning that trajectories of the Kuramoto dynamics converge to the fully synchronized state from almost all initial conditions, except for a set of measure zero. This property is tightly linked to the benign nonconvexity of the model's energy landscape. Existing guarantees for global synchronization rely on minimum-degree thresholds, which require the graph to be highly dense. In this work, we show that connected threshold graphs, whose density may vary from $2/n$ to $1$, are globally synchronizing. Our proof relies on a phasor-geometric analysis of the stationary points of the associated energy landscape.</description>

      <title>Dual Representations and $H_{\infty}$-Optimal Control of Partial Differential Equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.13104</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.13104v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We consider $\hinf$-optimal state-feedback control of the class of linear Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) which admit a Partial Integral Equation (PIE) representation. While linear matrix inequalities are commonly used for optimal control of Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs), the absence of a universal state-space representation and suitable dual form prevents such methods from being applied to optimal control of PDEs. Specifically, for ODEs, the controller synthesis problem is defined in state-space, and duality is used to resolve the bilinearity of that synthesis problem. Recently, the PIE representation was proposed as a universal state-space representation for linear PDE systems. In this paper, we show that any PDE system represented by a PIE admits a dual PIE with identical stability and I/O properties. This result allows us to reformulate the stabilizing and optimal state-feedback control problems as convex optimization over the cone of positive Partial Integral (PI) operators. Operator inversion formulae then allow us to construct feedback gains for the original PDE system. The results are verified through application to several canonical problems in optimal control of PDEs and indicate the resulting bounds on $\hinf$ norm are not conservative.</description>

      <title>Long-Duration Station-Keeping Strategy for Cislunar Spacecraft Formations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.19620v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper demonstrates a novel guidance and control strategy for cislunar near-rectilinear halo orbit formation-keeping applied to high-fidelity dynamics. Bounded relative motion is constructed about long-duration ephemeris trajectories with osculating invariant circles to form quasi-periodic relative orbits. State-of-the-art absolute control strategies are paired with a simple and effective relative control feedback law. Finally, a control barrier function is implemented to ensure recursively passively-safe bounded relative motion under feedback in the presence of possible missed maneuver events for the duration of the formation flight. The strategy is verified in high-fidelity simulation environments through Monte Carlo trials.</description>
