      <title>Modeling Finite Deformations in Alloying Electrodes -- A Closer Look at Cracks and Pores During Phase Transformation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19982</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19982v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nanostructured electrodes with voids or interconnected pores accommodate large volume changes, shorten ion diffusion pathways, and enhance the structural reversibility of alloying electrodes. While these nanoporous features improve the performance of architected electrodes over bulk electrodes, they also act as geometric irregularities that localize and concentrate internal stresses. In this work, we investigate the hierarchical interplay between phase boundaries and nanoporous features at the microstructural scale and their collective role in mitigating chemo-mechanical failure at the engineering scale. Using Sb$\to$Li$_2$Sb$\to$Li$_3$Sb as a model system, we develop a continuum framework coupling lithium diffusion and reaction kinetics with the finite deformation of alloying electrodes. We analytically show that large volume changes in the Sb$\rightarrow$Li$_2$Sb transformation induce fracture, which nanoporous geometries can mitigate. Building on this, we develop a micromechanical model using a hyper-elastic neo-Hookean material law to predict the deformations accompanying the Li$_2$Sb$\to$Li$_3$Sb transformation. Our results reveal how diffusion and reaction kinetics shape phase boundary morphology, identify crack geometries likely to propagate, and show how carefully architected electrodes relieve stresses. These findings highlight critical design principles to optimize electrode lifespan and demonstrate a potential application of our continuum model as an electrode design tool.</description>

      <title>Boron Fullerenes: From Theoretical Predictions to Experimental Reality</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20032</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20032v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of boron fullerenes and two-dimensional boron sheets, unified under a coordination-based framework. By classifying over a dozen boron nanostructures, including B$_{12}$, B$_{40}$, B$_{65}$, B$_{80}$, and B$_{92}$, according to their local atomic environments (4-, 5-, and 6-fold coordination), we identify clear trends in structural stability, electronic properties, and magnetism. A universal energetic scaling relation $E_c(n) = a/n^b + E_c^{sheet}$ (with $b \approx 1$) captures the convergence of fullerene cohesive energies toward those of 2D boron phases. Notably, we establish one-to-one structural correspondences between select cages and experimentally accessible borophenes: B$_{40}$ mirrors the $\chi_3$-sheet, B$_{65}$ the $\beta_{12}$-sheet, B$_{80}$ the $\alpha$-sheet, and B$_{92}$ the $bt$-sheet. These clusters also exhibit large HOMO-LUMO gaps (e.g., $E_g = 1.78$ eV for B$_{40}$, 1.14 eV for B$_{92}$), contrasting with the metallicity of their 2D counterparts and, in the case of B$_{65}$, spontaneous spin polarization ($M = 3 \, \mu_B$). Our findings provide a predictive strategy for designing boron nanostructures by leveraging coordination fingerprints, and are further validated by the recent experimental synthesis of the B$_{80}$ cage. This work bridges zero- and two-dimensional boron chemistry, offering a roadmap for the future synthesis and application of boron-based materials.</description>

      <title>Epitaxial Stabilization and Emergent Charge Order in Copper Selenide Thin Films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20076v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate epitaxial growth of copper selenide (Cu$_{2-x}$Se) thin films in both cubic and rhombohedral phases, achieved via molecular beam epitaxy on Al$_2$O$_3$ (001) substrates. Remarkably, the high-temperature cubic phase -- which in bulk transforms into the rhombohedral structure below 400 K -- is stabilized at room temperature and below, well outside its bulk equilibrium stability range. In the cubic phase films, temperature-dependent electrical transport reveals a pronounced, hysteretic resistivity peak near 140 K, accompanied by unit cell doubling along the [111] direction, as observed by x-ray diffraction, which are hallmarks of a charge density wave (CDW) transition. First-principles calculations show strong Fermi surface nesting in the cubic phase, consistent with the observed CDW instability. In contrast, the rhombohedral films exhibit suppressed nesting and no structural modulation. These results not only unambiguously identify a previously unreported CDW in Cu$_{2-x}$Se thin films, but also establish an epitaxial platform for tuning emergent electronic phases via strain and interface engineering.</description>

      <title>Observation of Berry Curvature-Enhanced Anomalous Photo-Nernst Effect in Magnetic Weyl Semimetal</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20180</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20180v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The anomalous Nernst effect is the thermoelectric counterpart of the anomalous Hall effect, which can emerge in magnetic materials or topological materials without magnetic field. Such effect is critical to both fundamental topological physics and various application fields, including energy harvesting, spintronics and optoelectronics. In this work, we observe the anomalous photo-Nernst effect, which use light excitation to generate temperature gradients for the thermoelectric response. Our experiments reveal a pronounced edge photocurrent response in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2 under zero magnetic field, originating from the anomalous photo-Nernst effect. The pronounced photo-Nernst current benefits from the exceptional properties of Co3Sn2S2, including the large thermoelectric coefficient, topologically enhanced anomalous response of Weyl bands and the Shockley-Ramo nature of long-range photocurrent generation. Furthermore, by comparing the nominal anomalous Nernst coefficient under different wavelength excitations, we observe a clear enhancement in the mid-infrared region, originating from the topological contribution from the large Berry curvature of Weyl bands. Our results reveal the interplay among light, magnetism, and topological order in magnetic Weyl semimetals, which not only offers insights for fundamental physics but also advances potential applications in quantum devices.</description>

      <title>High mechanical strength Si anode synthesis with interlayer bonded expanded graphite structure for lithium-ion batteries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20189</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20189v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Despite advancements in silicon-based anodes for high-capacity lithium-ion batteries, their widespread commercial adoption is still hindered by significant volume expansion during cycling, especially at high active mass loadings crucial for practical use. The root of these challenges lies in the mechanical instability of the material, which subsequently leads to the structural failure of the electrode. Here, we present a novel synthesis of a composite combining expanded graphite and silicon nanoparticles. This composite features a unique interlayer-bonded graphite structure, achieved through the application of a modified spark plasma sintering method. Notably, this innovative structure not only facilitates efficient ion and electron transport but also provides exceptional mechanical strength (Vickers hardness: up to 658 MPa, Young's modulus: 11.6 GPa). This strength effectively accommodates silicon expansion, resulting in an impressive areal capacity of 2.9 mA h cm-2 (736 mA h g-1) and a steady cycle life (93% after 100 cycles). Such outstanding performance is paired with features appropriate for large-scale industrial production of silicon batteries, such as active mass loading of at least 3.9 mg cm-2, a high-tap density electrode material of 1.68 g cm-3 (secondary clusters: 1.12 g cm-3), and a production yield of up to 1 kg per day.</description>

      <title>Interfacial reconstruction effects in insulating double perovskite Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$/SrTiO$_3$ and Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$/NdGaO$_3$ thin films</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20264</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20264v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferromagnetic insulating (FMI) double perovskite oxides (DPOs) $A_2BB'$O$_6$ with near-room-temperature Curie temperatures are promising candidates for ambient-temperature spintronics applications. To realize their potential, epitaxial stabilization of DPO films and understanding the effect of multiple broken symmetries across the film/substrate interface are crucial. This study investigates ultrathin films of the FMI Nd$_2$NiMnO$_6$ (NNMO) grown on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and NdGaO$_3$ (NGO) substrates. By comparing growth on these substrates, we examine the influence of polarity and structural symmetry mismatches, which are absent in the NGO system. The interface exhibits immeasurable resistance in both cases. Using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, we show that films have three octahedral rotational domains because of the structural symmetry mismatch with the STO substrate. Furthermore, our coherent Bragg rod analysis of specular X-ray diffraction reveals a significant modification of the out-of-plane lattice parameter within a few unit cells at the film/substrate interface and the surface. This arises from polarity compensation and surface symmetry breaking, respectively. These structural alterations influence the Mn orbital symmetry, a dependence that we further confirm through X-ray linear dichroism measurements. Since the ferromagnetism in insulating DPOs is mediated by orbital-dependent superexchange interactions [Phys. Rev. Lett. 100, 186402 (2008)], our study provides a framework for understanding the evolution of magnetism in ultrathin geometry.</description>

      <title>Two-dimensional transition metal selenides family M2Se: A platform for superconductivity, band topology, and charge density waves</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20265v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: MXenes and MBenes, which are two-dimensional (2D) transition metal carbides/nitrides and borides, have been extensively studied for their impressive properties. Recently, we reported a family of transition metal sulfides MSene (M2S) with rich properties [Phys. Rev. B 111, L041404 (2025)], it is worth studying whether selenides with similar structure also have rich properties. In this work, through high-throughput screening, we present a novel family of 2D transition metal selenides, M2Se. In this family, there are fifty-eight candidate materials, of which ten are stable and metallic. Notably, eight exhibit superconductivity, among which four are superconducting topological metals. Besides, eight show charge density wave (CDW) behavior, among which five also exhibit antiferromagnetism. It is revealed that CDW originates from electron-phonon coupling rather than Fermi surface nesting. Moreover, strain can be applied to regulate the competition between CDW and superconductivity. Our findings reveal the rich properties of superconductivity, band topology, CDW, and magnetism in M2Se, providing a new platform for the controllable integration of multifunctional quantum states.</description>

      <title>Graphene structure modification under tritium exposure: 3H chemisorption dominates over defect formation by \b{eta}-radiation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20304</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20304v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Potential structural modifications of graphene exposed to gaseous tritium are important for membrane-based hydrogen isotope separation. Such modifications cannot be explained by electron irradiation alone. Instead, tritiation, caused by the tritium radicals remaining after the decay, is the primary effect causing the modification of the graphene surface, as confirmed by confocal Raman spectroscopy. The effect of the interaction of tritium atoms with the graphene surface exceeds that of electron irradiation at the average energy of the beta particles (5.7 keV). Compared to previously investigated high electron doses in the absence of tritium, remarkably low concentrations of tritium already induce a significant amount of sp3- and vacancy-type defects at short exposure times. Our findings are supported by molecular dynamics simulations of graphene bombardment with tritium atoms. As a consequence, tritium saturation of graphene may alter its permeability for hydrogen isotopes, thus affecting potential applications.</description>

      <title>Computational study of geometry, electronic structure and low-lying excited states of linear T-graphene quantum dots</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20346v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A few years ago, by means of first-principles calculations, Enyashin et al.(2011) proposed several novel monolayers of carbon containing rings other than hexagons. One of those monolayers containing tetragons and octagons was investigated later in detail by Liu et al.(2012) who called it T-graphene, and found that it exists both in strictly planar and buckled forms, with the planar structure being metallic in nature. Given the fact that Kotakoski et al.(2011) had already found experimental evidence of 1D carbon structures containing tetragons and octagons, we decided to investigate finite linear fragments of T-graphene, with the strictly planar structures, referred to as T-graphene quantum dots (TQDs). In order to avoid the dangling bonds in the finite T-graphene fragments, we considered the edges to be saturated by hydrogen atoms. We first optimized the geometries of the considered TQDs using a first-principles density-functional theory (DFT) methodology, followed by calculations of their linear optical absorption spectra using the time-dependent DFT (TDDFT) approach. Given the fact that strictly planar T-graphene structures will have $\sigma$-$\pi$ separation with the $\pi$ electrons near the Fermi level, we also parameterized an effective $\pi$-electron Hamiltonian for TQDs, similar to the Pariser-Parr-Pople model for $\pi$-conjugated molecules. We further used the effective Hamiltonian to perform high-order electron-correlated calculations using the configuration interaction (CI) approach to compute the optical absorption spectra of TQDs, and also their singlet-triplet gaps. The symmetry analysis reveals that TQDs are photoluminescent materials. Moreover, in all the TQDs HOMO-LUMO transition is optically forbidden, the optical gaps of these molecules are quite large, suggesting the intriguing possibility of the fission of a singlet optical exciton into several triplet excitons.</description>

      <title>Thermal excitation of flexoelectricity in silicon</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20379</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20379v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Flexoelectricity, an electromechanical coupling between strain gradient and polarization, offers a promising dimension to enrich silicon-based devices. Although the flexoelectricity of silicon is known, some fundamental aspects remain ambiguous, such as the discrepancy between experimental results and theoretical predictions, the influence of doping concentration, and the role of the bandgap. Here, we measured the flexoelectricity of intrinsic and heavily doped Si over the temperature range of 223 -473 K. The flexoelectric coefficient is of 2.6 {\mu}C/m and barely varies with temperature in doped silicon, while in intrinsic silicon it varies by nearly two orders of magnitude from 15.2 nC/m to 1.8 {\mu}C/m as temperature increases. We show that their different temperature dependencies correspond to the temperature-insensitive donor ionization in doped silicon and the temperature-sensitive intrinsic excitation in intrinsic silicon, with the latter captured by a quantitative relationship between flexoelectricity, temperature and bandgap. Furthermore, similar experimental results on germanium (Ge) suggest the universality of this relationship in first-generation semiconductors. These findings would offer valuable reference for developing Si-based electromechanical devices, as well as understanding the strain-gradient effects on semiconductor band structures (flexoelectronics).</description>

      <title>Multiscale modeling of hydrogen diffusion in iron considering the effect of dislocations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20439</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modeling hydrogen diffusion and its absorption in traps is a fundamental first step towards the understanding and prediction of hydrogen embrittlement. In this study, a multiscale approach which includes DFT simulations, OkMC, and phase-field dislocations, is developed to study the movement of hydrogen atoms in alpha-iron crystals containing dislocations. At the nanoscale the interaction energies of hydrogen on different sites of the iron lattice are studied using DFT. At the microscale, this information is used to feed a lattice object kinetic Monte Carlo code (OKMC) which aims to evolve the arrangement of a large set of hydrogen atoms into the iron lattice considering point defects and the presence of dislocations. At the continuum level, an array of dislocations is introduced using a phase-field approach to accurately consider their elastic fields and core regions. The OKMC model includes both the chemical energies of H and vacancies and the elastic interactions between these point defects and the dislocations. The elastic interaction is obtained by an FFT-based approach which allows a very efficient computation of the elastic microfields created by the defects in an anisotropic medium. The framework has been used to obtain the diffusivity tensor of hydrogen as a function of the external stress state, temperature, and the presence of dislocations. It has been found that dislocations strongly affect the diffusivity tensor by breaking its isotropy and reducing its value by the effect of the microstresses around the dislocations.</description>

      <title>Interplay of magnetic ordering and charge transport in a distorted ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type GdZn$_3$As$_3$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20454</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20454v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the synthesis and characterization of GdZn$_3$As$_3$, a previously unreported variant of the $RM_3X_3$ family ($R$ = lanthanides; $M$ = Zn, Cd; $X$ = P, As), prepared in both single-crystal and polycrystalline forms. Unlike other $RM_3X_3$ compounds that crystallize in undistorted hexagonal structures, GdZn$_3$As$_3$ adopts a distorted ScAl$_3$C$_3$-type orthorhombic structure with $Cmcm$ space group. Magnetic measurements demonstrate that GdZn$_3$As$_3$ undergoes a ferromagnetic transition at the Curie temperature ($T_{\mathrm{C}}$) of 6.3~K, which is unique among known $RM_3X_3$ materials. This magnetic transition is further confirmed by specific heat and electrical resistivity measurements. GdZn$_3$As$_3$ displays metallic behavior with a pronounced resistivity peak near $T_{\mathrm{C}}$, which is strongly suppressed by magnetic fields, leading to significant negative magnetoresistance. Hall effect measurements reveal a low carrier density and a clear nonlinear anomalous Hall effect in GdZn$_3$As$_3$. Furthermore, both specific heat and resistivity data suggest the presence of additional magnetic transition(s) below $T_{\mathrm{C}}$, requiring further investigation. These results demonstrate that GdZn$_3$As$_3$ possesses distinct structural, magnetic, and electronic transport properties within the $RM_3X_3$ family, establishing it as an exceptional platform for investigating competing magnetic interactions in low-carrier-density rare-earth triangular-lattice systems.</description>

      <title>Conditions for thermoelectric power factor improvements upon band alignment in complex bandstructure materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20461</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20461v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Band alignment (or band convergence) is a strategy suggested to provide improvements in the thermoelectric power factor (PF) of materials with complex bandstructures. The addition of more bands at the energy region that contributes to transport, can provide more conducting paths and could improve the electrical conductivity and PF of a material. However, this can lead to increased inter-valley scattering, which will tend to degrade the conductivity. Using the Boltzmann Transport Equation (BTE) and a multi-band model, we theoretically investigate the conditions under which band alignment can improve the PF. We show that PF improvements are realized when intra-band scattering between the aligned bands dominates over inter-band scattering, with larger improvements reached when a light-band is brought into alignment. In the more realistic scenario of intra-and inter-band scattering co-existence, we show that in the light band alignment case, possibilities of PF improvement are present even down to the level where the intra- and inter-band scattering are of similar strength. For heavy band alignment this tolerance is weaker, and weaker inter-band scattering is necessary to realize PF improvements. On the other hand, when inter-band scattering dominates, it is not possible to realize any PF improvements upon band alignment, irrespective of bringing a light or a heavy band into alignment. Overall, to realize PF improvements upon band alignment, the valleys that are brought into alignment need to be as electrically conducting as possible compared to the lower energy base valleys and interact as little as possible with those.</description>

      <title>Visualizing intercalation effects in 2D materials using AFM based techniques</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20467</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20467v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Intercalation of two dimensional materials, particularly transition metal dichalcogenides, is a noninvasive way to modify electronic, optical and structural properties of these materials. However, research of these atomic-scale phenomena usually relies on using Ultra High Vacuum techniques which is time consuming, expensive and spatially limited. Here we utilize Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) based techniques to visualize local structural and electronic changes of the MoS2 on graphene on Ir(111), caused by sulfur intercalation. AFM topography reveals structural changes, while phase imaging and mechanical measurements show reduced Young's modulus and adhesion. Kelvin Probe Force Microscopy highlights variations in surface potential and work function, aligning with intercalation signatures, while Photoinduced Force Microscopy detects enhanced optical response in intercalated regions. These results demonstrate the efficacy of AFM based techniques in mapping intercalation, offering insights into tailoring 2D materials electronic and optical properties. This work underscores the potential of AFM techniques for advanced material characterization and the development of 2D material applications.</description>

      <title>High-Frequency and Microwave Magnetic Properties of Ni$_{0.5}$Zn$_{0.5}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ Spinel Ferrite Ceramics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20477</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20477v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Magnetic properties of the Ni$_{0.5}$Zn$_{0.5}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ (NZF) spinel ferrite ceramics were studied over a broad frequency range (1 MHz - 50 GHz). Between 10 MHz and 2 GHz, strong temperature-dependent resonance-like magnetic permeability dispersion was observed and attributed to the magnetic domain-wall dynamics. It is responsible for the high magnetic losses, absorption and shielding ability of NZF, and provides high nonlinearity and tunability of the permeability under a weak magnetic field. The attenuation constant of NZF is comparable to those of dielectric-conductor composites and giant permittivity materials. In the microwave range (2-50 GHz), three magnetic excitations dependent on a weak magnetic field were revealed and related to magnons. The lowest-frequency magnon (&lt;10 GHz) is attributed to the natural ferromagnetic resonance, two others are excited between 28 and 44 GHz. Interaction of the magnons and magneto-dielectric resonance modes with electromagnetic waves provides high absorption and shielding efficiency in the GHz range, including 5G and 6G communication frequencies.</description>

      <title>Direct Observation of Hot Spots in Ferroelectric Domain Wall Devices by Scanning Thermal Microscopy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20591</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20591v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ferroelectric domain wall devices offer a promising route to low voltage, reconfigurable nanoelectronics by confining currents to nanoscale conducting interfaces within an insulating bulk. However, resistive heating due to domain wall conduction still remains unexplored. Here, we employ scanning thermal microscopy to directly image hot spots in thin-film lithium niobate domain wall devices. Piezoresponse force microscopy shows that the hot spots correlate with nanodomain structure and thermal mapping reveals surface temperature rises of up to ~ 20 K, levels that are unlikely to negatively affect device performance. This is due to the moderate conductivity of domain walls, their voltage-tunable erasure, and distributed current pathways, which inherently limit power dissipation and peak temperatures. Finite element electrothermal modelling indicates that domain walls behave as pseudo-planar heat sources, distinct from filament-based models. These findings highlight the potential for domain wall devices as an energy-efficient, thermally stable platform for emerging memory and logic applications.</description>

      <title>Modeling phase transformations in Mn-rich disordered rocksalt cathodes with charge-informed machine-learning interatomic potentials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20605v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mn-rich disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathode materials exhibit a phase transformation from a disordered to a partially disordered spinel-like structure ($\delta$-phase) during electrochemical cycling. In this computational study, we used charge-informed molecular dynamics with a fine-tuned CHGNet foundation potential to investigate the phase transformation in Li$_{x}$Mn$_{0.8}$Ti$_{0.1}$O$_{1.9}$F$_{0.1}$. Our results indicate that transition metal migration occurs and reorders to form the spinel-like ordering in an FCC anion framework. The transformed structure contains a higher concentration of non-transition metal (0-TM) face-sharing channels, which are known to improve Li transport kinetics. Analysis of the Mn valence distribution suggests that the appearance of tetrahedral Mn$^{2+}$ is a consequence of spinel-like ordering, rather than the trigger for cation migration as previously believed. Calculated equilibrium intercalation voltage profiles demonstrate that the $\delta$-phase, unlike the ordered spinel, exhibits solid-solution signatures during the 0-TM to Li$_{\text{tet}}$ conversion reaction. A higher Li capacity is obtained than in the DRX phase. This study provides atomic insights into solid-state phase transformation and its relation to experimental electrochemistry, highlighting the potential of charge-informed machine learning interatomic potentials for understanding complex oxide materials.</description>

      <title>Reducing Self-Interaction Error in Transition-Metal Oxides with Different Exact-Exchange Fractions for Energy and Density</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20635</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20635v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: DFT is vital for materials discovery, and at the base of extensive molecular and materials databases, chemical reaction predictions, and machine learning potentials. The widespread use of DFT in chemistry and materials science aims for "chemical accuracy," but this is limited by the unknown exchange and correlation (XC) functional. A meta-GGA, the restored regularized strongly constrained and appropriately normed, r r2SCAN XC functional, fulfils 17 exact constraints of the XC energy. r2SCAN still appears inadequate at predicting material properties of strongly correlated compounds. Inaccuracies of r2SCAN arise from functional and density-driven errors, linked to the self-interaction error. We introduce a new method, r2SCANY@r2SCANX, for simulating transition metal oxides accurately. r2SCANY@r2SCANX utilizes different fractions of exact exchange: X to set the electronic density, and Y to set the energy density functional approximation. r2SCANY@r2SCANX addresses functional-driven and density-driven inaccuracies. Using just one or two universal parameters, r2SCANY@r2SCANX enhances the r2SCAN predictions of the properties of 18 correlated oxides, outperforming the highly parameterized DFT+U method. The O2 overbinding in r2SCAN (~0.3 eV/O2) reduces to just ~0.03 eV/O$_2$ with any X in r2SCAN10@r2SCANX. Uncertainties for oxide oxidation energies and magnetic moments are reduced by r2SCAN10@r2SCAN50, minimizing r2SCAN density-driven errors. The computationally efficient r2SCAN10@r2SCAN is nearly as accurate as the hybrid r2SCAN10 for oxidation energies. Thus, accurate energy differences can be achieved by rate-limiting self-consistent iterations and geometry optimizations with the efficient r2SCAN. Subsequently, expensive hybrid functionals can be applied in a fast-to-execute single post-self-consistent calculation, as in r2SCAN10@r2SCAN, which is 10 to 300 times faster than r2SCAN10.</description>

      <title>Artificial Symmetry Breaking by Self-Interaction Error</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20662</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20662v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Symmetry is a cornerstone of quantum mechanics and materials theory, underpinning the classification of electronic states and the emergence of complex phenomena such as magnetism and superconductivity. While symmetry breaking in density functional theory can reveal strong electron correlation, it may also arise spuriously from self-interaction error (SIE), an intrinsic flaw in many approximate exchange-correlation functionals. In this work, we present clear evidence that SIE alone can induce artificial symmetry breaking, even in the absence of strong correlation. Using a family of one-electron, multi-nuclear-center systems \( \mathrm{H}^+_{n \times \frac{+2}{n}}(R) \), we show that typical semilocal density functionals exhibit symmetry-breaking localization as system size increases, deviating from the exact, symmetry-preserving Hartree-Fock solution. We further demonstrate that this localization error contrasts with the well-known delocalization error of semilocal density functionals and design a semilocal density functional that avoids the artifact. Finally, we illustrate the real-world relevance of this effect in the \ch{Ti_{Zn}v_O} defect in ZnO, where a semilocal density functional breaks the $C_{3v}$ symmetry while a hybrid density functional preserves it. These findings highlight the need for improved functional design to prevent spurious symmetry breaking in both model and real materials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.19905v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We perform the first high-throughput search and evaluation of materials that can serve as excellent low-mass dark matter detectors. Using properties of close to one thousand materials from the Materials Project database, we project the sensitivity in dark matter parameter space for experiments constructed from each material, including both absorption and scattering processes between dark matter and electrons. Using the anisotropic materials in the dataset, we further compute the level of daily modulation in interaction rates and the resulting directional sensitivities, highlighting materials with prospects to detect the dark matter wind. Our methods provide the basic tools for the data-driven design of dark matter detectors, and our findings lay the groundwork for the next generation of highly optimized direct searches for dark matter as light as the keV scale.</description>

      <title>Gear-based Metamaterials for Extraordinary Bandgap Tunability</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20110</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20110v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metamaterials can be engineered with tunable bandgaps to adapt to dynamic and complex environments, particularly for controlling elastic waves and vibration. However, achieving wide-range, seamless, reversible, in-situ and robust tunability remains challenging and often impractical due to limitations in bandgap mechanisms and design principles. Here, we introduce gear-based metamaterials with unprecedented bandgap tunability. Our approach leverages Taiji planetary gear systems as variable-frequency local resonators, which allows the metamaterial to seamlessly modulate its bandgap's center frequency by 3-7 times (e.g. shifting from 250-430 Hz to 1400-2000 Hz), surpassing existing methods. Notably, this is achieved without pre-deformation or major changes to its static stiffness in the wave propagation direction, ensuring robust in-situ tunability and smooth control even under heavy static loads. This enables adaptable wave manipulation for versatile smart platforms.</description>

      <title>Staggered nonlinear spin generations in centrosymmetric altermagnets under electric current</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.20298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Current-induced spin generations are of significant importance for electrically controllable magnetization. Due to symmetry constraints, linear spin generation is absent in centrosymmetric magnets and nonlinear contributions become crucial. However, nonlinear spin generations have few examples in centrosymmetric compensated magnets with opposite-spin sublattices, which hinders electric control of associated magnetization. Here, we study nonlinear spin generations in altermagnets with opposite-spin sublattices. In a square altermagnetic model, both staggered and uniform nonlinear spin generations appear at opposite-spin sublattices. They vary as the magnetization direction rotates, with emerging out-of-plane components that can be utilized in perpendicular magnetization switching of high-density storage devices. By first-principles calculations, out-of-plane, staggered nonlinear spin generations are found to be considerable in a typical altermagnet, Fe$_2$Se$_2$O monolayer. Our findings provide opportunities for electrically manipulating magnetization and designing energy-efficient magnetic devices based on compensated magnets.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20366v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ultrafast pump-probe imaging reveals that the efficiency of optical excitation of coherent spins waves in epitaxial iron garnet films can be effectively controlled by an external electric field at room temperature. Although a femtosecond laser pulse alone does not excite any pronounced coherent spin oscillations, an electrical gating with the field of 0.5 MV/m dramatically changes the outcome in a laser-induced launching of spin waves. The effect, demonstrated under room-temperature conditions, is estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than in magnetic van der Waals semiconductors observed at 10 K. This electrical gating of laser-induced spin dynamics enriches opto-magnonics with a new tool and thus opens up a new avenue in fundamental and applied magnonics research.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20465v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Germanium nanostructures offer significant potential in developing advanced integrated circuit and disruptive quantum technologies, yet achieving both scalability and high carrier mobility remains a challenge in materials science. Here, we report an original low-temperature epitaxial method for growth of site-controlled in-plane germanium nanowires with high hole mobility by molecular beam epitaxy. By reducing the growth temperature, we effectively suppress Si-Ge interdiffusion, ensuring pure germanium composition within the nanowires while preserving their high crystalline quality. The method employs pre-patterned ridges on strain-relaxed Si$_{0.75}$Ge$_{0.25}$/Si(001) substrates as tailored templates, enabling control over the position, length, spacing and cross-sectional shape of the nanowires. Electrical measurements of field-effect devices made from as-grown germanium nanowires show that the nanowires are of hole conduction with mobility exceeding 7000 cm$^{2}$/Vs at 2-20 K. The method paves a way for fabrication of scalable germanium nanowire networks, providing a reliable platform for the developments of high-performance nanoelectronics and multi-qubit chips.</description>

We construct model Hamiltonians adopting the crystal structure theoretically determined by fixing the in-plane lattice constant to those substrates examined in the experiment. We also construct a model based on the experimentally determined lattice structure. To the models obtained, we apply the fluctuation exchange approximation, which takes into account the full momentum and frequency dependencies of the Green function and the pairing interaction. We find that the electronic structure, including the presence/absence of the so-called $\gamma$-pocket (the Fermi surface originating from the top of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bonding band) depends on the crystal structure adopted and/or the presence/absence of $+U$ correction in the band structure calculation. Nonetheless, $s\pm$-wave pairing symmetry remains robust regardless of these details in the band structure. The robustness of the $s\pm$-wave pairing mainly owes to the large sign changing superconducting gap function of the $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ bands around $(k_x,k_y)=(0,0)$ and $(k_x,k_y)=(\pi,\pi)$, which originates from the finite energy spin fluctuations. On the other hand, $T_c$ being halved from that of the pressurized bulk can only be understood by adopting the model with small $|t_\perp|$ derived from the experimentally determined crystal structure, at least within the present FLEX approach, although there may remain some other possibilities beyond this approach for the origin of the reduced $T_c$.</description>

      <title>High-temperature helical edge states in BiSbTeSe$_2$/graphene van der Waals heterostructure</title>

Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have been used to tailor atomic layers into various artificial materials through interactions at heterointerfaces. The interplay between the band gap created by the band folding of the interfacial potential and the band inversion driven by enhanced spin-orbit interaction (SOI) through band hybridization enables us to realize a two-dimensional topological insulator (2D-TI). Here we report the realization of graphene 2D-TIs by epitaxial growth of three-dimensional topological insulator (3D-TI) BiSbTeSe$_2$ ultrathin films on graphene. By increasing the BiSbTeSe$_2$ thickness from 2 nm to 9 nm to enhance SOI on graphene, the electronic state is altered from the trivial Kekul${\'e}$ insulator to the 2D-TI. The nonlocal transport reveals the helical edge conduction which survives up to 200 K at maximum. Our graphene 2D-TI is stable, easy to make electrical contacts, and of high quality. It offers various applications including spin-current conversion and platforms for Majorana fermions in junctions to superconductors.</description>

      <title>Micromagnetic structure of oxidized magnetite nanoparticles: sharp structural versus diffuse magnetic interface</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.20571v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The oxidation of magnetite to maghemite is a naturally occurring process that leads to the degradation of the magnetic properties of magnetite nanoparticles. Despite being systematically observed with traditional macroscopic magnetization measurement techniques, a detailed understanding of this process at the microscale is still missing. In this study, we track the evolution of the magnetic structure of magnetite nanoparticles during their oxidation to maghemite through numerical micromagnetic simulations. To capture realistic interparticle effects, we incorporate dipolar interactions by modeling the nanoparticles arranged in chains. Our computational results are benchmarked against experimental data from magnetotactic bacteria, studied over a time scale of years. To resolve the magnetization at the interface between both oxide phases, we propose spin-polarized small-angle neutron scattering (SANS), an experimental technique capable of probing magnetization textures at nanometer length scales. By analyzing the pair-distance distribution function extracted from SANS, we identify distinct signatures of magnetic disorder. Specifically, our findings suggest that the magnetization from the non-oxidized core region varies smoothly across the (structurally sharp) interface into the oxidized shell. The existence of such a diffuse magnetic interface may account for the superior magnetic properties of partially oxidized magnetite nanoparticles compared to fully converted maghemite samples.</description>

Abstract: We present a general, systematic theory of electromagnetism and chirality in crystalline solids. Symmetry is its basic guiding principle, enabling us to consider macroscopic multipole densities without reference to any specific microscopic configurations. We use a formal analogy between space inversion $i$ and time inversion $\theta$ to identify two complementary, comprehensive classifications of crystals, based on five categories of electric and magnetic multipole order--called polarizations--and five categories of chirality. The five categories of polarizations (parapolar, electropolar, magnetopolar, antimagnetopolar, and multipolar) embody the ways in which electromagnetic multipole order can be realized in solids, thus expanding the familiar notion of electric dipolarization in ferroelectrics and magnetization in ferromagnets to higher-order multipole densities. The five categories of chirality (parachiral, electrochiral, magnetochiral, antimagnetochiral, and multichiral) extend the notion of enantiomorphism--conventionally associated with the lack of spatial mirror symmetries--to include all possibilities for creating non-superposable images by applying the inversions $i$, $\theta$, and $i\theta$. In particular, multichiral systems lack all inversion symmetries and thus have four different enantiomorphs. Each category of chirality arises from particular superpositions of electric and magnetic multipole densities. Jointly, the categories of polarizations and chirality yield a classification of all 122 magnetic point groups into 12 types that exhibit distinct physical properties and are identifiable by characteristic features in the electronic band structure that we elucidate in detail. The classification makes the formal equivalence of $i$, $\theta$, and $i\theta$ explicit and reveals striking correspondences between apparently dissimilar systems and their physical properties.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous achievement of large anomalous Nernst effect and reduced thermal conductivity in sintered polycrystalline topological Heusler ferromagnets</title>

      <description>arXiv:2501.09965v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study reports the observation of the large anomalous Nernst effect in polycrystalline ferromagnetic Co$_{2}$MnGa (CMG) slabs prepared by a spark plasma sintering method. By optimizing the sintering conditions, the anomalous Nernst coefficient reaches ~7.5 $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ at room temperature, comparable to the highest value reported in the single-crystalline CMG slabs. Owing to the sizable anomalous Nernst coefficient and reduced thermal conductivity, the dimensionless figure of merit in our optimized CMG slab shows the record-high value of ~8$\times$10$^{-4}$ at room temperature. With the aid of the nano/microstructure characterization and first-principles phonon calculation, this study discusses the dependence of the transport properties on the degree of crystalline ordering and morphology of crystal-domain boundaries in the sintered CMG slabs. The results reveal a potential of polycrystalline topological materials for transverse thermoelectric applications, enabling the construction of large-scale modules.</description>

      <title>WyckoffDiff -- A Generative Diffusion Model for Crystal Symmetry</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.06485v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fr\'echet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation. As a proof-of-concept study, we use WyckoffDiff to find new materials below the convex hull of thermodynamical stability.</description>

      <title>3D variational autoencoder for fingerprinting microstructure volume elements</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.17427v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Microstructure quantification is an important step towards establishing structure-property relationships in materials. Machine learning-based image processing methods have been shown to outperform conventional image processing techniques and are increasingly applied to microstructure quantification tasks. In this work, we present a 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) for encoding microstructure volume elements (VEs) comprising voxelated crystallographic orientation data. Crystal symmetries in the orientation space are accounted for by mapping to the crystallographic fundamental zone as a preprocessing step, which allows for a continuous loss function to be used and improves the training convergence rate. The VAE is then used to encode a training set of VEs with an equiaxed polycrystalline microstructure with random texture. Accurate reconstructions are achieved with a relative average misorientation error of 3x10^-2 on the test dataset, for a continuous latent space with dimension 256. We show that the model generalises well to microstructures with textures, grain sizes and aspect ratios outside the training distribution. Structure-property relationships are explored through using the training set of VEs as initial configurations in various crystal plasticity (CP) simulations. Microstructural fingerprints extracted from the VAE, which parameterise the VEs in a low-dimensional latent space, are stored alongside the volume-averaged stress response, at each strain increment, to uniaxial tensile deformation from CP simulations. This is then used to train a fully connected neural network mapping the input fingerprint to the resulting stress response, which acts as a surrogate model for the CP simulation. The fingerprint-based surrogate model is shown to accurately predict the microstructural dependence in the CP stress response, with a relative mean-squared error of 2.75 MPa on unseen test data.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2506.02833v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We discuss electron redistribution during the semiconductor-to-Dirac semimetal transition in Na-Sb-Bi alloys using x-ray Compton scattering experiments combined with first-principles electronic structure modeling. A robust signature of the semiconductor-to-Dirac semimetal transition is identified in the spherically averaged Compton profile. We demonstrate how the number of electrons involved in this transition can be estimated to provide a novel descriptor for quantifying the strength of spin-orbit coupling responsible for driving the transition. The associated theoretical deviation of the Born charge of Na in Na$_3$Bi from the expected ionic charge of +1 is found to be consistent with the corresponding experimental value of about 10%. Our study also shows the sensitivity of the Compton scattering technique toward capturing the spillover of Bi 6p relativistic states onto Na sites.</description>

      <title>Pressure-Driven Metallicity in {\AA}ngstr\"om-Thickness 2D Bismuth and Layer-Selective Ohmic Contact to MoS2</title>

      <description>arXiv:2506.05133v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent fabrication of two-dimensional (2D) metallic bismuth (Bi) via van der Waals (vdW) squeezing method opens a new avenue to ultrascaling metallic materials into the {\aa}ngstr\"om-thickness regime [Nature 639, 354 (2025)]. However, freestanding 2D Bi is typically known to exhibit a semiconducting phase [Nature 617, 67 (2023), Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 236801 (2023)], which contradicts with the experimentally observed metallicity in vdW-squeezed 2D Bi. Here we show that such discrepancy originates from the pressure-induced buckled-to-flat structural transition in 2D Bi, which changes the electronic structure from semiconducting to metallic phases. Based on the experimentally fabricated MoS2-Bi-MoS2 trilayer heterostructure, we demonstrate the concept of layer-selective Ohmic contact in which one MoS2 layer forms Ohmic contact to the sandwiched Bi monolayer while the opposite MoS2 layer exhibits a Schottky barrier. The Ohmic contact can be switched between the two sandwiching MoS2 monolayers by changing the polarity of an external gate field, thus enabling charge to be spatially injected into different MoS2 layers. The layer-selective Ohmic contact proposed here represents a layertronic generalization of metal/semiconductor contact, paving a way towards layertronic device application.</description>

Abstract: Vertically stacked heterojunctions have garnered significant attention for their tunable electronic structures and photocatalytic performance, making them promising candidates for next-generation nanodevices. Using first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the electronic structure, optical characteristics, and charge transfer of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions. Our results reveal that SeWS/monolayer-SiC, SeWS/bilayer-SiC, and SWSe/monolayer-SiC exhibit type-II band alignment, whereas SWSe/bilayer-SiC displays type-I alignment. Notably, SeWS/bilayer-SiC possesses a direct bandgap, in contrast to the indirect bandgaps of the other three configurations. Remarkably, the SeWS/bilayer-SiC heterojunction demonstrates a high absorption coefficient ($10^{5}~\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$) in the visible range and exhibits exceptional anisotropy in carrier transport, with an outstanding hole mobility of $9.58 \times 10^{3}~\mathrm{cm}^{2}\,\mathrm{V}^{-1}\,\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ along the Y-direction. Furthermore, combining thermodynamic stability with an S-scheme charge transfer mechanism, this system exhibits superior redox capability for photocatalytic water splitting, achieving a high hydrogen evolution efficiency of 22.15%, which surpasses the commercial viability threshold (10\%). Furthermore, we demonstrate effective band gap modulation via external electric fields and biaxial strains, with optical absorption coefficients exhibiting strong strain dependence. This work provides fundamental insights into the design of WSSe/SiC heterojunctions for high-efficiency photocatalytic and tunable photodetector applications.</description>

Abstract: To find a suitable framework for nonlinear crystal optics(NCO), we have revisited linear crystal optics(LCO). At the methodological level, three widely used plane wave bases are compared in terms of eigenanalysis in reciprocal space and light field propagation in real space. Inspired by complex ray tracing, we expand M.V. Berry \&amp; M.R. Dennis's 2003 uniform plane wave model to non-uniform Fourier crystal optics and ultimately derive the explicit form of its 3$\times$2 transition matrix, bridging the two major branches of crystal optics in reciprocal space, where either ray direction $\hat{k}$ or spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ serves as the input variable. Using this model, we create the material-matrix tetrahedral compass to conduct a detailed analysis of how the four fundamental characteristics of materials (linear/circular birefringence/dichroism) influence the eigensystems of the vector electric field in two-dimensional spatial frequency $\bar{k}_{\mathrm{\rho}}$ domain and its distribution in three-dimensional $\bar{r}$ space with a crystal-2f configuration. Along this journey, we have uncovered new territories in LCO in both real and reciprocal space, such as infinite singularities arranged in disk-, ring-, and crescent-like shapes, ``L shorelines'' resembling hearts, generalized haunting theorem, double conical refraction, and optical knots it induces. We also present our model's early applications in focal engineering and NCO. As the opening chapter in a trilogy, this work connects crystal optics, Fourier optics, and nonlinear optics, while integrating theoretical, computational, and experimental physics, advancing all six domains.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity in doped planar Dirac insulators: A renormalization group study</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.20394v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: From a leading-order unbiased renormalization group analysis we here showcase the emergence of superconductivity (including the topological ones) from purely repulsive electron-electron interactions in two-dimensional doped Dirac insulators, featuring a Fermi surface. In the absence of chemical doping, such systems describe quantum anomalous or spin Hall and normal insulators. Otherwise a simply connected Fermi surface becomes annular deep inside the topological regime. By considering all symmetry allowed repulsive local four-fermion interactions, we show that the nature of the resulting superconducting states at low temperature follows certain Clifford algebraic selection rules, irrespective of the underlying Fermi surface topology. Within the framework of a microscopic Hubbard model, on-site repulsion among fermions with opposite orbitals (spin projections) typically favors topological $p$-wave (conventional $s$-wave) pairing. Theoretically predicted superconductivity can in principle be observed in experiments once the promising candidate materials for quantum anomalous and spin Hall insulators are doped to foster Fermi surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the novel electron beam resist Medusa 84 SiH by Allresist GmbH (Germany) for nanostructuring of single crystal diamond and its effects on the spin properties of nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in nanopillars as prototypes for photonic structures. We find contrast curves comparable to those of resists previously used for this task (Hydrogensilsequioxane FOx). We present a minimum selectivity for diamond etching of 6$\pm$1. Using an adhesion-promoting silicon interlayer enables fabrication yields of up to 98\%. We measure $T_2$ times of up to $\sim$25 $\mu$s before and after processing, demonstrating that the manufactured structures are usable for diamond-based quantum sensing.</description>

      <title>Simulating Heterogeneity within Elastic and Inelastic Discrete Mechanical Models</title>

Abstract: Two approaches to incorporate heterogeneity in discrete models are compared. In the first, standard approach, the heterogeneity is dictated by geometrical structure of the discrete system. In the second approach, the heterogeneity is imposed by randomizing material parameters of the contacts between the rigid bodies. A similar randomization strategy is often adopted in continuous homogeneous models. The study investigates both the elastic and fracture behaviors of these model types, and compares their local and macroscale responses. It is found that the stress oscillations present in the standard discrete models built on heterogeneous geometric structures cannot be replicated by randomization of the elastically homogeneous discrete system. The marginal distributions and dependencies between the stress tensor components cannot be adequately matched. Therefore, there is a fundamental difference between these two views on discrete models. The numerical experiments performed in the paper showed that an identical response can be achieved at the macroscale by tuning the material parameters. However, the local behavior, fracturing, and internal dependencies are quite different. These findings provide insight into the potential for controlled random assignment of heterogeneity in homogeneous models. They also demonstrate the need for experimental data capable of verifying the correctness of such an approach.</description>

      <title>Weak localization as probe of spin-orbit-induced spin-split bands in bilayer graphene proximity coupled to WSe$_2$</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.24632v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Proximity coupling of bilayer graphene (BLG) to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) offers a promising route to engineer gate-tunable spin-orbit coupling (SOC) while preserving BLG's exceptional electronic properties. This tunability arises from the layer-asymmetric electronic structure of gapped BLG, where SOC acts predominantly on the layer in contact with the TMD. Here, we present high-quality BLG/WSe$_2$ devices with a proximity-induced SOC gap and excellent electrostatic control. Operating in a quasi-ballistic regime, our double-gated heterostructures allow to form gate-defined p-n-p cavities and show clear weak anti-localization (WAL) features consistent with Rashba-type SOC. At lower hole densities, a transition to weak localization (WL) is observed, signaling transport through a single spin-split valence band. These findings - in agreement with calculations - provide direct spectroscopic evidence of proximity-induced spin-split band in BLG and underscore the potential of BLG/TMD heterostructures for spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies.</description>

      <title>Elastic properties of fluid mercury across the metal-nonmetal transition: Ab initio simulation study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09757</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.09757v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report an ab initio molecular dynamics study of fluid mercury at temperature 1750 K in the range of densities 7-13.5 g/cm$^3$. Along this isothermal line we performed an analysis of total charge fluctuations, which make evidence of neutral atom-like screening in fluid Hg for densities less than 9.25 g/cm$^3$, which practically coincides with the emergence of the gap in electronic density of states. High-frequency shear modulus, high-frequency and adiabatic speeds of sound, shear viscosity, Maxwell relaxation time and dispersion of collective excitations are analyzed as a function of density along the isothermal line.</description>

      <title>Voltage-Induced Oxidation for Enhanced Purity and Reproducibility of Quantum Emission in Monolayer 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19659</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.19659v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We report a voltage-induced oxidation technique using conductive atomic force microscopy to enhance the single-photon purity and reproducibility of quantum emitters in monolayer tung-sten diselenide (WSe2). By applying a controlled electric field across a monolayer WSe2/poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene) (P(VDF-TrFE)) on a silicon substrate, localized oxidation is induced around nanoindented emitter sites in the WSe2. This treatment selectively suppresses defect-bound exciton emissions while preserving emission from pristine regions within the indentations. Photoluminescence and second-order correlation measurements at 18 K demonstrate a substantial increase in single-photon purity when comparing emitters from untreated and voltage-treated regions. Emitters from untreated regions showed average values of g2(0) near or above the 0.5 threshold. In contrast, emitters from voltage-treated regions exhibited g2(0) values consistently below 0.14, with most falling near 0.05, demonstrating high-purity single-photon emission well below the g2(0) &lt; 0.5 threshold. This enhancement results from the oxidation-induced suppression of spurious luminescence from the area around the quantum emitter site that is spectrally degenerate with the single-photon wavelength. This approach offers nonvolatile, spatially selective control over the emitter environment without degrading the emission intensity, improving both purity and stability. It provides a scalable route for integrating high-quality quantum emitters in two-dimensional materials into photonic platforms. Integration with spectral tuning strategies such as strain engineering, local dielectric patterning, or electrostatic gating could further enable deterministic, wavelength-selective single-photon sources for advanced quantum photonic applications</description>
