      <title>Automating Research Synthesis with Domain-Specific Large Language Model Fine-Tuning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08680</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.08680v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This research pioneers the use of fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate Systematic Literature Reviews (SLRs), presenting a significant and novel contribution in integrating AI to enhance academic research methodologies. Our study employed the latest fine-tuning methodologies together with open-sourced LLMs, and demonstrated a practical and efficient approach to automating the final execution stages of an SLR process that involves knowledge synthesis. The results maintained high fidelity in factual accuracy in LLM responses, and were validated through the replication of an existing PRISMA-conforming SLR. Our research proposed solutions for mitigating LLM hallucination and proposed mechanisms for tracking LLM responses to their sources of information, thus demonstrating how this approach can meet the rigorous demands of scholarly research. The findings ultimately confirmed the potential of fine-tuned LLMs in streamlining various labor-intensive processes of conducting literature reviews. Given the potential of this approach and its applicability across all research domains, this foundational study also advocated for updating PRISMA reporting guidelines to incorporate AI-driven processes, ensuring methodological transparency and reliability in future SLRs. This study broadens the appeal of AI-enhanced tools across various academic and research fields, setting a new standard for conducting comprehensive and accurate literature reviews with more efficiency in the face of ever-increasing volumes of academic studies.</description>

      <title>Improved methodology for longitudinal Web analytics using Common Crawl</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09770</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09770v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Common Crawl is a multi-petabyte longitudinal dataset containing over 100 billion web pages which is widely used as a source of language data for sequence model training and in web science research. Each of its constituent archives is on the order of 75TB in size. Using it for research, particularly longitudinal studies, which necessarily involve multiple archives, is therefore very expensive in terms of compute time and storage space and/or web bandwidth. Two new methods for mitigating this problem are presented here, based on exploiting and extending the much smaller (&lt;200 gigabytes (GB) compressed) _index_ which is available for each archive. By adding Last-Modified timestamps to the index we enable longitudinal exploration using only a single archive. By comparing the distribution of index features for each of the 100 segments into which archive is divided with their distribution over the whole archive, we have identified the least and most representative segments for a number of recent archives. Using this allows the segment(s) that are most representative of an archive to be used as proxies for the whole. We illustrate this approach in an analysis of changes in URI length over time, leading to an unanticipated insight into the how the creation of Web pages has changed over time.</description>

      <title>AceMap: Knowledge Discovery through Academic Graph</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.02576</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.02576v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The exponential growth of scientific literature requires effective management and extraction of valuable insights. While existing scientific search engines excel at delivering search results based on relational databases, they often neglect the analysis of collaborations between scientific entities and the evolution of ideas, as well as the in-depth analysis of content within scientific publications. The representation of heterogeneous graphs and the effective measurement, analysis, and mining of such graphs pose significant challenges. To address these challenges, we present AceMap, an academic system designed for knowledge discovery through academic graph. We present advanced database construction techniques to build the comprehensive AceMap database with large-scale academic entities that contain rich visual, textual, and numerical information. AceMap also employs innovative visualization, quantification, and analysis methods to explore associations and logical relationships among academic entities. AceMap introduces large-scale academic network visualization techniques centered on nebular graphs, providing a comprehensive view of academic networks from multiple perspectives. In addition, AceMap proposes a unified metric based on structural entropy to quantitatively measure the knowledge content of different academic entities. Moreover, AceMap provides advanced analysis capabilities, including tracing the evolution of academic ideas through citation relationships and concept co-occurrence, and generating concise summaries informed by this evolutionary process. In addition, AceMap uses machine reading methods to generate potential new ideas at the intersection of different fields. Exploring the integration of large language models and knowledge graphs is a promising direction for future research in idea evolution.
