      <title>Properties of Free Floating Planets Ejected through Planet-Planet Scattering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13166</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13166v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multiple studies have shown that planet-planet scattering plays an important role in the dynamical evolution of planetary systems. For instance, it has been shown that planet-planet scattering can reproduce the eccentricity distribution of exoplanets. It can also contribute to the current census of free floating planets. In this work we run an ensemble of N-body simulations of planetary systems, and record the properties of planets which are ejected from the system. In our simulations we sample a wide range of orbital and physical properties of the planets. We find that in general $40-80\%$ of the planets are ejected from the system depending on the number of planets initially in the system. Most of the planets are ejected over a timescale of $\sim 10^8-10^9$ years. The ejected planets have a mean excess velocity in the range of 2-6 km/sec with respect to the host star. The excess velocities of the planets ejected from the system strongly depends on the semi-major axis of the inner most planet. We find that irrespective of their initial location in the planetary system, all planets are equally likely to be ejected from the system. Also, bound and ejected planets have distinct mass distributions, with bound planets being more massive than ejected planets. In addition, increasing the radii of the planets reduces the ejection fraction. The properties of the ejected planets do not strongly depend on the initial spacing between the planets. The timescale over which ejections happen does increase with the initial separation between the planets. We also find that the ejection fraction does not strongly depend on the distance from the host star beyond which the planets are considered unbound. Finally, we compared our results with observed populations of free floating planets. We conclude that on average 5-10 planets should form around each star to reproduce the observations.</description>

      <title>Formation of Giant Planets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13214v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Giant planets dominate the mass of many planetary systems, including the Solar System, and represent the best-characterized class of extrasolar planets. Understanding the formation of giant planets bridges the high mass end of the planet formation process and the low mass end of processes that produce stellar and brown dwarf companions. This review examines the latest evidence supporting the formation of Solar System giant planets and most extrasolar giant planets by core accretion. Key elements of this theory and recent advances are discussed, along with the role of gravitational fragmentation of gas disks -- a mechanism more likely to produce brown dwarfs and/or similarly massive binary companions.</description>

      <title>Transit-timing variations in the AU Mic system observed with CHEOPS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13575</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13575v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AU Mic is a very active M dwarf with an edge-on debris disk and two transiting sub-Neptunes with a possible third planetary companion. The two transiting planets exhibit significant transit-timing variations (TTVs) that are caused by the gravitational interaction between the bodies in the system. Using photometrical observations taken with the CHaracterizing ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS), our goal is to constrain the planetary radii, the orbital distances and periods of AU Mic b and c. We aim to determine the superperiod of the TTVs for AU Mic b and to update the transit ephemeris for both planets. Based on the observed TTVs, we study the possible presence of a third planet in the system. We conducted high precision photometric observations with CHEOPS in 2022 and 2023. We used Allesfitter to fit the planetary transits and to constrain the planetary and orbital parameters. We combined our new measurements with results from previous years to determine the periods and amplitudes of the TTVs. We applied dynamical modelling based on TTV measurements from the 2018-2023 period to reconstruct the perceived variations. The orbital distances and periods for AU Mic b and c agree with the results from previous works. However, the values for the planetary radii deviate slightly from previous values, which we attribute to the effect of stellar spots. AU Mic c showed very strong TTVs, with transits that occurred ~80 minutes later in 2023 than in 2021. Through dynamical analysis of the system, we found that the observed TTVs can be explained by a third planet with an orbital period of ~12.6 days and a mass of 0.203+0.022-0.024 M_E. We explored the orbital geometry of the system and found that AU Mic c has a misaligned retrograde orbit. Due limited number of observations the exact configuration and planetary parameters could not be determined. Further monitoring with CHEOPS may improve these results.</description>

      <title>The vertical shear instability in protoplanetary discs as an outwardly travelling wave. I. Linear theory</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13715v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the global linear theory of the vertical shear instability (VSI) in protoplanetary discs with an imposed radial temperature gradient. We focus on the regime in which the VSI has the form of a travelling inertial wave that grows in amplitude as it propagates outwards. Building on previous work describing travelling waves in thin astrophysical discs, we develop a quantitative theory of the wave motion, its spatial structure and the physical mechanism by which the wave is amplified. We find that this viewpoint provides a useful description of the large-scale development of the VSI in global numerical simulations, which involves corrugation and breathing motions of the disc. We contrast this behaviour with that of perturbations of smaller scale, in which the VSI grows into a nonlinear regime in place without significant radial propagation.</description>

      <title>Exoplanet Occurrence Rate with Age for FGK Stars in Kepler</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13809</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13809v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We measure exoplanet occurrence rate as a function of isochrone and gyrochronology ages using confirmed and candidate planets identified in Q1-17 DR25 Kepler data. We employ Kepler's pipeline detection efficiency to correct for the expected number of planets in each age bin. We examine the occurrence rates for planets with radii $0.2 \leq Rp \leq 20$ R$_\oplus$ and orbital periods $0.2 \leq P \leq 100$ days for FGK stars with ages between $1.5-8$ Gyr using the inverse detection efficiency method. We find no significant trend between occurrence rate and stellar ages; a slight, decreasing trend (within $1.5-2.5$ $\sigma$) only emerges for low-mass and metal-rich stars that dominate our sample. We isolate the effects of mass and metallicity on the occurrence rate trend with age, but find the results to be inconclusive due to weak trends and small sample size. Our results hint that the exoplanet occurrence rate may decrease over time due to dynamical instability from planet-planet scattering or planet ejection, but accurate ages and larger sample sizes are needed to resolve a clear relation between occurrence rate and age.</description>

      <title>Dust characterization of protoplanetary disks: a guide to multi-wavelength analyses and accurate dust mass measurements</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13877</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13877v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Multi-wavelength dust continuum observations of protoplanetary disks are essential for accurately measuring two key ingredients of planets formation theories: the dust mass and grain size. Unfortunately, they are also extremely time-expensive. We aim to investigate the most economic way of performing this analysis. We benchmark the dust characterization analysis on multi-wavelength observations of two disk models. We test three different combinations of bands (in the 0.45 mm $\to$ 7.46 mm range) to see how optically thick and thin observations aid the reconstruction of the dust properties for different morphologies and in three different dust mass regimes. We also test different spatial resolutions. Dust properties are robustly measured in a multi-band analysis if optically thin observations are included. For typical disks, this requires wavelengths longer than 3 mm. High-resolution (&lt; 0.03"-0.05") is fundamental to resolve the changes in dust content of substructures. However, lower-resolution results still provide an accurate measurement of the total dust mass and of the level of grain growth of rings. Additionally, we propose a new approach that successfully combines lower and higher resolution observations in the multi-wavelength analysis without losing spatial information. We also test individually enhancing the resolution of each radial intensity profile with Frank but we note the presence of artifacts. Finally, we discuss on the total dust mass that we derive from the SED analyses and compare it with the traditional method of deriving dust masses from millimeter fluxes. Accurate dust mass measurements from the SED analysis can be derived by including optically thin tracers. On the other hand, single-wavelength flux-based masses are always underestimated by even more than one order of magnitude.</description>

      <title>HD 206893 B at High Spectral Resolution with the Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13917</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.13917v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present an atmospheric characterization and orbital analysis of HD 206893 B, an exceptionally red, L/T-transition substellar companion in a multiplanetary system, via Keck Planet Imager and Characterizer (KPIC) high-resolution (R $\sim$ 35,000) K-band spectroscopy. Using PHOENIX atmospheric models in a forward-model framework that fits the spectrum of the companion and diffracted starlight simultaneously, we detect HD 206893 B at $&gt;8\sigma$ significance via cross-correlation in two epochs. We find an effective temperature for the companion of $1634^{+72}_{-38}$ K and a log(g) of $4.55^{+0.17}_{-0.22}$. Only accounting for statistical uncertainties, we measure the carbon-oxygen ratio (C/O) of this companion to be $0.57 \pm 0.02$, or near-solar while assuming solar metallicity. The C/O ratio we measure fits the tentative trend of $&gt;4 M_{Jup}$ companions having near-solar C/O ratios while less massive companions have greater-than-solar C/O ratios. Using substellar evolution models, we find an age of $112^{+36}_{-22}$ Myr, a mass of $22.7^{+2.5}_{-1.7} M_{Jup}$, and a radius of $1.11 \pm 0.03 R_{Jup}$ for this companion. We also use KPIC radial velocity data to fit the orbit of HD 206893 B and analyze the orbital stability of this system. We find that the orbital stability is relatively independent of the mass of HD 206893 B, and favors an orbital configuration where B and its interior planetary companion, HD 206893 c, are co-planar. The measured C/O ratio coupled with the current architecture of the system cannot rule out a core accretion scenario, nor a disk fragmentation scenario regarding the formation pathway of HD 206893 B.</description>

      <title>An automated occultation network for gravitational mapping of the trans-neptunian solar system</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16348</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.16348v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We explore the potential of an array of O(100) small fixed telescopes, aligned along a meridian and automated to measure millions of occultations of Gaia stars by minor planets, to constrain gravitational signatures from a "Planet X" mass in the outer solar system. The accuracy of center-of-mass tracking for the occulters is limited by photon noise, uncertainties in asteroid shapes, and Gaia's astrometry of the occulted stars. Using both parametric calculations and survey simulations, we assess the total information obtainable from occultation measurements of main-belt asteroids (MBAs), Jovian Trojans and trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs). We find that MBAs are the optimal target population due to their higher occultation rates and abundance of objects above LSST detection thresholds. A 10-year survey of occultations by MBAs and Trojans using an array of 200 40 cm telescopes at 5 km separation would achieve $5\sigma$ sensitivity to the gravitational tidal field of a $5M_\oplus$ Planet X at 800 AU for $&gt;90\%$ of potential sky locations. This configuration corresponds to an initial cost of $\approx $15 million. While the occultation survey's sensitivity to tidal forces improves rapidly with increasing number of telescopes, sensitivity to a Planet X becomes limited by degeneracy with the uncertain masses of large moonless TNOs. The 200-telescope survey would additionally detect $\approx $1800 TNO occultations, providing detailed shape, size, and albedo information. The survey would also measure the Yarkovski effect on many individual MBAs, measure the masses of many asteroids involved in mutual gravitational deflections, and enable better searches for primordial black holes and departures from General Relativity.</description>

      <title>Basaltic quasi-mini-moon: Characterizing 2024 PT5 with the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08834</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.08834v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Context. Small bodies in Earth-like orbits, the Arjunas, are good targets for scientific exploration, and space mining or in situ resource utilization (ISRU) trials as they enable low-cost missions. The subset of these objects that experience recurrent temporarily captured flyby or orbiter episodes are among the best ranked in terms of accessibility. Only a handful of objects are known to have engaged in such a dynamical behavior. Finding and characterizing more of them may help to expand scientific and commercial research activities in space over the next few decades. Asteroid 2024 PT5 is a recent finding that shows dynamical traits in common with this group.
  Aims. Here we investigate the orbital context of 2024 PT5 and its spectral and rotational properties.
  Methods. We studied the short-term orbital evolution of 2024 PT5 using direct N-body simulations. We identified its spectral class from the visible reflectance spectrum and used photometric observations to derive its rotational properties. Observational data were obtained with the OSIRIS camera spectrograph at the 10.4 m Gran Telescopio Canarias and the Two-meter Twin Telescope.
  Results. Asteroid 2024 PT5 experiences recurrent co-orbital engagements and episodes in which it has negative geocentric orbital energy while inside a geocentric distance under three Hill radii, which we call quasi-mini-moon events. Its visible spectrum is consistent with that of lunar-like silicates. Photometric data suggest a rotation period under 1 h.
  Conclusions. The discovery of 2024 PT5 confirms that events resembling temporary captures are relatively frequent and involve objects larger than a few meters, suitable as accessible targets for scientific research activities and demonstrating ISRU technologies.</description>

      <title>Potential habitability of present-day Mars subsurface for terrestrial-like methanogens</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.15064v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The intense debate about the presence of methane in the Martian atmosphere has stimulated the study of methanogens adapted to terrestrial habitats that mimic Martian environments. We examinate the environmental conditions, energy sources and ecology of terrestrial methanogens thriving in deep crystalline fractures, sub-sea hypersaline lakes and subglacial water bodies considered as analogs of a hypothetical habitable Martian subsurface. We combine this information with recent data on the distribution of buried water or ice and radiogenic elements on Mars and with models of the subsurface thermal regime of this planet to identify a 4.3-8.8 km-deep regolith habitat at the mid-latitude location of Acidalia Planitia, that might fit the requirements for hosting putative Martian methanogens analogous to the methanogenic families Methanosarcinaceae and Methanomicrobiaceae.</description>

      <title>Simultaneous Evolutionary Fits for Jupiter and Saturn Incorporating Fuzzy Cores</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17127</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.17127v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the recent realization that there likely are stably-stratified regions in the interiors of both Jupiter and Saturn, we construct new non-adiabatic, inhomogeneous evolutionary models with the same microphysics for each that result at the present time in respectable fits for all major bulk observables for both planets. These include the effective temperature, radius, atmospheric heavy-element and helium abundances (including helium rain), and the lower-order gravity moments J2 and J4. The models preserve from birth most of an extended "fuzzy" heavy-element core. Our predicted atmospheric helium mass fraction for Saturn is ~0.2, close to some measured estimates, but in disagreement with some published predictions. To preserve a fuzzy core from birth, the interiors of both planets must start out at lower entropies than would be used for traditional "hot start" adiabatic models, though the initial exterior mantle entropies can range from hot to warm start values. We do not see a helium ocean in Saturn's interior, and both models have inner envelopes with significant Brunt-Vaisala frequencies; this region for Saturn at the current epoch is more extended and in it, the Brunt is larger. The total heavy-element mass fraction in Jupiter and in Saturn is determined to be ~14% and ~26%, respectively, though there is some play in these determinations.</description>

Abstract: PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars (PLATO) is an ESA M-class mission to be launched by the end of 2026 to discover and characterize transiting planets around bright and nearby stars, and in particular habitable rocky planets hosted by solar-like stars. Over the mission lifetime, an average of 8% of the science data rate will be allocated to Guest Observer programs (GOs) selected by ESA through public calls, hence it is essential for the community to know in advance where the observing fields will be located. In a previous paper, we identified two preliminary long-pointing fields (LOPN1 and LOPS1) for PLATO, respectively in the northern and southern hemisphere. Here we present LOPS2, a slightly adjusted version of the southern field that has recently been selected by the PLATO Science Working Team as the first field to be observed by PLATO for at least two continuous years, following the scientific requirements. In this paper, we describe the astrophysical content of LOPS2 in detail, including known planetary systems, bright/variable/binary stars, clusters and synergies with other current and future facilities.</description>

      <title>Hot Jupiter engulfment by a red giant in 3D hydrodynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.15848</link>
      <description>arXiv:2210.15848v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Hot Jupiters are gas giant planets with orbital periods of a few days and are found in 0.1-1% of Sun-like stars. They are expected to be engulfed during their host star's radial expansion on the red giant branch, which may account for observed rapidly rotating and chemically enriched giant stars. We performed 3D hydrodynamical simulations of hot Jupiter engulfment by a 1 solar mass, 4 solar radii early red giant. Our 'global' simulations simultaneously resolve the stellar envelope and planetary structure, modelling the hot Jupiter as a polytropic gas sphere. The hot Jupiter spirals in due to ram-pressure drag. A substantial fraction of its mass is continuously ablated in this process, although the mass-loss rate is resolution dependent. We estimate that this could enhance the surface lithium abundance by up to 0.1 dex. The hot Jupiter is disrupted by a combination of ram pressure and tidal forces near the base of the convective envelope, with the deepest material penetrating to the radiative zone. The star experiences modest spin-up (~ 1 km/s), and engulfing a more massive companion may be required to produce a rapidly rotating giant. Drag heating near the surface and hydrogen recombination in the small amount of unbound ejecta recorded in the simulation could power an optical transient, although this needs to be confirmed by a calculation that has adequate resolution at the stellar surface.</description>

      <title>Multi-Point Hermite Methods for the N-Body Problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.17311v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Numerical integration methods are central to the study of self-gravitating systems, particularly those comprised of many bodies or otherwise beyond the reach of analytical methods. Predictor-corrector schemes, both multi-step methods and those based on 2-point Hermite interpolation, have found great success in the simulation of star clusters and other collisional systems. Higher-order methods, such as those based on Gaussian quadratures and Richardson extrapolation, have also proven popular for high-accuracy integrations of few-body systems, particularly those that may undergo close encounters. This work presents a family of high-order schemes based on multi-point Hermite interpolation. When applied as a multi-step multi-derivative schemes, these can be seen as generalizing both Adams-Bashforth-Moulton methods and 2-point Hermite methods; I present results for the 6th-, 9th-, and 12th-order 3-point schemes applied in this manner using variable time steps. In a cluster-like test problem, the 3-point 6th-order predictor-corrector scheme matches or outperforms the standard 2-point 4th-order Hermite scheme at negligible O(N) cost. I also present a number of high-order time-symmetric schemes up to 18th order, which have the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of long-duration simulations.</description>

      <title>Multi-Target Spacecraft Mission Design using Convex Optimization and Binary Integer Programming</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11281</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11281v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The optimal design of multi-target rendezvous and flyby missions is challenging due to the combination of traditional spacecraft trajectory optimization and high-dimensional combinatorial problems. This often requires large-scale global search techniques or simplified approximations that rely on manual tuning to be performant. While global search techniques are typically computationally expensive, limiting their use in time- or cost-constrained scenarios, this work proposes a computationally efficient nested-loop approach. The problem is split into separate combinatorial and optimal control subproblems: the combinatorial problem is solved using Binary Integer Programming (BIP) with a fixed rendezvous time schedule, while the optimal control problem is handled with adaptive-mesh Sequential Convex Programming (SCP), which also optimizes the time schedule. By iterating these processes in a nested-loop structure, the approach can efficiently find high-quality solutions. When, applied to the Global Trajectory Optimization Competition 12 (GTOC 12) problem, this method results in several new best-known solutions.</description>
