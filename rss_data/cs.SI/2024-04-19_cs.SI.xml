      <title>A Fast Maximum Clique Algorithm Based on Network Decomposition for Large Sparse Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11862</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11862v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Finding maximum cliques in large networks is a challenging combinatorial problem with many real-world applications. We present a fast algorithm to achieve the exact solution for the maximum clique problem in large sparse networks based on efficient graph decomposition. A bunch of effective techniques is being used to greatly prune the graph and a novel concept called Complete-Upper-Bound-Induced Subgraph (CUBIS) is proposed to ensure that the structures with the potential to form the maximum clique are retained in the process of graph decomposition. Our algorithm first pre-prunes peripheral nodes, subsequently, one or two small-scale CUBISs are constructed guided by the core number and current maximum clique size. Bron-Kerbosch search is performed on each CUBIS to find the maximum clique. Experiments on 50 empirical networks with a scale of up to 20 million show the CUBIS scales are largely independent of the original network scale. This enables an approximately linear runtime, making our algorithm amenable for large networks. Our work provides a new framework for effectively solving maximum clique problems on massive sparse graphs, which not only makes the graph scale no longer the bottleneck but also shows some light on solving other clique-related problems.</description>

      <title>Multi-view Graph Structural Representation Learning via Graph Coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11869</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.11869v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Transformers (GTs) have made remarkable achievements in graph-level tasks. However, most existing works regard graph structures as a form of guidance or bias for enhancing node representations, which focuses on node-central perspectives and lacks explicit representations of edges and structures. One natural question is, can we treat graph structures node-like as a whole to learn high-level features? Through experimental analysis, we explore the feasibility of this assumption. Based on our findings, we propose a novel multi-view graph structural representation learning model via graph coarsening (MSLgo) on GT architecture for graph classification. Specifically, we build three unique views, original, coarsening, and conversion, to learn a thorough structural representation. We compress loops and cliques via hierarchical heuristic graph coarsening and restrict them with well-designed constraints, which builds the coarsening view to learn high-level interactions between structures. We also introduce line graphs for edge embeddings and switch to edge-central perspective to construct the conversion view. Experiments on six real-world datasets demonstrate the improvements of MSLgo over 14 baselines from various architectures.</description>

      <title>Effective Individual Fairest Community Search over Heterogeneous Information Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12107</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12107v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community search over heterogeneous information networks has been applied to wide domains, such as activity organization and team formation. From these scenarios, the members of a group with the same treatment often have different levels of activity and workloads, which causes unfairness in the treatment between active members and inactive members (called individual unfairness). However, existing works do not pay attention to individual fairness and do not sufficiently consider the rich semantics of HINs (e.g., high-order structure), which disables complex queries. To fill the gap, we formally define the issue of individual fairest community search over HINs (denoted as IFCS), which aims to find a set of vertices from the HIN that own the same type, close relationships, and small difference of activity level and has been demonstrated to be NP-hard. To do this, we first develop an exploration-based filter that reduces the search space of the community effectively. Further, to avoid repeating computation and prune unfair communities in advance, we propose a message-based scheme and a lower bound-based scheme. At last, we conduct extensive experiments on four real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed algorithms, which achieve at least X3 times faster than the baseline solution.</description>

      <title>Stance Detection on Social Media with Fine-Tuned Large Language Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12171</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12171v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Stance detection, a key task in natural language processing, determines an author's viewpoint based on textual analysis. This study evaluates the evolution of stance detection methods, transitioning from early machine learning approaches to the groundbreaking BERT model, and eventually to modern Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, LLaMa-2, and Mistral-7B. While ChatGPT's closed-source nature and associated costs present challenges, the open-source models like LLaMa-2 and Mistral-7B offers an encouraging alternative. Initially, our research focused on fine-tuning ChatGPT, LLaMa-2, and Mistral-7B using several publicly available datasets. Subsequently, to provide a comprehensive comparison, we assess the performance of these models in zero-shot and few-shot learning scenarios. The results underscore the exceptional ability of LLMs in accurately detecting stance, with all tested models surpassing existing benchmarks. Notably, LLaMa-2 and Mistral-7B demonstrate remarkable efficiency and potential for stance detection, despite their smaller sizes compared to ChatGPT. This study emphasizes the potential of LLMs in stance detection and calls for more extensive research in this field.</description>

      <title>Improving the interpretability of GNN predictions through conformal-based graph sparsification</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.12356v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in solving graph classification tasks. However, most GNN architectures aggregate information from all nodes and edges in a graph, regardless of their relevance to the task at hand, thus hindering the interpretability of their predictions. In contrast to prior work, in this paper we propose a GNN \emph{training} approach that jointly i) finds the most predictive subgraph by removing edges and/or nodes -- -\emph{without making assumptions about the subgraph structure} -- while ii) optimizing the performance of the graph classification task. To that end, we rely on reinforcement learning to solve the resulting bi-level optimization with a reward function based on conformal predictions to account for the current in-training uncertainty of the classifier. Our empirical results on nine different graph classification datasets show that our method competes in performance with baselines while relying on significantly sparser subgraphs, leading to more interpretable GNN-based predictions.</description>

      <title>Social Links vs. Language Barriers: Decoding the Global Spread of Streaming Content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19329</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19329v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The development of the internet has allowed for the global distribution of content, redefining media communication and property structures through various streaming platforms. Previous studies successfully clarified the factors contributing to trends in each streaming service, yet the similarities and differences between platforms are commonly unexplored; moreover, the influence of social connections and cultural similarity is usually overlooked. We hereby examine the social aspects of three significant streaming services--Netflix, Spotify, and YouTube--with an emphasis on the dissemination of content across countries. Using two-year-long trending chart datasets, we find that streaming content can be divided into two types: video-oriented (Netflix) and audio-oriented (Spotify). This characteristic is differentiated by accounting for the significance of social connectedness and linguistic similarity: audio-oriented content travels via social links, but video-oriented content tends to spread throughout linguistically akin countries. Interestingly, user-generated contents, YouTube, exhibits a dual characteristic by integrating both visual and auditory characteristics, indicating the platform is evolving into unique medium rather than simply residing a midpoint between video and audio media.</description>
