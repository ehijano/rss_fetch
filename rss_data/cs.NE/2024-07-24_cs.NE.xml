      <title>Implementing engrams from a machine learning perspective: the relevance of a latent space</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16616v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous work, we proposed that engrams in the brain could be biologically implemented as autoencoders over recurrent neural networks. These autoencoders would comprise basic excitatory/inhibitory motifs, with credit assignment deriving from a simple homeostatic criterion. This brief note examines the relevance of the latent space in these autoencoders. We consider the relationship between the dimensionality of these autoencoders and the complexity of the information being encoded. We discuss how observed differences between species in their connectome could be linked to their cognitive capacities. Finally, we link this analysis with a basic but often overlooked fact: human cognition is likely limited by our own brain structure. However, this limitation does not apply to machine learning systems, and we should be aware of the need to learn how to exploit this augmented vision of the nature.</description>

      <title>A Quantum Leaky Integrate-and-Fire Spiking Neuron and Network</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16398</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16398v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Quantum machine learning is in a period of rapid development and discovery, however it still lacks the resources and diversity of computational models of its classical complement. With the growing difficulties of classical models requiring extreme hardware and power solutions, and quantum models being limited by noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware, there is an emerging opportunity to solve both problems together. Here we introduce a new software model for quantum neuromorphic computing -- a quantum leaky integrate-and-fire (QLIF) neuron, implemented as a compact high-fidelity quantum circuit, requiring only 2 rotation gates and no CNOT gates. We use these neurons as building blocks in the construction of a quantum spiking neural network (QSNN), and a quantum spiking convolutional neural network (QSCNN), as the first of their kind. We apply these models to the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and KMNIST datasets for a full comparison with other classical and quantum models. We find that the proposed models perform competitively, with comparative accuracy, with efficient scaling and fast computation in classical simulation as well as on quantum devices.</description>

      <title>No-brainer: Morphological Computation driven Adaptive Behavior in Soft Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16613</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.16613v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is prevalent in contemporary AI and robotics to separately postulate a brain modeled by neural networks and employ it to learn intelligent and adaptive behavior. While this method has worked very well for many types of tasks, it isn't the only type of intelligence that exists in nature. In this work, we study the ways in which intelligent behavior can be created without a separate and explicit brain for robot control, but rather solely as a result of the computation occurring within the physical body of a robot. Specifically, we show that adaptive and complex behavior can be created in voxel-based virtual soft robots by using simple reactive materials that actively change the shape of the robot, and thus its behavior, under different environmental cues. We demonstrate a proof of concept for the idea of closed-loop morphological computation, and show that in our implementation, it enables behavior mimicking logic gates, enabling us to demonstrate how such behaviors may be combined to build up more complex collective behaviors.</description>

      <title>Kernel Memory Networks: A Unifying Framework for Memory Modeling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.09416</link>
      <description>arXiv:2208.09416v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the problem of training a neural network to store a set of patterns with maximal noise robustness. A solution, in terms of optimal weights and state update rules, is derived by training each individual neuron to perform either kernel classification or interpolation with a minimum weight norm. By applying this method to feed-forward and recurrent networks, we derive optimal models, termed kernel memory networks, that include, as special cases, many of the hetero- and auto-associative memory models that have been proposed over the past years, such as modern Hopfield networks and Kanerva's sparse distributed memory. We modify Kanerva's model and demonstrate a simple way to design a kernel memory network that can store an exponential number of continuous-valued patterns with a finite basin of attraction. The framework of kernel memory networks offers a simple and intuitive way to understand the storage capacity of previous memory models, and allows for new biological interpretations in terms of dendritic non-linearities and synaptic cross-talk.</description>

      <title>Unsupervised End-to-End Training with a Self-Defined Target</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.12116v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Designing algorithms for versatile AI hardware that can learn on the edge using both labeled and unlabeled data is challenging. Deep end-to-end training methods incorporating phases of self-supervised and supervised learning are accurate and adaptable to input data but self-supervised learning requires even more computational and memory resources than supervised learning, too high for current embedded hardware. Conversely, unsupervised layer-by-layer training, such as Hebbian learning, is more compatible with existing hardware but does not integrate well with supervised learning. To address this, we propose a method enabling networks or hardware designed for end-to-end supervised learning to also perform high-performance unsupervised learning by adding two simple elements to the output layer: Winner-Take-All (WTA) selectivity and homeostasis regularization. These mechanisms introduce a "self-defined target" for unlabeled data, allowing purely unsupervised training for both fully-connected and convolutional layers using backpropagation or equilibrium propagation on datasets like MNIST (up to 99.2%), Fashion-MNIST (up to 90.3%), and SVHN (up to 81.5%). We extend this method to semi-supervised learning, adjusting targets based on data type, achieving 96.6% accuracy with only 600 labeled MNIST samples in a multi-layer perceptron. Our results show that this approach can effectively enable networks and hardware initially dedicated to supervised learning to also perform unsupervised learning, adapting to varying availability of labeled data.</description>

      <title>Smooth Tchebycheff Scalarization for Multi-Objective Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.19078</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.19078v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Multi-objective optimization problems can be found in many real-world applications, where the objectives often conflict each other and cannot be optimized by a single solution. In the past few decades, numerous methods have been proposed to find Pareto solutions that represent optimal trade-offs among the objectives for a given problem. However, these existing methods could have high computational complexity or may not have good theoretical properties for solving a general differentiable multi-objective optimization problem. In this work, by leveraging the smooth optimization technique, we propose a lightweight and efficient smooth Tchebycheff scalarization approach for gradient-based multi-objective optimization. It has good theoretical properties for finding all Pareto solutions with valid trade-off preferences, while enjoying significantly lower computational complexity compared to other methods. Experimental results on various real-world application problems fully demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method.</description>

      <title>The Platonic Representation Hypothesis</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.07987v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We argue that representations in AI models, particularly deep networks, are converging. First, we survey many examples of convergence in the literature: over time and across multiple domains, the ways by which different neural networks represent data are becoming more aligned. Next, we demonstrate convergence across data modalities: as vision models and language models get larger, they measure distance between datapoints in a more and more alike way. We hypothesize that this convergence is driving toward a shared statistical model of reality, akin to Plato's concept of an ideal reality. We term such a representation the platonic representation and discuss several possible selective pressures toward it. Finally, we discuss the implications of these trends, their limitations, and counterexamples to our analysis.</description>

      <title>E(n) Equivariant Topological Neural Networks</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.15429v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph neural networks excel at modeling pairwise interactions, but they cannot flexibly accommodate higher-order interactions and features. Topological deep learning (TDL) has emerged recently as a promising tool for addressing this issue. TDL enables the principled modeling of arbitrary multi-way, hierarchical higher-order interactions by operating on combinatorial topological spaces, such as simplicial or cell complexes, instead of graphs. However, little is known about how to leverage geometric features such as positions and velocities for TDL. This paper introduces E(n)-Equivariant Topological Neural Networks (ETNNs), which are E(n)-equivariant message-passing networks operating on combinatorial complexes, formal objects unifying graphs, hypergraphs, simplicial, path, and cell complexes. ETNNs incorporate geometric node features while respecting rotation and translation equivariance. Moreover, ETNNs are natively ready for settings with heterogeneous interactions. We provide a theoretical analysis to show the improved expressiveness of ETNNs over architectures for geometric graphs. We also show how several E(n) equivariant variants of TDL models can be directly derived from our framework. The broad applicability of ETNNs is demonstrated through two tasks of vastly different nature: i) molecular property prediction on the QM9 benchmark and ii) land-use regression for hyper-local estimation of air pollution with multi-resolution irregular geospatial data. The experiment results indicate that ETNNs are an effective tool for learning from diverse types of richly structured data, highlighting the benefits of principled geometric inductive bias.</description>

      <title>Event-Based Simulation of Stochastic Memristive Devices for Neuromorphic Computing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.04718</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.04718v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we build a general model of memristors suitable for the simulation of event-based systems, such as hardware spiking neural networks, and more generally, neuromorphic computing systems. We extend an existing general model of memristors - the Generalised Metastable Switch Model - to an event-driven setting, eliminating errors associated discrete time approximation, as well as offering potential improvements in terms of computational efficiency for simulation. We introduce the notion of a volatility state variable, to allow for the modelling of memory-dependent and dynamic switching behaviour, succinctly capturing and unifying a variety of volatile phenomena present in memristive devices, including state relaxation, structural disruption, Joule heating, and drift acceleration phenomena. We supply a drift dataset for titanium dioxide memristors and introduce a linear conductance model to simulate the drift characteristics, motivated by a proposed physical model of filament growth. We then demonstrate an approach for fitting the parameters of the event-based model to the drift model.</description>

      <title>Towards a "universal translator" for neural dynamics at single-cell, single-spike resolution</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14668</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.14668v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Neuroscience research has made immense progress over the last decade, but our understanding of the brain remains fragmented and piecemeal: the dream of probing an arbitrary brain region and automatically reading out the information encoded in its neural activity remains out of reach. In this work, we build towards a first foundation model for neural spiking data that can solve a diverse set of tasks across multiple brain areas. We introduce a novel self-supervised modeling approach for population activity in which the model alternates between masking out and reconstructing neural activity across different time steps, neurons, and brain regions. To evaluate our approach, we design unsupervised and supervised prediction tasks using the International Brain Laboratory repeated site dataset, which is comprised of Neuropixels recordings targeting the same brain locations across 48 animals and experimental sessions. The prediction tasks include single-neuron and region-level activity prediction, forward prediction, and behavior decoding. We demonstrate that our multi-task-masking (MtM) approach significantly improves the performance of current state-of-the-art population models and enables multi-task learning. We also show that by training on multiple animals, we can improve the generalization ability of the model to unseen animals, paving the way for a foundation model of the brain at single-cell, single-spike resolution.</description>
