      <title>On the parameters domain of the single-diode model</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07108v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The current-voltage (I-V) curves of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems have been widely used as a tool to determine their electrical operation. Usually, I-V curves are described employing three cardinal points: the short-circuit point $\left(0,I_\mathrm{sc}\right)$, the open-circuit point $\left(V_\mathrm{oc},0\right)$, and the maximum power point $\left(V_\mathrm{mp},I_\mathrm{mp} \right)$. In this context, to study the I-V curves, the single-diode model (SDM) is often used. In this manuscript, we present a practical approach for determining the parameters domain of the SDM given a set of cardinal points. An in-depth mathematical analysis showed that the SDM must satisfy the following inequalities $V_\mathrm{oc}/2 &lt;V_\mathrm{mp}&lt;V_\mathrm{oc}$ and $I_\mathrm{sc}/2 &lt;I_\mathrm{mp}&lt;I_\mathrm{sc}$. Then, it is possible to implicitly represent the SDM by a single parameter and, consequently, to determine its domain. For this purpose, a fast open-source computational algorithm for the single parameter domain of the SDM is presented. The algorithm has been computer-tested using $40\,000$ synthetically generated maximum power points which are processed in about one minute of the CPU time on a standard laptop computer. Moreover, as practical applications, the databases from the California Energy Commission and the NREL are analyzed using the presented algorithm.</description>

      <title>Spin Splitting in Altermagnetic RuO$_2$ Enables Field-free Spin-Orbit Torque Switching via Dominant Out-of-Plane Spin Polarization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07447</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07447v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Researchers have recently identified a novel class of magnetism, termed "altermagnetism", which exhibits characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Here, we report a groundbreaking discovery of efficient field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching in a RuO$_2$ (101)/Co/Pt/Co/Pt/Ta structure. Our results demonstrate that the spin current flows along the [100] axis, induced by the in-plane charge current, with the spin polarization direction aligned parallel to the N\'eel vector. These z-polarized spins generate an out-of-plane anti-damping torque, enabling deterministic switching of the Co/Pt layer without the necessity of an external magnetic field. The altermagnetic spin splitting effect (ASSE) in RuO$_2$ promotes the generation of spin currents with pronounced anisotropic behavior, maximized when the charge current flows along the [010] direction. This unique capability yields the highest field-free switching ratio, maintaining stable SOT switching within an external field range of approximately 400 Oe. Notably, ASSE dominates the spin current, especially when the current is aligned with the [010] direction ({\theta} = 90{\deg}). Here, the spin polarization component creates a substantial field-like effective field, surpassing the damping-like field from . This highlights the crucial role of in enhancing spin-torque efficiency and elucidating spin flow modulation mechanics in this crystalline context. Our study highlights the potential of RuO$_2$ as a powerful spin current generator, paving the way for practical applications in spin-torque switching technologies and other cutting-edge spintronic devices.</description>

      <title>Attojoule superconducting thermal logic and memories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07552</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07552v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to stringent thermal budgets in cryogenic technologies such as superconducting quantum computers and sensors, minimizing the energy dissipation and power consumption of cryogenic electronic components is pivotal for large-scale devices. However, electronic building blocks that simultaneously offer low energy consumption, fast switching, low error rates, a small footprint and simple fabrication remain elusive. In this work, we demonstrate a superconducting switch with attojoule switching energy, high speed (pico-second rise/fall times), and high integration density (on the order of $10^{-2}$ $\mathrm{\mu m^2}$ per switch). The switch consists of a superconducting channel and a metal heater separated by an insulating silica layer, prepared using lift-off techniques. We experimentally demonstrate digital gate operations utilizing this technology, such as NOT, NAND, NOR, AND, and OR gates, with a few femtojoule energy consumption and ultralow bit error rates &lt; $10^{-8}$. In addition, we build volatile memory elements with few femtojoule energy consumption per operation, a nanosecond operation speed, and a retention time over $10^5$ s. These superconducting switches open new possibilities for increasing the size and complexity of modern cryogenic technologies.</description>

      <title>Multiparameter admittance spectroscopy for investigating defects in MoS${_2}$ thin film MOSFETs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07783v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A method for assessing the quality of electronic material properties of thin-film metal oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs) is presented. By investigating samples with MOCVD-grown MoS${_2}$ channels exposed to atmospheric conditions, the existence of electron traps in MoS${_2}$ and at the interface between the gate insulator and the thin-film MoS${_2}$ are revealed. Differential conductance and capacitance data of the transistor channels are plotted as 3D surfaces on a base plane spanned by the measurement frequency versus the gate voltage. The existence of defects is confirmed by comparison with ideal results from a theoretical model.</description>

      <title>Transformation of a cellular skyrmion to polyomino-like structures</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07298</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07298v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological spin structures with transformable shapes may have potential implications on data storage and computation. Here, we demonstrate that a square cellular skyrmion on an artificial grid pinning pattern can be manipulated by programmed current pulses. We find that parallel short pulses could result in the elongation of the skyrmion mainly in the current direction, while parallel long pulses are able to induce the elongation in the direction perpendicular to the current due to the intrinsic skyrmion Hall effect. Consequently, a programmed sequence of parallel pulses could lead to the transformation of the skyrmion to I-, L-, and Z-shaped polyomino-like structures without affecting the topological charge. In addition, we find that orthogonal pulses could lead to the transformation to more complex polyomino-like structures, including the T-shaped and irregular ones. Particularly, when a small T-shaped structure is formed, the topological charge of the system is found to be non-integer due to incomplete compensation of local topological charge densities; however, the T-shaped structure is stable on the attractive pinning pattern. Our results offer an effective way to create polyomino-like spin structures toward functional applications.</description>

      <title>Bimerons create bimerons: proliferation and aggregation induced by currents and magnetic fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07303</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07303v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The aggregation of topological spin textures at nano and micro scales has practical applications in spintronic technologies. Here, the authors report the in-plane current-induced proliferation and aggregation of bimerons in a bulk chiral magnet. It is found that the spin-transfer torques can induce the proliferation and aggregation of bimerons only in the presence of an appropriate out-of-plane magnetic field. It is also found that a relatively small damping and a relatively large non-adiabatic spin-transfer torque could lead to more pronounced bimeron proliferation and aggregation. Particularly, the current density should be larger than a certain threshold in order to trigger the proliferation; namely, the bimerons may only be driven into translational motion under weak current injection. Besides, the authors find that the aggregate bimerons could relax into a deformed honeycomb bimeron lattice with a few lattice structure defects after the current injection. The results are promising for the development of bio-inspired spintronic devices that use a large number of aggregate bimerons. The findings also provide a platform for studying aggregation-induced effects in spintronic systems, such as the aggregation-induced lattice phase transitions.</description>

      <title>Electrically Tuning Quasi-Bound States in the Continuum with Hybrid Graphene-Silicon Metasurfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07343</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07343v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Metasurfaces have become one of the most prominent research topics in the field of optics owing to their unprecedented properties and novel applications on an ultrathin platform. By combining graphene with metasurfaces, electrical tunable functions can be achieved with fast tuning speed, large modulation depth and broad tuning range. However, the tuning efficiency of hybrid graphene metasurfaces within the short-wavelength infrared (SWIR) spectrum is typically low because of the small resonance wavelength shift in this wavelength range. In this work, through the integration of graphene and silicon metasurfaces that support quasi-bound states in the continuum (quasi-BIC), we experimentally demonstrate significant transmittance tuning even with less than 30 nm resonance wavelength shift thanks to the high quality-factor of quasi-BIC metasurfaces. The tunable transmittance spectrum was measured using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) with a modified reflective lens to improve the accuracy, and the electrical tuning was realized utilizing the cut-and-stick method of ion gel. At the wavelength of 3.0 um, the measured change of transmittance T_max-T_min and modulation depth (T_max-T_min)/T_max can reach 22.2% and 28.9%, respectively, under a small bias voltage ranging from -2 V to +2 V. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first experimental demonstration of tunable graphene/quasi-BIC metasurfaces, which have potential applications in optical modulation, reconfigurable photonic devices, and optical communications.</description>

      <title>Stability Analysis of Cantilever-like Structures with Applications to Soft Robotic Arms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07601</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07601v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The application of variational structure for analyzing problems in the physical sciences is widespread. Cantilever-like problems, where one end is subjected to a fixed value and the other end is free, have been less studied, especially in terms of their stability despite their abundance. In this article, we develop the stability conditions for these problems by examining the second variation of the energy functional using the generalized Jacobi condition, which includes computing conjugate points. These conjugate points are determined by solving a set of initial value problems from the resulting linearized equilibrium equations. We apply these conditions to investigate the nonlinear stability of intrinsically curved elastic cantilevers subject to a tip load. Kirchhoff rod theory is employed to model the elastic rod deformations. The role of intrinsic curvature in inducing complex nonlinear phenomena, such as snap-back instability, is particularly emphasized. This snap-back instability is demonstrated using various examples, highlighting its dependence on various system parameters. The presented examples illustrate the potential applications in the design of flexible soft robotic arms and mechanisms.</description>

      <title>Ferromagnetic CrBr$_3$-Induced Graphene Spintronics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.07602v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Our proposed spin valve prototype showcases a sophisticated design featuring a two-dimensional graphene bilayer positioned between layers of ${CrBr}_3$ ferromagnetic insulators. In this model, proximity coupling plays a pivotal role, influencing the magnetization orientations of the graphene layers and significantly impacting the \textit{in-plane} conductivity of the ${CrBr}_3$ layers. In this present work, we position the graphene bilayer between two layers of the ferromagnetic insulator ${CrBr}_3$ to establish this configuration. Using density functional theory, we conduct detailed computations to analyze the electronic structure of this sandwiched system. Our findings reveal a notable finite gap at specific \textit{k}-points, particularly evident in the antiparallel configuration of the magnetizations. This finding represents a significant advancement in spintronics, underscoring the potential of our spin valve prototype to drive innovation in electronic device technologies.</description>

      <title>High power GaSb-based distributed feedback laser with laterally coupled dielectric gratings at 1.95{\mu}m</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07690</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07690v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Traditional Distributed Feedback (DFB) or Distributed Bragg Reflector (DBR) lasers typically utilize buried gratings as frequency-selective optical feedback mechanisms. However, the fabrication of such gratings often necessitates regrowth processes, which can pose technical challenges for materials platforms such as GaAs and GaSb. Metal gratings were also used for GaSb lasers but they introduce additional absorption loss that limits device efficiency and output power. In this paper, we introduce a novel laterally coupled dielectric Bragg grating structure, which enables highly controllable, deterministic, and stable coupling between the grating and the optical mode. Our device demonstrates a continuous-wave output power of 47.02 mW at room temperature, exhibiting stable single-mode operation from 300-1000 mA and achieving a maximum side mode suppression ratio of 46.7 dB. These results underscore the innovative lateral coupled dielectric grating as a feasible and technologically superior approach for fabricating DFB and DBR lasers, which hold universal applicability across different material platforms and wavelength bands.</description>

      <title>Pentagonal Photonic Crystal Mirrors: Scalable Lightsails with Enhanced Acceleration via Neural Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07896</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07896v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Starshot Breakthrough Initiative aims to send one-gram microchip probes to Alpha Centauri within 20 years, using gram-scale lightsails propelled by laser-based radiation pressure, reaching velocities nearing a fifth of light speed. This mission requires lightsail materials that challenge the fundamentals of nanotechnology, requiring innovations in optics, material science and structural engineering. Unlike the microchip payload, which must be minimized in every dimension, such lightsails need meter-scale dimensions with nanoscale thickness and billions of nanoscale holes to enhance reflectivity and reduce mass. Our study employs neural topology optimization, revealing a novel pentagonal lattice-based photonic crystal (PhC) reflector. The optimized designs shorten acceleration times, therefore lowering launch costs significantly. Crucially, these designs also enable lightsail material fabrication with orders-of-magnitude reduction in costs. We have fabricated a 60 x 60 mm$^2$, 200nm thick, single-layer reflector perforated with over a billion nanoscale features; the highest aspect-ratio nanophotonic element to date. We achieve this with nearly 9,000 times cost reduction per m$^2$. Starshot lightsails will have several stringent requirements but will ultimately be driven by costs to build at scale. Here we highlight challenges and possible solutions in developing lightsail materials - showcasing the potential of scaling nanophotonics for cost-effective next-generation space exploration.</description>

      <title>Waves in space-dependent and time-dependent materials: a systematic comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.13428</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.13428v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Waves in space-dependent and time-dependent materials obey similar wave equations, with interchanged time- and space-coordinates. However, since the causality conditions are the same in both types of material (i.e., without interchangement of coordinates), the solutions are dissimilar.
  We present a systematic treatment of wave propagation and scattering in 1D space-dependent and time-dependent materials. After formulating unified equations, we discuss Green's functions and simple wave field representations for both types of material. Next we discuss propagation invariants, i.e., quantities that are independent of the space coordinate in a space-dependent material (such as the net power-flux density) or of the time coordinate in a time-dependent material (such as the net field-momentum density). A discussion of reciprocity theorems leads to the well-known source-receiver reciprocity relation for the Green's function of a space-dependent material and a new source-receiver reciprocity relation for the Green's function of a time-dependent material. A discussion of general wave field representations leads to the well-known expression for Green's function retrieval from the correlation of passive measurements in a space-dependent material and a new expression for Green's function retrieval in a time-dependent material.
  After an introduction of a matrix-vector wave equation, we discuss propagator matrices for both types of material. Since the initial condition for a propagator matrix in a time-dependent material follows from the boundary condition for a propagator matrix in a space-dependent material by interchanging the time- and space-coordinates, the propagator matrices for both types of material are interrelated in the same way. This also applies to representations and reciprocity theorems involving propagator matrices.</description>

      <title>Optoionic Impedance Spectroscopy (OIS): a model-less technique for in-situ electrochemical characterization of mixed ionic electronic conductors</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.06632v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Functional properties of mixed ionic electronic conductors (MIECs) can be radically modified by (de)insertion of mobile charged defects. A complete control of this dynamic behaviour has multiple applications in a myriad of fields including advanced computing, data processing, sensing or energy conversion. However, the effect of different MIECs state-of-charge is not fully understood yet and there is a lack of strategies for fully controlling the defect content in a material. In this work we present a model-less technique to characterize ionic defect concentration and ionic insertion kinetics in MIEC materials: Optoionic Impedance Spectroscopy (OIS). The proof of concept and advantages of OIS are demonstrated by studying the oxygen (de)insertion in thin films of hole-doped perovskite oxides. Ion migration into/out of the studied materials is achieved by the application of an electrochemical potential, achieving stable and reversible modification of its optical properties. By tracking the dynamic variation of optical properties depending on the gating conditions, OIS enables to extract electrochemical parameters involved in the electrochromic process. The results demonstrate the capability of the technique to effectively characterize the kinetics of single- and even multi- layer systems. The technique can be employed for studying underlying mechanisms of the response characteristics of MIEC-based devices.</description>
