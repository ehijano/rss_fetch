      <title>Polygonal equalities and $p$-negative type</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06658</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06658v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Nontrivial $p$-polygonal equalities impose certain conditions on the geometry of a metric space $(X,d)$ and so it is of interest to be able to identify the values of $p \in [0,\infty)$ for which such equalities exist. Following work of Li and Weston, Kelleher, Miller, Osborn and Weston established that if a metric space $(X,d)$ is of $p$-negative type, then $(X,d)$ admits no nontrivial $p$-polygonal equalities if and only if it is of strict $p$-negative type. In this note we remove the underlying premise of $p$-negative type from this theorem. As an application we show that the set of all $p$ for which a finite metric space $(X,d)$ admits a nontrivial $p$-polygonal equality is always a closed interval of the form $[\wp, \infty)$, where $\wp &gt; 0$, or the empty set. It follows that for each $q \not= 2$, the Schatten $q$-class $\mathcal{C}_{q}$ admits a nontrivial $p$-polygonal equality for each $p &gt; 0$. Other spaces with this same property include $C[0, 1]$ and $\ell_{q}^{(3)}$ for all $q &gt; 2$.</description>

      <title>Beyond trees: the metric geometry of subsets of weighted Hamming cubes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06684</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06684v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Associated to any finite metric space are a large number of objects and quantities which provide some degree of structural or geometric information about the space. In this paper we show that in the setting of subsets of weighted Hamming cubes there are unexpected relationships between many of these quantities. We obtain in particular formulas for the determinant of the distance matrix, the $M$-constant and the cofactor sum for such spaces. This work extends previous results for unweighted metric trees, and more generally, for subsets of standard Hamming cubes, as well as results for weighted metric trees. Finally we consider polygonal equalities in these spaces, giving a complete description of nontrivial $1$-polygonal equalities that can arise in weighted Hamming cubes.</description>

      <title>Order isomorphisms of sup-stable function spaces: continuous, Lipschitz, c-convex, and beyond</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06857</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06857v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: There have been many parallel streams of research studying order isomorphisms of some specific sets $\mathcal{G}$ of functions from a set $\mathcal{X}$ to $\mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}$, such as the sets of convex or Lipschitz functions. We provide in this article a unified abstract approach inspired by $c$-convex functions. Our results are obtained highlighting the role of inf and sup-irreducible elements of $\mathcal{G}$ and the usefulness of characterizing them, to subsequently derive the structure of order isomorphisms, and in particular of those commuting with the addition of scalars. We show that in many cases all these isomorphisms $J:\mathcal{G}\to\mathcal{G}$ are of the form $Jf=g+f\circ \phi$ for a translation $g:\mathcal{X}\to\mathbb{R}$ and a bijective reparametrization $\phi:\mathcal{X}\to \mathcal{X}$. We apply our theory to the sets of $c$-convex functions on compact Hausdorff spaces, to the set of lower semicontinuous (convex) functions on a Hausdorff topological vector space and to Lipschitz and 1-Lipschitz functions of complete metric spaces.</description>

      <title>Asymptotic theory of Schatten classes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.07145</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.07145v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The study of Schatten classes has a long tradition in geometric functional analysis and related fields. In this paper we study a variety of geometric and probabilistic aspects of finite-dimensional Schatten classes of not necessarily square matrices. Among the main results are the exact and asymptotic volume of the Schatten-$\infty$ unit ball, the boundedness of its isotropy constant, a Poincar\'e-Maxwell-Borel lemma for the uniform distribution on the Schatten-$\infty$ ball, and Sanov-type large deviations principles for the singular values of matrices sampled uniformly from the Schatten-$p$ unit ball for any $0 &lt; p \leq \infty$.</description>

      <title>On checking $\mathrm{L}^p$-admissibility for parabolic control systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06250</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06250v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this note we discuss the difficulty of verifying $\mathrm{L}^p$-admissibility for $p\neq 2$ -- that even manifests in the presence of a self-adjoint semigroup generator on a Hilbert space -- and survey tests for $\mathrm{L}^p$-admissibility of given control operators. These tests are obtained by virtue of either mapping properties of boundary trace operators, yielding a characterization of admissibility via abstract interpolation spaces; or through Laplace--Carleson embeddings, slightly extending results from Jacob, Partington and Pott to a class of systems which are not necessarily diagonal with respect to sequence spaces. Special focus is laid on illustrating the theory by means of examples based on the heat equation on various domains.</description>

      <title>Lack of isomorphic embeddings of $\ell_{p,q}$ into $L_{p,q}(\mathcal{M},\tau)$ over a noncommutative probability space</title>

Abstract: We prove that the sequence space $\ell_{p,q}$ does not embed into $L_{p,q}(\mathcal{M},\tau)$ for any noncommutative probability space $(\mathcal{M},\tau)$, $1&lt; p&lt;\infty $, $1\le q&lt;\infty$, $p\ne q$. Several applications to the isomorphic classification of noncommutative $L_{p,q}$-spaces are given, which extend and complement several earlier results.</description>

      <title>Regular inclusions of simple unital $C^*$-algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.06959</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.06959v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We prove that an inclusion $\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{A}$ of simple unital $C^*$-algebras with a finite-index conditional expectation is regular if and only if there exists a finite group $G$ that admits a cocycle action $(\alpha,\sigma)$ on the intermediate $C^*$-subalgebra $\mathcal{C}$ generated by $\mathcal{B}$ and its centralizer $\mathcal{C}_\mathcal{A}(\mathcal{B})$ such that $\mathcal{B}$ is outerly $\alpha$-invariant and $(\mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{A}) \cong ( \mathcal{B} \subset \mathcal{C}\rtimes^r_{\alpha, \sigma} G)$. Prior to this characterization, we prove the existence of two-sided and unitary quasi-bases for the minimal conditional expectation of any such inclusion, and also show that such an inclusion has integer Watatani index and depth at most $2$.</description>

      <title>Algebraic structures in the family of non-Lebesgue measurable sets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.11810</link>
      <description>arXiv:2105.11810v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In the additive topological group $(\mathbb{R},+)$ of real numbers, we construct families of sets for which elements are not measurable in the Lebesgue sense. The constructed families have algebraic structures of being semigroups (i.e., closed under finite unions of sets), and invariant under the action of the group $\Phi(\mathbb{R})$ of all translations of $\mathbb{R}$ onto itself. Those semigroups are constructed by using Vitali selectors and Bernstein subsets on $\mathbb{R}$. In particular, we prove that the family $(\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{B})\vee \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{V}))*\mathcal{N}_0:=\{((U_1\cup U_2)\setminus N)\cup M: U_1\in \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{B}), U_2\in \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{V}), N,M\in \mathcal{N}_0\} $ is a semigroup of sets, invariant under the action of $\Phi(\mathbb{R})$ and consists of sets which are not measurable in the Lebesgue sense. Here, $\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{B})$ is the collection of all finite unions of some type of Bernstein subsets of $\mathbb{R}$; $\mathcal{S}(\mathcal{V})$ is the collection of all finite unions of Vitali selectors of $\mathbb{R}$; and $\mathcal{N}_0$ is the $\sigma$-ideal of all subsets of $\mathbb{R}$ having the Lebesgue measure zero.</description>

      <title>Wold decomposition for isometries with equal range</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04445</link>
      <description>arXiv:2309.04445v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Let $n \geq 2$, and let $V=(V_1,\dots, V_n)$ be an $n$-tuple of isometries acting on a Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$. We say that $V$ is an $n$-tuple of isometries with equal range if $V_i^{m_i}V_j^{m_j}\mathcal{H} = V_j^{m_j} V_i^{m_i}\mathcal{H}$ and $V_i^{*m_i}V_j^{m_j} \mathcal{H} = V_j^{m_j} V_i^{*m_i}\mathcal{H}$ for $m_i,m_j \in \mathbb{Z}_+$, where $1 \leq i&lt;j \leq n$.
  We prove that each $n$-tuple of isometries with equal range admits a unique Wold decomposition. We obtain analytic models of the above class, and as a consequence, we show that the wandering data are complete unitary invariants for $n$-tuples of isometries with equal range. Our results unify all prior findings on the decomposition for tuples of isometries in the existing literature.</description>

      <title>A fuzzy algorithm for image rescaling and its comparison with other methods of digital image processing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.14545</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.14545v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The aim of this paper is to present a comparison among the fuzzy-type algorithm for image rescaling introduced by Jurio et al., 2011, quoted in the list of references, with some other existing algorithms such as the classical bicubic algorithm and the so-called sampling Kantorovich (SK) one. Note that, the SK algorithm is a recent tool for image rescaling and enhancement that revealed to be useful in several applications to real world problems, while bicubic algorithm is widely known in the literature. The comparison among the above mentioned algorithms (all implemented by MatLab programming language) has been done in term of suitable similarity indexes such as the Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) and the likelihood index $S$. Moreover, also the CPU time of the considered algorithms has been analysed.</description>

      <title>The local geometry of idempotent Schur multipliers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.02895</link>
      <description>arXiv:2312.02895v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A Schur multiplier is a linear map on matrices which acts on its entries by multiplication with some function, called the symbol. We consider idempotent Schur multipliers, whose symbols are indicator functions of smooth Euclidean domains. Given $1&lt;p\neq 2&lt;\infty$, we provide a local characterization (under some mild transversality condition) for the boundedness on Schatten $p$-classes of Schur idempotents in terms of a lax notion of boundary flatness. We prove in particular that all Schur idempotents are modeled on a single fundamental example: the triangular projection. As an application, we fully characterize the local $L_p$-boundedness of smooth Fourier idempotents on connected Lie groups. They are all modeled on one of three fundamental examples: the classical Hilbert transform, and two new examples of Hilbert transforms that we call affine and projective. Our results in this paper are vast noncommutative generalizations of Fefferman's celebrated ball multiplier theorem. They confirm the intuition that Schur multipliers share profound similarities with Euclidean Fourier multipliers |even in the lack of a Fourier transform connection| and complete, for Lie groups, a longstanding search of Fourier $L_p$-idempotents.</description>

      <title>Redefining fractals by Suzuki contraction</title>

      <description>arXiv:2403.11462v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: There has been a significant effort in recent years to generalize the traditional concept of iterated function systems (IFS).In this article, we proposed Suzuki contraction in hyperspace and finding out the fixed point for Hutchinson mapping, which is called a deterministic fractal. The deterministic fractal for such a Suzuki contraction mapping is shown to exist and to be unique. We propose the Suzuki IFS (SIFS) in the literature for fractal creation based on this conclusion. Keywords: Fixed point, iterated function system, Suzuki contraction, Suzuki iterated function system, Attractor (Deterministic Fractal).</description>
