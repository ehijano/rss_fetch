      <title>Quantifying community evolves in temporal networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10632</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10632v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: When we detect communities in temporal networks it is important to ask questions about how they change in time. Normalised Mutual Information (NMI) has been used to measure the similarity of communities when the nodes on a network do not change. We propose two extensions namely Union-Normalised Mutual Information (UNMI) and Intersection-Normalised Mutual Information (INMI). UNMI and INMI evaluate the similarity of community structure under the condition of node variation. Experiments show that these methods are effective in dealing with temporal networks with the changes in the set of nodes, and can capture the dynamic evolution of community structure in both synthetic and real temporal networks. This study not only provides a new similarity measurement method for network analysis but also helps to deepen the understanding of community change in complex temporal networks.</description>

      <title>Destabilizing a Social Network Model via Intrinsic Feedback Vulnerabilities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10868v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Social influence plays an important role in shaping individual opinions and actions, particularly in our digitally connected world. AI-generated, personalized content has led to serious and well-founded concerns, including United States Supreme Court Cases regarding the potential for the radicalization of individuals based on social influence. Motivated by these developments, we present a case study investigating the effects of small but intentional perturbations on the integrity of a simple social network. We employ Taylor's classic model of social influence and use tools from robust control theory (most notably the Dynamic Structure Function (DSF)), to identify precisely the perturbations that are sufficient to qualitatively alter the system's equilibrium and also minimal in norm. In particular, we examine two scenarios: perturbations to an existing link and perturbations taking the form of the addition of a new link to the network. In each case, we identify destabilizing perturbations and simulate their effects. Remarkably, we find that even small alterations to network structure may cause sentiments to grow in magnitude without bound, indicating the potential for large-scale shifts in collective behavior to be triggered by minor adjustments in social influence. Our findings emphasize the imperative need for further investigation into vulnerabilities in real-world social networks, where such dynamics may already exist.</description>

      <title>Spectral Subspace Clustering for Attributed Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11074</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11074v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Subspace clustering seeks to identify subspaces that segment a set of n data points into k (k&lt;&lt;n) groups, which has emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing data from various domains, especially images and videos. Recently, several studies have demonstrated the great potential of subspace clustering models for partitioning vertices in attributed graphs, referred to as SCAG. However, these works either demand significant computational overhead for constructing the nxn self-expressive matrix, or fail to incorporate graph topology and attribute data into the subspace clustering framework effectively, and thus, compromise result quality.
  Motivated by this, this paper presents two effective and efficient algorithms, S2CAG and M-S2CAG, for SCAG computation. Particularly, S2CAG obtains superb performance through three major contributions. First, we formulate a new objective function for SCAG with a refined representation model for vertices and two non-trivial constraints. On top of that, an efficient linear-time optimization solver is developed based on our theoretically grounded problem transformation and well-thought-out adaptive strategy. We then conduct an in-depth analysis to disclose the theoretical connection of S2CAG to conductance minimization, which further inspires the design of M-S2CAG that maximizes the modularity. Our extensive experiments, comparing S2CAG and M-S2CAG against 17 competitors over 8 benchmark datasets, exhibit that our solutions outperform all baselines in terms of clustering quality measured against the ground truth while delivering high efficiency</description>

      <title>Examining Platformization in Cultural Production: A Comparative Computational Analysis of Hit Songs on TikTok and Spotify</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11205</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11205v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The (re)creation and distribution of cultural products such as music are increasingly shaped by digital platforms. This study explores how TikTok and Spotify, situated in different governance and user contexts, could influence digital music production and reception within each platform and between each other. Focusing on daily hit song charts as the embodiment of platformization, we collected and analyzed a two-year longitudinal dataset on TikTok and Spotify. We tested the relationships between elements of platformization and hit song popularity within each platform, and examined cross-platform influence flow. Results reveal significant differences in major label, genre, and content features among hit songs on TikTok and Spotify, which can be explained by their distinct platformization practices. We also found some evidence that hit song popularity on Spotify might precede that on TikTok. This study illustrates both the platform-specific mechanisms of TikTok and Spotify and their interconnectedness in the cultural production ecosystem.</description>

      <title>Timescale-agnostic characterisation for collective attention events</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11500v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Online communications, and in particular social media, are a key component of how society interacts with and promotes content online. Collective attention on such content can vary wildly. The majority of breaking topics quickly fade into obscurity after only a handful of interactions, while the possibility exists for content to ``go viral'', seeing sustained interaction by large audiences over long periods. In this paper we investigate the mechanisms behind such events and introduce a new representation that enables direct comparison of events over diverse time and volume scales. We find four characteristic behaviours in the usage of hashtags on Twitter that are indicative of different patterns of attention to topics. We go on to develop an agent-based model for generating collective attention events to test the factors affecting emergence of these phenomena. This model can reproduce the characteristic behaviours seen in the Twitter dataset using a small set of parameters, and reveal that three of these behaviours instead represent a continuum determined by model parameters rather than discrete categories. These insights suggest that collective attention in social systems develops in line with a set of universal principles independent of effects inherent to system scale, and the techniques we introduce here present a valuable opportunity to infer the possible mechanisms of attention flow in online communications.</description>

      <title>Hierarchical-Graph-Structured Edge Partition Models for Learning Evolving Community Structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose a novel dynamic network model to capture evolving latent communities within temporal networks. To achieve this, we decompose each observed dynamic edge between vertices using a Poisson-gamma edge partition model, assigning each vertex to one or more latent communities through \emph{nonnegative} vertex-community memberships. Specifically, hierarchical transition kernels are employed to model the interactions between these latent communities in the observed temporal network. A hierarchical graph prior is placed on the transition structure of the latent communities, allowing us to model how they evolve and interact over time. Consequently, our dynamic network enables the inferred community structure to merge, split, and interact with one another, providing a comprehensive understanding of complex network dynamics. Experiments on various real-world network datasets demonstrate that the proposed model not only effectively uncovers interpretable latent structures but also surpasses other state-of-the art dynamic network models in the tasks of link prediction and community detection.</description>

      <title>Tenure and Research Trajectories</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10575v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tenure is a cornerstone of the US academic system, yet its relationship to faculty research trajectories remains poorly understood. Conceptually, tenure systems may act as a selection mechanism, screening in high-output researchers; a dynamic incentive mechanism, encouraging high output prior to tenure but low output after tenure; and a creative search mechanism, encouraging tenured individuals to undertake high-risk work. Here, we integrate data from seven different sources to trace US tenure-line faculty and their research outputs at an unprecedented scale and scope, covering over 12,000 researchers across 15 disciplines. Our analysis reveals that faculty publication rates typically increase sharply during the tenure track and peak just before obtaining tenure. Post-tenure trends, however, vary across disciplines: in lab-based fields, such as biology and chemistry, research output typically remains high post-tenure, whereas in non-lab-based fields, such as mathematics and sociology, research output typically declines substantially post-tenure. Turning to creative search, faculty increasingly produce novel, high-risk research after securing tenure. However, this shift toward novelty and risk-taking comes with a decline in impact, with post-tenure research yielding fewer highly cited papers. Comparing outcomes across common career ages but different tenure years or comparing research trajectories in tenure-based and non-tenure-based research settings underscores that breaks in the research trajectories are sharply tied to the individual's tenure year. Overall, these findings provide a new empirical basis for understanding the tenure system, individual research trajectories, and the shape of scientific output.</description>

      <title>Labeled Datasets for Research on Information Operations</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.10609v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Social media platforms have become a hub for political activities and discussions, democratizing participation in these endeavors. However, they have also become an incubator for manipulation campaigns, like information operations (IOs). Some social media platforms have released datasets related to such IOs originating from different countries. However, we lack comprehensive control data that can enable the development of IO detection methods. To bridge this gap, we present new labeled datasets about 26 campaigns, which contain both IO posts verified by a social media platform and over 13M posts by 303k accounts that discussed similar topics in the same time frames (control data). The datasets will facilitate the study of narratives, network interactions, and engagement strategies employed by coordinated accounts across various campaigns and countries. By comparing these coordinated accounts against organic ones, researchers can develop and benchmark IO detection algorithms.</description>

      <title>Never eat a Pigeon with a Pumpkin: a model for the emergence and fixation of unsupported beliefs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10743</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.10743v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A popular poster from Myanmar lists food pairings that should be avoided, sometimes at all costs. Coconut and honey taken together, for example, are believed to cause nausea, while pork and curdled milk will induce diarrhea. Worst of all, according to the poster, many seemingly innocuous combinations that include jelly and coffee, beef and star fruit, or pigeon and pumpkin, are likely to kill the unwary consumer. But why are these innocuous combinations considered dangerous, even fatal? The answer is relevant, not just to food beliefs, but to social beliefs of many kinds. Here we describe the prevalence of food combination superstitions, and an opinion formation model simulating their emergence and fixation. We find that such food norms are influenced, not just by actual risks, but also by strong forces of cultural learning that can drive and lock in arbitrary rules, even in the face of contrary evidence.</description>

      <title>Training a Label-Noise-Resistant GNN with Reduced Complexity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11020v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely employed for semi-supervised node classification tasks on graphs. However, the performance of GNNs is significantly affected by label noise, that is, a small amount of incorrectly labeled nodes can substantially misguide model training. Mainstream solutions define node classification with label noise (NCLN) as a reliable labeling task, often introducing node similarity with quadratic computational complexity to more accurately assess label reliability. To this end, in this paper, we introduce the Label Ensemble Graph Neural Network (LEGNN), a lower complexity method for robust GNNs training against label noise. LEGNN reframes NCLN as a label ensemble task, gathering informative multiple labels instead of constructing a single reliable label, avoiding high-complexity computations for reliability assessment. Specifically, LEGNN conducts a two-step process: bootstrapping neighboring contexts and robust learning with gathered multiple labels. In the former step, we apply random neighbor masks for each node and gather the predicted labels as a high-probability label set. This mitigates the impact of inaccurately labeled neighbors and diversifies the label set. In the latter step, we utilize a partial label learning based strategy to aggregate the high-probability label information for model training. Additionally, we symmetrically gather a low-probability label set to counteract potential noise from the bootstrapped high-probability label set. Extensive experiments on six datasets demonstrate that LEGNN achieves outstanding performance while ensuring efficiency. Moreover, it exhibits good scalability on dataset with over one hundred thousand nodes and one million edges.</description>

      <title>From Primes to Paths: Enabling Fast Multi-Relational Graph Analysis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11149</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11149v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-relational networks capture intricate relationships in data and have diverse applications across fields such as biomedical, financial, and social sciences. As networks derived from increasingly large datasets become more common, identifying efficient methods for representing and analyzing them becomes crucial. This work extends the Prime Adjacency Matrices (PAMs) framework, which employs prime numbers to represent distinct relations within a network uniquely. This enables a compact representation of a complete multi-relational graph using a single adjacency matrix, which, in turn, facilitates quick computation of multi-hop adjacency matrices. In this work, we enhance the framework by introducing a lossless algorithm for calculating the multi-hop matrices and propose the Bag of Paths (BoP) representation, a versatile feature extraction methodology for various graph analytics tasks, at the node, edge, and graph level. We demonstrate the efficiency of the framework across various tasks and datasets, showing that simple BoP-based models perform comparably to or better than commonly used neural models while offering improved speed and interpretability.</description>

      <title>$\nu$-LPA: Fast GPU-based Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) for Community Detection</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.11468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Community detection is the problem of identifying natural divisions in networks. Efficient parallel algorithms for identifying such divisions are critical in a number of applications. This report presents an optimized implementation of the Label Propagation Algorithm (LPA) for community detection, featuring an asynchronous LPA with a Pick-Less (PL) method every 4 iterations to handle community swaps, ideal for SIMT hardware like GPUs. It also introduces a novel per-vertex hashtable with hybrid quadratic-double probing for collision resolution. On an NVIDIA A100 GPU, our implementation, $\nu$-LPA, outperforms FLPA, NetworKit LPA, and GVE-LPA by 364x, 62x, and 2.6x, respectively, on a server with dual 16-core Intel Xeon Gold 6226R processors - processing 3.0B edges/s on a 2.2B edge graph - and achieves 4.7% higher modularity than FLPA, but 6.1% and 2.2% lower than NetworKit LPA and GVE-LPA.</description>

      <title>Link Prediction on Textual Edge Graphs</title>

      <description>arXiv:2405.16606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Textual-edge Graphs (TEGs), characterized by rich text annotations on edges, are increasingly significant in network science due to their ability to capture rich contextual information among entities. Existing works have proposed various edge-aware graph neural networks (GNNs) or let language models directly make predictions. However, they often fall short of fully capturing the contextualized semantics on edges and graph topology, respectively. This inadequacy is particularly evident in link prediction tasks that require a comprehensive understanding of graph topology and semantics between nodes. In this paper, we present a novel framework - Link2Doc, designed especially for link prediction on textual-edge graphs. Specifically, we propose to summarize neighborhood information between node pairs as a human-written document to preserve both semantic and topology information. A self-supervised learning model is then utilized to enhance GNN's text-understanding ability from language models. Empirical evaluations, including link prediction, edge classification, parameter analysis, runtime comparison, and ablation studies, on four real-world datasets demonstrate that Link2Doc achieves generally better performance against existing edge-aware GNNs and pre-trained language models in predicting links on TEGs.</description>

      <title>Network and Sentiment Analysis of Enron Emails</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.21063v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The objective of the research was to analyze e-mails exchanged at Enron, a power company that declared bankruptcy in 2001 following an investigation into unethical operations regarding their financials. Like other researchers, we identify the most important employees and detect communities using network science methods. We find that the importance of a person depends on the centrality measure used; while the communities we detected resembled the formal organizational structure of the company. In addition, because previous work required that 10 e-mails be sent and received for an e-mail relationship to exist, we analyzed the effect of different thresholds on the results and found that results were very dependent on the threshold used. We also performed sentiment analyses on the e-mails to evaluate whether sentiment changed over time and found that the sentiments of the e-mails do not give insight into the financial wellbeing of Enron. Our results provide insight into how information flowed through Enron, who the key employees were, and e-mail sentiment before and after the crisis</description>

      <title>Why distinctiveness centrality is distinctive</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02076</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.02076v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper responds to a commentary by Neal (2024) regarding the Distinctiveness centrality metrics introduced by Fronzetti Colladon and Naldi (2020). Distinctiveness centrality offers a novel reinterpretation of degree centrality, particularly emphasizing the significance of direct connections to loosely connected peers within (social) networks. This response paper presents a more comprehensive analysis of the correlation between Distinctiveness and the Beta and Gamma measures. All five distinctiveness measures are considered, as well as a more meaningful range of the alpha parameter and different network topologies, distinguishing between weighted and unweighted networks. Findings indicate significant variability in correlations, supporting the viability of Distinctiveness as alternative or complementary metrics within social network analysis. Moreover, the paper presents computational complexity analysis and simplified R code for practical implementation. Encouraging initial findings suggest potential applications in diverse domains, inviting further exploration and comparative analyses.</description>

      <title>Taming the Long Tail in Human Mobility Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14970</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.14970v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: With the popularity of location-based services, human mobility prediction plays a key role in enhancing personalized navigation, optimizing recommendation systems, and facilitating urban mobility and planning. This involves predicting a user's next POI (point-of-interest) visit using their past visit history. However, the uneven distribution of visitations over time and space, namely the long-tail problem in spatial distribution, makes it difficult for AI models to predict those POIs that are less visited by humans. In light of this issue, we propose the Long-Tail Adjusted Next POI Prediction (LoTNext) framework for mobility prediction, combining a Long-Tailed Graph Adjustment module to reduce the impact of the long-tailed nodes in the user-POI interaction graph and a novel Long-Tailed Loss Adjustment module to adjust loss by logit score and sample weight adjustment strategy. Also, we employ the auxiliary prediction task to enhance generalization and accuracy. Our experiments with two real-world trajectory datasets demonstrate that LoTNext significantly surpasses existing state-of-the-art works. Our code is available at https://github.com/Yukayo/LoTNext.</description>

      <title>Degree Matrix Comparison for Graph Alignment</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07475</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.07475v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Graph alignment considers the optimal node correspondence across networks. To advance unsupervised graph alignment algorithms on plain graphs, we propose Degree Matrix Comparison (DMC). Through extensive experiments and mathematical motivations, we demonstrate the potential of this method. Remarkably, DMC achieves up to 99% correct node alignment for 90%-overlap graphs and 100% accuracy for isomorphic graphs. Additionally, we propose a reduced version of DMC (Greedy DMC) that provides a solution to the graph alignment problem with lower time complexity. DMC could significantly impact graph alignment, offering a reliable solution for the task.</description>

      <title>Variational Graph Autoencoder for Heterogeneous Information Networks with Missing and Inaccurate Attributes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.07929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2311.07929v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Heterogeneous Information Networks (HINs), which consist of various types of nodes and edges, have recently demonstrated excellent performance in graph mining. However, most existing heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) ignore the problems of missing attributes, inaccurate attributes and scarce labels for nodes, which limits their expressiveness. In this paper, we propose a generative self-supervised model GraMI to address these issues simultaneously. Specifically, GraMI first initializes all the nodes in the graph with a low-dimensional representation matrix. After that, based on the variational graph autoencoder framework, GraMI learns both node-level and attribute-level embeddings in the encoder, which can provide fine-grained semantic information to construct node attributes. In the decoder, GraMI reconstructs both links and attributes. Instead of directly reconstructing raw features for attributed nodes, GraMI generates the initial low-dimensional representation matrix for all the nodes, based on which raw features of attributed nodes are further reconstructed to leverage accurate attributes. In this way, GraMI can not only complete informative features for non-attributed nodes, but rectify inaccurate ones for attributed nodes. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to show the superiority of GraMI in tackling HINs with missing and inaccurate attributes.</description>

      <title>DocNet: Semantic Structure in Inductive Bias Detection Models</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10965</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.10965v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: News will have biases so long as people have opinions. It is increasingly important for informed citizens to be able to identify bias as social media becomes the primary entry point for news and partisan differences increase. If people know the biases of the news they are consuming, they will be able to take action to avoid polarizing echo chambers. In this paper, we explore an often overlooked aspect of bias detection in documents: the semantic structure of news articles. We present DocNet, a novel, inductive, and low-resource document embedding and bias detection model that outperforms large language models. We also demonstrate that the semantic structure of news articles from opposing partisan sides, as represented in document-level graph embeddings, have significant similarities. These results can be used to advance bias detection in low-resource environments. Our code, data, and the corresponding datasheet are made available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/DocNet/.</description>

      <title>Modularity aided consistent attributed graph clustering via coarsening</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07128</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.07128v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Graph clustering is an important unsupervised learning technique for partitioning graphs with attributes and detecting communities. However, current methods struggle to accurately capture true community structures and intra-cluster relations, be computationally efficient, and identify smaller communities. We address these challenges by integrating coarsening and modularity maximization, effectively leveraging both adjacency and node features to enhance clustering accuracy. We propose a loss function incorporating log-determinant, smoothness, and modularity components using a block majorization-minimization technique, resulting in superior clustering outcomes. The method is theoretically consistent under the Degree-Corrected Stochastic Block Model (DC-SBM), ensuring asymptotic error-free performance and complete label recovery. Our provably convergent and time-efficient algorithm seamlessly integrates with graph neural networks (GNNs) and variational graph autoencoders (VGAEs) to learn enhanced node features and deliver exceptional clustering performance. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods for both attributed and non-attributed graphs.</description>

      <title>UniTraj: Learning a Universal Trajectory Foundation Model from Billion-Scale Worldwide Traces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03859</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.03859v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Human trajectory modeling is essential for deciphering movement patterns and supporting advanced applications across various domains. However, existing methods are often tailored to specific tasks and regions, resulting in limitations related to task specificity, regional dependency, and data quality sensitivity. Addressing these challenges requires a universal human trajectory foundation model capable of generalizing and scaling across diverse tasks and geographic contexts. To this end, we propose UniTraj, a Universal human Trajectory foundation model that is task-adaptive, region-independent, and highly generalizable. To further enhance performance, we construct WorldTrace, the first large-scale, high-quality, globally distributed dataset sourced from open web platforms, encompassing 2.45 million trajectories with billions of points across 70 countries. Through multiple resampling and masking strategies designed for pre-training, UniTraj effectively overcomes geographic and task constraints, adapting to heterogeneous data quality. Extensive experiments across multiple trajectory analysis tasks and real-world datasets demonstrate that UniTraj consistently outperforms existing approaches in terms of scalability and adaptability. These results underscore the potential of UniTraj as a versatile, robust solution for a wide range of trajectory analysis applications, with WorldTrace serving as an ideal but non-exclusive foundation for training.</description>
