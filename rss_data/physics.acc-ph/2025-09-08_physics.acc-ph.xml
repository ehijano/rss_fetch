      <title>Express Diagnostic of Intense Laser-driven MeV Radiation Source using Copper Isotopes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06581</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.06581v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We explored the generation and diagnosis of high-brightness MeV bremsstrahlung radiation caused by intense beam of relativistic electrons propagating in a tantalum converter. The intense electron beam was produced through direct laser acceleration mechanism in the interaction of relativistic high-power sub-ps laser pulse with near critical density plasma. We propose to detect the divergence angle and photon fluence of high-brightness and high-energy gamma radiation source based on the nuclear activation method. The radioactive 62^Cu was generated through photonuclear reactions 63^Cu(gamma,n) 62^Cu and the subsequent beta^+ decay of 62^Cu was measured to derive characteristics of the gamma radiation source. This method provides an express approach to diagnose the laser-driven MeV radiation source and a potential efficient way to produce 62^Cu isotopes.</description>

      <title>AttoSHINE: Generation of continuous-wave terawatt-scale attosecond X-ray pulses at SHINE</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07213</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.07213v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Attosecond X-ray pulses are a critical tool for tracking ultrafast electron dynamics in condensed matter, molecular systems, and strongly correlated materials. Recent breakthroughs have pushed X-ray free electron lasers (XFELs) into the attosecond domain, significantly surpassing their previous femtosecond capabilities. Building on these advancements, this work investigates the potential of the Shanghai High Repetition Rate XFEL and Extreme Light Facility (SHINE), China's first continuous-wave (CW) XFEL, to generate intense attosecond X-ray pulses, thereby offering transformative capabilities for X-ray science. Through comprehensive start-to-end simulations, we show that SHINE is capable of producing hard X-ray pulses with peak powers reaching the terawatt-scale and average pulse durations of approximately 300 as. This is achieved using a self-chirping scheme within the existing machine configuration, requiring no additional hardware. Our findings demonstrate that CW XFELs can generate intense attosecond X-ray pulses at megahertz repetition rates, opening new opportunities for real-time studies of electronic dynamics in complex systems.</description>

      <title>Prism-based compensation of group delay dispersion in the components of a femtosecond laser resonator and analysis of the influence of prism configuration on laser radiation parameters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18688</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.18688v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A mathematical algorithm is described for calculating the minimum distance between prisms and the allowable prism insertion depth into the laser beam when solving the general problem of intracavity group delay dispersion (GDD) compensation. GDD is caused by the optical elements of the master oscillator in a femtosecond laser system. The calculation was carried out using analytical and geometrical methods. The influence of changing the distance between the prisms and the depth of their insertion into the laser beam on the GDD compensation has been investigated. Under experimental conditions, this changes the Q-factor of the laser resonator, which determines the central wavelength of the radiation and its spectral width in a titanium-sapphire laser.</description>
