      <title>Group-circulant singularities and partial desingularization preserving normal crossings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09114</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09114v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The subject is partial desingularization preserving the normal crossings singularities of an algebraic or analytic variety X (over the complex field or over an uncountable algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, in the algebraic case). Our approach has three parts involving distinct techniques: (1) a formal splitting theorem for regular or analytic functions which satisfy a generic splitting hypothesis; (2) a study of singularities in the closure of the normal crossings locus, based on the combinatorics of G-circulant matrices, where G is a finite abelian group, leading to a theorem on reduction to group-circulant normal form; (3) a partial desingularization theorem, proved using (1) and (2) together with weighted blowings-up of group-circulant singularities. Previous results were for partial desingularization preserving simple normal crossings, or preserving general normal crossings when dim X &lt; 5.</description>

      <title>Euler characteristics of the universal Picard stack</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09117v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study $\mathbb{S}_n$-equivariant topological and weight-graded compactly-supported Euler characteristics of the universal Picard stack $\mathrm{Pic}_{g, n}^d \to \mathcal{M}_{g, n}$ of degree-$d$ line bundles over $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}$. We prove that in the weight-zero and topological cases, the generating function for Euler characteristics of $\mathrm{Pic}_{g, n}^d$ is obtained from the corresponding one for $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}$ by an extremely simple combinatorial transformation. This lets us deduce closed formulas for the two generating functions, taking as input the Chan--Faber--Galatius--Payne formula in the weight-zero case and Gorsky's formula in the topological case. As a corollary, we also obtain a closed formula for the topological Euler characteristic of $\mathrm{Pic}^d_g$. Our weight-zero calculation is a corollary of a general result passing from the weight-graded Euler characteristics of $\mathcal{M}_{g, n}$ to those of $\mathrm{Pic}_{g,n}^d$.</description>

      <title>Generic flatness of the cohomology of thickenings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09201</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09201v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Given a set of $m$ distinct points in projective space over a field, and $t$ a positive integer, a classical question asks for the least degree of a hypersurface that passes through each point with multiplicity at least $t$. Related to this, it remains unresolved whether there exists a dense open set of $m$-tuples of points for which this least degree is constant for each $t\ge 1$. We formulate a conjecture regarding the generic freeness of certain local cohomology modules that would answer this in the affirmative; we then prove this conjecture for up to $n+2$ points in projective $n$-space over a field. In a related direction, we prove a generic flatness result for the cohomology of thickenings of a closed subscheme of projective space over an integral domain.</description>

      <title>Weil restriction and the motivic cycle class map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09215</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09215v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The etale cycle class map links Chow groups with etale cohomology. Within the framework of motivic cohomology, the motivic cycle class map appears as a comparison morphism relating motivic and Lichtenbaum cohomology. By examining the comparison morphism constructed by Geisser and Levine, we show that the motivic cycle class map is induced by the etale cycle class map. We then study the behavior of cycle class maps under Weil restriction. Extending Karpenko's construction of the Weil restriction for algebraic cycles and Chow groups, we introduce a corresponding Weil restriction for l-adic cohomology and prove its compatibility with the motivic cycle class map. This provides a conceptual explanation for the descent of cycle classes under finite Galois extensions.</description>

      <title>A proof of Dolbeault geometric Langlands for $\GL_2$ with reduced spectral curves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09359</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09359v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In our previous paper with Tudor P\u{a}durariu, we introduced the notion of limit categories for moduli stacks of Higgs bundles and formulated the Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence. These limit categories are expected to provide an effective ``classical limit'' of the categories of D-modules on the moduli stack of bundles, and our formulation links categorical Donaldson-Thomas theory with the geometric Langlands correspondence.
  In this paper, we prove the above Dolbeault geometric Langlands correspondence for $\GL_2$ over the locus in the Hitchin base where the spectral curves are reduced. This is the first non-trivial case in which the relevant moduli stacks are not quasi-compact, and the use of limit categories is essential to the formulation and proof of the correspondence.
  Our approach also outlines a strategy for proving the correspondence in greater generality and explains the current obstructions to such an extension.</description>

Abstract: We construct a family of points on the Lagrangian cone of a partial flag bundle associated to a (possibly non-split) vector bundle from any Weyl-invariant $I$-function of a prequotient. This result can be seen as the nonabelian analogue of the mirror theorem for projective bundles in arXiv:2307.03696, and generalizes Oh's mirror theorem for split partial flag bundles in arXiv:1607.08326.</description>

      <title>On semidefinite-representable sets over valued fields</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09702</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09702v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Polyhedra and spectrahedra over the real numbers, or more generally their images under linear maps, are respectively the feasible sets of linear and semidefinite programming, and form the family of semidefinite-representable sets. This paper studies analogues of these sets, as well as the associated optimization problems, when the data are taken over a valued field $K$. For $K$-polyhedra and linear programming over $K$ we present an algorithm based on the computation of Smith normal forms. We prove that fundamental properties of semidefinite-representable sets extend to the valued setting. In particular, we exhibit examples of non-polyhedral $K$-spectrahedra, as well as sets that are semidefinite-representable over $K$ but are not $K$-spectrahedra.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09706v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This short note is devoted to the study of $G$-Higgs bundles twisted by a central gerbe. These objects arise naturally in the decomposition of the inertia stacks of $G$-Higgs bundles in terms of coendoscopic data. We establish that stabilised point-counts and cohomology are insensitive to the central twist. Along the way we show an analogue of Ng\^o's product formula for twisted Hitchin fibres.</description>

      <title>Hecke curves in Frobenius strata of moduli space of rank 2 vector bundles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09879</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09879v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Let $k$ be an algebraically closed field with characteristic $2$, and let $X$ be a smooth projective algebraic curve of genus $g \geqslant 2$ over $k$. Let $\mathcal{M}^s_X(2,\mathcal{L})$ be the moduli space of rank $2$ stable vector bundles with determinant $\mathcal{L}$ on $X$. The Frobenius stratification measures the instability of bundles in $\mathcal{M}^s_X(r,\mathcal{L})$ under pullback by the Frobenius map. We show that there exists a Frobenius stratum in $\mathcal{M}^s_X(2,\mathcal{L})$ which is covered by Hecke curves.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2602.09966v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We compute an explicit closed formula for the Hilbert polynomial of the Jacobian algebra $M(f)$ of a reduced surface $X:f=0$ in $\mathbb P^3$ in terms of the graded Betti numbers of the algebra $M(f)$. When $X$ has only isolated singularities, a result by A. du Plessis and C. T. C. Wall yields new necessary condition for a set of positive integers to be the graded Betti numbers of the Jacobian algebra of such a surface. The comparison with the plane curve case is discussed in detail and additional information is given in the case of nodal surfaces.</description>

Abstract: We study holomorphic vector fields whose singular locus contains a local complete intersection smooth positive-dimensional component. We prove global and local formulas expressing the limiting Milnor/Poincare-Hopf contribution along such a component in terms of its embedded scheme structure, and we obtain sharp lower bounds for this contribution under holomorphic perturbations. We provide explicit families show optimality and illustrate how singularities may redistribute between a fixed neighborhood of the component and the part at infinity in projective compactifications.</description>

      <title>Equivalence of flat connections and Fay identities on arbitrary Riemann surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09108</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09108v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A flat connection on a Riemann surface with values in an infinite dimensional Lie algebra provides a systematic and effective tool for generating an infinite family of polylogarithms via iterated integrals. The recent literature offers different types of connections, in one or several variables, on compact Riemann surfaces with or without punctures, and in the meromorphic or single-valued categories. In this work, we show that the flatness conditions for the single-valued and modular DHS connection in multiple variables, which was introduced in the companion paper arXiv:2602.01461, are equivalent to the union of all the interchange and Fay identities among DHS integration kernels that were proven in arXiv:2407.11476. Based on the same combinatorial techniques, the flatness conditions on the multivariable Enriquez connection is shown to imply the union of all the interchange and Fay identities for Enriquez kernels.</description>

      <title>Total positivity in twisted flag varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09350</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09350v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Let $G$ be a Kac-Moody group, split over $\mathbb R$. The totally nonnegative part of $G$ and its (ordinary) flag variety $G/B^+$ was introduced by Lusztig. It is known that the totally nonnegative parts of $G$ and $G/B^+$ have remarkable combinatorial and topological properties.
  In this paper, we consider the totally nonnegative part of the $J$-twisted flag variety $G/{}^J B^+$, where ${}^J B^+$ is the Borel subgroup opposite to $B^+$ in the standard parabolic subgroup $P_J^+$ of $G$. The $J$-twisted flag varieties include the ordinary flag variety $G/B^+$ as a special case. Our main result show that the totally nonnegative part of $G/{}^J B^+$ decomposes into cells, and the closure of each cell is a regular CW complex. This generalizes the work of Galashin-Karp-Lam \cite{GKL22} and the joint work of Bao with the first author \cite{BH24} for ordinary flag varieties.
  As an application, we deduce that the totally nonnegative part of the double flag variety $G/B^+ \times G/B^-$ with respect to the diagonal $G$-action has similar nice properties. We also establish some connections between the totally nonnegative part of the double flag with the canonical basis of the tensor product of a lowest weight module with a highest weight module of $G$.
  As another application, we show that the link of identity in a totally nonnegative reduced double Bruhat cell of $G$ is a regular CW complex. This generalizes the work of Hersh \cite{Her14} on the link of $U_{\geq0}^-$ and gives a positive answer to an open question of Fomin and Zelevinsky.</description>

      <title>Discrete-time, discrete-state multistate Markov models from the perspective of algebraic statistics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09619</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.09619v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study discrete-time, discrete-state multistate Markov models from the perspective of algebraic statistics. These models are widely studied in event history analysis, and are characterized by the state space, the initial distribution and the transition probabilities. A finite path under the multistate Markov model is a particular set of states occupied at finite time instances $\{1, \dots, n\}$. The main goal of this paper is to establish a bridge between event history analysis and algebraic statistics. The joint probabilities of finite paths in these models have a natural monomial parametrization in terms of the initial distribution and the transition probabilities. We study the polynomial relations among joint path probabilities. When the statistical constraints on the parameters are disregarded, nonhomogeneous multistate Markov models of arbitrary order can be viewed as slices of decomposable hierarchical models. This yields a complete description of their vanishing ideals as toric ideals generated by explicit families of binomials. Moreover, the variety of this vanishing ideal equals the nonhomogeneous multistate Markov model on the probability simplex. In contrast, homogeneous multistate Markov models exhibit different algebraic behavior, as time homogeneity imposes additional polynomial relations, leading to vanishing ideals that are strictly larger than in the nonhomogeneous case. We also derive families of binomial relations that vanish on homogeneous multistate Markov models. We investigate maximum likelihood estimation from statistical and algebraic perspectives. For nonhomogeneous models, classical and algebraic formulas agree; in the homogeneous case, the algebraic approach is more complex. Lastly, we provide data applications where we demonstrate the statistical theory to obtain the maximum likelihood estimates of the parameters under specific multistate Markov models.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.08652v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a new method to study mixed characteristic deformation of line bundles. In particular, for sufficiently large smooth projective families $f : \mathscr{X} \to \mathscr{S}$ defined over the ring of $N$-integers $\mathscr{O}_{L}[1/N]$ of a number field $L$, we produce a proper closed subscheme $\mathscr{E} \subsetneq \mathscr{S}$ outside of which all line bundles appearing in positive characteristic fibres of $f$ admit characteristic zero lifts. This in particular applies to elliptic surfaces over $\mathbb{P}^1$ and projective hypersurfaces in $\mathbb{P}^3$ of degree $d \geq 5$. We also study the locus in $\mathscr{E}$ in more detail in the $h^{0, 2} = 2$ case.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2406.00463v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the question whether a real threefold X fibred into quadric surfaces over the real projective line is stably rational (over R) if the topological space X(R) is connected. We give a counterexample. When all geometric fibres are irreducible, the question is open. We investigate a family of such fibrations for which the intermediate jacobian technique is not available. We produce two independent methods which in many cases enable one to prove decomposition of the diagonal.</description>

      <title>Models of hypersurfaces and Bruhat-Tits buildings</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.02638</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.02638v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We propose a new approach to constructing semistable integral models of hypersurfaces over a discretely valued complete field K. For each stable hypersurface X over K we define a continuous stability function on the Bruhat-Tits building of PGL_{n+1}(K); its global minima control semistable hypersurface models after finite extensions of K. In particular, in residue characteristic zero the problem reduces to minimizing this function on the original building and then passing to a finite extension that turns a rational minimizer into a vertex. This extends work of Kollar and of Elsenhans-Stoll on minimal hypersurface models. We implement the resulting strategy for plane curves over p-adic number fields. In a follow-up article we use our results to compute the semistable reduction of smooth plane quartics.</description>

      <title>The Hodge conjecture for Weil fourfolds with discriminant 1 via singular OG6-varieties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.13607v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We give a new proof of the Hodge conjecture for abelian fourfolds of Weil type with discriminant 1 and all of their powers. The Hodge conjecture for these abelian fourfolds was proven by Markman using hyperholomorphic sheaves on hyper-K\"ahler varieties of generalized Kummer type, and by constructing semiregular sheaves on abelian varieties. Our proof instead relies on a direct geometric relation between abelian fourfolds of Weil type with discriminant 1 and the six-dimensional hyper-K\"ahler varieties $\widetilde{K}$ of O'Grady type arising as crepant resolutions $\widetilde{K}\to K$ of a locally trivial deformation of a singular moduli space of sheaves on an abelian surface. As applications, we establish the Hodge conjecture and the Tate conjecture for any variety $\widetilde{K}$ of OG6-type as above, and all of its powers.</description>

      <title>De Rham Theory in Derived Differential Geometry</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03978</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.03978v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the question: What is the de Rham theory for general differentiable spaces? We identify two potential answers and study them. In the first part, we show that the de Rham cohomology calculated using (the completion of) the exterior algebra of the cotangent complex yields non-trivial local invariants for singular differentiable spaces. In particular, in some cases, it differs from the constant sheaf cohomology, which provides an obstruction for the de Rham comparison map to be an equivalence. Moreover, we provide conditions under which this local invariant trivializes, yielding a de Rham-type isomorphism. In the second part, we show that for a suitably defined de Rham stack, there is always an isomorphism between functions on it and constant sheaf cohomology of the underlying topological space. Consequently, there exists a version of the de Rham theorem for singular differentiable spaces which holds with almost no restrictions. Finally, we sketch a generalization of this result to other theories of smooth functions, such as holomorphic or analytic functions. The last part is thus related to analytic de Rham stacks of Rodriguez Camargo used by Scholze to geometrize the local Langlands correspondence.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2507.21399v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Laurent Lafforgue's presentation of a Grassmannian Gr$^{d, E}$ naturally comes equipped with the induced action of a subtorus $\mathbb{T}_\bullet$ of PGL$(E)$. By investigating the defining ideals of $\mathbb{T}_\bullet$-orbit closures through general points of Gr$^{d,E}$ and studying their degenerations, we obtain a morphsim $\mathfrak{q}: \mathbb{F}^{d, E_\bullet} \to \mathbb{H}^{d, E_{\bullet}}$ such that $\mathbb{H}^{d, E_\bullet}$, termed the $\mathfrak{G}$-quotient of Gr$^{d,E}$ by $\mathbb{T}_\bullet$, is birational to $[{\rm Gr}^{d, E}/\mathbb{T}_\bullet]$, and $\mathfrak{q}$, termed $\mathfrak{G}$-family of Gr$^{d,E}$ by $\mathbb{T}_\bullet$, is a family of general $\mathbb{T}_\bullet$-orbit closures and their degenerations. We obtain a series of new results on $\mathbb{H}^{d, E_{\bullet}}$ and $\mathbb{F}^{d, E_\bullet}$.</description>

      <title>Stabilization of intersection Betti numbers for moduli spaces of one-dimensional sheaves on surfaces</title>

      <description>arXiv:2511.18426v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a unified approach to study the intersection Betti numbers of moduli spaces of one-dimensional semistable sheaves on smooth projective surfaces. Assuming the irreducibility of such moduli spaces, we prove that their intersection Betti numbers in a certain range of degrees coincide with the stable Betti numbers of Hilbert schemes of points. As an application, for minimal surfaces of Kodaira dimension 0, we show that these intersection Betti numbers stabilize in each fixed degree, which fits into the broader context of stable cohomology for moduli spaces of sheaves. In the case of Enriques surfaces, we also prove a refined stabilization result related to Oberdieck's conjecture on perverse Hodge numbers.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2512.19544v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We determine the Picard number and the Ulrich complexity of general bidouble covers of the projective plane, providing the first systematic study of Ulrich bundles on non-cyclic abelian covers. For a bidouble plane branched along three smooth curves of degrees $n_1,n_2,n_3$, we show that $\rho(S)=1$ unless $(n_1,n_2,n_3)$ belongs to an explicit list, thereby extending Buium's classical results on double planes to the non-cyclic case. As an application, we determine the range of branch degrees for which Ulrich line bundles could exist. Our method combines the invariant-theoretic decomposition of $H^2(S,\mathbb{Q})$ under the Galois group with cohomological criteria for Ulrich bundles.</description>

      <title>On curves of degree 10 with 12 triple points</title>

      <description>arXiv:2601.07809v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We construct an irreducible rational curve of degree 10 in $CP^2$ which has 12 triple points and a union of three rational quartics with 19 triple points. This gives counter-examples to a conjecture by Dimca, Harbourne, and Sticlaru. We also prove that there exists an analytic family $C_u$ of curves of degree 10 with 12 triple points which tends as $u\to 0$ to the union of the dual Hesse arrangement of lines (9 lines with 12 triple points) with an additional line. We hope that our approach to the proof of the latter fact could be of independent interest.</description>

Abstract: We study the nef cones and fundamental domains of Hilbert schemes of points on the Cayley K3 surface $S$ and its generalizations $S_a$. For the Hilbert square $S^{[2]}$, we explicitly compute the nef cone and describe a fundamental domain using the automorphisms of $S^{[2]}$ and lattice-theoretic methods. For higher Hilbert schemes $S_a^{[n]}$, we determine the nef cones using Bridgeland stability methods that identify the contracted curves defining walls and the divisors generating the extremal rays.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2405.17174v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This article establishes alcove walk models for intersections of Schubert varieties and partially semi-infinite orbits in the affine Grassmannian of a split reductive group (we call such intersections parabolic Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen intersections). More precisely, we describe explicit cellular pavings of these intersections, indexed by certain positively-folded alcove walks. We prove a parametrization of the irreducible components of maximal possible dimension, in terms of alcove walks of maximal possible dimension. We then deduce a new combinatorial description of branching to Levi subgroups of irreducible highest weight representations, and in particular we give a new algorithm for computing the characters of such representations.</description>

Abstract: Given a variety with a suitable Brauer class, we present a general pullback construction that produces varieties that has Brauer--Manin obstruction to the existence of rational points. We then study Severi--Brauer fibrations and their Brauer groups without relying on explicit defining equations. As a key application, we show that there exist Severi--Brauer fibrations with index one that fails Hasse principle.</description>

      <title>Shifted Poisson structures on higher Chevalley-Eilenberg algebras</title>

      <description>arXiv:2412.12804v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper develops a graphical calculus to determine the $n$-shifted Poisson structures on finitely generated semi-free commutative differential graded algebras. When applied to the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of an ordinary Lie algebra, we recover Safronov's result that the $(n=1)$- and $(n=2)$-shifted Poisson structures in this case are given by quasi-Lie bialgebra structures and, respectively, invariant symmetric tensors. We generalize these results to the Chevalley-Eilenberg algebra of a Lie $2$-algebra and obtain $n\in\{1,2,3,4\}$ shifted Poisson structures in this case, which we interpret as semi-classical data of `higher quantum groups'.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.10302v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a class of signomials whose positive support is the set of vertices of a simplex and which may have several negative support points in the simplex. Various groups of authors have provided an exact characterization for the global nonnegativity of a signomial in this class in terms of circuit signomials and that characterization provides a tractable nonnegativity test. We generalize this characterization to the constrained nonnegativity over a set $X$ under an additional convexity precondition in the exponential moment space. This provides a tractable nonnegativity test over $X$ for the class in terms of a power cone program. Our proof methods rely on a variant of the convex cone of constrained SAGE signomials (sums of arithmetic-geometric exponentials) and the duality theory.</description>

      <title>Three lectures on tropical algebra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08664</link>
      <description>arXiv:2602.08664v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This document is a slightly expanded version of a series of talks given by J. Giansiracusa at the workshop `Geometry over semirings' at Universitat Aut\`{o}noma de Barcelona in July 2025. In the first lecture we introduce tropical polynomials, ideals, congruences, and how the connection with tropical geometry is made via congruences of bend relations. Tropical geometry and matroid theory are telling us that we should focus attention on a narrow slice of the world of tropical algebra, and this leads to the theory of tropical ideals (as developed by Maclagan and Rinc\'{o}n) and an abundance of interesting open questions. In the second lecture we examine the relationship between Berkovich analytification and tropicalization from the perspective of bend relations, giving a refinement of Payne's influential limit theorem. In the third lecture we set aside geometry and focus on tropicalization via bend relations as a construction in commutative and non-commutative algebra. Constructions such as symmetric algebras, exterior algebras, matrix algebras, and Clifford algebras can be tropicalized. In the case of exterior algebras, the resulting tropical notion beautifully completes the picture of the Pl\"{u}cker embedding and gives a new perspective on the tropical Pl\"{u}cker relations. For matrix algebras and Clifford algebras, Morita theory becomes an interesting topic.</description>
