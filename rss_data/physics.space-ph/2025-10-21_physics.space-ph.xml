      <title>Ionization Rate of Interstellar Neutral Helium from New Horizons/SWAP Observations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17563</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17563v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Interstellar neutral (ISN) atoms enable studies of the physical conditions in the local interstellar medium surrounding the heliosphere. ISN helium, which is the most abundant species at 1 au, is directly observed by space missions, such as Interstellar Boundary Explorer (IBEX). However, some of these atoms are ionized by solar ultraviolet radiation before reaching 1 au, producing pickup ions (PUIs). A recent analysis of IBEX data suggests that the helium photoionization rates predicted by models are underestimated by up to 40%. The Solar Wind Around Pluto (SWAP) instrument on board New Horizons enables the study of PUIs giving complementary insight into the other side of the ionization process. Our goal is to verify this increased helium ionization by determining the ionization rate of ISN helium in the heliosphere based on the SWAP observations of helium PUIs. For this purpose, we analyze SWAP data collected between 2012 and 2022, at distances 22 to 54 au from the Sun. We develop a new method for fitting model distribution functions to the observational data using the maximum likelihood method. Our approach accounts for the spacecraft's rotation and the SWAP response function, which depends on both energy and inflow direction. We estimate SWAP's efficiency for helium relative to that for hydrogen and determine the ISN helium ionization rate. We find that the photoionization rate obtained from the SWAP observations is 43% larger than the rates predicted by models, confirming the IBEX results.</description>

      <title>Properties of current sheets in two-dimensional tearing-mediated magnetohydrodynamic turbulence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.16707v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: It is well known that the nonlinear evolution of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) turbulence generates intermittent current sheets. In the solar wind turbulence, current sheets are frequently observed and they are believed to be an important pathway for the turbulence energy to dissipate and heat the plasma. In this study, we perform a comprehensive analysis of current sheets in a high-resolution two-dimensional simulation of balanced, incompressible MHD turbulence. The simulation parameters are selected such that tearing mode instability is triggered and plasmoids are generated throughout the simulation domain. We develop an automated method to identify current sheets and accurately quantify their key parameters including thickness ($a$), length ($L$), and Lundquist number ($S$). Before the triggering of tearing instability, the current sheet lengths are mostly comparable to the energy injection scale. After the tearing mode onsets, smaller current sheets with lower Lundquist numbers are generated. We find that the aspect ratio ($a/L$) of the current sheets scales approximately as $S^{-1/2}$, i.e. the Sweet-Parker scaling. While a power-law scaling between $L$ and $a$ is observed, no clear correlation is found between the upstream magnetic field strength and thickness $a$. Finally, although the turbulence energy shows anisotropy between the directions parallel and perpendicular to the local magnetic field increment, we do not observe a direct correspondence between the shape of the current sheets and that of the turbulence "eddies." These results suggest that one needs to be cautious when applying the scale-dependent dynamic alignment model to the analysis of current sheets in MHD turbulence.</description>

      <title>HelioFill: Diffusion-Based Model for EUV Reconstruction of the Solar Farside</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17012</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17012v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The loss of STEREO-B in 2014 created a persistent blind spot in Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) imaging of the solar farside. We present HelioFill, to the authors' knowledge, the first denoising-diffusion inpainting model that restores full-Sun EUV coverage by synthesizing the STEREO-B sector from Earth-side (SDO) and STEREO-A views. Trained on full-Sun maps from 2011-2014 (when SDO+STEREO-A+B provided 360 degrees coverage), HelioFill couples a latent diffusion backbone with domain-specific additions: spectral gating, confidence weighting, and auxiliary regularizers, to produce operationally suitable 304 Angstrom reconstructions. On held-out data, the model preserves the observed hemisphere with mean SSIM 0.871 and mean PSNR 25.56 dB, while reconstructing the masked hemisphere with mean SSIM 0.801 and mean PSNR 17.41 dB and reducing boundary error by approximately 21 percent (Seam L2) compared to a state-of-the-art diffusion inpainting model. The generated maps maintain cross-limb continuity and coronal morphology (loops, active regions, and coronal-hole boundaries), supporting synoptic products and cleaner inner-boundary conditions for coronal/heliospheric models. By filling observational gaps with observationally consistent EUV emission, HelioFill maintains continuity of full-Sun monitoring and complements helioseismic farside detections, illustrating how diffusion models can extend the effective utility of existing solar imaging assets for space-weather operations.</description>

      <title>Origin of Unusual Composition of 3He-Rich Solar Energetic Particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine 3He-rich solar energetic particles (SEPs) detected on 2023 October 24-25 by Solar Orbiter at 0.47 au. The measurements revealed that heavy-ion enhancements increase irregularly with mass, peaking at S. C, and especially N, Si, and S, stand out in the enhancement pattern with large abundances. Except for 3He, heavy ion spectra can only be measured below 0.5 MeV/nucleon. At 0.386 MeV/nucleon, the event showed a huge 3He/4He ratio of 75.2+/-33.9, larger than previously observed. Solar Dynamics Observatory extreme ultraviolet data showed a mini filament eruption at the solar source of 3He-rich SEPs that triggered a straight tiny jet. Located at the boundary of a low-latitude coronal hole, the jet base is a bright, small-scale region with a supergranulation scale size. The emission measure provides relatively cold source temperatures of 1.5 to 1.7 MK between the filament eruption and nonthermal type III radio burst onset. The analysis suggests that the emission measure distribution of temperature in the solar source could be a factor that affects the preferential selection of heavy ions for heating or acceleration, thus shaping the observed enhancement pattern. Including previously reported similar events indicates that the eruption of the mini filament is a common feature of events with heavy-ion enhancement not ordered by mass. Surprisingly, sources with weak magnetic fields showed extreme 3He enrichment in these events. Moreover, the energy attained by heavy ions seems to be influenced by the size and form of jets.</description>

      <title>Helium-3 Enrichment in Gradual Solar Energetic Particle Events: Evidence for Jet-Supplied Seed Population</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17134</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.17134v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Enhancements in 3He abundance, a characteristic feature of impulsive solar energetic particle (ISEP) events, are also frequently observed in gradual SEP (GSEP) events. Understanding the origin of this enrichment is crucial for identifying the mechanisms behind SEP generation. We investigate the origin of 3He enrichment in high-energy (25-50 MeV) solar proton events observed by SOHO, selecting events that coincide with &lt;1 MeV/nucleon 3He-rich periods detected by ACE during 1997-2021. The identified 3He enhancements include cases where material from independent impulsive (3He-rich) SEP events is mixed with GSEP proton populations. Two high-energy proton events exhibit elemental composition and solar source characteristics consistent with ISEPs. Extreme-ultraviolet imaging from SDO and STEREO reveals narrow, jet-like eruptions in the parent active regions of about 60% of the remaining events. Notably, the highest 3He/4He ratios occur when coronal jets are present, consistent with fresh, jet-driven injection of suprathermal 3He that is subsequently re-accelerated during the event. Correspondingly, jet-associated events show fewer pre-event (residual) 3He counts, indicating that enrichment in these cases does not primarily come from remnant material. We find a positive correlation between 3He/4He and Fe/O, strongest in jet-associated events, consistent with a common jet-supplied seed population re-accelerated by the CME shock.</description>

      <title>Passivity-Based Robust Shape Control of a Cable-Driven Solar Sail Boom for the CABLESSail Concept</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.14115v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Solar sails provide a means of propulsion using solar radiation pressure, which offers the possibility of exciting new spacecraft capabilities. However, solar sails have attitude control challenges because of the significant disturbance torques that they encounter due to imperfections in the sail and its supporting structure, as well as limited actuation capabilities. The Cable-Actuated Bio-inspired Lightweight Elastic Solar Sail (CABLESSail) concept was previously proposed to overcome these challenges by controlling the shape of the sail through cable actuation. The structural flexibility of CABLESSail introduces control challenges, which necessitate the design of a robust feedback controller for this system. The purpose of the proposed research here is to design a robust controller to ensure precise and reliable control of CABLESSail's boom. Taking into account the system dynamics and the dynamic properties of the CABLESSail concept, a passivity-based proportional-derivative (PD) controller for a single boom on the CABLESSail system is designed. To reach the nonzero desired setpoints, a feedforward input is additionally applied to the control law and a time-varying feedforward input is used instead of the constant one to effectively track a time-varying desired boom tip deflection. This control law is assessed by numerical simulations and by tests using a smaller-scale prototype of Solar Cruiser. Both the simulation and the test results show that this PD control with the time-varying feedforward input robustly controls the flexible cable-actuated solar sail.</description>
