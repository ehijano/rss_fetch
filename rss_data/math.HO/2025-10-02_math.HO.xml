      <title>Guess my number! From binary tricks to general base representations, how many cards are needed?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01844</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01844v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We revisit the classic 'guess my number' game and extend it from its familiar binary form to representations in any integer base. For each base we derive formulas for the number of cards needed to identify a given integer and, conversely, for the largest integer that can be determined when the number of cards is fixed. Both analysis and graphical evidence show that base 2 is optimal in both directions: it requires the fewest cards to represent any specified integer and, for a fixed card count, allows the widest range of integers to be guessed. Figures illustrate these results, and complete proofs appear in the Appendix.</description>

      <title>EEFSUVA: A New Mathematical Olympiad Benchmark</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Recent breakthroughs have spurred claims that large language models (LLMs) match gold medal Olympiad to graduate level proficiency on mathematics benchmarks. In this work, we examine these claims in detail and assess the extent to which current benchmarks capture genuine LLM mathematical reasoning. The composition of these benchmarks, primarily drawing from the International Mathematics Olympiad (IMO) and related competitions, may overstate models reasoning ability due to potential data contamination and a narrow focus on familiar problem types. To enable a more holistic assessment of mathematical understanding, we introduce EEFSUVA, a novel benchmark curated from under circulated regional and national Olympiads of Eastern Europe and the countries from the former Soviet Union. These contests feature problems of comparable difficulty to the IMO and are renowned for demanding nonstandard problem-solving techniques, yet their problems are far less prevalent in online corpora. Preliminary results suggest that even state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit a notable performance decline on EEFSUVA relative to other Olympiad-style benchmarks. These findings also suggest the potential importance of broader evaluation datasets for a fuller assessment of mathematical reasoning and for guiding future model development.</description>

      <title>A Graph-Theoretic Model for a Generic Three-Jug Puzzle</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13868</link>
      <description>arXiv:2308.13868v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A classic three-jug puzzle asks, given three jugs $A$, $B$, and $C$ with fixed maximum capacities, with jug $A$ filled with wine to its maximum capacity, whether is it possible to divide the wine into two halves by pouring it from one jug to another without using any other measuring devices. However, we consider a generic version of the three-jug puzzle and present an independent graph-theoretic model to determine whether the puzzle has a solution at all. If it has a solution, then the same can be determined using this model. We also present the sketch of an algorithm to determine the solution of the puzzle.</description>
