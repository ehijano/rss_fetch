      <title>Microrheological model for Kelvin-Voigt materials with micro-heterogeneities</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16468v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce a generalization of the Kelvin-Voigt model in order to include and characterize heterogeneities in viscoelastic semisolid materials. By considering a microrheological approach, we present analytical expressions for the mean square displacement and for the time-dependent diffusion coefficient of probe particles immersed in a viscoelastic material described by this model. Besides validating our theoretical approach through Brownian dynamics simulations, we show how the model can be used to describe experimental data obtained for polyacrylamide and laponite gels.</description>

      <title>Anti-thixotropic dynamics in attractive colloidal dispersions: a shear restructuring driven by elastic stresses</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16532</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16532v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to rich rheological properties, dispersions of attractive colloidal particles are ubiquitous in industries. Specifically, upon experiencing a sudden reduction in shear rate, these dispersions may exhibit transient behaviors such as thixotropy-where viscosity increases over time-and anti-thixotropy, characterized by an initial viscosity decrease before reaching a steady state. While thixotropy has been described as a competition between structure buildup and disruption, the mechanisms of anti-thixotropy remain poorly understood. Here, we investigate the anti-thixotropic dynamics of carbon black particles dispersed in oil-a system known for exhibiting anti-thixotropy-through flow step-down experiments. Using a multi-technique approach combining rheology with velocimetry and structural characterizations, we show that viscosity decrease results from a decrease in wall slip concomitant to shear-induced structural rearrangements, indicating a transition from a dynamical network of fractal clusters into a network of loosely connected dense agglomerates. Additionally, after a characteristic anti-thixotropic time $\tau$, a steady flow is reached. This time $\tau$ diverges with increasing shear rate at a critical value corresponding to a Mason number of one, indicating that anti-thixotropy occurs only when colloidal attraction outweighs viscous forces. More precisely, we show that the structural rearrangement underpinning the viscosity decrease is mediated by elastic stresses $\sigma_e$, such that $\tau \propto \sigma_e^{-3}$. Finally, on long time scales, the steady state is linked to a microstructure with nearly zero yield stress, indicating a loss of flow memory. These findings provide a mechanism for anti-thixotropy and suggest pathways for controlling viscosity and yield stress in attractive colloidal dispersions.</description>

      <title>Active chiral rotors: hydrodynamics and chemotaxis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16835</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16835v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An active chiral rotor is a spherical object that can generate chiral flows in a fluid by rotating about an axis. For example, if the flow around the upper hemisphere of the chiral rotor is in a clockwise direction, then the flow in the lower hemisphere is in the anti-clockwise direction, and vice versa. In this paper, we aim to study the combined behaviour of hydrodynamically interacting chiral rotors in the presence of an external chemical gradient. While a single isolated rotor is stationary in a fluid, a pair of rotors can move in linear or circular paths as they hydrodynamically interact with each other. It is observed that the emergent linear or circular trajectories depend on the type of rotors and the orientation of their rotation axes. The dynamics of the rotors are altered in a more complex environment, such as in an external chemical field. Interestingly, we observe two types of motion: chemotaxis and anti-chemotaxis. While in the anti-chemotaxis case, both rotors are driving away from the target, in the chemotaxis case, one of the rotors successfully reaches the chemical target. This study helps to understand the collective behavior of self-propelled microorganisms and artificial swimmers.</description>

      <title>Glassforming liquid crystalline equimolar mixtures of MHPOBC and fluorinated compounds -- structural, optical, and dielectric properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three liquid crystalline equimolar mixtures are formulated, each containing the MHPOBC compound and the homolog from the 3FmHPhF6 series with m = 4, 5 or 6. The properties of the mixtures are investigated by differential scanning calorimetry, polarizing optical microscopy, X-ray diffraction, electro-optic measurements, and UV-Vis-NIR and dielectric spectroscopies. In all mixtures, the smectic A*, smectic C*, and smectic C$_A$* phases are observed. Each mixture can be supercooled and forms the glass of smectic C$_A$* at 225-238 K. The glass transition temperature decreases with the increasing C$_m$H$_{2m}$ chain length in the 3FmHPhF6 molecule. The tilt angle in the smectic C$_A$* phase reaches 36.5-37.5{\deg}. The selective reflection of light in the visible and near-infrared spectral ranges is observed, with a strong dependence of the reflected light's wavenumber on temperature.</description>

      <title>Emergent collective behavior of cohesive, aligning particles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16994</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.16994v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Collective behavior is all around us, from flocks of birds to schools of fish. These systems are immensely complex, which makes it pertinent to study their behavior through minimal models. We introduce such a minimal model for cohesive and aligning self-propelled particles in which group cohesion is established through additive, non-reciprocal torques. These torques cause constituents to effectively turn towards one another. We additionally incorporate an alignment torque, which competes with the cohesive torque in the same spatial range. By changing the strength and range of these torque interactions, we uncover six states which we distinguish via their static and dynamic properties: a disperse state, a multiple worm state, a line state, a persistent worm state, a rotary worm state, and an aster state. Their occurrence strongly depends on initial conditions and stochasticity, so the model exhibits multistabilities. A number of the states exhibit collective dynamics which are reminiscent of those seen in nature.</description>

      <title>Numerical insights on the volume phase transition of thermoresponsive hollow microgels</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17020</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17020v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hollow microgels, consisting of a pNIPAM polymer network with a central cavity, have significant potential due to their tunable softness and encapsulation capabilities. Using molecular dynamics simulations, we thoroughly characterise the swelling behaviour of neutral hollow microgels across the Volume Phase Transition (VPT) upon varying crosslinker concentration, shell thickness, and size. In particular, we examine in detail the onset of cavity filling and its relation to the VPT, detecting the presence of a discontinuity in the radius of gyration of the microgels, if an appropriate balance between shell stiffness and thermoresposiveness is reached. The discontinuity is, however, absent in the behaviour of the hydrodynamic radius, in agreement with experimental observations. We then test our numerical model by direct comparison of form factors with available measurements in the literature and also establish a minimal-size, stable hollow microgel for future computationally feasible bulk investigations. Overall, our findings provide valuable insights into the fundamental swelling properties of hollow microgels that can be useful to control the opening and closing of the cavity for application purposes.</description>

      <title>A Variational Theory for Soft Shells</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17073</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17073v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Three general modes are distinguished in the deformation of a thin shell; these are stretching, drilling, and bending. Of these, the drilling mode is the one more likely to emerge in a soft matter shell (as compared to a hard, structural one), as it is ignited by a swerve of material fibers about the local normal. We propose a hyperelastic theory for soft shells, based on a separation criterion that envisages the strain-energy density as the sum of three independent pure measures of stretching, drilling, and bending. Each individual measure is prescribed to vanish on all other companion modes. The result is a direct, second-grade theory featuring a bending energy quartic in an invariant strain descriptor that stems from the polar rotation hidden in the deformation gradient (although quadratic energies are also appropriate in special cases). The proposed energy functional has a multi-well character, which fosters cases of soft elasticity (with a continuum of ground states) related to minimal surfaces.</description>

      <title>The fluid dynamics of liquid mushrooms</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17051</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17051v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Droplets that impact the surface of a deep liquid pool may form a vertical jet after the cavity formation event, provided they have sufficient impact energy. Depending on the associated time scales and the effect of the Rayleigh Plateau instability, this jet may either continue to rise, or may form satellite droplets via necking. Collision of these structures with a second incoming droplet, ejected from the same dispensing tip as the first droplet, may result in the formation of various lamellar patterns, depending on the impact conditions, giving rise to liquid mushroom and or umbrella structures. In this research, we experiment for the first time with hydrodynamics of such liquid mushrooms, and study the effect of droplet impact height, surface tension, and viscosity on the dynamics of such lamellar formations. We further explore the role of the orientation of incoming droplet impact, ie whether head on or offset collision with the rising jet or satellite droplet. We discuss the spatiotemporal evolution of the lamella diameters, and its susceptibility to surface tension, viscosity, and droplet impact height. We put forward a theoretical model based on energetics, to predict the maximum spread diameter of the lamellae, which yields accurate predictions with respect to our experiments. Our findings may help to provide important insights towards a fluid dynamic phenomenon observed often in nature and may be important in niche utilities as well.</description>

      <title>Hovering of an actively driven fluid-lubricated foil</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17080</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.17080v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Inspired by recent experimental observations of a harmonically excited elastic foil hovering near a wall while supporting substantial weight, we develop a theoretical framework that describes the underlying physical effects. Using elastohydrodynamic lubrication theory, we quantify how the dynamic deformation of the soft foil couples to the viscous fluid flow in the intervening gap. Our analysis shows that the soft foil rectifies the reversible forcing, breaking time-reversal symmetry; the relative spatial support of the forcing determines whether the sheet is attracted to or repelled from the wall. A simple scaling law predicts the time-averaged equilibrium hovering height and the maximum weight the sheet can sustain before detaching from the surface. Numerical simulations of the governing equation corroborate our theoretical predictions, are in qualitative agreement with experiments, and might explain the behavior of organisms while providing design principles for soft robotics.</description>

      <title>Tuning Higher Order Structure in Colloidal Fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.09029</link>
      <description>arXiv:2303.09029v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Colloidal particles self assemble into a wide range of structures under external AC electric fields due to induced dipolar interactions [Yethiraj and Van Blaaderen Nature 421 513 (2003)]. As a result of these dipolar interactions, at low volume fraction the system is modulated between a hard-sphere like state (in the case of zero applied field) and a "string fluid" upon application of the field. Using both particle-resolved experiments and Brownian dynamics simulations, we investigate the emergence of the string fluid with a variety of structural measures including two-body and higher-order correlations. The higher-order structure we probe using three-body spatial correlation functions and a many-body approach based on minimum energy clusters of a dipolar-Lennard-Jones system. This yields a series of geometrically distinct minimum energy clusters upon increasing the strength of the dipolar interaction, which are echoed in the higher-order structure of the colloidal fluids we study here. We find good agreement between experiment and simulation at the two-body level, although some discrepancies are found at higher field strength, where the system falls out of equilibrium. Higher-order correlations exhibit reasonable agreement between experiment and simulation, again with more discrepancy at higher field strength for three--body correlation functions. At higher field strength, the cluster population in our experiments and simulations is dominated by the minimum energy clusters for all sizes $8 \leq m \leq 12$. The agreement that we find here is notable considering that there is no fit parameter in our mapping between experiment and simulation.</description>

      <title>Theory and Modeling of Transport for Simple Fluids in Nanoporous Materials: From Microscopic to Coarse-Grained Descriptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03039</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.03039v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present the state-of-the-art theoretical modeling, molecular simulation, and coarse-graining strategies for the transport of gases and liquids in nanoporous materials (pore size 1-100 nm). Special emphasis is placed on the transport of small molecules in zeolites, active carbons, metal-organic frameworks, but also in nanoporous materials with larger pores such as ordered and disordered mesoporous oxides. We present different atomistic and mesoscopic methods as well as the theoretical formalisms. Attention is given to the investigation of different molecular transport coefficients - including the self, collective and transport diffusivities - but also to the determination of free energy barriers and their role in overall adsorption/separation process rates. We also introduce other available approaches such as hierarchical simulations and upscaling strategies. This review focuses on simple fluids in prototypical nanoporous materials. While the phenomena covered here capture the main physical mechanisms in such systems, complex molecules will exhibit additional specific features. For the sake of clarity and brevity, we also omit multicomponent systems (e.g. fluid mixtures, electrolytes, etc.) and electrokinetic effects arising when charged systems are considered (ionic species, charged surfaces, etc.), both of which add to the complexity.</description>

      <title>Spontaneous Motion of Liquid Droplets on Soft Gradient Surfaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.10480</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.10480v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report an experimental investigation of the spontaneous motion of liquid droplets on soft gels with a crosslinking gradient. By systematically adjusting the spatial difference in crosslinking density, we observed that millimeter-sized liquid droplets moved along the gradient of elastic modulus and even climbed tilted slopes against gravity. Unlike the wetting dynamics of micro-droplets, which are governed by elastocapillary effects, we demonstrated that the observed spontaneous movements of millimeter-sized droplets were attributed to the surface energy difference resulting from the variation in crosslinking density. Using {\em in-situ} confocal microscopy imaging, we analyzed the viscoelastic dissipation induced by the moving wetting ridges near dynamic contact lines. Based on the relationship between the crosslinking density and surface energy of soft gels, our findings reveal a new method for controlling droplet dynamics at soft and dissipative interfaces.</description>

      <title>Precisely controlled colloids: A playground for path-wise non-equilibrium physics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07026</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.07026v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We investigate path-wise observables in experiments on driven colloids in a periodic light field to dissect selected intricate transport features, kinetics, and transition-path time statistics out of thermodynamic equilibrium. These observables directly reflect the properties of individual paths in contrast to the properties of an ensemble of particles, such as radial distribution functions or mean-squared displacements. In particular, we present two distinct albeit equivalent formulations of the underlying stochastic equation of motion, highlight their respective practical relevance, and show how to interchange between them. We discuss conceptually different notions of local velocities and interrogate one- and two-sided first-passage and transition-path time statistics in and out of equilibrium. Our results reiterate how path-wise observables may be employed to systematically assess the quality of experimental data and demonstrate that, given sufficient control and sampling, one may quantitatively verify subtle theoretical predictions.</description>

      <title>On the shape of Gaussian scale-free polymer networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02566</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.02566v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider the model of complex hyperbranched polymer structures formed on the basis of scale-free graphs, where functionalities (degrees) $k$ of nodes obey a power law decaying probability $p(k)\sim{k^{-\alpha}}$. Such polymer topologies can be considered as generalization of regular hierarchical dendrimer structures with fixed functionalities. The conformational size and shape characteristics, such as averaged asphericity $\langle A_3 \rangle$ and size ratio $g$ of such polymer networks are obtained numerically by application of Wei's method, which defines the configurations of any complex Gaussian network in terms of eigenvalue spectra of corresponding Kirchhoff matrix. Our quantitative results indicate, in particular, an increase of compactness and symmetry of network structures with the decrease of parameter $\alpha$.</description>

Abstract: Earlier we showed that in the molecular dynamics simulation of a rigid model of water it is necessary to use an integration time-step $\delta t \leq 0.5$ fs to ensure equipartition between translational and rotational modes. Here we extend that study in the $NVT$ ensemble to $NpT$ conditions and to an aqueous protein. We study neat liquid water with the rigid, SPC/E model and the protein BBA (PDB ID: 1FME) solvated in the rigid, TIP3P model. We examine integration time-steps ranging from $0.5$ fs to $4.0$ fs for various thermostat plus barostat combinations. We find that a small $\delta t$ is necessary to ensure consistent prediction of the simulation volume. Hydrogen mass repartitioning alleviates the problem somewhat, but is ineffective for the typical time-step used with this approach. The compressibility, a measure of volume fluctuations, and the dielectric constant, a measure of dipole moment fluctuations, are also seen to be sensitive to $\delta t$. Using the mean volume estimated from the $NpT$ simulation, we examine the electrostatic and van der Waals contribution to the hydration free energy of the protein in the $NVT$ ensemble. These contributions are also sensitive to $\delta t$. In going from $\delta t = 2$ fs to $\delta t = 0.5$ fs, the change in the net electrostatic plus van der Waals contribution to the hydration of BBA is already in excess of the folding free energy reported for this protein.</description>

Abstract: The random packing fraction of binary particles in D-dimensional Euclidean space R^D is studied using a geometric approach. First, the binary packing fraction of assemblies with small size difference are studied, using the excluded volume model by Onsager for particles in three-dimensional space (D = 3). According to this model the packing increase by bidispersity is proportional to (1 - f)(u^D - 1)^2, with f as monosized packing fraction, u as size ratio and D as space dimension. The model predictions are compared with computational results for disks in two dimensions (D = 2) and hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit (D to infinity), yielding good agreement. Subsequently, the packing of hyperspheres with large size difference is modeled, employing the classic theory of Furnas. This theory, developed for three dimensions, starts from an infinite size ratio of larger and smaller particles (u to infinity). Here, the pertaining equations are applied to hyperspheres, and successfully compared with computational results for hyperspheres in the large-dimension limit. Furthermore, an asymptotic approximation of the binary packing fraction for large size ratio is derived, which shows that the first order variation of the Furnas packing fraction (u^-1 = 0) is proportional to (2 - f)u^-1. Finally, a scaled D-dimensional binary packing graph is presented, governing a simplified phase diagram that borders the binary random packing fraction of amorphous assemblies. To summarize, basic space-filling and geometric (a-thermal) theories on simple hard spheres appear to be a valuable tool for the study of hyperspheres packing and amorphization.</description>
