      <title>Phase Transitions on 1d Long-Range Ising Models with Decaying Fields: A Direct Proof via Contours</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07098</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07098v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Following seminal work by J. Fr\"ohlich and T. Spencer on the critical exponent $\alpha=2$, we give a proof via contours of phase transition in the one-dimensional long-range ferromagnetic Ising model in the entire region of decay, where phase transition is known to occur, i.e., polynomial decay $\alpha \in (1,2]$. No assumptions that the nearest-neighbor interaction $J(1)$ is large are made. The robustness of the method also yields a proof of phase transition in the presence of a nonsummable external field that decays sufficiently fast.</description>

      <title>Tube Category, Tensor Renormalization and Topological Holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07198</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07198v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Ocneanu's tube algebra provides a finite algorithm to compute the Drinfeld center of a fusion category. In this work we reveal the universal property underlying the tube algebra. Take a base category $\mathcal V$ which is concrete, bicomplete, and symmetric closed monoidal. For physical applications one takes $\mathcal V=\mathbf{Vec}$ the category of vector spaces. Given a $\mathcal V$-enriched monoidal category $\mathcal C$ (not necessarily finite or semisimple) we define the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ using coends valued in $\mathcal V$. Our main theorem established the relation between (the category of representations of) the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ and the Drinfeld center $Z(\mathcal C)$: When $\mathcal C$ is pivotal, we prove that $Z(\mathcal C)\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Fun}(\mathbb X \mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V)\cong Z(\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))$. Physically, besides viewing the tube category as a version of TFT with domain being the tube, we emphasize the "Wick-rotated" perspective, that the morphisms in $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ are the local tensors of fixed-point matrix product operators which preserves the symmetry $\mathcal C$ in one spatial dimension. We provide a first-principle flavored construction, from microscopic quantum degrees of freedom and operators perserving the symmetry, to the macroscopic universal properties of the symmetry which form the Drinfeld center. Our work is thus a proof to the 1+1D topological holography in a very general setting.</description>

      <title>On the equivalence of AQFTs and prefactorization algebras</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07318</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07318v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper revisits the equivalence problem between algebraic quantum field theories and prefactorization algebras defined over globally hyperbolic Lorentzian manifolds. We develop a radically new approach whose main innovative features are 1.) a structural implementation of the additivity property used in earlier approaches and 2.) a reduction of the global equivalence problem to a family of simpler spacetime-wise problems. When applied to the case where the target category is a symmetric monoidal $1$-category, this yields a generalization of the equivalence theorem from [Commun. Math. Phys. 377, 971 (2019)]. In the case where the target is the symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category of cochain complexes, we obtain a reduction of the global $\infty$-categorical equivalence problem to simpler, but still challenging, spacetime-wise problems. The latter would be solved by showing that certain functors between $1$-categories exhibit $\infty$-localizations, however the available detection criteria are inconclusive in our case.</description>

      <title>On matrix Lax representations and constructions of Miura-type transformations for differential-difference equations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01474</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.01474v2 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper is part of a research project on relations between differential-difference matrix Lax representations (MLRs) with the action of gauge transformations and discrete Miura-type transformations (MTs) for (nonlinear) integrable differential-difference equations.
  The paper addresses the following problem:
  when and how can one eliminate some shifts of dependent variables from the discrete (difference) part of an MLR by means of gauge transformations?
  Using results on this problem, we present applications to constructing new MLRs and new integrable equations connected by new MTs to known equations.
  In particular, we obtain results of this kind for equations connected to the following ones:
  - The two-component Belov--Chaltikian lattice.
  - The equation (introduced by G. Mari Beffa and Jing Ping Wang) which describes the evolution induced on invariants by an invariant evolution of planar polygons.
  - An equation from [S. Igonin, arXiv:2405.08579] related to the Toda lattice in the Flaschka--Manakov coordinates.</description>

      <title>Dependence of the induced vacuum energy of scalar matter in the background of an impenetrable magnetic tube on the coupling to the space-time curvature</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06814v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We considered the vacuum polarization of a quantized charged scalar matter field in the background of a finite-thickness tube with magnetic flux inside. The tube is impenetrable for quantum matter and a Robin-type boundary condition is imposed at its surface. We have shown that in the flat space-time the total induced vacuum energy does not depend on the coupling $(\xi)$ of the scalar field's interaction with the space-time curvature only for the partial cases of the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary conditions on the tube's edge. However, for generalized Robin boundary conditions, the total induced energy depends on the coupling $\xi$ in flat space-time, at least for negative values of the boundary condition parameter $-\pi/2&lt;\theta&lt;0$.</description>

      <title>Late-time tails in nonlinear evolutions of merging black holes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06887</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.06887v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We uncover late-time gravitational-wave tails in fully nonlinear 3+1 dimensional numerical relativity simulations of merging black holes, using the highly accurate SpEC code. We achieve this result by exploiting the strong magnification of late-time tails due to binary eccentricity, recently observed in perturbative evolutions, and showcase here the tail presence in head-on configurations for several mass ratios close to unity. We validate the result through a large battery of numerical tests and detailed comparison with perturbative evolutions, which display striking agreement with full nonlinear ones. Our results offer yet another confirmation of the highly predictive power of black hole perturbation theory in the presence of a source, even when applied to nonlinear solutions. The late-time tail signal is much more prominent than anticipated until recently, and possibly within reach of gravitational-wave detectors measurements, unlocking observational investigations of an additional set of general relativistic predictions on the long-range gravitational dynamics.</description>

Abstract: Consider a conformally covariant four-point function of identical scalar operators with a discrete spectrum, a twist gap, and compatible with the unitarity conditions. We give a mathematical proof confirming that the spectrum and OPE coefficients at large spin and fixed twist always become that of a generalized free field theory.</description>

      <title>On absence of embedded eigenvalues and stability of BGK waves</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07025</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07025v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider space-periodic and inhomogeneous steady states of the one-dimensional electrostatic Vlasov-Poisson system, known as the Bernstein-Greene-Kruskal (BGK) waves. We prove that there exists a large class of fixed background ion densities and spatial periods, so that the corresponding linearised operator around the associated BGK-equilibria has no embedded eigenvalues inside the essential spectrum. As a consequence we conclude a nonquantitative version of Landau damping around a subclass of such equilibria with monotone dependence on particle energy.
  The BGK equilibria under investigation feature trapped electrons which lead to presence of both elliptic and hyperbolic critical points in the characteristic phase-space diagram. They also feature a small parameter, which roughly speaking governs the size of the trapped zone - also referred to as electron hole. Our argument uses action-angle variables and a careful analysis of the associated period function. To exclude embedded eigenvalues we develop an energy-based approach which deals with resonant interactions between the energy (action)-space and the angle frequencies; their singular structure and summability properties are the key technical challenge. Our approach is robust and applicable to other spectral problems featuring elliptic and hyperbolic critical points.</description>

      <title>Optimal unitary trajectories under commuting target and cost observables; applications to cooling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07291</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07291v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The preparation of quantum states, especially cooling, is a fundamental technology for nanoscale devices. The past decade has seen important results related to both the limits of state transformation and the limits to their efficiency -- the quantum versions of the third and second law of thermodynamics. The limiting cases always involve an infinite resource cost, typically machine complexity or time. Realistic state preparation takes into account both a finite size of the machine and constraints on the operations we can perform. In this work, we determine in full generality the optimal operation for a predominant quantum paradigm: state transformation under a single unitary operation upon a finite system, in the case where the observables corresponding to the target (such as ground state probability) and cost (such as dissipation) commute. We then extend this result to the case of having a third, commuting, globally conserved quantity (such as total energy). The results are demonstrated with the paradigmatic example of ground state cooling, for both arbitrary and energy-preserving unitary operations.</description>

Abstract: The time-dependent Schrodinger equation is solved for two model problems for a non-Hermitian quantum system.A simple matrix model system is used to examine two critical problems for these systems: complex and non-observable energies and situations where the matrix is defective. In addition the stationary states for infinite dimensional model system, which is confined in space , is examined and it is shown that the pattern of eigenvalue energies differs from when the system is unconfined.</description>

Abstract: We present two explicit expressions for generic singular vectors of type $(r,s)$ of the Virasoro algebra. These results follow from the paper of Bauer et al which presented recursive methods to construct the vectors. The expressions presented here generalise the results of Benoit-Saint Aubin for the type $(1,s)$ singular vectors in two different ways: the first simply solves the recursion through the use of partitions; the second gives explicit formulae for the coefficients in a particular expansion. A Mathematica notebook is available which implements the formulae.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07562v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We consider different pentagon identities realized by the hyperbolic hypergeometric functions and investigate their degenerations to the level of complex hypergeometric functions. In particular, we show that one of the degenerations yields the complex binomial theorem which coincides with the Fourier transformation of the complex analogue of the Euler beta integral. At the bottom we obtain a Fourier transformation formula for the complex gamma function. This is done with the help of a new type of the limit $\omega_1+\omega_2\to 0$ (or $b\to \textrm{i}$ in two-dimensional conformal field theory) applied to the hyperbolic hypergeometric integrals.</description>

      <title>Improving the Robustness of the Projected Gradient Descent Method for Nonlinear Constrained Optimization Problems in Topology Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07634</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07634v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) algorithm is a widely used and efficient first-order method for solving constrained optimization problems due to its simplicity and scalability in large design spaces. Building on recent advancements in the PGD algorithm where an inertial step component has been introduced to improve efficiency in solving constrained optimization problems this study introduces two key enhancements to further improve the algorithm's performance and adaptability in large-scale design spaces. First, univariate constraints (such as design variable bounds constraints) are directly incorporated into the projection step via the Schur complement and an improved active set algorithm with bulk constraints manipulation, avoiding issues with min-max clipping. Second, the update step is decomposed relative to the constraint vector space, enabling a post-projection adjustment based on the state of the constraints and an approximation of the Lagrangian, significantly improving the algorithm's robustness for problems with nonlinear constraints. Applied to a topology optimization problem for heat sink design, the proposed PGD algorithm demonstrates performance comparable to or exceeding that of the Method of Moving Asymptotes (MMA), with minimal parameter tuning. These results position the enhanced PGD as a robust tool for complex optimization problems with large variable space, such as topology optimization problems.</description>

      <title>Fractal zeta functions at infinity and the $\phi$-shell Minkowski content</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07645</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07645v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study fractal properties of unbounded domains with infinite Lebesgue measure via their complex fractal dimensions. These complex dimensions are defined as poles of a suitable defined Lapidus fractal zeta function at infinity and are a generalization of the Minkowski dimension for a special kind of a degenerated relative fractal drum at infinity. It is a natural generalization of a similar approach applied to unbounded domains of finite Lebesgue measures investigated previously by the author. In this case we adapt the definition of Minkowski content and dimension at infinity by introducing the so-called $\phi$-shells where $\phi$ is a real parameter. We show that the new notion of the upper $\phi$-shell Minkowski dimension is independent on the paramter $\phi$ and well adapted to the fractal zeta function at infinity. We also study how the new definition connects with the one-point compactification and the classical fractal properties of the corresponding compactified domain. We also give a construction of maximally hyperfractal and of quasperiodic domains at infinity of infinite Lebesgue measure.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2412.07653v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a mathematical framework that generalizes the definition of statistics for Abelian anyons, based on string operators in many-body Hilbert space, to arbitrary dimensions of invertible topological excitations on arbitrary manifolds. This theory is rigorous, systematic, and provides a general framework for understanding and proving the properties of statistics. Additionally, we propose several conjectures that may hold mathematical interest. We also present a computer program for calculating statistics, which has yielded results consistent with predictions from other physical theories.</description>

      <title>A dynamical study of Hilda asteroids in the Circular and Elliptic RTBP</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07700v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The Hilda group is a set of asteroids whose mean motion is in a 3:2 orbital resonance with Jupiter. In this paper we use the planar Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CRTBP) as a dynamical model and we show that there exists a family of stable periodic orbits that are surrounded by islands of quasi-periodic motions. We have computed the frequencies of these quasi-periodic motions and we have shown how the Hilda family fits inside these islands. We have compared these results with the ones obtained using the Elliptic Restricted Three-Body Problem and they are similar, showing the suitability of the CRTBP model. It turns out that, to decide if a given asteroid belongs to the Hilda class, it is much better to look at its frequencies in the planar CRTBP rather than to use two-body orbital elements as it is commonly done today.</description>

      <title>A Hamiltonian Formulation for Energy Loss, Collision Rate, and Entropy Evolution in Collisionless and Collisional Plasmas: Transition from Maxwellian to Non-Maxwellian Distributions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07725</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.07725v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we present a generalised Hamiltonian formulation to model the collision rate, energy loss, entropy evolution, and the transition from Maxwellian to non-Maxwellian distributions in a plasma. By incorporating gyrokinetic turbulence and the effects of collisions, we derive a Hamiltonian that captures both the collisionless and collisional dynamics of a plasma. The formulation accounts for entropy production, energy transport, and the resulting changes in plasma confinability. We show how entropy increase during the transition from Maxwellian to non-Maxwellian states impacts fusion efficiency and plasma stability. Finally, we provide a mathematical proof that links entropy evolution to energy loss and the emergent properties of confinement.</description>

      <title>Some solutions to the eigenstate equation for the free quantum field Hamiltonian in the Schr\"odinger representation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.03049</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.03049v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Using closed positive extensions of the quadratic form in the potential term we provide alternative solutions to the eigenstate equation for the free quantum field Hamiltonian in the Schr\"o\-din\-ger representation. We show that admissible extensions stem from the singular behaviour of the quantum field simultaneously in at least two points, the distance between the latter being limited by the extension parameter. Including position of singularities into dynamical model we provide example of quantum field evolved by the action of the free Hamiltonian interacting with external sources via functional boundary conditions.</description>

      <title>Evolving the Euler rotation axis as a dynamical system, using the Euler vector and generalizations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11814</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11814v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Differential equations are derived which show how generalized Euler vector representations of the Euler rotation axis and angle for a rigid body evolve in time; the Euler vector is also known as a rotation vector or axis-angle vector. The solutions can exhibit interesting rotational features in this non-abstract, visualizable setting, including spinor-like behavior and quasiperiodicity. The equations are well-behaved at zero, reducing to the simple infinitesimal case there. One of them is equivalent to a known quaternion differential equation. The simple geometric derivation does not depend on Euler's rotation theorem, and yields a proof of Euler's theorem using only infinitesimal motions. With mild regularity conditions on the angular velocity function, there is a continuous evolution of the normalized axis and angle for all time. Dynamical systems properties are discussed, and numerical solutions are used to investigate them when the angular velocity is itself rotating, and the Euler vector trajectory traces out a torus-like shape, with a strobe plot that densely fills in a closed curve.</description>

      <title>PT-Symmetry in $2\times 2$ Matrix Polynomials Formed by Pauli Matrices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.04022v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: $2\times2$ matrix polynomials of the form $P_{n}(z)= \Sigma^{n}_{j=0}\,\sigma_{j}\,z^{j}$, for the cases $n=1,2,3$ are constructed, and the nature of PT-symmetry is examined across different points $z=(x,y)$ in the complex plane. The PT-symmetric properties of $P_{n}(z)$ can be characterized by two functions, denoted by $s(x,y)$ and $h(x,y)$. If the trace of the matrix polynomial is real, then the points at which it can exhibit PT-symmetry are defined by the family of curves $s(x,y)=0$. Additionally, at points where the function $h(x,y)\geq 0$, the matrix polynomial exhibits unbroken PT-symmetry; otherwise, it exhibits broken PT-symmetry. The intersection points of the curves $s(x,y)=0$ and $h(x,y)=k$, for a given $k\in \mathbb{R}$, are shown to lie on an ellipse, hyperbola, two lines passing through the origin, or a straight line, depending on the nature of PT-symmetry of the matrix polynomial. The PT-symmetric behaviour of $P_{n}(z)$ at the zeros of the matrix polynomial is also studied.</description>

      <title>A Simple Recursion for the Mirzakhani Volume and its Super Extension</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.04458</link>
      <description>arXiv:2008.04458v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we derive a simple recursion formula for the Weil-Petersson volumes of moduli spaces of hyperbolic surfaces with boundaries. This formula demonstrates the polynomiality of the volume functions. By constructing the Laplace transform for both the original and our alternative formulas, we show that they are directly equivalent. By considering the top and lowest degree terms of these formulas, we recover the DVV identity and cohomology class identities for $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$. Similar conclusions are drawn for the super-analog of these results.</description>

      <title>Fiber 2-Functors and Tambara-Yamagami Fusion 2-Categories</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08117</link>
      <description>arXiv:2306.08117v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We introduce group-theoretical fusion 2-categories, a strong categorification of the notion of a group-theoretical fusion 1-category. Physically speaking, such fusion 2-categories arise by gauging subgroups of a global symmetry. We show that group-theoretical fusion 2-categories are completely characterized by the property that the braided fusion 1-category of endomorphisms of the monoidal unit is Tannakian. Then, we describe the underlying finite semisimple 2-category of group-theoretical fusion 2-categories, and, more generally, of certain 2-categories of bimodules. We also partially describe the fusion rules of group-theoretical fusion 2-categories, and investigate the group gradings of such fusion 2-categories. Using our previous results, we classify fusion 2-categories admitting a fiber 2-functor. Next, we study fusion 2-categories with a Tambara-Yamagami defect, that is $\mathbb{Z}/2$-graded fusion 2-categories whose non-trivially graded factor is $\mathbf{2Vect}$. We classify these fusion 2-categories, and examine more closely the more restrictive notion of Tambara-Yamagami fusion 2-categories. Throughout, we give many examples to illustrate our various results.</description>

      <title>Fusion rule in conformal field theories and topological orders: A unified view of correspondence and (fractional) supersymmetry and their relation to topological holography</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05178</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.05178v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The algebraic or ring structure of anyons called the fusion rule, is one of the most fundamental research interests in contemporary studies on topological orders (TOs) and the corresponding conformal field theories (CFTs). Recently, the algebraic structure realized as generalized symmetry, including non-invertible and categorical symmetry, captured attention in the fields. Such non-abelian anyonic objects appear in a bulk CFT or chiral CFT (CCFT), but it has been known that the construction of a CCFT contains theoretical difficulties in general. In this work, we study the structure of the fusion rule in $Z_{N}$ symmetric chiral and bulk conformal field theories and the corresponding TOs. We propose a nontrivial expression of subalgebra structure in the fusion rule of a bulk CFT. We name this subalgebra ``bulk semion". This corresponds to the fusion rule of the CCFTs and categorical symmetry of the TOs or symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT). This gives a bulk-edge correspondence based on the symmetry analysis and corresponds to an anyon algebraic expression of topological holography in the recent literature. The topological holography is expected to apply to systems in general space-time dimensions. Moreover, we give a concise way of unifying duality (or fractional supersymmetry), generalized or categorical symmetry, and Lagrangian subalgebra. Our method is potentially useful to formulate and study general TOs, fundamentally only from the data of bulk CFTs or vice versa, and gives a clue in understanding CCFT (or ancillary CFT more generally).</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.03235v5 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Through the rotational invariance of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice we express Smirnov's edge parafermionic observable as a sum of two new edge observables. With the help of these two new edge observables we can apply the discrete harmonic analysis and conformal mapping theory to prove the convergence of the 2-d critical bond percolation exploration path on the square lattice to the trace of $SLE_6$ as the mesh size of the lattice tends to zero.</description>

      <title>A Stochastic Origin of Spacetime Non-Commutativity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.11866v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We propose a stochastic interpretation of spacetime non-commutativity starting from the path integral formulation of quantum mechanical commutation relations. We discuss how the (non-)commutativity of spacetime is inherently related to the continuity or discontinuity of paths in the path integral formulation. Utilizing Wiener processes, we demonstrate that continuous paths lead to commutative spacetime, whereas discontinuous paths correspond to non-commutative spacetime structures. As an example we introduce discontinuous paths from which the $\kappa$-Minkowski spacetime commutators can be obtained. Moreover we focus on modifications of the Leibniz rule for differentials acting on discontinuous trajectories. We show how these can be related to the deformed action of translation generators focusing, as a working example, on the $\kappa$-Poincar\'e algebra. Our findings suggest that spacetime non-commutativity can be understood as a result of fundamental discreteness in temporal and/or spatial evolution.</description>

      <title>Quantum Groups as Global Symmetries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.24142v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study quantum field theories which have quantum groups as global internal symmetries. We show that in such theories operators are generically non-local, and should be thought as living at the ends of topological lines. We describe the general constraints of the quantum group symmetry, given by Ward identities, that correlation functions of the theory should satisfy. We also show that generators of the symmetry can be represented by topological lines with some novel properties. We then discuss a particular example of $U_q(sl_2)$ symmetric CFT, which we solve using the bootstrap techniques and relying on the symmetry. We finally show strong evidence that for a special value of $q$ a subsector of this theory reproduces the fermionic formulation of the Ising model. This suggests that a quantum group can act on local operators as well, however, it generically transforms them into non-local ones.</description>

      <title>Scaling law for membrane lifetime</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.04754v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Membrane configurations in the Banks-Fischler-Shenker-Susskind matrix model are unstable due to the existence of flat directions in the potential and the decay process can be seen as a realization of chaotic scattering. In this note, we compute the lifetime of a membrane in a reduced model. The resulting lifetime exhibits scaling laws with respect to energy, coupling constant and a cut-off scale. We numerically evaluate the scaling exponents, which cannot be fixed by the dimensional analysis. Finally, some applications of the results are discussed.</description>
