      <title>Joint Travel Route Optimization Framework for Platooning</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07623</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07623v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Platooning represents an advanced driving technology designed to assist drivers in traffic convoys of varying lengths, enhancing road safety, reducing driver fatigue, and improving fuel efficiency. Sophisticated automated driving assistance systems have facilitated this innovation. Recent advancements in platooning emphasize cooperative mechanisms within both centralized and decentralized architectures enabled by vehicular communication technologies. This study introduces a cooperative route planning optimization framework aimed at promoting the adoption of platooning through a centralized platoon formation strategy at the system level. This approach is envisioned as a transitional phase from individual (ego) driving to fully collaborative driving. Additionally, this research formulates and incorporates travel cost metrics related to fuel consumption, driver fatigue, and travel time, considering regulatory constraints on consecutive driving durations. The performance of these cost metrics has been evaluated using Dijkstra's and A* shortest path algorithms within a network graph framework. The results indicate that the proposed architecture achieves an average cost improvement of 14 % compared to individual route planning for long road trips.</description>

      <title>Sacred or Secular? Religious Bias in AI-Generated Financial Advice</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07118</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07118v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This study examines religious biases in AI-generated financial advice, focusing on ChatGPT's responses to financial queries. Using a prompt-based methodology and content analysis, we find that 50% of the financial emails generated by ChatGPT exhibit religious biases, with explicit biases present in both ingroup and outgroup interactions. While ingroup biases personalize responses based on religious alignment, outgroup biases introduce religious framing that may alienate clients or create ideological friction. These findings align with broader research on AI bias and suggest that ChatGPT is not merely reflecting societal biases but actively shaping financial discourse based on perceived religious identity. Using the Critical Algorithm Studies framework, we argue that ChatGPT functions as a mediator of financial narratives, selectively reinforcing religious perspectives. This study underscores the need for greater transparency, bias mitigation strategies, and regulatory oversight to ensure neutrality in AI-driven financial services.</description>

      <title>A Replica for our Democracies? On Using Digital Twins to Enhance Deliberative Democracy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07138</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07138v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Deliberative democracy depends on carefully designed institutional frameworks, such as participant selection, facilitation methods, and decision-making mechanisms, that shape how deliberation occurs. However, determining which institutional design best suits a given context often proves difficult when relying solely on real-world observations or laboratory experiments, which can be resource intensive and hard to replicate. To address these challenges, this paper explores Digital Twin (DT) technology as a regulatory sandbox for deliberative democracy. DTs enable researchers and policymakers to run "what if" scenarios on varied deliberative designs in a controlled virtual environment by creating dynamic, computer based models that mirror real or synthetic data. This makes systematic analysis of the institutional design possible without the practical constraints of real world or lab-based settings. The paper also discusses the limitations of this approach and outlines key considerations for future research.</description>

      <title>Conducting VR User Studies with People with Vision/Hearing Impairments: Challenges and Mitigation Strategies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07256</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07256v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: There is a lack of virtual reality (VR) user studies that have been conducted involving people with vision/hearing impairments. This is due to the difficulty of recruiting participants and the accessibility barriers of VR devices. Based on the authors' experience conducting VR user studies with participants with vision/hearing impairments, this position paper identifies 5 key challenges (1. Recruitment, 2. Language Familiarity, 3. Technology Limitations and Barriers, 4. Access to Audio Cue, and 5. Travelling to the Experiment Location) and proposes strategic approaches to mitigate these challenges. In addition, we also presented three key considerations regarding understanding participants' lived experiences that could help the user study become accessible.</description>

      <title>TwinArch: A Digital Twin Reference Architecture</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07530</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07530v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Background. Digital Twins (DTs) are dynamic virtual representations of physical systems, enabled by seamless, bidirectional communication between the physical and digital realms. Among the challenges impeding the widespread adoption of DTs is the absence of a universally accepted definition and a standardized DT Reference Architecture (RA). Existing state-of-the-art architectures remain largely domain-specific, primarily emphasizing aspects like modeling and simulation. Furthermore, they often combine structural and dynamic elements into unified, all-in-one diagrams, which adds to the ambiguity and confusion surrounding the concept of Digital Twins.
  Objective. To address these challenges, this work aims to contribute a domain-independent, multi-view Digital Twin Reference Architecture that can help practitioners in architecting and engineering their DTs.
  Method. We adopted the design science methodology, structured into three cycles: (i) an initial investigation conducting a Systematic Literature Review to identify key architectural elements, (ii) preliminary design refined via feedback from practitioners, and (iii) final artifact development, integrating knowledge from widely adopted DT development platforms and validated through an expert survey of 20 participants.
  Results. The proposed Digital Twin Reference Architecture is named TwinArch. It is documented using the Views and Beyond methodology by the Software Engineering Institute. TwinArch website and replication package: https://alessandrasomma28.github.io/twinarch/
  Conclusion. TwinArch offers practitioners practical artifacts that can be utilized for designing and developing new DT systems across various domains. It enables customization and tailoring to specific use cases while also supporting the documentation of existing DT systems.</description>

      <title>Temporal Tensors and Quantum Shortcut Dynamics in a Supermaze of Multidimensional Time</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07900</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.07900v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework that unifies concepts of multiple time dimensions, quantum shortcut dynamics, and complex topological structures ('supermazes') to explore novel phenomena in quantum and classical systems. In particular, we introduce a Temporal Tensor Formalism to describe multidimensional time, define Quantum Shortcut Operators that enact near-instantaneous state transitions, and incorporate these into a supermaze topological model inspired by labyrinthine geometry and network complexity. We show how this framework can give rise to surprising effects such as anomalous thermodynamic relaxation (analogous to the Mpemba effect) in quantum systems. Theoretical implications for quantum computing (including quantum cloud networks) are discussed, and connections are drawn to established mathematical paradoxes and physical principles.</description>

      <title>Antennas in Walls: Performance Analysis of Microstrip Patch Antennas Designed for Internet of Paint (IoP)</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01452</link>
      <description>arXiv:2412.01452v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This study presents a simulated transceiver with a microstrip patch antenna (MPA) designed to resonate at 150 GHz and embedded in paint. The in-paint MPA (IP-MPA) is designed for the Internet of Paint (IoP) paradigm, which envisions seamless device communication through a paint layer on walls. This study introduces a comprehensive channel model for transceivers in paint at arbitrary depths and IP-MPA orientations. The best antenna orientations are analyzed for IoP channel performance. Extensive simulations indicate that the lateral waves, which propagate along the air-paint interface, exhibit the lowest loss, making this path the most reliable for communication between transceivers in paint. Further, the maximum received power for each propagation path, with the exception of the direct path, depends on depth. The findings suggest that the proposed network of IP-MPA-enabled transceivers for IoP has the potential to transform conventional walls into an integrated high-speed wireless communication and sensing infrastructure.</description>

      <title>EDA-Q: Electronic Design Automation for Superconducting Quantum Chip</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15386</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.15386v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Electronic Design Automation (EDA) plays a crucial role in classical chip design and significantly influences the development of quantum chip design. However, traditional EDA tools cannot be directly applied to quantum chip design due to vast differences compared to the classical realm. Several EDA products tailored for quantum chip design currently exist, yet they only cover partial stages of the quantum chip design process instead of offering a fully comprehensive solution. Additionally, they often encounter issues such as limited automation, steep learning curves, challenges in integrating with actual fabrication processes, and difficulties in expanding functionality. To address these issues, we developed a full-stack EDA tool specifically for quantum chip design, called EDA-Q. The design workflow incorporates functionalities present in existing quantum EDA tools while supplementing critical design stages such as device mapping and fabrication process mapping, which users expect. EDA-Q utilizes a unique architecture to achieve exceptional scalability and flexibility. The integrated design mode guarantees algorithm compatibility with different chip components, while employing a specialized interactive processing mode to offer users a straightforward and adaptable command interface. Application examples demonstrate that EDA-Q significantly reduces chip design cycles, enhances automation levels, and decreases the time required for manual intervention. Multiple rounds of testing on the designed chip have validated the effectiveness of EDA-Q in practical applications.</description>

      <title>Direct-Write Printed Contacts to Layered and 2D Materials</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11691</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.11691v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Advancements in fabrication methods have shaped new computing device technologies. Among these methods, depositing electrical contacts to the channel material is fundamental to device characterization. Novel layered and two-dimensional (2D) materials are promising for next-generation computing electronic channel materials. Direct-write printing of conductive inks is introduced as a surprisingly effective, significantly faster, and cleaner method to contact different classes of layered materials, including graphene (semi-metal), MoS2 (semiconductor), Bi-2212 (superconductor), and Fe5GeTe2 (metallic ferromagnet). Based on the electrical response, the quality of the printed contacts is comparable to what is achievable with resist-based lithography techniques. These devices are tested by sweeping gate voltage, temperature, and magnetic field to show that the materials remain pristine post-processing. This work demonstrates that direct-write printing is an agile method for prototyping and characterizing the electrical properties of novel layered materials.</description>

      <title>GIScience in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: A Research Agenda Towards Autonomous GIS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23633</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.23633v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The advent of generative AI exemplified by large language models (LLMs) opens new ways to represent and compute geographic information and transcends the process of geographic knowledge production, driving geographic information systems (GIS) towards autonomous GIS. Leveraging LLMs as the decision core, autonomous GIS can independently generate and execute geoprocessing workflows to perform spatial analysis. In this vision paper, we further elaborate on the concept of autonomous GIS and present a conceptual framework that defines its five autonomous goals, five autonomous levels, five core functions, and three operational scales. We demonstrate how autonomous GIS could perform geospatial data retrieval, spatial analysis, and map making with four proof-of-concept GIS agents. We conclude by identifying critical challenges and future research directions, including fine-tuning and self-growing decision-cores, autonomous modeling, and examining the societal and practical implications of autonomous GIS. By establishing the groundwork for a paradigm shift in GIScience, this paper envisions a future where GIS moves beyond traditional workflows to autonomously reason, derive, innovate, and advance geospatial solutions to pressing global challenges. As we design and deploy increasingly intelligent geospatial systems, we carry a responsibility to ensure they are developed in socially responsible ways, serve the public good, and support the continued value of human geographic insight in an AI-augmented future.</description>
