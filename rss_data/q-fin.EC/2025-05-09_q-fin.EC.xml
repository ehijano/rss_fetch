      <title>Shocking concerns: public perception about climate change and the macroeconomy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04669</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.04669v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Public perceptions of climate change arguably contribute to shaping private adaptation and support for policy intervention. In this paper, we propose a novel Climate Concern Index (CCI), based on disaggregated web-search volumes related to climate change topics, to gauge the intensity and dynamic evolution of collective climate perceptions, and evaluate its impacts on the business cycle. Using data from the United States over the 2004:2024 span, we capture widespread shifts in perceived climate-related risks, particularly those consistent with the postcognitive interpretation of affective responses to extreme climate events. To assess the aggregate implications of evolving public concerns about the climate, we estimate a proxy-SVAR model and find that exogenous variation in the CCI entails a statistically significant drop in both employment and private consumption and a persistent surge in stock market volatility, while core inflation remains largely unaffected. These results suggest that, even in the absence of direct physical risks, heightened concerns for climate-related phenomena can trigger behavioral adaptation with nontrivial consequences for the macroeconomy, thereby demanding attention from institutional players in the macro-financial field.</description>

      <title>How General Are Measures of Choice Consistency? Evidence from Experimental and Scanner Data</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05275</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05275v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Choice consistency with utility maximization is a fundamental assumption in economic analysis and is extensively measured across various contexts. Here we investigate the generalizability of consistency measures derived from purchasing decisions using supermarket scanner data and budgetary decisions from lab-in-the-field experiments. We observe a lack of correlation between consistency scores from supermarket purchasing decisions and those from risky decisions in the experiment. However, we observe moderate correlations among experimental tasks and low to moderate correlations across purchasing categories and time periods within the supermarket. These results suggest that choice consistency may be characterized as a multidimensional skill set.</description>

      <title>Signature Decomposition Method Applying to Pair Trading</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05332</link>
      <description>arXiv:2505.05332v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Quantitative trading strategies based on medium- and high-frequency data have long been of significant interest in the futures market. The advancement of statistical arbitrage and deep learning techniques has improved the ability of processing high-frequency data, but also reduced arbitrage opportunities for traditional methods, yielding strategies that are less interpretable and more unstable. Consequently, the pursuit of more stable and interpretable quantitative investment strategies remains a key objective for futures market participants. In this study, we propose a novel pairs trading strategy by leveraging the mathematical concept of path signature which serves as a feature representation of time series data. Specifically, the path signature is decomposed to create two new indicators: the path interactivity indicator segmented signature and the change direction indicator path difference product. These indicators serve as double filters in our strategy design. Using minute-level futures data, we demonstrate that our strategy significantly improves upon traditional pairs trading with increasing returns, reducing maximum drawdown, and enhancing the Sharpe ratio. The method we have proposed in the present work offers greater interpretability and robustness while ensuring a considerable rate of return, highlighting the potential of path signature techniques in financial trading applications.</description>

      <title>Globalization? Trade War? A Counterbalance Perspective</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.03436</link>
      <description>arXiv:2009.03436v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper explores the exciting dynamics of international trade, focusing on the strategic balance between competition and cooperation in the global trade network. It highlights how competitive advantages, rather than comparative advantages, drive trade conflicts and deglobalization. By using the balance of power, the paper introduces a quantitative measure of competitiveness that serves as a common goal for all countries, alongside trade balance. It then examines how nations can boost their competitive strength and trade balance through globalization, protectionism, trade collaboration, or conflict. The study provides practical insights for policymakers on managing trade relationships, resolving conflicts, and determining the right level of globalization by analyzing trade data. The analysis is supported by a comparison between theory-driven quantitative evidence and historical events, using real-world trade data from 2000 to 2019.</description>
