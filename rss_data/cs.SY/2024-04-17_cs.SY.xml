      <title>Monitoring Based Fatigue Damage Prognosis of Wind Turbine Composite Blades under Uncertain Wind Loads</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10021</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10021v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Lifecycle assessment of wind turbines is essential to improve their design and to optimum maintenance plans for preventing failures during the design life. A critical element of wind turbines is the composite blade due to uncertain cyclic wind loads with relatively high frequency and amplitude in offshore environments. It is critical to detect the wind fatigue damage evolution in composite blades before they fail catastrophically and destroy the entire wind turbines. This study presents a methodology for analysing the fatigue failure probability of a wind turbine composite blade by using monitoring stochastic deterioration modelling. On the basis of 5 minutes mean wind speed measurements, the internal stresses can be accurately obtained from finite element analysis, and failure probabilities are predicted by stochastic gamma process fatigue damage model in design service life. A numerical example of a wind turbine composite blade is investigated to show the applicability of the proposed model. The results show that the stochastic fatigue damage model can give reliable results for time-dependent reliability analysis for composite blades of wind turbines.</description>

      <title>COBRAPRO: A MATLAB toolbox for Physics-based Battery Modeling and Co-simulation Parameter Optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: COBRAPRO is a new open-source physics-based battery modeling software with the capability to conduct closed-loop parameter optimization using experimental data. Physics-based battery models require systematic parameter calibration to accurately predict battery behavior across different usage scenarios. While parameter calibration is essential to predict the dynamic behavior of batteries, many existing open-source DFN tools lack parameter identification features. COBRAPRO addresses this gap by featuring an embedded parameter optimization routines that optimizes the model parameters by minimizing the error between the simulated and experimentally observed current-voltage data. With COBRAPRO, users can non-invasively identify unknown battery model parameters for any given battery chemistry.</description>

      <title>The Feasibility of Constrained Reinforcement Learning Algorithms: A Tutorial Study</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10064</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10064v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Satisfying safety constraints is a priority concern when solving optimal control problems (OCPs). Due to the existence of infeasibility phenomenon, where a constraint-satisfying solution cannot be found, it is necessary to identify a feasible region before implementing a policy. Existing feasibility theories built for model predictive control (MPC) only consider the feasibility of optimal policy. However, reinforcement learning (RL), as another important control method, solves the optimal policy in an iterative manner, which comes with a series of non-optimal intermediate policies. Feasibility analysis of these non-optimal policies is also necessary for iteratively improving constraint satisfaction; but that is not available under existing MPC feasibility theories. This paper proposes a feasibility theory that applies to both MPC and RL by filling in the missing part of feasibility analysis for an arbitrary policy. The basis of our theory is to decouple policy solving and implementation into two temporal domains: virtual-time domain and real-time domain. This allows us to separately define initial and endless, state and policy feasibility, and their corresponding feasible regions. Based on these definitions, we analyze the containment relationships between different feasible regions, which enables us to describe the feasible region of an arbitrary policy. We further provide virtual-time constraint design rules along with a practical design tool called feasibility function that helps to achieve the maximum feasible region. We review most of existing constraint formulations and point out that they are essentially applications of feasibility functions in different forms. We demonstrate our feasibility theory by visualizing different feasible regions under both MPC and RL policies in an emergency braking control task.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Complex-Frequency Control of Grid-Forming Converters</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10071</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10071v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Complex droop control, alternatively known as dispatchable virtual oscillator control (dVOC), stands out for its unique capabilities in synchronization and voltage stabilization among existing control strategies for grid-forming converters. Complex droop control leverages the novel concept of ``complex frequency'', thereby establishing a coupled connection between active and reactive power inputs and frequency and rate-of-change-of voltage outputs. However, its reliance on static droop gains limits its ability to exhibit crucial dynamic response behaviors required in future power systems. To address this limitation, this paper introduces \textit{dynamic complex-frequency control}, upgrading static droop gains with dynamic transfer functions to enhance the richness and flexibility in dynamic responses for frequency and voltage control. Unlike existing approaches, the complex-frequency control framework treats frequency and voltage dynamics collectively, ensuring small-signal stability for frequency synchronization and voltage stabilization simultaneously. The control framework is validated through detailed numerical case studies on the IEEE nine-bus system, also showcasing its applicability in multi-converter setups.</description>

      <title>Disturbance Rejection-Guarded Learning for Vibration Suppression of Two-Inertia Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10240v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Model uncertainty presents significant challenges in vibration suppression of multi-inertia systems, as these systems often rely on inaccurate nominal mathematical models due to system identification errors or unmodeled dynamics. An observer, such as an extended state observer (ESO), can estimate the discrepancy between the inaccurate nominal model and the true model, thus improving control performance via disturbance rejection. The conventional observer design is memoryless in the sense that once its estimated disturbance is obtained and sent to the controller, the datum is discarded. In this research, we propose a seamless integration of ESO and machine learning. On one hand, the machine learning model attempts to model the disturbance. With the assistance of prior information about the disturbance, the observer is expected to achieve faster convergence in disturbance estimation. On the other hand, machine learning benefits from an additional assurance layer provided by the ESO, as any imperfections in the machine learning model can be compensated for by the ESO. We validated the effectiveness of this novel learning-for-control paradigm through simulation and physical tests on two-inertial motion control systems used for vibration studies.</description>

      <title>Learning and Optimization for Price-based Demand Response of Electric Vehicle Charging</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10311</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10311v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the context of charging electric vehicles (EVs), the price-based demand response (PBDR) is becoming increasingly significant for charging load management. Such response usually encourages cost-sensitive customers to adjust their energy demand in response to changes in price for financial incentives. Thus, to model and optimize EV charging, it is important for charging station operator to model the PBDR patterns of EV customers by precisely predicting charging demands given price signals. Then the operator refers to these demands to optimize charging station power allocation policy. The standard pipeline involves offline fitting of a PBDR function based on historical EV charging records, followed by applying estimated EV demands in downstream charging station operation optimization. In this work, we propose a new decision-focused end-to-end framework for PBDR modeling that combines prediction errors and downstream optimization cost errors in the model learning stage. We evaluate the effectiveness of our method on a simulation of charging station operation with synthetic PBDR patterns of EV customers, and experimental results demonstrate that this framework can provide a more reliable prediction model for the ultimate optimization process, leading to more effective optimization solutions in terms of cost savings and charging station operation objectives with only a few training samples.</description>

      <title>Metamaterial-inspired Wearable Pad for Enhancing EM Coupling with Biological Tissues</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10313</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10313v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Wearable, implantable, and ingestible antennas are continuously evolving in biomedical applications, as they are crucial components in devices used for monitoring and controlling physiological parameters. This work presents an experimentally validated wearable pad which can improve transmission of electromagnetic waves into the human body. This metamaterial-inspired matching pad, which is based on small metallic loops encased in a thin dielectric layer, is mechanically stable, flexible, and passive. As such, the pad can serve as a coupling medium for microwave medical systems and implantable device communication. Operating in the 2.4-2.5 GHz range, the pad demonstrates significant improvement in signal penetration levels (and, hence, depth) into a biological tissue. The study presents design methodology, simulation studies, in-lab development, and experimental characterization of this pad, which can offer a practical solution for enhanced communication and functionality in various medical diagnostic systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10439v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Battery energy storage systems (BESSs) are essential for stable power supply in renewable energy systems that can operate in all weather. Future BESSs will be massive and pluggable with several heterogeneous batteries. In this paper, a novel decentralized control method for a heterogeneous BESS is proposed, in which each battery autonomously operates based on its characteristics. First, a control method that uses only one broadcast signal for each type of battery is proposed. Second, the asymptotic stability of the tracking error is proved. Third, numerical simulations confirm that the proposed control method has robust tracking performance of the total electric power to the demanded power when some batteries fail and are detached from the system. Last, in order to suppress degradation of battery, equalization of the state of charge is achieved for each type of battery without communication among the batteries.</description>

      <title>A Game-Theoretic Approach for PMU Deployment Against False Data Injection Attacks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Phasor Measurement Units (PMUs) are used in the measurement, control and protection of power grids. However, deploying PMUs at every bus in a power system is prohibitively expensive, necessitating partial PMU placement that can ensure system observability with minimal units. One consequence of this economic approach is increased system vulnerability to False Data Injection Attacks (FDIAs). This paper proposes a zero-sum game-based approach to strategically place an additional PMU (following the initial optimal PMU deployment that ensures full observability) to bolster robustness against FDIAs by introducing redundancy in attack-susceptible areas. To compute the Nash equilibrium (NE) solution, we leverage a reinforcement learning algorithm that mitigates the need for complete knowledge of the opponent's actions. The proposed PMU deployment algorithm increases the detection rate of FDIA by 36% compared to benchmark algorithms.</description>

      <title>Iterated Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IIEKF)</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10665v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the Iterated Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IIEKF), which is an invariant extended Kalman filter (IEKF) where the updated state in the light of the latest measurement is defined as a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimate. Under some compatibility requirements on the output map, we prove strong mathematical guarantees which echo those of the Kalman filter in the linear case. We apply the technique to two problems: solving a system of equations on a Lie group, and a problem of engineering interest, namely ego-localization of the hook of a crane. The latter serves as a benchmarking example, where the IIEKF favorably compares to other filters.</description>

      <title>Circuit-theoretic Joint Parameter-State Estimation -- Balancing Optimality and AC Feasibility</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10676</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10676v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AC State Estimation (ACSE) is widely recognized as a practical approach for determining the grid states in steady-state conditions. It serves as a fundamental analysis to ensure grid security and is a reference for market dispatch. As grid complexity increases with rapid electrification and decarbonization, there is a growing need for more accurate knowledge of the grid operating state. However, existing ACSE algorithms have technical gaps. Critically, current ACSE algorithms are susceptible to erroneous system parameters, which are assumed to be fixed in traditional approaches. In this paper, we build a novel circuit-theoretic joint parameter-state estimation algorithm to address this limitation. The innovative algorithm builds an analogous equivalent circuit of the grid with states and certain parameters unknown. It solves a circuit-constrained optimization to estimate the most likely grid states and parameters given a set of measurements. Further, it quantifies the goodness of the estimated output by formulating tight convex envelopes around the original non-convex problem to quantify the quality of estimates. We compare the various proposed approaches on systems with up to 2869 nodes while demonstrating a tradeoff between solution optimality and model fidelity.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10687v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we focus on developing an Invariant Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) for extended pose estimation for a noisy system with state equality constraints. We treat those constraints as noise-free pseudo-measurements. To this aim, we provide a formula for the Kalman gain in the limit of noise-free measurements and rank-deficient covariance matrix. We relate the constraints to group-theoretic properties and study the behavior of the IEKF in the presence of such noise-free measurements. We illustrate this perspective on the estimation of the motion of the load of an overhead crane, when a wireless inertial measurement unit is mounted on the hook.</description>

      <title>How Deduction Systems Can Help You To Verify Stability Properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10747</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10747v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Mathematical proofs are a cornerstone of control theory, and it is important to get them right. Deduction systems can help with this by mechanically checking the proofs. However, the structure and level of detail at which a proof is represented in a deduction system differ significantly from a proof read and written by mathematicians and engineers, hampering understanding and adoption of these systems.
  This paper aims at helping to bridge the gap between machine-checked proofs and proofs in engineering and mathematics by presenting a machine-checked proof for stability using Lyapunov's theorem in a human-readable way. The structure of the proof is analyzed in detail, and potential benefits of such a proof are discussed, such as generalizability, reusability and increased trust in correctness.</description>

      <title>Electric Vehicles Limit Equitable Access to Essential Services During Blackouts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.09998</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.09998v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Electric vehicles (EVs) link mobility and electric power availability, posing a risk of making transportation unavailable during blackouts. We develop a computational framework to quantify the impact of EVs on mobility and access to services and find that existing access issues are exacerbated by EVs. Our results demonstrate that larger batteries reduce mobility constraints but their effectiveness is dependent on the geographic distribution of services and households. We explore the trade-offs between mobility and quality-of-life improvements presented by Vehicle-to-Grid technologies and the feasibility and trade-offs of public charging infrastructure as a solution to access inequalities. Equitable access to essential services (e.g. supermarkets, schools, parks, etc.) is the most important aspect of community resilience and our results show vehicle electrification can hinder access to essential services unless properly incorporated into policy and city-scale decision-making.</description>

      <title>A Linear MPC with Control Barrier Functions for Differential Drive Robots</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10018</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10018v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The need for fully autonomous mobile robots has surged over the past decade, with the imperative of ensuring safe navigation in a dynamic setting emerging as a primary challenge impeding advancements in this domain. In this paper, a Safety Critical Model Predictive Control based on Dynamic Feedback Linearization tailored to the application of differential drive robots with two wheels is proposed to generate control signals that result in obstacle-free paths. A barrier function introduces a safety constraint to the optimization problem of the Model Predictive Control (MPC) to prevent collisions. Due to the intrinsic nonlinearities of the differential drive robots, computational complexity while implementing a Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) arises. To facilitate the real-time implementation of the optimization problem and to accommodate the underactuated nature of the robot, a combination of Linear Model Predictive Control (LMPC) and Dynamic Feedback Linearization (DFL) is proposed. The MPC problem is formulated on a linear equivalent model of the differential drive robot rendered by the DFL controller. The analysis of the closed-loop stability and recursive feasibility of the proposed control design is discussed. Numerical experiments illustrate the robustness and effectiveness of the proposed control synthesis in avoiding obstacles with respect to the benchmark of using Euclidean distance constraints. Keywords: Model Predictive Control, MPC, Autonomous Ground Vehicles, Nonlinearity, Dynamic Feedback Linearization, Optimal Control, Differential Robots.</description>

Abstract: Iterative learning control (ILC) is a method for reducing system tracking or estimation errors over multiple iterations by using information from past iterations. The disturbance observer (DOB) is used to estimate and mitigate disturbances within the system, while the system is being affected by them. ILC enhances system performance by introducing a feedforward signal in each iteration. However, its effectiveness may diminish if the conditions change during the iterations. On the other hand, although DOB effectively mitigates the effects of new disturbances, it cannot entirely eliminate them as it operates reactively. Therefore, neither ILC nor DOB alone can ensure sufficient robustness in challenging scenarios. This study focuses on the simultaneous utilization of ILC and DOB to enhance system robustness. The proposed methodology specifically targets dynamically different linearized systems performing repetitive tasks. The systems share similar forms but differ in dynamics (e.g. sizes, masses, and controllers). Consequently, the design of learning filters must account for these differences in dynamics. To validate the approach, the study establishes a theoretical framework for designing learning filters in conjunction with DOB. The validity of the framework is then confirmed through numerical studies and experimental tests conducted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Although UAVs are nonlinear systems, the study employs a linearized controller as they operate in proximity to the hover condition.

      <title>Graph neural network-based surrogate modelling for real-time hydraulic prediction of urban drainage networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10324</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10324v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Physics-based models are computationally time-consuming and infeasible for real-time scenarios of urban drainage networks, and a surrogate model is needed to accelerate the online predictive modelling. Fully-connected neural networks (NNs) are potential surrogate models, but may suffer from low interpretability and efficiency in fitting complex targets. Owing to the state-of-the-art modelling power of graph neural networks (GNNs) and their match with urban drainage networks in the graph structure, this work proposes a GNN-based surrogate of the flow routing model for the hydraulic prediction problem of drainage networks, which regards recent hydraulic states as initial conditions, and future runoff and control policy as boundary conditions. To incorporate hydraulic constraints and physical relationships into drainage modelling, physics-guided mechanisms are designed on top of the surrogate model to restrict the prediction variables with flow balance and flooding occurrence constraints. According to case results in a stormwater network, the GNN-based model is more cost-effective with better hydraulic prediction accuracy than the NN-based model after equal training epochs, and the designed mechanisms further limit prediction errors with interpretable domain knowledge. As the model structure adheres to the flow routing mechanisms and hydraulic constraints in urban drainage networks, it provides an interpretable and effective solution for data-driven surrogate modelling. Simultaneously, the surrogate model accelerates the predictive modelling of urban drainage networks for real-time use compared with the physics-based model.</description>

      <title>UAV Trajectory Optimization for Sensing Exploiting Target Location Distribution Map</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10605</link>
      <description>arXiv:2404.10605v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: In this paper, we study the trajectory optimization of a cellular-connected unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) which aims to sense the location of a target while maintaining satisfactory communication quality with the ground base stations (GBSs). In contrast to most existing works which assumed the target's location is known, we focus on a more challenging scenario where the exact location of the target to be sensed is unknown and random, while its distribution is known a priori and stored in a novel target location distribution map. Based on this map, the probability for the UAV to successfully sense the target can be expressed as a function of the UAV's trajectory. We aim to optimize the UAV's trajectory between two pre-determined locations to maximize the overall sensing probability during its flight, subject to a GBS-UAV communication quality constraint at each time instant and a maximum mission completion time constraint. Despite the non-convexity and NP-hardness of this problem, we devise three high-quality suboptimal solutions tailored for it with polynomial complexity. Numerical results show that our proposed designs outperform various benchmark schemes.</description>

      <title>A hybrid Quantum-Classical Algorithm for Mixed-Integer Optimization in Power Systems</title>

Abstract: Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) can be considered the backbone of the modern power system optimization process, with a large application spectrum, from Unit Commitment and Optimal Transmission Switching to verifying Neural Networks for power system applications. The main issue of these formulations is the computational complexity of the solution algorithms, as they are considered NP-Hard problems. Quantum computing has been tested as a potential solution towards reducing the computational burden imposed by these problems, providing promising results, motivating the can be used to speedup the solution of MILPs. In this work, we present a general framework for solving power system optimization problems with a Quantum Computer (QC), which leverages mathematical tools and QCs' sampling ability to provide accelerated solutions. Our guiding applications are the optimal transmission switching and the verification of neural networks trained to solve a DC Optimal Power Flow. Specifically, using an accelerated version of Benders Decomposition , we split a given MILP into an Integer Master Problem and a linear Subproblem and solve it through a hybrid ``quantum-classical'' approach, getting the best of both worlds. We provide 2 use cases, and benchmark the developed framework against other classical and hybrid methodologies, to demonstrate the opportunities and challenges of hybrid quantum-classical algorithms for power system mixed integer optimization problems.</description>

      <title>A Systematic Survey of the Gemini Principles for Digital Twin Ontologies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.10754v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ontologies are widely used for achieving interoperable Digital Twins (DTws), yet competing DTw definitions compound interoperability issues. Semantically linking these differing twins is feasible through ontologies and Cognitive Digital Twins (CDTws). However, it is often unclear how ontology use bolsters broader DTw advancements. This article presents a systematic survey following the PRISMA method, to explore the potential of ontologies to support DTws to meet the Centre for Digital Built Britain's Gemini Principles and aims to link progress in ontologies to this framework. The Gemini Principles focus on common DTw requirements, considering: Purpose for 1) Public Good, 2) Value Creation, and 3) Insight; Trustworthiness with sufficient 4) Security, 5) Openness, and 6) Quality; and appropriate Functionality of 7) Federation, 8) Curation, and 9) Evolution. This systematic literature review examines the role of ontologies in facilitating each principle. Existing research uses ontologies to solve DTw challenges within these principles, particularly by connecting DTws, optimising decisionmaking, and reasoning governance policies. Furthermore, analysing the sectoral distribution of literature found that research encompassing the crossover of ontologies, DTws and the Gemini Principles is emerging, and that most innovation is predominantly within manufacturing and built environment sectors. Critical gaps for researchers, industry practitioners, and policymakers are subsequently identified.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2109.05777v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Adaptive model predictive control (MPC) robustly ensures safety while reducing uncertainty during operation. In this paper, a distributed version is proposed to deal with network systems featuring multiple agents and limited communication. To solve the problem in a distributed manner, structure is imposed on the control design ingredients without sacrificing performance. Decentralized and distributed adaptation schemes that allow for a reduction of the uncertainty online compatibly with the network topology are also proposed. The algorithm ensures robust constraint satisfaction, recursive feasibility and finite gain $\ell_2$ stability, and yields lower closed-loop cost compared to robust distributed MPC in simulations.</description>

      <title>Learning-based Position and Stiffness Feedforward Control of Antagonistic Soft Pneumatic Actuators using Gaussian Processes</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.01840v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Variable stiffness actuator (VSA) designs are manifold. Conventional model-based control of these nonlinear systems is associated with high effort and design-dependent assumptions. In contrast, machine learning offers a promising alternative as models are trained on real measured data and nonlinearities are inherently taken into account. Our work presents a universal, learning-based approach for position and stiffness control of soft actuators. After introducing a soft pneumatic VSA, the model is learned with input-output data. For this purpose, a test bench was set up which enables automated measurement of the variable joint stiffness. During control, Gaussian processes are used to predict pressures for achieving desired position and stiffness. The feedforward error is on average 11.5% of the total pressure range and is compensated by feedback control. Experiments with the soft actuator show that the learning-based approach allows continuous adjustment of position and stiffness without model knowledge.</description>

      <title>Learning-Based Optimal Control with Performance Guarantees for Unknown Systems with Latent States</title>

      <description>arXiv:2303.17963v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: As control engineering methods are applied to increasingly complex systems, data-driven approaches for system identification appear as a promising alternative to physics-based modeling. While the Bayesian approaches prevalent for safety-critical applications usually rely on the availability of state measurements, the states of a complex system are often not directly measurable. It may then be necessary to jointly estimate the dynamics and the latent state, making the quantification of uncertainties and the design of controllers with formal performance guarantees considerably more challenging. This paper proposes a novel method for the computation of an optimal input trajectory for unknown nonlinear systems with latent states based on a combination of particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methods and scenario theory. Probabilistic performance guarantees are derived for the resulting input trajectory, and an approach to validate the performance of arbitrary control laws is presented. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated in a numerical simulation.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2311.09793v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents Fossil 2.0, a new major release of a software tool for the synthesis of certificates (e.g., Lyapunov and barrier functions) for dynamical systems modelled as ordinary differential and difference equations. Fossil 2.0 is much improved from its original release, including new interfaces, a significantly expanded certificate portfolio, controller synthesis and enhanced extensibility. We present these new features as part of this tool paper. Fossil implements a counterexample-guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) loop ensuring the soundness of the method. Our tool uses neural networks as templates to generate candidate functions, which are then formally proven by an SMT solver acting as an assertion verifier. Improvements with respect to the first release include a wider range of certificates, synthesis of control laws, and support for discrete-time models.</description>

Abstract: Plant-soil negative feedback (PSNF) is the rise in soil of negative conditions for plant performance induced by the plants themselves, limiting the full potential yield and thus representing a loss for the agricultural industry. It has been recently shown that detrimental effects the PSNF has on the growth of plant's biomass can be mitigated by periodically intervening on the plant/soil system, for example by washing the soil. The periodic control inputs were computed by using an average model of the system and then applied in open-loop. In this paper we present two feedback control strategies, namely a PI and a MPC-based controllers, that, by adapting online the duty-cycle of the periodic control input, guarantee precise regulation of the biomass yield and at the same time robustness to unavoidable modeling errors and perturbations acting on the system. The performance of the proposed control strategies is then validated by means of extensive numerical simulations.</description>

Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to multi-agent reinforcement learning (RL) for linear systems with convex polytopic constraints. Existing work on RL has demonstrated the use of model predictive control (MPC) as a function approximator for the policy and value functions. The current paper is the first work to extend this idea to the multi-agent setting. We propose the use of a distributed MPC scheme as a function approximator, with a structure allowing for distributed learning and deployment. We then show that Q-learning updates can be performed distributively without introducing nonstationarity, by reconstructing a centralized learning update. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated on two numerical examples.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.13562v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of group target tracking (GTT), wherein multiple closely spaced targets within a group pose a coordinated motion. To improve the tracking performance, the labeled random finite sets (LRFSs) theory is adopted, and this paper develops a new kind of LRFSs, i.e., augmented LRFSs, which introduces group information into the definition of LRFSs. Specifically, for each element in an LRFS, the kinetic states, track label, and the corresponding group information of its represented target are incorporated. Furthermore, by means of the labeled multi-Bernoulli (LMB) filter with the proposed augmented LRFSs, the group structure is iteratively propagated and updated during the tracking process, which achieves the simultaneously estimation of the kinetic states, track label, and the corresponding group information of multiple group targets, and further improves the GTT tracking performance. Finally, simulation experiments are provided, which well demonstrates the effectiveness of the labeled multi-Bernoulli filter with the proposed augmented LRFSs for GTT tracking.</description>

      <title>Dynamic Modeling and Stability Analysis for Repeated LVRT Process of Wind Turbine Based on Switched System Theory</title>

      <description>arXiv:2404.01155v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The electrical distance between the wind power collection sending end grid and the main grid is relatively long, lacking synchronous power supply support. In this weak grid-connected wind power system, a new type of voltage oscillation phenomenon caused by repeated low voltage ride through (LVRT) of the wind turbine has been observed, threatening the safe and stable operation of power systems. Its dynamic evolution mechanisms and stability analysis approaches need to be studied urgently. Therefore, this paper introduces the switched system theory for dynamic modeling, mechanism explanation, and stability analysis of the repeated LVRT process. Firstly, considering the external connected impedance and internal control dynamics, a novel wind turbine grid-side converter (WT-GSC) switched system model is established, which can characterize the evolution dynamic and mechanism of the voltage oscillation. Then, the common Lyapunov function based sufficient stability criterion and stability index are proposed for stability analysis and assessment of the WT-GSC switched system. Moreover, to improve the system stability, the Sobol' global sensitivity analysis method is adopted to select the dominant parameters, which can be furtherly optimized through the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. Finally, simulations performed on a modified IEEE 39-bus test system verify the effectiveness of the proposed dynamic modeling and stability analysis methods.</description>

Abstract: This paper studies the effect of perturbations on the gradient flow of a general nonlinear programming problem, where the perturbation may arise from inaccurate gradient estimation in the setting of data-driven optimization. Under suitable conditions on the objective function, the perturbed gradient flow is shown to be small-disturbance input-to-state stable (ISS), which implies that, in the presence of a small-enough perturbation, the trajectories of the perturbed gradient flow must eventually enter a small neighborhood of the optimum. This work was motivated by the question of robustness of direct methods for the linear quadratic regulator problem, and specifically the analysis of the effect of perturbations caused by gradient estimation or round-off errors in policy optimization. We show small-disturbance ISS for three of the most common optimization algorithms: standard gradient flow, natural gradient flow, and Newton gradient flow.</description>

      <title>UAV-enabled Integrated Sensing and Communication: Tracking Design and Optimization</title>

      <description>arXiv:2401.03726v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) enabled by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) is a promising technology to facilitate target tracking applications. In contrast to conventional UAV-based ISAC system designs that mainly focus on estimating the target position, the target velocity estimation also needs to be considered due to its crucial impacts on link maintenance and real-time response, which requires new designs on resource allocation and tracking scheme. In this paper, we propose an extended Kalman filtering-based tracking scheme for a UAV-enabled ISAC system where a UAV tracks a moving object and also communicates with a device attached to the object. Specifically, a weighted sum of predicted posterior Cram\'er-Rao bound (PCRB) for object relative position and velocity estimation is minimized by optimizing the UAV trajectory, where an efficient solution is obtained based on the successive convex approximation method. Furthermore, under a special case with the measurement mean square error (MSE), the optimal relative motion state is obtained and proved to keep a fixed elevation angle and zero relative velocity. Numerical results validate that the obtained solution to the predicted PCRB minimization can be approximated by the optimal relative motion state when predicted measurement MSE dominates the predicted PCRBs, as well as the effectiveness of the proposed tracking scheme. Moreover, three interesting trade-offs on system performance resulted from the fixed elevation angle are illustrated.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2403.08159v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate sufficient conditions for the exponential stability of LTI systems driven by controllers derived from parametric optimization problems. Our primary focus is on parametric projection controllers, namely parametric programs whose objective function is the squared distance to a nominal controller. Leveraging the virtual system method of analysis and a novel contractivity result for Lur'e systems, we establish a sufficient LMI condition for the exponential stability of an LTI system with a parametric projection-based controller. Separately, we prove additional results for single-integrator systems. Finally, we apply our results to state-dependent saturated control systems and control barrier function-based control and provide numerical simulations.</description>

      <title>Rate-Optimal Non-Asymptotics for the Quadratic Prediction Error Method</title>

Abstract: We study the quadratic prediction error method -- i.e., nonlinear least squares -- for a class of time-varying parametric predictor models satisfying a certain identifiability condition. While this method is known to asymptotically achieve the optimal rate for a wide range of problems, there have been no non-asymptotic results matching these optimal rates outside of a select few, typically linear, model classes. By leveraging modern tools from learning with dependent data, we provide the first rate-optimal non-asymptotic analysis of this method for our more general setting of nonlinearly parametrized model classes. Moreover, we show that our results can be applied to a particular class of identifiable AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) models, resulting in the first optimal non-asymptotic rates for identification of ARMA models.</description>
