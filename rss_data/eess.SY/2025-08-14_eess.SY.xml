      <title>Design and Simulation of 6T SRAM Array</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09419</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09419v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Conventional 6T SRAM is used in microprocessors in the cache memory design. The basic 6T SRAM cell and a 6 bit memory array layout are designed in LEdit. The design and analysis of key SRAM components, sense amplifiers, decoders, write drivers and precharge circuits are also provided. The pulse voltage waveforms generated for read and write operations as well as Q and Qbar nodes are simulated in LTSpice. Parasitic capacitances are extracted and their impact on the waveforms analyzed. Static noise margin, propagation delays, and power dissipation are calculated. Comparison of SRAM read and write operational performance using CMOS transistors is made with edge-triggered D flip flops. If certain size area and ratio constraints are satisfied, the 6T cell with CMOS transistors will possess stability, speed, and power efficiency. Both theoretical and simulated results are given.</description>

      <title>Control Systems Analysis of a 3-Axis Photovoltatic Solar Tracker for Water Pumping</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09420</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09420v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose 3-axis solar tracker water pumping system. The solar tracker can rotate and tilt using stepper/DC motors and can rise and lower on a tripod using a linear actuator. The charge generated from solar energy absorbed by photovoltaic (PV) cells in the solar panel is stored in a 12V battery that in turn powers two water diaphragm pumps using a solar charge controller. The PV uses four light photocell resistors/sensors to measure light intensity. A solar tracking algorithm determines the optimal angle for PV positioning. Using an ultrasonic sensor to measure the water level in a reservoir water tank, water is pumped from one water tank to the reservoir. Based on soil moisture sensor levels, a second water pump supplies water from the reservoir to the plant. The system is analyzed from a control systems perspective. The transfer functions, root loci, and Bode plots are generated and simulated and experimental results are provided as well as stability and steady-state error analysis.</description>

      <title>Imperfect Competition in Markets for Short-Circuit Current Services</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09425</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09425v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: An important limitation of Inverter-Based Resources (IBR) is their reduced contribution to Short-Circuit Current (SCC), as compared to that of Synchronous Generators (SGs). With increasing penetration of IBR in most power systems, the reducing SCC poses challenges to a secure system operation, as line protections may not trip when required. In order to address this issue, the SCC ancillary service could be procured via an economic mechanism, aiming at securing adequate SCC on all buses. However, the suitability of markets for SCC services is not well understood, given that these could be prone to market-power issues: since the SCC contributions from various SGs to a certain bus are determined by the electrical topology of the grid, this is a highly local service. It is necessary to understand if SGs at advantageous electrical locations could exert market power and, if so, how it could be mitigated. In order to fill this gap, this paper adopts an SCC-constrained bilevel model to investigate strategic behaviors of SGs. To address the non-convexity due to unit commitment variables, the model is restructured through a primal-dual formulation. Based on a modified IEEE 30-bus system, cases with strategic SGs placed at different buses are analyzed. These studies demonstrate that agents exerting market power could achieve up to triple revenues from SCC provision, highlighting the need to carefully design these markets.</description>

      <title>From Micro to Macro Flow Modeling: Characterizing Heterogeneity of Mixed-Autonomy Traffic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09432</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09432v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Most autonomous-vehicles (AVs) driving strategies are designed and analyzed at the vehicle level, yet their aggregate impact on macroscopic traffic flow is still not understood, particularly the flow heterogeneity that emerges when AVs interact with human-driven vehicles (HVs). Existing validation techniques for macroscopic flow models rely on high-resolution spatiotemporal data spanning entire road segments which are rarely available for mixed-autonomy traffic. AVs record detailed Lagrangian trajectories of the ego vehicle and surrounding traffic through onboard sensors. Leveraging these Lagrangian observations to validate mixed-autonomy flow models therefore remains an open research challenge. This paper closes the gap between microscopic Lagrangian data and macroscopic Euclidean traffic models by introducing a continuous traffic-heterogeneity attribute. We represent traffic flow with two coupled conservation laws with one for vehicle number and one for the traffic attribute. Reconstruction methods are designed to derive the traffic attribute from Lagrangian vehicle trajectories. When abundant trajectory data are available, we characterize traffic heterogeneity by extracting drivers' desired speed and local behavioral uncertainty from trajectories. In data-scarce mixed traffic, we design an end-to-end mapping that infers the traffic heterogeneity solely from trajectories in the current spatiotemporal region. Experiments across multiple traffic datasets show that the proposed model effectively captures traffic heterogeneity by clustering the fundamental diagram scatter into attribute-based groups. The calibration errors of traffic flow dynamics are also reduce by 20% relative to the Aw-Rascle-Zhang model benchmark. Detailed analyses further show that the model generalizes well, maintaining nearly the same accuracy when evaluated under a variety of previously unseen traffic conditions.</description>

      <title>From Formal Methods to Data-Driven Safety Certificates of Unknown Large-Scale Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09520</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09520v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we propose a data-driven scheme within a compositional framework with noisy data to design robust safety controllers in a fully decentralized fashion for large-scale interconnected networks with unknown mathematical dynamics. Despite the network's high dimensionality and the inherent complexity of its unknown model, which make it intractable, our approach effectively addresses these challenges by (i) treating the network as a composition of smaller subsystems, and (ii) collecting noisy data from each subsystem's trajectory to design a control sub-barrier certificate (CSBC) and its corresponding local controller. To achieve this, our proposed scheme only requires a noise-corrupted single input-state trajectory from each unknown subsystem up to a specified time horizon, satisfying a certain rank condition. Subsequently, under a small-gain compositional reasoning, we compose those CSBC, derived from noisy data, and formulate a control barrier certificate (CBC) for the unknown network, ensuring its safety over an infinite time horizon, while providing correctness guarantees. We offer a data-dependent sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization program for computing CSBC alongside local controllers of subsystems. We illustrate that while the computational complexity of designing a CBC and its safety controller grows polynomially with network dimension using SOS optimization, our compositional data-driven approach significantly reduces it to a linear scale concerning the number of subsystems. We demonstrate the capability of our data-driven approach on multiple physical networks involving unknown models and a range of interconnection topologies.</description>

      <title>Shepherd Grid Strategy: Towards Reliable SWARM Interception</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09536</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09536v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern unmanned aerial vehicle threats require sophisticated interception strategies that can overcome advanced evasion capabilities and operate effectively in contested environments. Traditional single-interceptor and uncoordinated multi-interceptor approaches suffer from fundamental limitations including inadequate coverage, predictable pursuit patterns, and vulnerability to intelligent evasion maneuvers. This paper introduces the Shepherd Grid Strategy, a new multi-phase coordination framework that employs pack-based behavioral coordination to achieve deterministic target interception through systematic containment and coordinated strike execution. The strategy implements a four-phase operational model consisting of chase, follow, formation, and engagement phases, with dynamic role assignment and adaptive formation geometry that maintains persistent target pressure while preparing optimal strike opportunities. Our approach incorporates three key innovations: adaptive phase transition mechanisms that optimize pursuit behavior based on proximity and mission objectives, dynamic role assignment systems that designate specialized interceptor functions including formation maintenance and strike execution, and predictive formation geometry algorithms that create mobile containment grids adapting to target movement patterns. The simulation experiments demonstrate significant performance improvements over traditional methods, achieving near-perfect interception success rates (over 95%) compared to traditional approaches (65%) and reducing median time-to-intercept.</description>

      <title>Metering traffic flows for perimeter control through auction-based signalling using connected vehicles</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09678</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09678v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Urban traffic congestion remains a critical challenge in modern cities, with traffic signal control systems often struggling to manage congestion during peak travel times. Perimeter control of a Protected Network (PN) has emerged as a potential solution to reducing gridlock in urban networks. This paper proposes a novel auction-based mechanism for green time allocation at signalized intersections, for effective perimeter control application. Utilising a Sealed Bid, Second Price auction framework, our approach combines real-time traffic monitoring with market-inspired mechanisms to regulate vehicle inflows into PN areas. Unlike existing methods that focus primarily on gated links, our system allocates budgets to individual traffic movements, providing greater flexibility in managing multi-directional flows. We evaluate the proposed mechanism using a test case intersection with a single controlled inflow, comparing it against a volume-based fixed-time approach. The results demonstrate that our auction-based method controls flows into the PN with improved accuracy, outperforming the volume-based approach in terms of inflow regulation, queue management and delays. The framework can be applied in real time to any generic intersection, offering a scalable solution for urban traffic management. This work bridges the gap between perimeter control and market-based intersection auctions, providing a pathway for further research on adaptive traffic management systems.</description>

      <title>A Divide-and-Conquer Tiling Method for the Design of Large Aperiodic Phased Arrays</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09682</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09682v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Due to the growing request from modern wireless applications of cost-affordable and high-gain scanning antenna solutions, the design of large phased arrays (PAs) with radiating elements organized into modular clusters with sub-array-only amplitude and phase control is a key topic. In this paper, an innovative irregular tiling method is proposed where, according to a divide-and-conquer strategy, the antenna aperture is subdivided into sub-areas that are locally domino-tiled by jointly fulfilling the full-coverage condition on the remaining untiled part of the PA support. Selected representative results, including comparisons with competitive state-of-the-art synthesis methods, are reported to prove the effectiveness and the computational efficiency of the proposed tiling approach. Use-cases of current relevance for low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications are discussed, as well, to provide the antenna designers useful practical guidelines for handling large PAs.</description>

      <title>Integrated Learning and Optimization to Control Load Demand and Wind Generation for Minimizing Ramping Cost in Real-Time Electricity Market</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09774</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09774v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We developed a new integrated learning and optimization (ILO) methodology to predict context-aware unknown parameters in economic dispatch (ED), a crucial problem in power systems solved to generate optimal power dispatching decisions to serve consumer load. The ED formulation in the current study consists of load and renewable generation as unknown parameters in its constraints predicted using contextual information (e.g., prior load, temperature). The ILO framework train a neural network (NN) to estimate ED parameters by minimizing an application-specific regret function which is a difference between ground truth and NN-driven decisions favouring better ED decisions. We thoroughly analyze the feasible region of ED formulation to understand the impact of load and renewable learning together on the ED decisions. Corresponding to that we developed a new regret function to capture real-time electricity market operations where differences in predicted and true loads are corrected by ramping generators in real-time but at a higher cost than the market price. The proposed regret function when minimized using ILO framework train the NN to guide the load and renewable predictions to generate ED decisions favouring minimum generator ramping costs. This is unlike conventional sequential learning and optimization (SLO) framework which train NN to accurately estimate load and renewable instead of better ED decisions. The combined training of load and renewable using ILO is a new concept and lead to significantly improved ramping costs when compared with SLO based training of load and renewable and SLO trained load with 100% accurate renewable proving its decision-focused capability.</description>

      <title>Collision-Free Bearing-Driven Formation Tracking for Euler-Lagrange Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09908</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09908v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the problem of tracking formations driven by bearings for heterogeneous Euler-Lagrange systems with parametric uncertainty in the presence of multiple moving leaders. To estimate the leaders' velocities and accelerations, we first design a distributed observer for the leader system, utilizing a bearing-based localization condition in place of the conventional connectivity assumption. This observer, coupled with an adaptive mechanism, enables the synthesis of a novel distributed control law that guides the formation towards the target formation, without requiring prior knowledge of the system parameters. Furthermore, we establish a sufficient condition, dependent on the initial formation configuration, that ensures collision avoidance throughout the formation evolution. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through a numerical example.</description>

      <title>Online Safety under Multiple Constraints and Input Bounds using gatekeeper: Theory and Applications</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09963</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09963v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This letter presents an approach to guarantee online safety of a cyber-physical system under multiple state and input constraints. Our proposed framework, called gatekeeper, recursively guarantees the existence of an infinite-horizon trajectory that satisfies all constraints and system dynamics. Such trajectory is constructed using a backup controller, which we define formally in this paper. gatekeeper relies on a small number of verifiable assumptions, and is computationally efficient since it requires optimization over a single scalar variable. We make two primary contributions in this letter. (A) First, we develop the theory of gatekeeper: we derive a sub-optimality bound relative to a full nonlinear trajectory optimization problem, and show how this can be used in runtime to validate performance. This also informs the design of the backup controllers and sets. (B) Second, we demonstrate in detail an application of gatekeeper for multi-agent formation flight, where each Dubins agent must avoid multiple obstacles and weapons engagement zones, both of which are nonlinear, nonconvex constraints.</description>

      <title>Long-Term Client Selection for Federated Learning with Non-IID Data: A Truthful Auction Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09181</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09181v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) provides a decentralized framework that enables universal model training through collaborative efforts on mobile nodes, such as smart vehicles in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). Each smart vehicle acts as a mobile client, contributing to the process without uploading local data. This method leverages non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) training data from different vehicles, influenced by various driving patterns and environmental conditions, which can significantly impact model convergence and accuracy. Although client selection can be a feasible solution for non-IID issues, it faces challenges related to selection metrics. Traditional metrics evaluate client data quality independently per round and require client selection after all clients complete local training, leading to resource wastage from unused training results. In the IoV context, where vehicles have limited connectivity and computational resources, information asymmetry in client selection risks clients submitting false information, potentially making the selection ineffective. To tackle these challenges, we propose a novel Long-term Client-Selection Federated Learning based on Truthful Auction (LCSFLA). This scheme maximizes social welfare with consideration of long-term data quality using a new assessment mechanism and energy costs, and the advised auction mechanism with a deposit requirement incentivizes client participation and ensures information truthfulness. We theoretically prove the incentive compatibility and individual rationality of the advised incentive mechanism. Experimental results on various datasets, including those from IoV scenarios, demonstrate its effectiveness in mitigating performance degradation caused by non-IID data.</description>

      <title>Fake-Mamba: Real-Time Speech Deepfake Detection Using Bidirectional Mamba as Self-Attention's Alternative</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09294</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09294v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Advances in speech synthesis intensify security threats, motivating real-time deepfake detection research. We investigate whether bidirectional Mamba can serve as a competitive alternative to Self-Attention in detecting synthetic speech. Our solution, Fake-Mamba, integrates an XLSR front-end with bidirectional Mamba to capture both local and global artifacts. Our core innovation introduces three efficient encoders: TransBiMamba, ConBiMamba, and PN-BiMamba. Leveraging XLSR's rich linguistic representations, PN-BiMamba can effectively capture the subtle cues of synthetic speech. Evaluated on ASVspoof 21 LA, 21 DF, and In-The-Wild benchmarks, Fake-Mamba achieves 0.97%, 1.74%, and 5.85% EER, respectively, representing substantial relative gains over SOTA models XLSR-Conformer and XLSR-Mamba.

      <title>Satellites are closer than you think: A near field MIMO approach for Ground stations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09374</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09374v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The rapid growth of low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations has revolutionized broadband access, earth observation, and direct-to-device connectivity. However, the expansion of ground station infrastructure has not kept pace, creating a critical bottleneck in satellite-to-ground backhaul capacity. Traditional parabolic dish antennas, though effective for geostationary (GEO) satellites, are ill-suited for dense, fastmoving LEO networks due to mechanical steering delays and their inability to track multiple satellites simultaneously. Phased array antennas offer electronically steerable beams and multisatellite support, but their integration into ground stations is limited by the high cost, hardware issues, and complexity of achieving sufficient antenna gain. We introduce ArrayLink, a distributed phased array architecture that coherently combines multiple small commercially available panels to achieve high-gain beamforming and unlock line-of-sight MIMO spatial multiplexing with minimal additional capital expenditure. By spacing 16 (32x32) panels across a kilometer-scale aperture, ArrayLink enters the radiative near-field, focusing energy in both angle and range while supporting up to four simultaneous spatial streams on a single feeder link. Through rigorous theoretical analysis, detailed 2D beam pattern simulations and real-world hardware experiments, we show that ArrayLink (i) achieves dish-class gain with in range 1-2 dB of 1.47 m reflector, (ii) maintains four parallel streams at ranges of hundreds of kilometers (falling to two beyond 2000 km), and (iii) exhibits tight agreement across theory, simulation, and experiment with minimal variance. These findings open a practical and scalable path to boosting LEO backhaul capacity.</description>

      <title>Offline Auto Labeling: BAAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09585</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09585v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: This paper introduces BAAS, a new Extended Object Tracking (EOT) and fusion-based label annotation framework for radar detections in autonomous driving. Our framework utilizes Bayesian-based tracking, smoothing and eventually fusion methods to provide veritable and precise object trajectories along with shape estimation to provide annotation labels on the detection level under various supervision levels. Simultaneously, the framework provides evaluation of tracking performance and label annotation. If manually labeled data is available, each processing module can be analyzed independently or combined with other modules to enable closed-loop continuous improvements. The framework performance is evaluated in a challenging urban real-world scenario in terms of tracking performance and the label annotation errors. We demonstrate the functionality of the proposed approach for varying dynamic objects and class types</description>

      <title>HapticGiant: A Novel Very Large Kinesthetic Haptic Interface with Hierarchical Force Control</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09595</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09595v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Research in virtual reality and haptic technologies has consistently aimed to enhance immersion. While advanced head-mounted displays are now commercially available, kinesthetic haptic interfaces still face challenges such as limited workspaces, insufficient degrees of freedom, and kinematics not matching the human arm. In this paper, we present HapticGiant, a novel large-scale kinesthetic haptic interface designed to match the properties of the human arm as closely as possible and to facilitate natural user locomotion while providing full haptic feedback. The interface incorporates a novel admittance-type force control scheme, leveraging hierarchical optimization to render both arbitrary serial kinematic chains and Cartesian admittances. Notably, the proposed control scheme natively accounts for system limitations, including joint and Cartesian constraints, as well as singularities. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of HapticGiant and its control scheme, paving the way for highly immersive virtual reality applications.</description>

      <title>Duty-Cycling is Not Enough in Constrained IoT Networking: Revealing the Energy Savings of Dynamic Clock Scaling</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09620</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09620v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Minimizing energy consumption of low-power wireless nodes is a persistent challenge from the constrained Internet of Things (IoT). In this paper, we start from the observation that constrained IoT devices have largely different hardware (im-)balances than full-scale machines. We find that the performance gap between MCU and network throughput on constrained devices enables minimal energy delay product (EDP) for IoT networking at largely reduced clock frequencies. We analyze the potentials by integrating dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) into the RIOT IoT operating system and show that the DVFS reconfiguration overhead stays below the energy saved for a single, downscaled MAC operation. Backed by these findings, we systematically investigate how DVFS further improves energy-efficiency for common networking tasks -- in addition to duty-cycling. We measure IoT communication scenarios between real-world systems and analyze two MAC operating modes -- CSMA/CA and time slotting -- in combination with different CoAP transactions, payload sizes, as well as DTLS transport encryption. Our experiments reveal energy savings between 24% and 52% for MAC operations and up to 37% for encrypted CoAP communication. These results shall encourage research and system design work to integrate DVFS in future IoT devices for performing tasks at their optimal frequencies and thereby significantly extending battery lifetimes.</description>

      <title>A Shank Angle-Based Control System Enables Soft Exoskeleton to Assist Human Non-Steady Locomotion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.09876v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Exoskeletons have been shown to effectively assist humans during steady locomotion. However, their effects on non-steady locomotion, characterized by nonlinear phase progression within a gait cycle, remain insufficiently explored, particularly across diverse activities. This work presents a shank angle-based control system that enables the exoskeleton to maintain real-time coordination with human gait, even under phase perturbations, while dynamically shaping assistance profiles to match the biological ankle moment patterns across walking, running, stair negotiation tasks. The control system consists of an assistance profile online generation method and a model-based feedforward control method. The assistance profile is formulated as a dual-Gaussian model with the shank angle as the independent variable. Leveraging only IMU measurements, the model parameters are updated online each stride to adapt to inter- and intra-individual biomechanical variability. The profile tracking control employs a human-exoskeleton kinematics and stiffness model as a feedforward component, reducing reliance on historical control data due to the lack of clear and consistent periodicity in non-steady locomotion. Three experiments were conducted using a lightweight soft exoskeleton with multiple subjects. The results validated the effectiveness of each individual method, demonstrated the robustness of the control system against gait perturbations across various activities, and revealed positive biomechanical and physiological responses of human users to the exoskeleton's mechanical assistance.</description>

      <title>SINDyG: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-Structured Data, with Applications to Stuart-Landau Oscillator Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04463</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.04463v5 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The combination of machine learning (ML) and sparsity-promoting techniques is enabling direct extraction of governing equations from data, revolutionizing computational modeling in diverse fields of science and engineering. The discovered dynamical models could be used to address challenges in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, epidemiology, and beyond. However, most existing sparse identification methods for discovering dynamical systems treat the whole system as one without considering the interactions between subsystems. As a result, such models are not able to capture small changes in the emergent system behavior. To address this issue, we developed a new method called Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamical Systems from Graph-structured data (SINDyG), which incorporates the network structure into sparse regression to identify model parameters that explain the underlying network dynamics. We tested our proposed method using several case studies of neuronal dynamics, where we modeled the macroscopic oscillation of a population of neurons using the extended Stuart-Landau (SL) equation and utilize the SINDyG method to identify the underlying nonlinear dynamics. Our extensive computational experiments validate the improved accuracy and simplicity of discovered network dynamics when compared to the original SINDy approach. The proposed graph-informed penalty can be easily integrated with other symbolic regression algorithms, enhancing model interpretability and performance by incorporating network structure into the regression process.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates the spread of infectious diseases within a networked community by integrating epidemic transmission and public opinion dynamics. We propose a novel discrete-time networked SIS (Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible) epidemic model coupled with opinion dynamics that includes stubborn agents with biased views. The model captures the interplay between perceived and actual epidemic severity, offering insights into epidemic dynamics in socially interconnected environments. We introduce the SIS-opinion reproduction number to assess epidemic severity and analyze conditions for disease eradication and the global stability of endemic equilibria. Additionally, we explore opinion-based intervention strategies, providing a framework for policymakers to design effective prevention measures. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate our theoretical findings and the model's practical implications.</description>

      <title>Routing Guidance for Emerging Transportation Systems with Improved Dynamic Trip Equity</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.12601v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This paper presents a dynamic routing guidance system that optimizes route recommendations for individual vehicles in an emerging transportation system while enhancing travelers' trip equity. We develop a framework to quantify trip quality and equity in dynamic travel environments, providing new insights into how routing guidance influences equity in road transportation. Our approach enables real-time routing by incorporating both monitored and anticipated traffic congestion. We provide conditions that ensure perfect trip equity for all travelers in a free-flow network. Simulation studies on 1,000 vehicles traversing an urban road network in Boston demonstrate that our method improves trip equity by approximately 11.4\% compared to the shortest-route strategy. In addition, the results reveal that our approach redistributes travel costs across vehicle types through route optimization, contributing to a more equitable transportation system.</description>

      <title>Directional excitability in Hilbert spaces</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00297v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We introduce a generalized excitable system in which spikes can happen in a continuum of directions, therefore drastically enriching the expressivity and control capability of the spiking dynamics. In this generalized excitable system, spiking trajectories happen in a Hilbert space with an excitable resting state at the origin and spike responses that can be triggered in any direction as a function of the system's state and inputs. State-dependence of the spiking direction provide the system with a vanishing spiking memory trace, which enables robust tracking and integration of inputs in the spiking direction history. The model exhibits generalized forms of both Hodgkin's Type I and Type II excitability, capturing their usual bifurcation behaviors in an abstract setting. When used as the controller of a two-dimensional navigation task, this model facilitates both the sparseness of the actuation and its sensitivity to environmental inputs. These results highlight the potential of the proposed generalized excitable model for excitable control in high- and infinite-dimensional spaces.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2505.03596v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We consider a distributed cloud service deployed at a set of distinct server pools. Arriving jobs are classified into heterogeneous types, in accordance with their setup times which are differentiated at each of the pools. A dispatcher for each job type controls the balance of load between pools, based on decentralized feedback. The system of rates and queues is modeled by a fluid differential equation system, and analyzed via convex optimization. A first, myopic policy is proposed, based on task delay-to-service. Under a simplified dynamic fluid queue model, we prove global convergence to an equilibrium point which minimizes the mean setup time; however queueing delays are incurred with this method. A second proposal is then developed based on proximal optimization, which explicitly models the setup queue and is proved to reach an optimal equilibrium, devoid of queueing delay. Results are demonstrated through a simulation example.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2310.16985v4 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Model-predictive control (MPC) is a powerful tool for controlling highly dynamic robotic systems subject to complex constraints. However, MPC is computationally demanding, and is often impractical to implement on small, resource-constrained robotic platforms. We present TinyMPC, a high-speed MPC solver with a low memory footprint targeting the microcontrollers common on small robots. Our approach is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and leverages the structure of the MPC problem for efficiency. We demonstrate TinyMPC's effectiveness by benchmarking against the state-of-the-art solver OSQP, achieving nearly an order of magnitude speed increase, as well as through hardware experiments on a 27 gram quadrotor, demonstrating high-speed trajectory tracking and dynamic obstacle avoidance. TinyMPC is publicly available at https://tinympc.org.</description>

      <title>The Holonomy of Optimal Mass Transport: The Gaussian-Linear Case</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14707</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.14707v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: The theory of Monge-Kantorovich Optimal Mass Transport (OMT) has in recent years spurred a fast developing phase of research in stochastic control, control of ensemble systems, thermodynamics, data science, and several other fields in engineering and science. We herein introduce a new type of transportation problems. The salient feature of these problems is that particles/agents in the ensemble are labeled and their relative position along their journey is of interest. Of particular importance in our program are control laws that steer ensembles along cycles ensuring that individual particles return to their original position. This feature is in contrast with the classical theory of optimal transport where the primary object of study is the path of probability densities, without any concern about particle labels. In the theory that we present, we focus on the case Gaussian distributions and linear dynamics, and explore a hitherto unstudied sub-Riemannian structure of Monge-Kantorovich transport where the relative position of particles along their journey is modeled by the holonomy of the transportation schedule. From this vantage point, we discuss several other problems of independent interest.</description>

      <title>Barriers on the EDGE: A scalable CBF architecture over EDGE for safe aerial-ground multi-agent coordination</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16608</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.16608v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In this article, we propose a control architecture for the safe, coordinated operation of a multi-agent system with aerial (UAVs) and ground (UGVs) robots in a confined task space. We consider the case where the aerial and ground operations are coupled, enabled by the capability of the aerial robots to land on moving ground robots. The proposed method uses time-varying Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) to impose safety constraints associated with (i) collision avoidance between agents, (ii) landing of UAVs on mobile UGVs, and (iii) task space restriction. Further, this article addresses the challenge induced by the rapid increase in the number of CBF constraints with the increasing number of agents through a hybrid centralized-distributed coordination approach that determines the set of CBF constraints that is relevant for every aerial and ground agent at any given time. A centralized node (Watcher), hosted by an edge computing cluster, activates the relevant constraints, thus reducing the network complexity and the need for high onboard processing on the robots. The CBF constraints are enforced in a distributed manner by individual robots that run a nominal controller and safety filter locally to overcome latency and other network nonidealities.</description>

Abstract: With the rapid development of robot swarm technology and its diverse applications, navigating robot swarms through complex environments has emerged as a critical research direction. To ensure safe navigation and avoid potential collisions with obstacles, the concept of virtual tubes has been introduced to define safe and navigable regions. However, current control methods in virtual tubes face the congestion issues, particularly in narrow ones with low throughput. To address these challenges, we first propose a novel control method that combines a modified artificial potential field (APF) for swarm navigation and density feedback control for distribution regulation. Then we generate a global velocity field that not only ensures collision-free navigation but also achieves locally input-to-state stability (LISS) for density tracking. Finally, numerical simulations and realistic applications validate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method in navigating robot swarms through narrow virtual tubes.</description>

      <title>On learning racing policies with reinforcement learning</title>

Abstract: Fully autonomous vehicles promise enhanced safety and efficiency. However, ensuring reliable operation in challenging corner cases requires control algorithms capable of performing at the vehicle limits. We address this requirement by considering the task of autonomous racing and propose solving it by learning a racing policy using Reinforcement Learning (RL). Our approach leverages domain randomization, actuator dynamics modeling, and policy architecture design to enable reliable and safe zero-shot deployment on a real platform. Evaluated on the F1TENTH race car, our RL policy not only surpasses a state-of-the-art Model Predictive Control (MPC), but, to the best of our knowledge, also represents the first instance of an RL policy outperforming expert human drivers in RC racing. This work identifies the key factors driving this performance improvement, providing critical insights for the design of robust RL-based control strategies for autonomous vehicles.</description>

      <title>Performance Benchmarking of Machine Learning Models for Terahertz Metamaterial Absorber Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08611</link>

Abstract: This study presents a polarization-insensitive ultra-broadband terahertz metamaterial absorber based on vanadium dioxide (VO2) and evaluates machine learning methods for predicting its absorption performance. The structure consists of a VO2 metasurface, a MF2 dielectric spacer, and a gold ground plane. It achieves more than 90% absorption between 5.72 and 11.11 THz, covering a 5.38 THz bandwidth with an average absorptance of 98.15%. A dataset of 9,018 samples was generated from full-wave simulations by varying patch width, dielectric thickness, and frequency. Six regression models were trained: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Bagging. Performance was measured using adjusted R2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Ensemble models achieved the best results, with Bagging reaching an adjusted R2 of 0.9985 and RMSE of 0.0146. The workflow offers a faster alternative to exhaustive simulations and can be applied to other metamaterial designs, enabling efficient evaluation and optimization.</description>
