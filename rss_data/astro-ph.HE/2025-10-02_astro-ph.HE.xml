      <title>Probing the accreting millisecond X-ray pulsar SAX J1808.4-3658 using the evolution of its spectral and aperiodic timing properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01207</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01207v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding accretion components in neutron star (NS) low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) systems is important to probe fundamental aspects of accretion mechanism and evolution of the system constraining its physical properties. Here, we present spectral and aperiodic timing analyses of the NICER and AstroSat data from the accretion powered millisecond X-ray pulsar (AMXP) SAX J1808.4-3658 during its 2022 outburst. We find that emissions from a softer accretion disk and a harder, centrally located, compact, partially covering, Comptonizing corona explains the continuum spectra from the source throughout the outburst. The disk inner edge temperature, the coronal electron temperature and photon index are found to be around ~ 0.5-0.9 keV, a few keV and ~ 1.1-1.8, respectively, during the entire outburst. We also find an intrinsic atomic hydrogen medium in the system, which substantially and systematically evolved throughout the outburst. We detect two broadband aperiodic features (~ 0.004-2 Hz; ~ 10-100 Hz), with the former having a significant hard lag of ~ 11 ms between 1.5-10.0 keV and 0.5-1.5 keV photons. We conclude that both the disk photons and the photons up-scattered by the corona contributed to each aperiodic feature, with the disk and the corona contributing more to the low and high frequency ones, respectively.</description>

      <title>Spin period evolution and X-ray spectral characteristics of the SMC pulsar SXP 46.6</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01208</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01208v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We characterize the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) pulsar SXP 46.6 using NuSTAR observations conducted in 2017. The spin period (P) of this neutron star decreased from its discovered value of 46.6 s to a value of 45.984(1) s, indicating a spin-up at the rate of \dot{P} = -1.13 x 10^{-9} s s^{-1}. This spin-up rate is used to calculate a high pulsar magnetic field value of 2.25 x 10^{13} G. This process also gives a low magnetic field value, which we rule out here by constraining the inner accretion disk radius to be less than the radius of the innermost stable circular orbit. The pulse profile, analyzed in soft, hard, and broad X-ray bands, shows a double-peaked structure, consistent with pencil beam emission from two antipodal hot spots on the neutron star surface. We also perform spin phase-resolved spectroscopy for the first time, revealing spectral variations across different phases of the pulsar's rotation. These results offer new insights into the long-term spin evolution and emission properties of SXP 46.6.</description>

      <title>Infrared Synchrotron Emission in the Soft State of GX 339-4 and the Mid-Infrared/X-ray Luminosity Plane of Black Hole X-ray Binaries</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01338v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Progress in understanding the growth of accreting black holes remains hampered by a lack of sensitive coordinated multiwavelength observations. In particular, the mid-infrared (MIR) regime remains ill-explored except for jet-dominant states. Here, we present comprehensive follow-up of the black hole X-ray binary GX 339-4 during a disc-dominated state in its 2023/24 outburst as part of a multi-wavelength campaign coordinated around JWST/MIRI. The X-ray properties are fairly typical of soft accretion states, with a high-energy Comptonised tail. The source is significantly detected between 5-10$\mu$m, albeit at a faint flux level requiring MIR compact jet emission to be quenched by a factor of $\sim$300 or more relative to previous hard-state detections. The MIRI spectrum can be described as a simple power-law with slope $\alpha$ = +0.39$\pm$0.07 ($F_\nu$ $\propto$ $\nu^\alpha$), but surprisingly matches neither the radio/sub-mm nor the optical broadband slopes. Significant MIR stochastic variability is detected. Synchrotron radiation from the same medium responsible for high-energy Comptonisation can self-consistently account for the observed MIRI spectral-timing behaviour, offering new constraints on the physical conditions in the soft-state accretion disc atmosphere/corona. Alternative explanations, including a circumbinary disc or emission from a warm wind, fail to cleanly explain either the spectral properties or the variability. Multiwavelength timing cross-correlations show a puzzlingly long MIR lag relative to the optical, though at limited significance. We compile archival MIR and X-ray luminosities of transient black hole systems, including previously unreported detections of GX 339-4. These trace the evolution of the MIR-to-X-ray flux ratio with accretion state, and also reveal high MIR luminosities for GX 339-4 across all states. (abridged)</description>

      <title>Discovery of diffuse gamma-ray emission in the vicinity of G172.8+1.5: An old supernova remnant with different turbulence properties</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01340v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the detection of high-energy $\gamma$-ray emission in the vicinity of G172.8+1.5, which is debated as a Supernova remnant (SNR) or an ionized hydrogen (H$_{\rm{II}}$) region. Using 16-yr Pass 8 data from Fermi Large Area Telescope (Fermi-LAT), we found the GeV emission can be described by two extended sources with different photon spectra. Among them, the much more extended $\gamma$-ray source SrcA with a Power-law spectrum is spatially coincident with a giant neutral Hydrogen shell structure and several OB stars inside a huge H$_{\rm{II}}$ region. The softer Log-Parabola spectra $\gamma$-ray source SrcB is spatially coincident with a star-forming region with several OB stars, maser sources and IR sources. Gas observation results display a dense molecular cloud surrounding SrcB in the velocity range of [-25,-5] km s$^{-1}$. The possible origins of $\gamma$-ray emission are discussed, including CRs escaped from SNR shock surface and illuminated nearby MC, the young massive star clusters associated with the star-forming region and a pulsar halo generated by an invisible energetic pulsar inside the SNR. Furthermore, under the hadronic scenario, the measured diffusion coefficient in the compact SrcB region is significantly lower than that of the more extended SrcA. This suppression is likely attributed to cosmic-ray-driven instabilities, which reduce the diffusion efficiency in the vicinity of the source relative to the standard conditions in the interstellar medium (ISM). Future advanced analysis from LHAASO observation results would help distinguish the origins of $\gamma$-ray emission in this region and clarify the nature of this source.</description>

      <title>Microquasars as the major contributors to Galactic cosmic rays around the "knee"</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01369</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01369v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recently, LHAASO detected a gamma-ray emission extending beyond $100\,\rm{TeV}$ from 4 sources associated to powerful microquasars. We propose that such sources are the main Galactic PeVatrons and investigate their contribution to the proton and gamma-ray fluxes by modeling their entire population. We find that the presence of only $\sim10$ active powerful microquasars in the Galaxy at any given time is sufficient to account for the proton flux around the knee and to provide a very good explanation of cosmic-ray and gamma-ray data in a self-consistent picture. The $10\,\rm{TeV}$ bump and the $300\,\rm{TeV}$ hardening in the cosmic-ray spectrum naturally appear, and the diffuse background measured by LHAASO above a few tens of $\rm{TeV}$ is accounted for. This supports the paradigm in which cosmic rays around the knee are predominantly accelerated in a very limited number of powerful microquasars.</description>

      <title>Pinpointing the location of the gamma-ray emitting region in the FSRQ 4C+01.28</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01476</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01476v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The FSRQ 4C+01.28 is a bright and highly variable radio and $\gamma$-ray emitter. We aim to pinpoint the location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting region within its jet in order to derive strong constraints on $\gamma$-ray emission models for blazar jets. We use radio and $\gamma$-ray data obtained with ALMA, OVRO, SMA and Fermi/LAT to study the cross-correlation between $\gamma$-ray and multi-frequency radio light curves. Moreover, we employ VLBA observations at 43 GHz over a period of around nine years to study the parsec-scale jet kinematics. To pinpoint the location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting region, we use a model in which outbursts shown in the $\gamma$-ray and radio light curves are produced when moving jet components pass through the $\gamma$-ray emitting and the radio core regions. We find two bright and compact newly ejected jet components that are likely associated with a high activity period visible in the $\gamma$-ray and radio light curves. The kinematic analysis of the VLBA observations leads to a maximum apparent jet speed of $\beta_{app}=19\pm10$ and an upper limit on the viewing angle of $\phi$ &lt; 4 deg. We determine the power law indices that are characterizing the jet geometry, brightness temperature distribution, and core shift to be $l=0.974\pm0.098$, $s=-3.31\pm0.31$, and $k_r=1.09\pm0.17$, which are in agreement with a conical jet in equipartition. A cross-correlation analysis shows that the radio light curves follow the $\gamma$-ray light curve. We pinpoint the location of the $\gamma$-ray emitting region with respect to the jet base to the range of $2.6\,\mathrm{pc}\leq d_\gamma\leq20\,\mathrm{pc}$. Our derived observational limits places the location of $\gamma$-ray production in 4C+01.28 beyond the expected extent of the broad-line region (BLR) and therefore challenges blazar-emission models that rely on inverse Compton up-scattering of seed photons from the BLR.</description>

      <title>Dedicated-frequency analysis of gravitational-wave bursts from core-collapse supernovae with minimal assumptions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01614</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01614v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Gravitational-wave (GW) emissions from core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) provide insights into the internal processes leading up to their explosions. Theory predicts that CCSN explosions are driven by hydrodynamical instabilities like the standing accretion shock instability (SASI) or neutrino-driven convection, and simulations show that these mechanisms emit GWs at low frequencies ($\lesssim 0.25 \,{\rm kHz}$). Thus the detection of low-frequency GWs, or lack thereof, is useful for constraining explosion mechanisms in CCSNe. This paper introduces the dedicated-frequency framework, which is designed to follow-up GW burst detections using bandpass analyses. The primary aim is to study whether low-frequency (LF) follow-up analyses, limited to $\leq 256 \,{\rm Hz}$, constrain CCSN explosion models in practical observing scenarios. The analysis dataset comprises waveforms from five CCSN models with different strengths of low-frequency GW emissions induced by SASI and/or neutrino-driven convection, injected into the Advanced LIGO data from the Third Observing Run (O3). Eligible candidates for the LF follow-up must satisfy a benchmark detection significance and are identified using the coherent WaveBurst (cWB) algorithm. The LF follow-up analyses are performed using the BayesWave algorithm. Both cWB and BayesWave make minimal assumptions about the signal's morphology. The results suggest that the successful detection of a CCSN in the LF follow-up analysis constrains its explosion mechanism. The dedicated-frequency framework also has other applications. As a demonstration, the loudest trigger from the SN 2019fcn supernova search is followed-up using a high-frequency (HF) analysis, limited to $\geq 256 \,{\rm Hz}$. The trigger has negligible power below $256 \, {\rm Hz}$, and the HF analysis successfully enhances its detection significance.</description>

      <title>Exploring GRB Afterglows in the TeV Era: New Diagnostics of Particle Acceleration</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01739</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01739v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The TeV gamma-ray band is essential for probing the most extreme particle acceleration processes in the Universe. The recent detections of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) at these energies offer an incredible opportunity to investigate the origins of such transient events in an unprecedented way. In this presentation, we analyze the afterglows of these GRBs by modeling their synchrotron and inverse Compton emission within an optimized relativistic fireball framework. By comparing observational data with theoretical predictions, we constrain key model parameters and track their temporal evolution. The comparison of different TeV-detected GRBs reveals an intriguing variety among them, potentially reflecting differences in the particle acceleration processes that have to be very fast and able to accelerate to large energies. We discuss how late-time afterglow observations of X-ray and GeV-TeV emissions are crucial for providing diagnostics into the physics of GRBs. At this scope, we also present the most updated results of the AGILE telescope, which support our interpretation. Finally, we highlight theoretical predictions for future TeV observations and their implications for understanding these extreme cosmic explosions.</description>

      <title>Instabilities at recollimation shocks in MHD jets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01742</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01742v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: AGN jet structure and stability remain uncertain; recollimation shocks are linked to morphology and variability, but the role of downstream instabilities is still unclear. We aim to investigate how jet magnetization and other physical parameters influence the development of instabilities beyond the first recollimation shock. In particular, we focus on identifying the conditions under which the centrifugal instability (CFI) is effective. We perform high-resolution 2D and 3D simulations using the relativistic magnetohydrodynamics code PLUTO. The jets are initialized with a conical geometry and propagate into an ambient medium, and we follow by axisymmetric simulations how they evolve towards a steady-state. In 2D we explore a range of magnetizations (from 0 to 1), pressure contrasts, and inertia ratios to characterize the formation and evolution of recollimation shocks. The results are further evaluated using linear stability analysis to assess the growth and suppression of CFI. Finally, we perform 3D simulations of unstable and stable jets. We discuss how the different parameters of the axisymmetric steady solutions influence the location and strength of recollimation. We find that, even in moderately magnetized jets, $\sigma$=0.1, the CFI can still develop under suitable local conditions and disrupt the jet structure. This instability is governed by the jet radius, curvature, Lorentz factor, and magnetization, and is not always predictable from injection conditions. While magnetization can delay or locally suppress instability growth, it does not guarantee long-term jet stability. Our 3D results highlight the limitations of 2D models in capturing non-axisymmetric and nonlinear effects, and underline the complex interplay between magnetic confinement and destabilizing mechanisms. These findings have implications for interpreting variability, and polarization structure in AGN jets.</description>

      <title>Identifying tidal disruption events among radio transient galaxies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01773</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01773v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the optical and infrared properties of a sample of 24 radio transient sources discovered in the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS). Previous studies of their radio emission showed that these sources resemble young gigahertz-peaked spectrum (GPS) radio sources, but are less powerful and characterized by low-power jets. The bursts of radio activity in most cases are likely due to intrinsic changes in the accretion processes. However, for a few sources in this sample, we cannot rule out the possibility that their radio variability results from a tidal disruption event (TDE). In this work, we extend our analysis to the optical and infrared regimes, confirming that our sample of radio transients is not homogeneous in terms of their optical and infrared properties either. The host galaxies of most of these sources are massive ellipticals with emission dominated by active galactic nuclei (AGN). They host supermassive black holes (SMBHs) with masses typical of radio-loud AGNs ($\rm &gt;10^7\,M_{\odot}$), but exhibit very low accretion activity. In contrast, the sources for which a TDE origin is suspected are either pure star-forming galaxies or show significant ongoing star formation, similar to radio-selected optically-detected TDEs. Additionally, two of them exhibit infrared flares characteristic of TDEs, while the remaining sources do not display significant variability outside the radio regime. Moreover, the evolution of their radio brightness in the W3/radio diagnostic diagram, which we employ in our analysis, also sets our TDE candidates apart from the rest of the sample and resembles the radio variability seen in optically discovered TDEs with radio emission. Finally, based on our findings, we hypothesize that the mid-IR/radio relation can serve as a tool to distinguish between radio transients caused by TDEs and those originating from intrinsic AGN variability.</description>

      <title>Constraining the Neutron-Star Equation of State via Short Gamma-Ray Burst X-ray Afterglows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent observations from NICER in X-rays and LIGO/Virgo in gravitational waves have provided critical constraints on the mass, radius, and tidal deformability of neutron stars, imposing stringent limits on the equation of state (EOS) and the behavior of ultra-dense matter. However, several key parameters influencing the EOS, such as the maximum mass of neutron stars, spin-down rates, and the potential role of exotic matter in their cores, remain subject of ongoing debate. Here we present a new approach to constraining the EOS by analyzing the X-ray afterglows of some short gamma-ray bursts, focusing on "the internal plateau" phase and its abrupt decay, which reflect the spin-down and possible collapse of a supra-massive neutron star into a black hole. By linking critical neutron star masses with black hole formation criteria and the observational data from Swift's BAT and XRT instruments with compact object models, we explore three representative EOSs that range from "soft" to "stiff". Our result supports a maximum mass for neutron stars of approximately 2.39 solar masses at the threshold of black hole formation. This conclusion holds under assumptions of magnetar-powered X-ray plateaus, constant radiative efficiency, isotropic emission, and full Kerr black hole energy extraction; deviations could influence the inferred results. Our results demonstrate the critical role of neutron star/black hole physics in probing dense nuclear matter and provide a novel framework for exploring extreme astrophysical environments.</description>

Abstract: Very Faint X-ray Transients (VFXTs) are a class of X-ray binary systems that exhibit occasional outbursts with peak X-ray luminosities (L_X&lt; 1e36 erg s^-1) much lower than typical X-ray transients. On 22nd February 2024, during its daily Galactic center monitoring, Swift-XRT detected a VFXT, 7 arcmin from Sgr A* dubbing it Swift J174610--290018. We aim to characterize the outburst that occurred in 2024, and a second, distinct outburst in 2025, to understand the nature and accretion flow properties of this new VFXT. Swift-XRT light curves are used to constrain the duration of the two events. We carried out X-ray spectral analysis exploiting XMM and NuSTAR data. We used Chandra and XMM observations of the last 25 years to constrain the quiescent luminosity of the source. During the 2024 outburst, which lasted about 50 days, the source reached a luminosity in the 2-10 keV band of L_X = 1.2e35 erg s^-1 (assuming it is located at the Galactic center). The 2025 outburst is shorter (about 5 days), and reached L_X = 9e34 erg s^-1. The spectral features of the source include an excess at 6.5-7 keV, which can be associated either with a single reflection line or with the ionized Fe XXV and XXVI lines. The same source was identified in both the XMM and Chandra catalogs of point sources (known as 4XMM J174610.7--290020). During previous detections, the source displayed luminosity levels ranging from L_X= 2e32 to L_X = 3e34 erg s^-1 between 2000 and 2010. Moreover, it exhibited a potential type I X-ray burst in 2004. The analysis of the outbursts and the potential type I burst strongly suggests the neutron star low mass X-ray binary (NS-LMXB) nature of the VFXT. The source can be described by an accretion disk corona (as has been recently proposed by the XRISM/Xtend analysis). This scenario explains the overall low luminosity of this transient and the peculiar iron lines in the spectrum.</description>

      <title>The Progenitor of the S147 Supernova Remnant</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.02132v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The supernova remnant (SNR) S147 contains the pulsar PSR J0538+2817 and a likely unbound binary companion, HD 37424. It is the only good Galactic candidate for a binary unbound by a core-collapse supernova (SN). Using Gaia DR3 parallaxes and photometry, we select the stars local to SNR S147 in a cylinder with a projected radius of $100$ pc and a parallax range of $0.614 &lt; \varpi &lt; 0.787$ mas (a length of $\simeq 360$ pc). We individually model the most luminous of these stars. The two most luminous single stars are the unbound binary companion, HD 37424, and HD 37367, with estimated masses of $(13.51\pm0.05) M_{\odot}$ and $(14.30\pm0.09) M_{\odot}$, respectively. The two most luminous binary systems are the spectroscopic binary HD 37366 and the eclipsing binary ET Tau that have primary masses of $(20.9\pm0.12) M_{\odot}$ and $(16.7\pm0.09) M_{\odot}$, respectively. We model the Gaia color-magnitude diagram (CMD) of this local stellar population using both single stars and a model consisting of noninteracting binaries using Solar metallicity PARSEC isochrones. For both models, the estimated age distributions of the $439$ $M_{G} &lt; 0$ mag stars favor a high mass progenitor of $21.5M_{\odot}-41.1M_{\odot}$ for the SN.</description>

      <title>Jittering jets in stripped-envelope core-collapse supernovae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02203</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02203v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Using the one-dimensional stellar evolution code MESA, we find that all our models in the initial mass range of 12-40 Mo, regardless of whether they have hydrogen-rich, hydrogen-stripped, or helium+hydrogen-stripped envelopes, have at least one significant strong convective zone in the inner core, which can facilitate the jittering-jets explosion mechanism (JJEM). We focus on stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors that earlier studies of the JJEM did not study, and examine the angular momentum parameter j=rVconv, where r is the radius of the layer and Vconv is the convective velocity according to the mixing length theory. In all models, there is at least one prominent convective zone with j&gt;2e15 cm^2/s inside the mass coordinate that is the maximum baryonic mass of a neutron star (NS), m=2.65 Mo. According to the JJEM, convection in these zones seeds instabilities above the newly born NS, leading to the formation of intermittent accretion disks that launch pairs of jittering jets, which in turn explode the star. Our finding is encouraging for the JJEM, although it does not show that the intermittent accretion disks indeed form. We strengthen the claim that, according to the JJEM, there are no failed CCSNe and that all massive stars explode. In demonstrating the robust convection in the inner core of stripped-envelope CCSN progenitors, we add to the establishment of the JJEM as the primary explosion mechanism of CCSNe.</description>

      <title>Noisy Timing Behavior is a Feature of Central Compact Object Pulsars</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02233</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02233v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a timing study of the three known central compact object (CCO) pulsars, isolated cooling neutron stars in supernova remnants, using Chandra, XMM-Newton and NICER observations spanning two decades. Relative to canonical young pulsars, CCOs are spinning down at a very slow rate $|\dot f| &lt;10^{-15}$ s$^{-2}$, implying a surface dipole magnetic field strength $B_s &lt; 10^{11}$ G that is too weak to account for their X-ray emitting hot spots. Two CCO pulsars with sufficiently long monitoring, 1E 1207.4$-$5209 and PSR J0821$-$4300, are seen to deviate from steady spin-down; their timing residuals can be modeled by one or more glitches in $f$ and $\dot f$, or alternatively by extreme timing noise. For the third CCO pulsar, PSR J1852+0400, the sparse temporal coverage was insufficient to detect such effects. Glitch activity and timing noise in large samples of rotation-powered pulsars correlate best with $\dot f$, while the timing irregularities of the first two CCOs are extreme compared to pulsars of the same $\dot f$. Nevertheless, timing activity in CCOs may arise from properties that they share with other young but more energetic pulsars: high internal temperature, strong buried magnetic field and superfluid behavior. Alternatively, continuing low-level accretion of supernova debris is not ruled out as a source of timing noise in CCOs.</description>

      <title>Relativistic Jets and Winds in Radio-Identified Supermassive Black Hole Binary Candidates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02301</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02301v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Supermassive black hole binary systems (SMBHBs) are thought to emit the recently discovered nHz gravitational wave background; however, not a single individual nHz source has been confirmed to date. Long-term radio-monitoring at the Owens Valley Radio Observatory has revealed two potential SMBHB candidates: blazars PKS 2131-021 and PKS J0805-0111. These sources show periodic flux density variations across the electromagnetic spectrum, signaling the presence of a good clock. To explain the emission, we propose a generalizable jet model, where a mildly relativistic wind creates an outward-moving helical channel, along which the ultra-relativistic jet propagates. The observed flux variation from the jet is mostly due to aberration. The emission at lower frequency arises at larger radius and its variation is consequently delayed, as observed. Our model reproduces the main observable features of both sources and can be applied to other sources as they are discovered. We make predictions for radio polarization, direct imaging, and emission line variation, which can be tested with forthcoming observations. Our results motivate future numerical simulations of jetted SMBHB systems and have implications for the fueling, structure, and evolution of blazar jets.</description>

      <title>Expectations for the first supermassive black-hole binary resolved by PTAs I: Model efficacy</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01317</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01317v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: One of the most promising targets for Pulsar Timing Arrays (PTAs) is identifying an individual supermassive black hole binary (SMBHB) out of the population of binaries theorized to produce a gravitational wave background (GWB). In this work, we emulate an evolving PTA dataset, complete with an increasing number of pulsars and timing baseline, into which we inject a single binary on top of a Gaussian GWB signal. We vary the binary's source parameters, including sky position and frequency, and create an ensemble of simulated datasets with which we assess current Bayesian binary search techniques. We apply two waveform-based template models and a frequency-resolved anisotropy search to these simulations to understand how they compare in their detection and characterization abilities. We find that a template-based search including the full gravitational-wave signal structure (i.e., both Earth and pulsar effects of an incident GW) returns the highest Bayes Factors (BF), exceeding our estimator's capabilities by (S/N)~9-19, and has the most robust parameter estimation. Our anisotropy model attains a realization-median BF&gt;10 at 7&lt;(S/N)&lt;15. Interestingly, despite being a deterministic model, the Earth-term template struggles to detect and characterize low-frequency binaries (5 nHz). These binaries require higher (S/N)~16-19 to reach the same BF threshold. This is likely due to neglected confusion effects between the pulsar and Earth terms. By contrast, the frequency-resolved anisotropy model shows promise for parameter estimation despite treating a binary's GW signal as excess directional GW power without phase modeling. Sky location and frequency parameter constraints returned by the anisotropy model are only surpassed by the Earth term template model at (S/N)~12-13. Milestones for a first detection using the full-signal GW model are included in a companion paper (Petrov et al. 2025).</description>

      <title>Dark Drag Around Sagittarius A*</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01320v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We analyze the effect of Dark Matter (DM) - Standard Model (SM) non-gravitational interactions on the orbital dynamics of celestial bodies near the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*, where the DM density is generically expected to be high. We outline the conditions under which a DM-SM scattering channel gives rise to a drag force on objects in this region, and show that for sufficiently large cross-sections, this effect can lead to observable orbital decay on timescales as short as a single orbital period. We identify the types of objects most strongly affected by this dark drag and place constraints on specific dark matter distributions and interaction strengths, assuming both elastic and inelastic scattering. For inelastic DM, we find sensitivity to mass splittings that reach the MeV scale. We also demonstrate that a DM-induced drag force could potentially contribute to the observed depletion of red giant branch stars in the innermost region of the Milky Way.</description>

      <title>The Spatially Resolved Hot Gas Properties of NGC 1266's AGN-Driven Outflow</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01321</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01321v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Galactic winds play a critical role in galaxy evolution, yet their structure and driving mechanisms remain poorly understood, especially in low-luminosity AGN (LLAGN) systems. NGC 1266 hosts one such LLAGN, embedded in a massive molecular gas reservoir that is not forming stars, likely due to AGN feedback. We analyze deep archival \textit{Chandra} data to constrain the properties of its hot gas and compare them to other wind systems. We find temperatures of $0.24$--$1.85$ keV and notably high electron densities of $0.33$--$4.2$ cm$^{-3}$, suggesting significant mass loading, further supported by charge exchange emission in the southern lobe, one of the few AGN systems where it has been detected. We measure pressures and thermal energies of $10^6$--$10^8$~K cm$^{-3}$ and $10^{54}$--$10^{56}$ erg, exceeding the minimum energy needed for the radio jet to power the outflow and implying the hot phase comprises a large fraction of the energy budget. Archival MUSE data reveal a cavity-like feature in the southern outflow, potentially associated with the far side of the outflow cone. At the maximum outflow extent, the warm and hot phases appear to be in pressure equilibrium. Coupled with short cooling timescales of $\sim$1 Myr, comparable to the advection time, this suggests the outflow is undergoing radiative cooling and may have stalled. Finally, we compare NGC 1266 to other local AGN and starburst galaxies, finding NGC 1266 to be the densest wind in the sample.</description>

      <title>Feeding frenzy in the mighty black holes: what we could learn from them?</title>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01486v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Eddington ratio is a paramount parameter governing the accretion history and life cycles of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGNs). This short review presents a multi-faceted view of the importance of the Eddington ratio spanning varied AGN studies. We find that the Eddington ratio is crucial for standardizing the Radius-Luminosity (R-L) relation - a necessary step for employing quasars (QSOs) as standardizable cosmological probes to help clarify the standing of the Hubble tension. In this data-driven era, we consolidated disparate aspects by developing novel relations borne out of large datasets, such as the robust, nearly universal anti-correlation between fractional variability and Eddington ratio derived from Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) data, which is vital for interpreting forthcoming high-cadence surveys like Rubin Observatory's LSST. Addressing the conundrum where JWST results suggest an overabundance of massive high-redshift black holes, we demonstrate that local AGNs offer clarification: Changing-Look AGNs (CLAGNs), driven by rapid Eddington ratio shifts, cluster in the low-accretion regime, a rate independently confirmed by our integral field spectroscopy and photoionization modeling of a well-known Seyfert 2 galaxy, rich in high-ionization, forbidden, coronal lines. Conversely, for the high-redshift, high-luminosity population where traditional reverberation mapping (RM) is highly impractical, photometric reverberation mapping (PRM) offers a rapid alternative to constrain accretion disk sizes, enabling efficient estimates of black hole masses and Eddington ratios. Finally, we developed tailored semi-empirical spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for extremely high-accretion quasars, successfully validating their characteristic extreme physical conditions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2510.01512v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present the first set of fully-nonlinear, necessary and sufficient conditions guaranteeing causal evolution of the initial data for the Israel-Stewart hydrodynamic equations with shear and bulk viscosity coupled to a nonzero baryon current. These constraints not only provide nonlinear causality: they also (a) guarantee the existence of a locally well-posed evolution of the initial data (they enforce strong hyperbolicity) when excluding the endpoints of the bounds, (b) arise from purely algebraic constraints that make no underlying symmetry assumptions on the degrees of freedom and (c) propagate the relevant symmetries of the degrees of freedom over the entire evolution of the problem. Our work enforces a mathematically rigorous foundation for future studies of viscous relativistic hydrodynamics with baryon-rich matter including neutron star mergers and heavy-ion collisions.</description>

      <title>Suppression of inverse magnetic energy transfer in collisionless marginally magnetized plasmas</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01573</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01573v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigate the inverse cascade of magnetic energy in decaying, collisionless plasmas with moderate to high-$\beta$ values via first-principles numerical simulations and analytical theory. We find that pressure-anisotropy-driven instabilities, in particular the firehose instability, suppress reconnection-driven coalescence of magnetic structures (i.e., inverse transfer) by nullifying magnetic tension. This suppression leaves such structures elongated and confined to scales comparable to the Larmor radius of the particles. The presence of a magnetic guide field of sufficient strength, or a greater scale separation between the initial size of the magnetic structures and the Larmor radius, restores the system's ability to inverse transfer magnetic energy. These results reveal that inverse energy transfer in collisionless plasmas is not guaranteed, but instead sensitively depends on magnetization. In the astrophysical context, this identifies a kinetic mechanism by which Weibel-generated seed fields may fail to merge consistently, potentially limiting their role in cosmic magnetogenesis.</description>

      <title>Orbital Period Changes in Recurrent Nova T Corona Borealis Prove That It Is Not a Type Ia Supernovae Progenitor</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01587</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.01587v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: T Corona Borealis (T CrB) is a recurrent nova and a symbiotic star that is commonly highlighted as the best case for being a progenitor of a Type Ia supernova (SNIa) within the framework of single-degenerate models. This exemplar can be tested by measuring whether the white dwarf (WD) mass ($M_{\rm WD}$) is increasing over each eruption cycle. This is a balance between the mass ejected during each nova event ($M_{\rm ejecta}$) and the mass accreted onto the WD between the nova events ($M_{\rm accreted}$). I have used all 206 radial velocities from 1946--2024 to measure the orbital period just after the 1946 eruption to be $P_{\rm post}$=227.6043 days, while the steady orbital period change ($\dot{P}$) is ($-$3.1$\pm$1.6)$\times$10$^{-6}$. I have used my full 213,730 magnitude $B$ and $V$ light curve from 1842--2025 to measure the times of maximum brightness in the ellipsoidal modulations to construct the $O-C$ from 1866--1946. I fit the broken parabola shape, to find the orbital period immediately before the 1946 eruption to be $P_{\rm pre}$=227.4586 days. The orbital period changed by $\Delta P$=$+$0.146$\pm$0.019 days. With Kepler's Law, conservation of angular momentum, and the well-measured binary properties, the ejecta mass in 1946 is 0.00074$\pm$0.00009 M$_{\odot}$. $M_{\rm accreted}$ is reliably measured to be 1.38$\times$10$^{-6}$ M$_{\odot}$ from the accretion luminosity. $M_{\rm ejecta}$ is larger than $M_{\rm accreted}$ by 540$\times$, so $M_{\rm WD}$ is {\it decreasing} every eruption cycle. T CrB can never become a SNIa.</description>

Abstract: Recurrent nova U Scorpii (U Sco) is one of the prototypes for a Type Ia supernova progenitor. The logic is that the white dwarf is near the Chandrasekhar mass and gas is accumulating onto its surface at a near-maximal accretion rate, so it will soon increase its mass to the supernova trigger. But the white dwarf loses mass every nova eruption, so the issue is balancing the mass ejected ($M_{\rm ejecta}$) against the mass accreted between eruptions ($M_{\rm accreted}$). Measuring $M_{\rm accreted}$ can be done in several ways to useable accuracy. But the old methods for measuring $M_{\rm ejecta}$ (involving the flux in hydrogen emission lines) are all with real error bars of 2--3 orders of magnitude. The only solution is to measure the change of the orbital period across the nova eruption ($\Delta P$). But this solution requires a vast photometric program of eclipse timings stretching decades. For U Sco, a program started in 1989, now reaches its culmination with measures of $\Delta P$ for the eruptions of 1999, 2010, 2016, and 2022. This paper reports on 52 new eclipse times (for a total of 218 eclipses 1945--2025), plus a new theory result allowing for the confident calculation of $M_{\rm ejecta}$ from $\Delta P$. The four eruptions ejected a total of (103$\pm$14)$\times$$10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$, while the white dwarf accreted 4$\times$$10^{-6}$ $M_{\odot}$ over the four previous eruption cycles. With M$_{\rm ejecta}$=26$\times$M$_{\rm accreted}$, the U Sco white dwarf is losing large masses each eruption cycle, so U Sco can never produce a Type Ia supernova.</description>

      <title>On the uncertainty in predicting the stochastic gravitational wave background from compact binary coalescences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02163</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.02163v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The stochastic gravitational-wave background from compact binary coalescences is expected to be the first detectable stochastic signal via cross-correlation searches with terrestrial detectors. It encodes the cumulative merger history of stellar-mass binaries across cosmic time, offering a unique probe of the high-redshift Universe. However, predicting the background spectrum is challenging due to numerous modeling choices, each with distinct uncertainties. In this work, we present a comprehensive forecast of the astrophysical gravitational-wave background from binary black holes, binary neutron stars, and neutron star-black hole systems. We systematically assess the impact of uncertainties in population properties, waveform features, and the modeling of the merger rate evolution. By combining all uncertainties, we derive credible bands for the background spectrum, spanning approximately an order of magnitude in the fractional energy density. These results provide thorough predictions to facilitate the interpretation of current upper limits and future detections.</description>

      <title>Looking for the {\gamma}-Ray Cascades of the KM3-230213A Neutrino Source</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16606</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.16606v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The extreme energy of the KM3-230213A event could transform our understanding of the most energetic sources in the Universe. However, it also reveals an inconsistency between the KM3NeT detection and strong IceCube constraints on the ultra-high energy neutrino flux. The most congruous explanation for the KM3NeT and IceCube data requires KM3-230213A to be produced by a (potentially transient) source fortuitously located in a region where the KM3NeT acceptance is maximized. In hadronic models of ultra-high-energy neutrino production, such a source would also produce a bright {\gamma}-ray signal, which would cascade to GeV--TeV energies due to interactions with extragalactic background light. We utilize the {\gamma}-Cascade package to model the spectrum, spatial extension, and time-delay of such a source, and scan a region surrounding the KM3NeT event to search for a consistent {\gamma}-ray signal. We find no convincing evidence for a comparable \textit{Fermi}-LAT source and place constraints on a combination of the source redshift and the intergalactic magnetic field strength between the source and Earth.</description>

      <title>What Determines the Maximum Mass of AGN-assisted Black Hole Mergers?</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.19570v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The origin of merging binary black holes detected through gravitational waves remains a fundamental question in astrophysics. While stellar evolution imposes an upper mass limit of about 50 solar mass for black holes, some observed mergers--most notably GW190521--involve significantly more massive components, suggesting alternative formation channels. Here we investigate the maximum masses attainable by black hole mergers within active galactic nucleus (AGN) disks. Using a comprehensive semi-analytic model incorporating 27 binary and environmental parameters, we explore the role of AGN disk conditions in shaping the upper end of the black hole mass spectrum. We find that AGN disk lifetime is the dominant factor, with high-mass mergers (&gt;200 solar mass) only possible if disks persist for ~40 Myr. The joint electromagnetic observation of an AGN-assisted merger could therefore lead to a direct measurement of the age of an AGN disk.</description>

      <title>Gamma/hadron discriminant variables in application to high-energy cosmic-ray air showers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04546</link>
      <description>arXiv:2507.04546v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Identification of primary cosmic rays on an event-by-event basis is a much-desired capability of cosmic-ray observatories. Several cosmic-ray air-shower experiments use so-called photon tags for gamma hadron primary particle discrimination. These photon tag variables are derived from the total signals measured by an array of detectors and are correlated with the total number of muons in the air shower. In this work, variables based on time distribution of signals in detectors (trace-based discriminant variables) are studied and compared to total-signal-based variables. This study relies on simulated high-energy cosmic-ray air showers with energies around 10^17.5eV. Since the variables discussed are derived from total signals and their time traces, which can be directly measured in real data, they are suitable for use as discriminant variables in the real ground-based cosmic ray experiments.</description>

      <title>Return of the Clocked Burster: Exceptionally Short Recurrence Time in GS 1826-238</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18837</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18837v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report the discovery of an exceptionally short burst recurrence time in the well-known clocked burster GS 1826$-$238, observed with the CubeSat X-ray observatory NinjaSat. In 2025 May, GS 1826$-$238 underwent a soft-to-hard state transition for the first time in 10 years. On June 23, NinjaSat began monitoring GS 1826$-$238 in the hard state and continued until it returned to a steady soft state. During this period, we detected 19 X-ray bursts: 14 during the hard state, 4 in the transitional state, and 1 in the soft state. In the hard state, we identified a new clocked bursting epoch, during which the burst recurrence time remained highly stable and unprecedentedly short among the clocked bursting phases of GS 1826$-$238, with $t_{\rm rec} = 1.603 \pm 0.040$ hr ($1\sigma$ error). Previous observations showed that the burst recurrence time in GS 1826$-$238 decreased with increasing mass accretion rate, reached its minimum value of $t_{\rm rec} \sim 3$ hr, and then increased again. The observed 1.6 hr recurrence time is therefore exceptionally short, indicating anomalous ignition conditions. We propose that this phenomenon reflects fuel accumulation over a smaller fraction of the neutron star surface, resulting in a higher local accretion rate compared to earlier epochs. This scenario naturally accounts for the exceptionally short recurrence time, together with the observed reductions during bursts in blackbody normalization (proportional to the emitting area) and fluence. We also discuss possible contributions from residual heat in the neutron star crust or the presence of an additional soft spectral component.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2509.26418v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Dense neutrino systems, which display collectivity mediated by the weak interaction, have deep parallels with mean-field kinetic systems governed by other fundamental forces. We identify analogues in fast flavor conversion (FFC) of some time-honored nonlinear phenomena in plasmas and self-gravitating systems. We focus in particular on nonlinear Landau damping and collisionless equilibria, which are likely important pieces of the unsolved puzzle of neutrino oscillations in core-collapse supernovae and neutron star mergers. Our analysis additionally reveals the previously unexplored phenomenon of flavor-wave synchronization.</description>

      <title>Mapping the evolution of supernova-neutrino-boosted dark matter within the Milky Way</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15151</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.15151v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Supernova-neutrino-boosted dark matter (SN$\nu$ BDM) has emerged as a promising portal for probing sub-GeV dark matter. In this work, we investigate the behavior of BDM signatures originating from core-collapse supernovae within the Milky Way (MW) over the past one hundred thousand years, examining both their temporal evolution and present-day spatial distributions. We show that while the MW BDM signature is approximately diffuse in the nonrelativistic regime, it exhibits significant temporal variation and spatial localization when the BDM is relativistic. Importantly, we compare these local MW signatures with the previously proposed diffuse SN$\nu$ BDM (DBDM), which arises from the accumulated flux of all past supernovae in the Universe [Y.-H. Lin and M.-R. Wu, Phys. Rev. Lett. 133, 111004 (2024)]. In the nonrelativistic limit, DBDM consistently dominates over the local diffuse MW BDM signature. Only when the MW BDM becomes ultrarelativistic and transitions into a transient, highly-localized signal can it potentially surpass the DBDM background. This work thus reinforces the importance of DBDM for SN$\nu$ BDM searches until the next galactic SN offers new opportunities.</description>

      <title>Accretion of a Vlasov gas by a Kerr black hole</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04783</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.04783v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We investigate the accretion of a collisionless, relativistic kinetic gas by a rotating Kerr black hole, assuming that at infinity the state of the gas is described by a distribution function depending only on the energy of the particles. Neglecting the self-gravity of the gas, we show that relevant physical observables, including the particle current density and the accretion rates associated with the mass, the energy, and the angular momentum, can be expressed in the form of closed integrals that can be evaluated numerically or approximated analytically in the slow-rotation limit. The accretion rates are computed in this manner for both monoenergetic particles and the Maxwell-J\"uttner distribution and compared with the corresponding results in the non-rotating case. We show that the angular momentum accretion rate decreases the absolute value of the black hole spin parameter. It is also found that the rotation of the black hole has a small but non-vanishing effect on the mass and the energy accretion rates, which is remarkably well described by an analytic calculation in the slow-rotation approximation to quadratic order in the rotation parameter. The effects of rotation on the morphology of the accretion flow are also analyzed.</description>

      <title>Energy extraction from the accelerating Kerr black hole via magnetic reconnection in the plunging region and circular orbit region</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11934</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11934v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Based on the magnetic reconnection mechanism, this study investigates how to extract energy effectively from an accelerating Kerr black hole in the plunging region and circular orbit region. After introducing the properties of accelerating black holes, including the event horizon, ergosphere, circular orbits, and innermost stable circular orbit, we investigate the magnetic reconnection process in the plunging region. Specifically, we analyze variations of the azimuthal angle with respect to the acceleration, examine changes in energy per enthalpy of decelerated plasma, and plot energy extraction efficiency along with permissible energy extraction regions. Results show that in the plunging region, at larger radii of reconnection locations, the accelerating black hole exhibits higher energy extraction efficiency than a Kerr black hole. Away from extremality, the acceleration parameter impedes energy extraction, while near extremality, it enhances extraction. We also study energy extraction in circular orbit region by plotting energy extraction efficiency within permissible regions. We find that the permissible energy extraction area is reduced and the efficiency exceeds that of Kerr black holes due to the existence of acceleration parameter. Larger acceleration parameters yield more effective energy extraction regardless of extremality, which is different from that in the plunging region. Additionally, energy extraction efficiency in the plunging region surpasses that in the circular orbit region, aligning with prior conclusions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2508.20189v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We derive an exact solution representing a Bondi-type stationary accretion of a kinetic (Vlasov) gas onto the Kerr black hole. The solution is exact in the sense that relevant physical quantities, such as the particle current density or the accretion rates, are expressed as explicit integrals, which can be evaluated numerically. We provide an analytic approximation which allows us to obtain simple formulas for the mass, energy, and angular momentum accretion rates. These formulas are used to derive characteristic time scales of the black hole mass growth and the associated spin-down in two different scenarios: assuming that the ambient energy density is either constant or decreases on a cosmological scale.</description>

      <title>Chase Orbits, not Time: A Scalable Paradigm for Long-Duration Eccentric Gravitational-Wave Surrogates</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00116</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.00116v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Surrogate modeling of eccentric binary black hole waveforms has remained challenging. The complicated morphology of these waveforms due to the eccentric orbital timescale variations makes it difficult to construct accurate and efficient surrogate models, especially for waveforms long enough to cover the sensitivity band of the current ground-based gravitational wave detectors. We present a novel and scalable surrogate building technique which makes surrogate modeling of long-duration eccentric binary black hole waveforms both feasible and highly efficient. The technique aims to simplify the harmonic content of the intermediate eccentric surrogate data pieces by modeling them in terms of an angular orbital element called the mean anomaly, instead of time. We show that this novel parameterization yields an order of magnitude fewer surrogate basis functions than using the contemporary parameterization in terms of time. We show that variations in surrogate data-pieces across parameter space become much more regular when expressed in terms of the instantaneous waveform eccentricity and mean anomaly, greatly easing their parameter-space fitting. The methods presented in this work make it feasible to build long-duration eccentric surrogates for the current as well as future third-generation gravitational wave detectors.</description>
