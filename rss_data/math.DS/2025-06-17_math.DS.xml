      <title>Interacting Geodesics on Discrete Manifolds</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12054</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12054v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We define an evolution of multiple particles on a discrete manifold $G$. Each particle alone moves on geodesics and particles can interact if they are on the same facet. They move deterministically and reversibly on the frame bundle $P$ of the abstract simplicial complex $G$. Particles are signed and each is represented by a totally ordered maximal simplex $p \in P$ in $G$. The motion of divisors on $P$ also defines a time dependent reversible deformation of space.</description>

      <title>SINDybrid: automatic generation of hybrid models for dynamic systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12498</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12498v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Hybrid modelling enhances the accuracy and predictive capability of dynamic models by integrating first principles with data-driven methods, effectively mitigating epistemic uncertainties inherent in mechanistic approaches. However, hybrid model construction remains complex, typically requiring expert knowledge to identify model epistemic uncertainty and select suitable machine-learning components to capture it. This complexity limits broader adoption in research and industry. We introduce SINDybrid, an automated algorithm designed to streamline hybrid model development for dynamic systems. SINDybrid employs a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach to systematically identify epistemic uncertainty sources and compensate them using optimally selected data-driven components. For broader accessibility and reproducibility, we provide SINDybrid as an open-source Python library. SINDybrid was validated through three case studies: a catalytic reaction system, a continuous fermentation process, and a Lotka-Volterra oscillator, each showcasing different epistemic uncertainties. The robustness of the algorithm is tested against varying experimental conditions, including measurement noise (up to 20%), limited training batches (minimum 2), and sparse temporal sampling (minimum 5 samples per experiment). Results demonstrate a consistent ability of the SINDybrid approach to produce accurate hybrid models, achieving R^2 scores above 0.85 on validation data. Additionally, the algorithm effectively identifies uncertainty locations within system dynamics under challenging scenarios. This work highlights SINDybrid potential as a versatile, automated solution for hybrid modelling, significantly reducing the barriers to adopting hybrid methods in complex dynamic systems across scientific research and industrial applications.</description>

      <title>On preservation of normality and determinism under arithmetic operations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12929</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12929v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we develop a general ergodic approach which reveals the underpinnings of the effect of arithmetic operations involving normal and deterministic numbers. This allows us to recast in new light and amplify the result of Rauzy, which states that a number $y$ is deterministic if and only if $x+y$ is normal for every normal number $x$. Our approach is based on the notions of lower and upper entropy of a point in a topological dynamical system. The ergodic approach to Rauzy theorem naturally leads to the study of various aspects of normality and determinism in the general framework of dynamics of endomorphisms of compact metric groups. In particular, we generalize Rauzy theorem to ergodic toral endomorphisms. Also, we show that the phenomena described by Rauzy do not occur when one replaces the base $2$ normality associated with the $(\frac12,\frac12)$-Bernoulli measure by the variant of normality associated with a $(p,1-p)$-Bernoulli measure, where $p\neq\frac12$. Finally, we present some rather nontrivial examples which show that Rauzy-type results are not valid when addition is replaced by multiplication.</description>

      <title>Distribution of polynomial orbits in Toeplitz systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12942</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12942v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We examine the convergence of ergodic averages along polynomials in Toeplitz systems and prove that it is possible for averages along one polynomial to converge, and along another to diverge. We also study density of the polynomial orbits in Toeplitz systems -- we show that it implies equidistribution of the polynomial orbits in the class of regular Toeplitz systems, but not in the class of strictly ergodic ones.</description>

      <title>Quenched invariance principle with a rate for random dynamical systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the quenched invariance principle for random Young towers driven by an ergodic system. In particular, we obtain the Wassertein convergence rate in the quenched invariance principle. As a key ingredient, we derive a new martingale-coboundary decomposition for the random tower map, which provides a good control over sums of squares of the approximating martingale. We apply our results to a class of random dynamical systems that admit a random Young tower, such as independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) translations of Viana maps, intermittent maps of the interval and small random perturbations of Anosov maps with an ergodic driving system.</description>

      <title>Normal forms of piecewise-smooth systems with a monodromic singular point</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13200</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13200v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Normal form theory is developed deeply for planar smooth systems but has few results
  for piecewise-smooth systems because difficulties arise from continuity of the near-identity
  transformation, which is constructed piecewise. In this paper, we overcome the difficulties
  to study normal forms for piecewise-smooth systems with FF, FP, or PP equilibrium and
  obtain explicit any-order normal forms by finding piecewise-analytic homeomorphisms and
  deriving a new normal form for analytic systems. Our theorems of normal forms not only
  generalize previous results from second-order to any-order, from FF type to all FF, FP, PP
  types, but also provide a new method to compute Lyapunov constants, which are applied to
  solve the center problem and any-order Hopf bifurcations of piecewise-smooth systems.</description>

      <title>Radius-zero Extended Symmetries and Irregular Fibres of $\mathbb{Z}^d$-Substitution Subshifts</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this work, we consider $\mathbb{Z}^d$-shifts generated by digit substitutions. For such a shift $\mathbb{X}$, we study the elements of the normaliser of $\mathbb{Z}^d$ in the group of self homeomorphisms (called extended symmetries) whose local maps guaranteed by the generalised Curtis--Hedlund--Lyndon theorem have radius-zero. Using the formalism of minimal sets developed by Lema\'{n}czyk, M\"ullner and Yassawi, we provide an algorithm to compute elements of $\mathcal{N}(\mathbb{X})$ that preserve the hierarchical structure. We also investigate the interaction of extended symmetries with (i) the height lattice and (ii) the irregular fibres over the maximal equicontinuous factor. Towards (ii), we introduce the notion of derived substitutions to provide a complete description of the irregular fibres, extending a result by Coven, Quas and Yassawi in the one-dimensional case.</description>

      <title>Partially rigid motions in the planar three-body problem</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13570</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.13570v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: A solution of the n-body problem in R^d is a relative equilibrium if all of the mutual distance between the bodies are constant. In other words, the bodies undergo a rigid motion. Here we investigate the possibility of partially rigid motions, where some but not all of the distances are constant. For the planar three-body problem with equal masses, we show that partially rigid motions are impossible -- if even one of the three mutual distances is constant, the motion must be a relative equilibrium.</description>

      <title>Fronts and patterns with a dynamic parameter ramp</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12142</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12142v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We examine the effect of a slowly-varying time-dependent parameter on invasion fronts for which an unstable homogeneous equilibrium is invaded by either another homogeneous state or a spatially periodic state. We first explain and motivate our approach by studying asymptotically constant invasion fronts in a scalar FKPP equation with time-dependent parameter which controls the stability of the trivial state. Following recent works in the area, we use a linearized analysis to derive formal predictions for front position and leading-edge spatial decay. We then use a comparison principle approach to establish a rigorous spreading result in the case of an unbounded temporal parameter. We then consider patterned-invasion in the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with dynamic bifurcation parameter, a prototype for slow passage through a spatio-temporal Hopf instability. Linearized analysis once again gives front position and decay asymptotics, but also the selected spatial wavenumber at the leading edge. We then use a Burger's modulation analysis to predict the slowly-varying wavenumber in the wake of the front. Finally, in both equations, we used the recently developed concept of a space-time memory curve to characterize delayed invasion in the case where the parameter is initially stable before a subsequent slow passage through instability and invasion. We also provide preliminary results studying invasion in other prototypical pattern formation models modified with a dynamic parameter, as well as numerical results for delayed transition between pushed and pulled fronts in Nagumo's equation with dynamic parameter.</description>

      <title>Nonlinear Model Order Reduction of Dynamical Systems in Process Engineering: Review and Comparison</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12819</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12819v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Computationally cheap yet accurate enough dynamical models are vital for real-time capable nonlinear optimization and model-based control. When given a computationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a lower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we review state-of-the-art nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a theoretical comparison of method properties. Additionally, we discuss both general-purpose methods and tailored approaches for (chemical) process systems and we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As manifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the construction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to dynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight established model order reduction methods to an air separation process model: POD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode decomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor, compartment modeling, and model aggregation. Herein, we do not investigate hyperreduction (reduction of FLOPS). Based on our findings, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the model order reduction methods.</description>

      <title>The Kuramoto model on the Sierpinski Gasket</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12940</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.12940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the Kuramoto model (KM) of coupled phase oscillators on graphs approximating the Sierpinski gasket (SG). As the size of the graph tends to infinity, the limit points of the sequence of stable equilibria in the KM correspond to the minima of the Dirichlet energy, i.e., to harmonic maps from the SG to the circle. We provide a complete description of the stable equilibria of the continuum limit of the KM on graphs approximating the SG, under both Dirichlet and free boundary conditions. We show that there is a unique stable equilibrium in each homotopy class of continuous functions from the SG to the circle. These equilibria serve as generalizations of the classical twisted states on ring networks. Furthermore, we extend the analysis to the KM on post-critically finite fractals. The results of this work reveal the link between self-similar organization and network dynamics.</description>

Abstract: The geometry of the period doubling Cantor sets of strongly dissipative infinitely renormalizable H\'enon-like maps has been shown to be unbounded by M. Lyubich, M. Martens and A. de Carvalho, although the measure of unbounded "spots" in the Cantor set has been demonstrated to be zero.
  We show that an even more extreme situation takes places for infinitely renormalizable area-preserving H\'enon-like maps: both bounded and unbounded geometries exist on subsets of positive measure.</description>

Abstract: We describe a locally connected model of the boundary of the cubic connectedness locus. The model is obtained by constructing a decomposition of the space of critical portraits and collapsing elements of the decomposition into points. This model is similar to a quotient of the quadratic combinatorial locus where all baby Mandelbrot sets are collapsed to points. All fibers of the model, possibly except one, are connected. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Yuri Ilyich Lyubich.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2409.02781v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We show that the orbit equivalence relation of a free action of a locally compact group is hyperfinite (\`a la Connes-Feldman-Weiss) precisely when it is 'hypercompact'. This implies an uncountable version of the Ornstein-Weiss Theorem and that every locally compact group admitting a hypercompact probability preserving free action is amenable. We also establish an uncountable version of Danilenko's Random Ratio Ergodic Theorem. From this we deduce the 'Hopf dichotomy' for many nonsingular Bernoulli actions.</description>

      <title>Mitigating distribution shift in machine learning-augmented hybrid simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.09259</link>
      <description>arXiv:2401.09259v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study the problem of distribution shift generally arising in machine-learning augmented hybrid simulation, where parts of simulation algorithms are replaced by data-driven surrogates. We first establish a mathematical framework to understand the structure of machine-learning augmented hybrid simulation problems, and the cause and effect of the associated distribution shift. We show correlations between distribution shift and simulation error both numerically and theoretically. Then, we propose a simple methodology based on tangent-space regularized estimator to control the distribution shift, thereby improving the long-term accuracy of the simulation results. In the linear dynamics case, we provide a thorough theoretical analysis to quantify the effectiveness of the proposed method. Moreover, we conduct several numerical experiments, including simulating a partially known reaction-diffusion equation and solving Navier-Stokes equations using the projection method with a data-driven pressure solver. In all cases, we observe marked improvements in simulation accuracy under the proposed method, especially for systems with high degrees of distribution shift, such as those with relatively strong non-linear reaction mechanisms, or flows at large Reynolds numbers.</description>

Abstract: Let $G$ be a discrete group. Given unital $G$-$C^*$-algebras $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{B}$, we give an abstract condition under which every $G$-subalgebra $\mathcal{C}$ of the form $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{C}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ is a tensor product. This generalizes the well-known splitting results in the context of $C^*$-algebras by Zacharias and Zsido. As an application, we prove a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. When a product group $G=\Gamma_1\times\Gamma_2$ acts (by a product action) on the product of corresponding $\Gamma_i$-boundaries $\partial\Gamma_i$, using the abstract condition, we show that every intermediate subalgebra $C(X)\subset\mathcal{C}\subset C(X)\otimes_{\text{min}}C(\partial\Gamma_1\times \partial\Gamma_2)$ is a tensor product (under some additional assumptions on $X$). This can be considered as a topological version of the Intermediate Factor theorem. We prove that our assumptions are necessary and cannot generally be relaxed. We also introduce the notion of a uniformly rigid action for $C^*$-algebras and use it to give various classes of inclusions $\mathcal{A}\subset \mathcal{A}\otimes_{\text{min}}\mathcal{B}$ for which every invariant intermediate algebra is a tensor product.</description>

Abstract: This paper investigates quasi-homogeneous integrable systems by analyzing their Laurent series solutions near movable singularities, motivated by patterns observed in Kovalevskaya exponents of four-dimensional Painlev\'e-type equations. We introduce a parameter space encoding the free coefficients in these expansions and study its deformation under a commuting quasi-homogeneous vector field.
  Within this framework, we derive lower indicial loci from the principal one and establish an arithmetic resonance condition on Kovalevskaya exponents that governs the emergence of fractional powers and the breakdown of the Painlev\'e property. Moreover, we construct a Frobenius manifold structure on the parameter space via the initial value map, which becomes conformal when all weights coincide.
  In the Hamiltonian context, we demonstrate that the induced flow on the parameter space preserves a symplectic form and yields a natural pairing of Kovalevskaya exponents. These findings unify analytic and geometric aspects of quasi-homogeneous integrable systems and offer new insights into their deformation theory and singularity structures. Our results provide a comprehensive framework applicable to the classification and analysis of Painlev\'e-type equations and related integrable models.</description>
