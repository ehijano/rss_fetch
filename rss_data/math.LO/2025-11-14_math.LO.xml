      <title>Bishop's (up)crossing inequality and lower semicomputable random reals revisited</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09756</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09756v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In this paper we provide an easy proof of Barmpalias--Lewis-Pye result saying that all computable increasing sequences converging to random reals converge with the same speed (up to a $c+o(1)$ factor) by noting that it immediately follows from Bishop's upcrossing inequality. We also provide a simple derivation of this inequality.</description>

      <title>From Internal to External: Classical Models of ZF + PP + $\neg$AC</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09764</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09764v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Goal. We analyze when the Partition Principle ($\mathsf{PP}$) holds without $\mathsf{AC}$ in models arising from a free finite $H$-action on Cantor space, and reconcile two standard routes to such models. Approach. Route I proceeds via a Boolean-valued presentation $\mathrm{Sh}(\mathbb{B})$ and symmetric names; Route II uses direct forcing with $\mathrm{Fn}(\mathbb{N}\times H,2)$ and finite-support automorphisms. We prove a unification theorem identifying the resulting symmetric submodels and develop a Local-to-Global Embedding Principle (LEP) for hereditarily symmetric names. Results. We prove external $\mathsf{PP}$ in the symmetric model $N$ built via Route II. From LEP we obtain that $\mathsf{PP}$ holds in the symmetric model, hence $N\models \mathsf{ZF}+\mathsf{PP}+\neg\mathsf{AC}$. Along the way, we unify the Route I/Route II presentations functorially. Limitations. Our proof exploits the countable-support stratification of $\mathrm{Fn}(\mathbb{N}\times H,2)$; extending the LEP/gluing to uncountable presentations (e.g. $\mathrm{Fn}(\kappa\times H,2)$ for $\kappa&gt;\omega$) or, more generally, to $\kappa$-directed families of finite supports remains open.</description>

      <title>Pre-filtrations, Pre-stable Canonical Rules, and the Kuznetsov-Muravitsky Isomorphism</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09824</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.09824v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We introduce pre-filtration and pre-stable canonical rules for the Kuznetsov-Muravitsky system of intuitionistic modal logic and provide a new proof of the Kuznetsov-Muravitsky isomorphism, along with several preservation results. The proofs employ these rules and a duality between modal (Heyting) algebras and their corresponding order-topological spaces.</description>

      <title>Positive Logic: An Introduction for Model Theorists</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10167</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10167v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Positive logic is a generalisation of full first-order logic that does not have negation built in. Still, many model-theoretic ideas, tools and techniques work perfectly fine in positive logic. Importantly, there is a compactness theorem. With some care, many classical results hold in the generality of positive logic without giving up any strength.
  In these self-contained notes we give an introduction to model theory in positive logic. We give a complete treatment of the basics of positive model theory and then we move on to deeper model-theoretic concepts. First, we discuss countable categoricity, where we work towards a theorem that characterises countably categorical positive theories. After that, we briefly discuss how the convenient formalism of monster models goes through in positive logic as usual. This is helpful in the remainder of the notes, where we discuss simple and stable theories. The main aim in those chapters is to develop dividing independence and prove Kim-Pillay style theorems. For a smoother treatment we assume thickness, which is the relatively mild assumption that being an indiscernible sequence is type-definable. We finish by discussing two big applications of positive logic: hyperimaginaries and continuous logic. For the former we define an $(-)^{\text{heq}}$ construction, analogous to the $(-)^{\text{eq}}$ construction for imaginaries in full first-order logic. Where the $(-)^{\text{heq}}$ construction is problematic in full first-order logic, it does stay within the framework in positive logic and it preserves many nice properties. For the latter we explain how continuous logic can be studied as a special case of positive logic, making it so that all abstract model-theoretic results in positive logic apply to continuous theories.
  In the appendix we provide a quick guide to the material covered in these notes, including very brief proof sketches.</description>

      <title>Quantum modal logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.10188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A modal logic based on quantum logic is formalized in its simplest possible form. Specifically, a relational semantics and a sequent calculus are provided, and the soundness and the completeness theorems connecting both notions are demonstrated. This framework is intended to serve as a basis for formalizing various modal logics over quantum logic, such as quantum alethic logic, quantum temporal logic, quantum epistemic logic, and quantum dynamic logic.</description>

      <title>Formalising Propositional Information via Implication Hypergraphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00186</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.00186v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: This work introduces a framework for quantifying the information content of logical propositions through the use of implication hypergraphs. We posit that a proposition's informativeness is primarily determined by its relationships with other propositions; specifically, the extent to which it implies or derives other propositions. To formalize this notion, we develop a framework based on implication hypergraphs, that seeks to capture these relationships. Within this framework, we define propositional information, derive some key properties, and illustrate the concept through examples. While the approach is broadly applicable, mathematical propositions emerge as an ideal domain for its application due to their inherently rich and interconnected structure. We provide several examples to illustrate this and subsequently discuss the limitations of the framework, along with suggestions for potential refinements.</description>

      <title>Symmetric Iterations with Countable and $&lt;\kappa$-Support: A Framework for Choiceless ZF Extensions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07866</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.07866v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a unified framework for symmetric iterations with countable and, more generally, $&lt;\kappa$-support. Set-length iterations are handled uniformly, and, when the template is first-order definable over a G\"odel-Bernays set theory with Global Choice ground, the same scheme yields class-length iterations. Limit stages with $\mathrm{cf}(\lambda)\ge\kappa$ are treated by direct limits; limits with $\mathrm{cf}(\lambda)&lt;\kappa$ are presented as inverse limits via trees of conditions and tuple-stabilizer filters. The induced limit filters are normal and $\kappa$-complete, which ensures closure of hereditarily symmetric names and preservation of ZF; under a $\kappa$-Baire (strategic-closure) hypothesis we obtain $DC_{&lt;\kappa}$, and under a Localization hypothesis we obtain $DC_\kappa$. For countable support we give an $\omega_1$-length construction that adds reals and refutes AC while preserving ZF+DC, and we show that mixed products (e.g., Cohen with Random) fit naturally via stable pushforwards and restrictions. For singular $\kappa$, we prove the case $\mathrm{cf}(\kappa)=\omega$ in full using block-partition stabilizers and trees; for arbitrary singular $\kappa$ we introduce game-guided fusion of length $\mathrm{cf}(\kappa)$ and a tree-fusion master condition, yielding singular-limit completeness, preservation of $DC_{&lt;\kappa}$, no collapse of $\kappa$, and no new bounded subsets of $\kappa$. The resulting toolkit provides reusable patterns for constructing choiceless inner models that retain targeted fragments of Dependent Choice.</description>

      <title>Datalog-Expressibility for Monadic and Guarded Second-Order Logic</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.05677</link>
      <description>arXiv:2010.05677v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We characterise the sentences in Monadic Second-order Logic (MSO) that are over finite structures equivalent to a Datalog program, in terms of an existential pebble game. We also show that for every class C of finite structures that can be expressed in MSO and is closed under homomorphisms, and for all integers l,k, there exists a canonical Datalog program Pi of width (l,k) in the sense of Feder and Verdi. The same characterisations also hold for Guarded Second-order Logic (GSO), which properly extends MSO. To prove our results, we show that every class C in GSO whose complement is closed under homomorphisms is a finite union of constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs) of countably categorical structures. The intersection of MSO and Datalog is known to contain the class of nested monadically defined queries (Nemodeq); likewise, we show that the intersection of GSO and Datalog contains all problems that can be expressed by the more expressive language of nested guarded queries. Yet, by exploiting our results, we can show that neither of the two query languages can serve as a characterization, as we exhibit a query in the intersection of MSO and Datalog that is not expressible in nested guarded queries.</description>
