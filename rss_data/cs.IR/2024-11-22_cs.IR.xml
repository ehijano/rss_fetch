      <title>A Collaborative Ensemble Framework for CTR Prediction</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13700</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13700v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recent advances in foundation models have established scaling laws that enable the development of larger models to achieve enhanced performance, motivating extensive research into large-scale recommendation models. However, simply increasing the model size in recommendation systems, even with large amounts of data, does not always result in the expected performance improvements. In this paper, we propose a novel framework, Collaborative Ensemble Training Network (CETNet), to leverage multiple distinct models, each with its own embedding table, to capture unique feature interaction patterns. Unlike naive model scaling, our approach emphasizes diversity and collaboration through collaborative learning, where models iteratively refine their predictions. To dynamically balance contributions from each model, we introduce a confidence-based fusion mechanism using general softmax, where model confidence is computed via negation entropy. This design ensures that more confident models have a greater influence on the final prediction while benefiting from the complementary strengths of other models. We validate our framework on three public datasets (AmazonElectronics, TaobaoAds, and KuaiVideo) as well as a large-scale industrial dataset from Meta, demonstrating its superior performance over individual models and state-of-the-art baselines. Additionally, we conduct further experiments on the Criteo and Avazu datasets to compare our method with the multi-embedding paradigm. Our results show that our framework achieves comparable or better performance with smaller embedding sizes, offering a scalable and efficient solution for CTR prediction tasks.</description>

      <title>LEADRE: Multi-Faceted Knowledge Enhanced LLM Empowered Display Advertisement Recommender System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13789</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13789v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Display advertising provides significant value to advertisers, publishers, and users. Traditional display advertising systems utilize a multi-stage architecture consisting of retrieval, coarse ranking, and final ranking. However, conventional retrieval methods rely on ID-based learning to rank mechanisms and fail to adequately utilize the content information of ads, which hampers their ability to provide diverse recommendation lists.
  To address this limitation, we propose leveraging the extensive world knowledge of LLMs. However, three key challenges arise when attempting to maximize the effectiveness of LLMs: "How to capture user interests", "How to bridge the knowledge gap between LLMs and advertising system", and "How to efficiently deploy LLMs". To overcome these challenges, we introduce a novel LLM-based framework called LLM Empowered Display ADvertisement REcommender system (LEADRE). LEADRE consists of three core modules: (1) The Intent-Aware Prompt Engineering introduces multi-faceted knowledge and designs intent-aware &lt;Prompt, Response&gt; pairs that fine-tune LLMs to generate ads tailored to users' personal interests. (2) The Advertising-Specific Knowledge Alignment incorporates auxiliary fine-tuning tasks and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align LLMs with ad semantic and business value. (3) The Efficient System Deployment deploys LEADRE in an online environment by integrating both latency-tolerant and latency-sensitive service. Extensive offline experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LEADRE and validate the contributions of individual modules. Online A/B test shows that LEADRE leads to a 1.57% and 1.17% GMV lift for serviced users on WeChat Channels and Moments separately. LEADRE has been deployed on both platforms, serving tens of billions of requests each day.</description>

      <title>HARec: Hyperbolic Graph-LLM Alignment for Exploration and Exploitation in Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13865</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13865v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Modern recommendation systems often create information cocoons, limiting users' exposure to diverse content. To enhance user experience, a crucial challenge is developing systems that can balance content exploration and exploitation, allowing users to adjust their recommendation preferences. Intuitively, this balance can be achieved through a tree-structured representation, where depth search facilitates exploitation and breadth search enables exploration. However, current works face two challenges to achieve this target: (1) Euclidean methods fail to fully capture hierarchical structures and lack flexibility in balancing exploration-exploitation, while (2) hyperbolic approaches, despite better hierarchical modeling, suffer from insufficient semantic alignment due to their reliance on Euclidean text encoders. To address these challenges, we propose HARec, a hyperbolic representation learning framework that jointly aligns user-item collaborative information with textual descriptions in hyperbolic space. Our framework introduces two key technique novelty: (1) a hierarchical-aware graph-llm alignment mechanism that enables better hierarchical representation, and (2) a hyperbolic hierarchical tree structure that facilitates user-adjustable exploration-exploitation trade-offs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HARec consistently outperforms both Euclidean and hyperbolic baselines, achieving up to 5.49% improvement in utility metrics and 11.39% increase in diversity metrics.</description>

      <title>Topology-Aware Popularity Debiasing via Simplicial Complexes</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13892</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.13892v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Recommender systems (RS) play a critical role in delivering personalized content across various online platforms, leveraging collaborative filtering (CF) as a key technique to generate recommendations based on users' historical interaction data. Recent advancements in CF have been driven by the adoption of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), which model user-item interactions as bipartite graphs, enabling the capture of high-order collaborative signals. Despite their success, GNN-based methods face significant challenges due to the inherent popularity bias in the user-item interaction graph's topology, leading to skewed recommendations that favor popular items over less-known ones.
  To address this challenge, we propose a novel topology-aware popularity debiasing framework, Test-time Simplicial Propagation (TSP), which incorporates simplicial complexes (SCs) to enhance the expressiveness of GNNs. Unlike traditional methods that focus on pairwise relationships, our approach captures multi-order relationships through SCs, providing a more comprehensive representation of user-item interactions. By enriching the neighborhoods of tail items and leveraging SCs for feature smoothing, TSP enables the propagation of multi-order collaborative signals and effectively mitigates biased propagation.
  Our TSP module is designed as a plug-and-play solution, allowing for seamless integration into pre-trained GNN-based models without the need for fine-tuning additional parameters. Extensive experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of our method, particularly in long-tail recommendation tasks. Visualization results further confirm that TSP produces more uniform distributions of item representations, leading to fairer and more accurate recommendations.</description>

      <title>BEST-STD: Bidirectional Mamba-Enhanced Speech Tokenization for Spoken Term Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14100</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14100v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Spoken term detection (STD) is often hindered by reliance on frame-level features and the computationally intensive DTW-based template matching, limiting its practicality. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach that encodes speech into discrete, speaker-agnostic semantic tokens. This facilitates fast retrieval using text-based search algorithms and effectively handles out-of-vocabulary terms. Our approach focuses on generating consistent token sequences across varying utterances of the same term. We also propose a bidirectional state space modeling within the Mamba encoder, trained in a self-supervised learning framework, to learn contextual frame-level features that are further encoded into discrete tokens. Our analysis shows that our speech tokens exhibit greater speaker invariance than those from existing tokenizers, making them more suitable for STD tasks. Empirical evaluation on LibriSpeech and TIMIT databases indicates that our method outperforms existing STD baselines while being more efficient.</description>

      <title>OpenScholar: Synthesizing Scientific Literature with Retrieval-augmented LMs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14199</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.14199v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Scientific progress depends on researchers' ability to synthesize the growing body of literature. Can large language models (LMs) assist scientists in this task? We introduce OpenScholar, a specialized retrieval-augmented LM that answers scientific queries by identifying relevant passages from 45 million open-access papers and synthesizing citation-backed responses. To evaluate OpenScholar, we develop ScholarQABench, the first large-scale multi-domain benchmark for literature search, comprising 2,967 expert-written queries and 208 long-form answers across computer science, physics, neuroscience, and biomedicine. On ScholarQABench, OpenScholar-8B outperforms GPT-4o by 5% and PaperQA2 by 7% in correctness, despite being a smaller, open model. While GPT4o hallucinates citations 78 to 90% of the time, OpenScholar achieves citation accuracy on par with human experts. OpenScholar's datastore, retriever, and self-feedback inference loop also improves off-the-shelf LMs: for instance, OpenScholar-GPT4o improves GPT-4o's correctness by 12%. In human evaluations, experts preferred OpenScholar-8B and OpenScholar-GPT4o responses over expert-written ones 51% and 70% of the time, respectively, compared to GPT4o's 32%. We open-source all of our code, models, datastore, data and a public demo.</description>

      <title>A Gradient Accumulation Method for Dense Retriever under Memory Constraint</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12356</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.12356v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: InfoNCE loss is commonly used to train dense retriever in information retrieval tasks. It is well known that a large batch is essential to stable and effective training with InfoNCE loss, which requires significant hardware resources. Due to the dependency of large batch, dense retriever has bottleneck of application and research. Recently, memory reduction methods have been broadly adopted to resolve the hardware bottleneck by decomposing forward and backward or using a memory bank. However, current methods still suffer from slow and unstable training. To address these issues, we propose Contrastive Accumulation (ContAccum), a stable and efficient memory reduction method for dense retriever trains that uses a dual memory bank structure to leverage previously generated query and passage representations. Experiments on widely used five information retrieval datasets indicate that ContAccum can surpass not only existing memory reduction methods but also high-resource scenario. Moreover, theoretical analysis and experimental results confirm that ContAccum provides more stable dual-encoder training than current memory bank utilization methods.</description>

      <title>A Thorough Performance Benchmarking on Lightweight Embedding-based Recommender Systems</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.17335</link>
      <description>arXiv:2406.17335v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Since the creation of the Web, recommender systems (RSs) have been an indispensable mechanism in information filtering. State-of-the-art RSs primarily depend on categorical features, which ecoded by embedding vectors, resulting in excessively large embedding tables. To prevent over-parameterized embedding tables from harming scalability, both academia and industry have seen increasing efforts in compressing RS embeddings. However, despite the prosperity of lightweight embedding-based RSs (LERSs), a wide diversity is seen in evaluation protocols, resulting in obstacles when relating LERS performance to real-world usability. Moreover, despite the common goal of lightweight embeddings, LERSs are evaluated with a single choice between the two main recommendation tasks -- collaborative filtering and content-based recommendation. This lack of discussions on cross-task transferability hinders the development of unified, more scalable solutions. Motivated by these issues, this study investigates various LERSs' performance, efficiency, and cross-task transferability via a thorough benchmarking process. Additionally, we propose an efficient embedding compression method using magnitude pruning, which is an easy-to-deploy yet highly competitive baseline that outperforms various complex LERSs. Our study reveals the distinct performance of LERSs across the two tasks, shedding light on their effectiveness and generalizability. To support edge-based recommendations, we tested all LERSs on a Raspberry Pi 4, where the efficiency bottleneck is exposed. Finally, we conclude this paper with critical summaries of LERS performance, model selection suggestions, and underexplored challenges around LERSs for future research. To encourage future research, we publish source codes and artifacts at \href{this link}{https://github.com/chenxing1999/recsys-benchmark}.</description>

      <title>Pairwise Judgment Formulation for Semantic Embedding Model in Web Search</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04197</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.04197v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Semantic Embedding Model (SEM), a neural network-based Siamese architecture, is gaining momentum in information retrieval and natural language processing. In order to train SEM in a supervised fashion for Web search, the search engine query log is typically utilized to automatically formulate pairwise judgments as training data. Despite the growing application of semantic embeddings in the search engine industry, little work has been done on formulating effective pairwise judgments for training SEM. In this paper, we make the first in-depth investigation of a wide range of strategies for generating pairwise judgments for SEM. An interesting (perhaps surprising) discovery reveals that the conventional pairwise judgment formulation strategy wildly used in the field of pairwise Learning-to-Rank (LTR) is not necessarily effective for training SEM. Through a large-scale empirical study based on query logs and click-through activities from a major commercial search engine, we demonstrate the effective strategies for SEM and highlight the advantages of a hybrid heuristic (i.e., Clicked &gt; Non-Clicked) in comparison to the atomic heuristics (e.g., Clicked &gt; Skipped) in LTR. We conclude with best practices for training SEM and offer promising insights for future research.</description>

      <title>RRADistill: Distilling LLMs' Passage Ranking Ability for Long-Tail Queries Document Re-Ranking on a Search Engine</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18097</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.18097v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding the semantic relationships between queries and documents, even with lengthy and complex long-tail queries. These queries are challenging for feedback-based rankings due to sparse user engagement and limited feedback, making LLMs' ranking ability highly valuable. However, the large size and slow inference of LLMs necessitate the development of smaller, more efficient models (sLLMs). Recently, integrating ranking label generation into distillation techniques has become crucial, but existing methods underutilize LLMs' capabilities and are cumbersome. Our research, RRADistill: Re-Ranking Ability Distillation, propose an efficient label generation pipeline and novel sLLM training methods for both encoder and decoder models. We introduce an encoder-based method using a Term Control Layer to capture term matching signals and a decoder-based model with a ranking layer for enhanced understanding. A/B testing on a Korean-based search platform, validates the effectiveness of our approach in improving re-ranking for long-tail queries.</description>

      <title>Controlling Diversity at Inference: Guiding Diffusion Recommender Models with Targeted Category Preferences</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.11240</link>
      <description>arXiv:2411.11240v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Diversity control is an important task to alleviate bias amplification and filter bubble problems. The desired degree of diversity may fluctuate based on users' daily moods or business strategies. However, existing methods for controlling diversity often lack flexibility, as diversity is decided during training and cannot be easily modified during inference. We propose \textbf{D3Rec} (\underline{D}isentangled \underline{D}iffusion model for \underline{D}iversified \underline{Rec}ommendation), an end-to-end method that controls the accuracy-diversity trade-off at inference. D3Rec meets our three desiderata by (1) generating recommendations based on category preferences, (2) controlling category preferences during the inference phase, and (3) adapting to arbitrary targeted category preferences. In the forward process, D3Rec removes category preferences lurking in user interactions by adding noises. Then, in the reverse process, D3Rec generates recommendations through denoising steps while reflecting desired category preferences. Extensive experiments on real-world and synthetic datasets validate the effectiveness of D3Rec in controlling diversity at inference.</description>

      <title>REAR: A Relevance-Aware Retrieval-Augmented Framework for Open-Domain Question Answering</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17497</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.17497v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Considering the limited internal parametric knowledge, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) has been widely used to extend the knowledge scope of large language models (LLMs). Despite the extensive efforts on RAG research, in existing methods, LLMs cannot precisely assess the relevance of retrieved documents, thus likely leading to misleading or even incorrect utilization of external knowledge (eg., retrieved documents). To address this issue, in this paper, we propose REAR, a RElevance-Aware Retrieval-augmented approach for open-domain question answering (QA). As the key motivation, we aim to enhance the self-awareness regarding the reliability of external knowledge for LLMs, so as to adaptively utilize external knowledge in RAG systems. Specially, we develop a novel architecture for LLM-based RAG systems, by incorporating a specially designed assessment module that precisely assesses the relevance of retrieved documents. Furthermore, we propose an improved training method based on bi-granularity relevance fusion and noise-resistant training. By combining the improvements in both architecture and training, our proposed REAR can better utilize external knowledge by effectively perceiving the relevance of retrieved documents. Experiments on four open-domain QA tasks show that REAR significantly outperforms previous a number of competitive RAG approaches.

      <description>arXiv:2411.00262v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: This paper investigates the relationships among key elements of the scientific research network, namely articles, researchers, and journals. We introduce a novel approach to use semantic information through the HITS algorithm-based propagation of topic information in the network. The topic information is derived by using the Named Entity Recognition and Entity Linkage. In our case, MedCAT is used to extract the topics from the CORD19 Dataset, which is a corpus of academic articles about COVID-19 and the coronavirus scientific network. Our approach focuses on the COVID-19 domain, utilizing the CORD-19 dataset to demonstrate the efficacy of integrating topic-related information within the citation framework. Through the application of a hybrid HITS algorithm, we show that incorporating topic data significantly influences article rankings, revealing deeper insights into the structure of the academic community.</description>

Abstract: Detecting and tracking emerging trends and weak signals in large, evolving text corpora is vital for applications such as monitoring scientific literature, managing brand reputation, surveilling critical infrastructure and more generally to any kind of text-based event detection. Existing solutions often fail to capture the nuanced context or dynamically track evolving patterns over time. BERTrend, a novel method, addresses these limitations using neural topic modeling in an online setting. It introduces a new metric to quantify topic popularity over time by considering both the number of documents and update frequency. This metric classifies topics as noise, weak, or strong signals, flagging emerging, rapidly growing topics for further investigation. Experimentation on two large real-world datasets demonstrates BERTrend's ability to accurately detect and track meaningful weak signals while filtering out noise, offering a comprehensive solution for monitoring emerging trends in large-scale, evolving text corpora. The method can also be used for retrospective analysis of past events. In addition, the use of Large Language Models together with BERTrend offers efficient means for the interpretability of trends of events.</description>
