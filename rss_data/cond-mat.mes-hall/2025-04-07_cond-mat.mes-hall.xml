      <title>Chirality-Driven Magnetization Emerges from Relativistic Four-Current Dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03781</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03781v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) is a striking quantum phenomenon in which electron transport through chiral molecules leads to spin polarization -- even in the absence of magnetic fields or magnetic components. Although observed in systems such as DNA, helicenes, proteins, and polymers, the fundamental physical origin of CISS remains unresolved. Here, we introduce a time-dependent relativistic four-current framework, in which charge and current densities evolve according to the time-dependent variational principle. Real-time relativistic four-current simulations enable direct analysis of helical currents and induced magnetization dynamics. Applied to helicenes -- axially chiral molecules lacking stereocenters -- our simulations reveal curvature-induced helical electron currents that generate spontaneous magnetic fields aligned along the molecular axis. These fields are handedness-dependent and reach magnitudes of $10^{-1}$~Tesla per single helicene strand. Our results suggest that CISS may arise from intrinsic, relativistic curvature-induced helical currents and the associated magnetic fields within chiral molecules. This four-current mechanism offers a self-contained explanation for spin selectivity, independent of interfacial effects or strong spin-orbit coupling. Furthermore, our results lead to several testable hypotheses that can be explored in experiments.</description>

      <title>Atomic-scale imaging of graphene nanoribbons on graphene after polymer-free substrate transfer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03815</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03815v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: On-surface synthesis enables the fabrication of atomically precise graphene nanoribbons (GNRs) with properties defined by their shape and edge topology. While this bottom-up approach provides unmatched control over electronic and structural characteristics, integrating GNRs into functional electronic devices requires their transfer from noble metal growth surfaces to technologically relevant substrates. However, such transfers often induce structural modifications, potentially degrading or eliminating GNRs' desired functionality - a process that remains poorly understood. In this study, we employ low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy (STM/STS) to characterize 9-atom-wide armchair GNRs (9-AGNRs) following polymer-free wet-transfer onto epitaxial graphene (EG) and quasi-freestanding epitaxial graphene (QFEG) substrates. Our results reveal that armchair GNRs maintain their structural integrity post-transfer, while GNRs with extended or modified edge topologies exhibit significant structural changes, including partial disintegration. Additionally, STS measurements reveal differences in the Fermi level alignment between GNRs and the graphene substrates, a key factor in optimizing carrier injection efficiency in electronic transport devices. This study establishes a framework for detecting post-processing structural modifications in GNRs, which are often hidden in optical ensemble measurements. By addressing the challenges of substrate transfer and providing new insights into GNR-substrate interactions, these findings pave the way for the reliable integration of atomically precise GNRs into next-generation nanoelectronic and optoelectronic devices.</description>

      <title>Tunable Topological Phases in Multilayer Graphene Coupled to a Chiral Cavity</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03842</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03842v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Coupling photonic cavity fields to electronic degrees of freedom in 2D materials introduces an additional control knob to the toolbox of solid-state engineering. Here we demonstrate a subtle competition between cavity frequency and interlayer tunneling in graphene stacks that is responsible for topological phase transitions in light-matter Hilbert space and that cannot be captured by mean-field theory in vacuum. A systematic exploration of multilayer graphene heterostructures and stacking configurations in a chiral tHz cavity reveals that linear dispersion enhances the low-energy cavity-induced topological gap. In bilayer graphene, a displacement field drives the low-energy vacuum band from valley-Chern to Chern insulator, comprising a gate-tunable topological phase transition. Furthermore, we show that a chiral cavity breaks not only the time-reversal symmetry of bilayer graphene but also the inversion symmetry, which impacts its edge spectrum. Our findings pave the way for future control and engineering of graphene heterostructures with chiral cavity fields.</description>

      <title>Single-Molecule Vibrational Characterization of Binding Geometry Effects on Isocyanide-Metal Interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03945</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03945v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Isocyanide-metal binding is governed by sigma-donation and pi-back-bonding, which affects the energy of the isocyanide stretching mode-a characteristic probe for ligand-metal interactions. While extensive correlations exist between structure and spectroscopy in molecular isocyanide-metal systems, isocyanide interactions with metallic crystalline surfaces, where ligands often bind in various geometries, remain poorly understood. Conventional vibrational spectroscopies, such as infrared and Raman, lack the molecular-scale resolution needed to distinguish these inhomogeneous configurations. In contrast, inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy with scanning tunneling microscopy (STM-IETS) enables direct visualization of ligand adsorption geometries and their vibrational signatures. Using STM-IETS, here we investigate a matal-adsorbed m-terphenyl isocyanie ligand and find that adsorption geometry on Cu(100) induces a significant shift in isocyanide stretching frequency, even greater than replacing Cu(100) with Ag(111). Density functional theory confirms this shift arises from atomic-scale variations in isocyanide-metal binding. This study elucidates how atomic-scale binding influences the vibrational signatures of isocyanide ligands-an often-overlooked factor in understanding isocyanide-metal interactions.</description>

      <title>Rectification and bolometric terahertz radiation detectors based on perforated graphene structures exhibiting plasmonic resonant response</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04036</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04036v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We propose and evaluate the characteristics of the terahertz (THz) detectors based on perforated graphene layers (PGLs). The PGL structures constitute the interdigital in-plane arrays of the graphene microribbons (GMRs) connected by the sets of narrow constrictions, which form the graphene nanoribbon (GNR) bridges. The PGL detector operation is associated with the rectification and hot-carrier bolometric mechanisms. The excitation of plasmonic oscillations in the GMRs can reinforce these mechanisms. The room temperature PGL detector responsivity and detectivity are calculated as function of the radiation frequency and device structure parameters. The effects of the rectification and hot-carrier mechanisms are compared. The PGL THz detectors under consideration can exhibit highly competitive values of responsivity and detectivity.</description>

      <title>Spin-Torque-Driven Non-uniform Dynamics of an Antivortex Core in Truncated Astroid Shaped Nanomagnets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04273</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04273v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Spin textures that are not readily available in the domain structures of continuous magnetic thin films can be stabilized when patterned to micro/nano scales due to the dominant effect of dipolar magnetic interactions. Fabrication of such devices enables a thorough study of their RF dynamics excited by highly concentrated spin-polarized/pure-spin currents. For this purpose, in this study, we have employed a truncated astroid geometry to achieve stable magnetic antivortex core nucleation/annihilation which was detectable using the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) at various temperatures. Furthermore, by depositing a soft magnetic thin film (20 nm thick permalloy) capped with a heavy-metal 2nm Pt layer, we were able to probe the spin orbit torque induced excitations accompanied by self-torque due to half-antivortex cores reminiscent of an isolated-antivortex, yielding GHz frequency oscillations with high quality factors (~50000). The observed RF oscillations can be attributed to a non-uniform domain wall oscillation mode close to the stable-antivortex core nucleation site as seen in micromagnetic simulations. This fundamental study of antivortex core response to spin currents is crucial for the assessment of their potential applications in high frequency spintronic devices such as reservoir computers.</description>

      <title>Low-energy effective theory of localization-delocalization transition in noninteger-charged electron wave packets</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04392</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04392v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present a low-energy effective theory to describe the localization-delocalization transition, which occurs for wave functions of electrons and holes injected individually by a voltage pulse with noninteger flux quantum. We find that the transition can be described by an effective scattering matrix in a truncated low-energy space, which is composed of two parts. The first part describes the infrared-divergence of the scattering matrix, while the second part represents the high-energy correlation. For short-tailed pulses which decay faster than Lorentzian, the scattering matrix exhibits solely an inverse linear divergence in the infrared limit. The divergence is responsible for the dynamical orthogonality catastrophe, which leads to electron-hole pairs with delocalized wave functions. In contrast, the high-energy correlation can be approximated by a constant term, which leads to electron-hole pairs with localized wave functions. Due to the competition between the two terms, the wave functions can undergo a localization-delocalization transition, which occurs for electrons and holes injected individually by the voltage pulse. As a consequence, the localization-delocalization transitions for all short-tailed pulses can be described by the same effective scattering matrix, suggesting that they belong to the same universality class. For pulses with longer tails, the scattering matrix can exhibit additional infrared-divergences. We show that a Lorentzian pulse gives rise to a logarithmic divergence, while a fractional-powered Lorentzian pulse gives rise to a power-law divergence. The additional divergence can lead to localization-delocalization transitions belonging to different universality classes. These results demonstrate the fine-tuning capabilities of the localization-delocalization transition in time-dependent quantum transport.</description>

      <title>Circular currents in an antiferromagnetic ring with a side-coupled one-dimensional chain</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04487</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04487v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We investigate persistent charge and spin currents in an antiferromagnetic (AFM) quantum ring threaded by an Aharonov-Bohm flux, in the presence of a side-coupled one-dimensional non-magnetic (NM) chain. In the absence of the chain, the spin circular current vanishes exactly due to the symmetry between the up and down spin sub-Hamiltonians. Modeling the system within a tight-binding (TB) framework, we compute the currents using a second-quantized approach. Both charge and spin currents can be selectively tuned by adjusting the ring-chain coupling strength. Temperature plays a crucial role in modulating the currents, and interestingly, we find that they increase significantly with rising temperature--contrary to conventional expectations.</description>

      <title>Surface Dominated Quantum Geometry-Induced Nonlinear Transport in the van der Waals Antiferromagnet CrSBr</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04526</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04526v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The van der Waals (vdW) antiferromagnet CrSBr has recently garnered significant attention due to its air stability, high magnetic transition temperature, and semiconducting properties. We investigate its nonlinear transport properties and identify a quantum metric dipole-induced nonlinear anomalous Hall effect and nonlinear longitudinal resistivity, which switch sign upon reversing the N\'eel vector. The significant quantum metric dipole originates from Dirac nodal lines near the conduction band edge within the experimentally achievable doping range. Known the weak interlayer coupling, it is unexpected that the nonlinear conductivities do not scale with sample thickness but are dominantly contributed by surface layers. In the electron-doped region, the top layer dominates the response while the top three layers contribute the most in the hole-doped region. Our results establish topological nodal lines as a guiding principle to design high-performance nonlinear quantum materials and suggest that surface-sensitive transport devices will provide new avenues for nonlinear electronic applications.</description>

      <title>Long-living superfluidity of dark excitons in a strip of strained transition metal dichalcogenides double layer</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04651</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04651v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We have proposed the superfluidity of dipolar excitons in a strip of double-layer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) heterostructures. We have shown that strain causes a shift in k-space between the minimum of the conduction band and the maximum of the valence band. Therefore, we expect that applying strain to this system can cause dark excitons to be created. We have numerically calculated the energy spectrum of dark dipolar excitons in strained MoSe$_2$, and we have calculated their binding energies and effective masses. We have shown that the dark dipolar excitons in strained TMDC heterostructures form superfluids, and we have calculated the sound velocity in the energy spectrum of collective excitations, as well as the mean-field critical temperature for superfluidity. We have shown that two separate superfluid flows moving in opposite directions will appear in the system, one on each edge of the strip, forming the double layer. We have seen that the critical temperature for superfluidity increases with the concentration of dark excitons, as well as with the inter-layer separation. The fact that dark excitons cannot decay by the simple emission of photons, makes it so that the superfluids and condensates formed by them have a much longer lifetime than that formed by bright excitons. We propose a way to experimentally verify the predicted phenomena.</description>

      <title>Uncovering the roughness effect on inelastic phonon scattering and thermal conductance at interface via spectral energy exchange</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04696</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04696v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism of interfacial thermal transport is crucial for thermal management of electronics. Recent experiments have shown the strong impact of interfacial roughness on inelastic phonon scattering and interfacial thermal conductance (ITC), while the theoretical modeling and underlying physics remain missing. Through non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations with quantum correction, we predict ITC of both sharp and rough Si/Al interfaces in a good agreement with experimental results in a broad range of temperatures. We further introduce a novel spectral energy exchange analysis, which reveals more annihilation of high-frequency phonons and generation of moderate-frequency phonons around the sharp interface compared to its rough counterpart. However, the low-frequency phonons at rough interface shows unexpected stronger inelastic scattering and larger contribution to ITC due to unique emerging interfacial modes. Our work thus promotes both the methodology and understanding of interfacial thermal transport at solid/solid interfaces, and may benefit the design and optimization of thermal interface materials.</description>

      <title>Observation of non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence in non-chiral non-unitary quantum dynamics of single photons</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04882</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04882v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The breakdown of conventional bulk-boundary correspondence, a cornerstone of topological physics, is one of counter-intuitive phenomena in non-Hermitian systems, that is deeply rooted in symmetry. In particular, preserved chiral symmetry is one of the key ingredients, which plays a pivotal role in determining non-Hermitian topology. Nevertheless, chiral symmetry breaking in non-Hermitian systems disrupts topological protection, modifies topological invariants, and substantially reshapes spectral and edge-state behavior. The corresponding fundamentally important bulk-boundary correspondence thus needs to be drastically reconstructed. However, it has so far eluded experimental efforts. Here, we theoretically predict and experimentally demonstrate the bulk-boundary correspondence of a one-dimensional (1D) non-Hermitian system with chiral symmetry breaking in discrete-time non-chiral non-unitary quantum walks of single photons. Through constructing a domain-wall configuration, we experimentally observe the photon localization at the interface of domain-wall structure, clearly indicating the presence of the topological edge mode. The appearance of that matches excellently with the prediction of our introduced non-chiral non-Bloch topological invariants pair. Our work thus unequivocally builds the non-Hermitian bulk-boundary correspondence as a general principle for studying topological physics in non-Hermitian systems with chiral symmetry breaking.</description>

      <title>Combining kinetic and thermodynamic uncertainty relations in quantum transport</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04980</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04980v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We study the fluctuations of generic currents in multi-terminal, multi-channel quantum transport settings. In the quantum regime, these fluctuations and the resulting precision differ strongly depending on whether the device is of fermionic or bosonic nature. Using scattering theory, we show that the precision is bounded by constraints set by the entropy production and by the activity in the spirit of thermodynamic or kinetic uncertainty relations, valid for fermionic and bosonic quantum systems and even in the absence of time-reversal symmetry. Furthermore, we derive a combined thermodynamic kinetic uncertainty relation, which is tight over a wide range of parameters and can hence predict the reachable precision of a device.
  Since these constraints can be expressed in terms of observables accessible in transport measurements, such as currents and bandwidth, we foresee that the tight thermodynamic kinetic uncertainty-like bounds are also useful as an inference tool: they can be exploited to estimate entropy production from transport observables, such as the charge current and its noise, which are more easily accessible in experiment.</description>

      <title>Radio frequency single electron transmission spectroscopy of a semiconductor Si/SiGe quantum dot</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05016</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05016v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Rapid single shot spin readout is a key ingredient for fault tolerant quantum computing with spin qubits. An RF-SET (radio-frequency single electron transistor) is predominantly used as its the readout timescale is far shorter than the spin decoherence time. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate a transmission-based RF-SET using a multi-module semiconductor-superconductor assembly. A monolithically integrated SET placed next to a double quantum dot in a Si/SiGe heterostructure is wire-bonded to a superconducting niobium inductor forming the impedance-transforming network. Compared to RF reflectometry, the proposed set-up is experimentally simpler without the need for directional couplers. Read-out performance is benchmarked by the signal-to-noise (SNR) of a dot-reservoir transition (DRT) and an interdot charge transition (ICT) in the double quantum dot near the SET as a function of RF power and integration time. The minimum integration time for unitary SNR is found to be 100 ns for ICT and 300 ns for DRT. The obtained minimum integration times are comparable to the state of the art in conventional RF reflectometry set-ups. Furthermore, we study the turn-on properties of the RF-SET to investigate capacitive shifts and RF losses. Understanding these effects are crucial for further optimisations of the impedance transforming network as well as the device design to assist RF read-out. This new RF read-out scheme also shows promise for multiplexing spin-qubit readout and further studies on rapid charge dynamics in quantum dots.</description>

      <title>Superconductivity, Anomalous Hall Effect, and Stripe Order in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05129</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05129v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the discovery of a unique superconducting phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene characterized by its simultaneous emergence with both the anomalous Hall effect and stripe charge order. The onset of stripe charge order is revealed through angle-resolved transport measurements, which show thermally activated insulating behavior along one axis and highly conductive transport along the orthogonal direction. Superconductivity develops exclusively along the high-conductivity axis, giving rise to a one-dimensional-like superconducting channel. This superconducting state exhibits first-order transitions under an out-of-plane magnetic field, consistent with a chiral order parameter that breaks time-reversal symmetry. Most remarkably, thermally driven superconducting transitions display pronounced hysteresis-an uncommon phenomenon that reflects the complex interplay among stripe formation, broken time-reversal symmetry, and superconductivity. Together, these results uncover a previously unidentified quantum phase: a chiral superconductor embedded within an anomalous Hall crystal.</description>

      <title>Violation of local reciprocity in charge-orbital interconversion</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05139</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05139v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We demonstrate a violation of local reciprocity in the interconversion between charge and orbital currents. By investigating orbital torque and orbital pumping in W/Ni bilayers, we show that the charge-orbital interconversion in the bulk of the W layer exhibits opposite signs in the direct and inverse processes -- the direct and inverse orbital Hall effects being positive and negative, respectively. This finding provides direct evidence of local non-reciprocity in the charge-orbital interconversion, in agreement with a theoretical prediction. These results highlight the unique characteristics of charge-orbital coupled transport and offer fundamental insights into the mechanisms underlying orbital-current-driven phenomena.</description>

      <title>Apparent fractional charge signatures in PbTe quantum dots due to capacitively coupled charge trap dynamics</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05221</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05221v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We report the observation of fractional shifts in the experimental stability diagrams of PbTe nanowire quantum dots. Although this behavior may appear to suggest fractional charge transport, akin to that reported in the fractional quantum Hall regime, the quasi-one-dimensionality of the system and absence of an applied magnetic field indicate that the presence of fractional charges is highly unlikely. We instead attribute these effects to the presence of one or more spurious dots, or charge traps, capacitively coupled to the primary dot. Our findings illustrate how signatures of fractional charge transport may be replicated through trivial mesoscopic Coulombic effects.</description>

      <title>Dimensionality Enhanced Out-of-Plane Spin Currents in NbIrTe$_4$ for Efficient Field-Free Switching of Perpendicular Magnetization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05280</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05280v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Efficient generation of out-of-plane (OOP) spin currents is crucial for advanced spintronic memory applications. However, the theoretical understanding and experimental implementation of robust OOP spin currents for high-density and low-power magnetization switching remain significant challenges of spintronics. Here, we demonstrate that transitioning NbIrTe$_4$ from a two-dimensional quantum spin Hall insulator to a three-dimensional type-II Weyl semimetal markedly enhances OOP spin current generation. The bulk topological Weyl semimetal nature of NbIrTe$_4$, characterized by its Weyl cone, significantly enhances the OOP spin Berry curvature, enabling an unprecedented OOP spin Hall conductivity exceeding $10^5\hbar/2e$ $\Omega^{-1}m^{-1} $. This enhancement, surpassing the in-plane component by more than fourfold, enables efficient and field-free spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching of perpendicular magnetization with a low current density of 1.4 MA/cm$^2$. The improved spin Hall conductivity reduces the overall power consumption by more than two orders of magnitude compared to existing systems, such as heavy metals. Our findings highlight the pivotal role of dimensionality in harnessing robust OOP spin currents in topological Weyl semimetals, paving the way for the development of high-density, low-power spintronic memory technologies.</description>

      <title>Quantum Otto engine mimicking Carnot near pseudotransitions in the 1D extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03946</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.03946v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The one-dimensional extended Hubbard model (EHM) in the atomic limit has recently been found to exhibit a curious thermal pseudo-transition behavior, which closely resembles first and second-order thermal phase transitions. This phenomenon, occurring at half-filling, is influenced by the quantum phase transition between the alternating pair (AP) and paramagnetic (PM) phases at zero temperature. In this study, we leverage this anomalous behavior to investigate the performance of quantum many-body machines, using the EHM as the working substance. Our analysis reveals that the quantum Otto engine, when operating in the anomalous region, closely mimics the ideal Carnot engine. In this region, both the work output and thermal efficiency of the Otto engine increase, approaching the performance of a Carnot engine. This highlights the potential of many-body systems, such as the EHM, in enhancing quantum thermodynamic performance. Our findings demonstrate that, although the second law of thermodynamics prevents engines from surpassing Carnot efficiency, the Otto engine can operate remarkably close to this limit in the anomalous region, offering insights into new directions for future research on quantum thermodynamic cycles and working substances.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04106v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We develop a fully first-principles approach for spin dynamics based on density functional perturbation theory. We demonstrate that the magnon wavefunction can be expressed by a set of electronic wavefunctions obtained from the decomposition of magnon density profile, enabling the direct calculation of magnonic quantities including Berry curvature and Chern number. As a concrete example, we show that monolayer CrI$_3$ can host topological magnons driven by spin-orbit coupling. Our model-free approach paves the way for the comprehensive studies of magnons in real materials.</description>

      <title>Electron density and compressibility in the Kitaev model with a spatially modulated Phase in the superconducting pairing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04123</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04123v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A current flowing through a one-dimensional Kitaev chain induces a spatial modulation in its superconducting pairing, characterized by a wave vector $Q$, which is known to induce two types of topological phase transitions: one is the customary band topology transition between gapped phases, while the other is a Lifshitz transition related to the Fermi surface topology and leading to a gapless superconducting phase. We investigate the behavior of the electron density $\rho$ and the compressibility $\kappa$ across the two types of transitions, as a function of the model parameters. We find that the behavior of $\rho$ as a function of $Q$ and chemical potential $\mu$ enables one to infer the ground state phase diagram. Moreover, the analysis of the compressibility $\kappa$ as a function of $\mu$ enables one to distinguish the two transitions: While $\kappa$ exhibits a symmetric divergence across the band topology transition, it displays an asymmetric jump across the Lifshitz transition.</description>

      <title>Positive unidirectional anisotropy in Y3Fe5O12/Ir20Mn80 bilayers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04227</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04227v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report an experimental study of the unidirectional anisotropy in bilayers made of the important ferrimagnetic insulator yttrium iron garnet (YIG) and the room temperature antiferromagnet Ir20Mn80 (IrMn). Measurements of the magnetization hysteresis loop in a wide temperature range and ferromagnetic resonance at room temperature revealed an unconventional positive exchange bias (EB). For comparison, we also made FMR measurements in a Py/IrMn bilayer that led to a negative EB with amplitude nearly two orders of magnitude larger than in YIG/IrMn. The presence of the positive EB, in which the hysteresis loop shift occurs in the direction of the field applied during deposition of the films, is attributed to an antiferromagnetic coupling between the spins of the two layers at the interface. The small value of the EB field in YIG/IrMn can be attributed to a competition of the interactions between the spins of the two sublattices of antiferromagnetic IrMn and ferrimagnetic YIG produced by the interface roughness.</description>

      <title>Spreading dynamics in the Hatano-Nelson model with disorder</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04370</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04370v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect is the accumulation of eigenstates at the boundaries, reflecting the system's nonreciprocity. Introducing disorder leads to a competition between the skin effect and Anderson localization, giving rise to the skin-Anderson transition. Here, we investigate wave packet spreading in the disordered Hatano-Nelson model and uncover distinct dynamical behaviors across different regimes. In the clean limit, transport is unidirectionally ballistic ({\Delta}x ~ t) due to nonreciprocity. For weak disorder, where skin and Anderson-localized modes coexist, transport transitions from ballistic at early times to superdiffusive ({\Delta}x ~ t^{2/3}) at long times. In the deeply Anderson-localized regime, initial diffusion ({\Delta}x ~ t^{1/2}) eventually gives way to superdiffusive spreading. We examine how these scaling behaviors emerge from the system's spectral properties and eigenstate localization behaviors. Our work unveils the rich dynamics driven by nonreciprocity and disorder in non-Hermitian systems.</description>

      <title>Planar Josephson junction devices with narrow superconducting strips: Topological properties and optimization</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04468</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04468v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We study the low-energy physics of planar Josephson junction structures realized in a quasi-two dimensional semiconductor system proximity-coupled to narrow superconducting films. Using both a recursive Green's function approach and an effective Hamiltonian approximation, we investigate the topological superconducting phase predicted to emerge in this type of system. We first characterize the effects associated with varying the electrostatic potentials applied within the unproximitized semiconductor regions. We then address the problem of optimizing the width of the superconductor films and identifying the optimal regimes characterized by large topological gap values. We find that structures with narrow superconducting films of widths ranging between about $100~$nm and $200~$nm can support topological superconducting phases with gaps up to $40\%$ of the parent superconducting gap, significantly larger than those characterizing the corresponding wide-superconductor structures. This work represents the first component of a proposed comprehensive strategy to address this optimization problem in planar Josephson junction structures and realize robust topological devices.</description>

      <title>Topological Fermi-arc-like surface states in Kramers nodal line metals</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04529</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04529v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The discovery of Kramers nodal line metals (KNLMs) and Kramers Weyl semimetals (KWSs) has significantly expanded the range of metallic topological materials to all noncentrosymmetric crystals. However, a key characteristic of this topology - the presence of topologically protected surface states in KNLMs - is not well understood. In this work, we use a model of a $C_{1v}$ KNLM with curved Kramers nodal lines (KNLs) to demonstrate that Fermi-arc-like surface states (FALSSs), which have a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological origin, appear on surfaces parallel to the mirror plane. These states connect two surface momenta, corresponding to the projections of two touching points on the Fermi surfaces. Notably, as achiral symmetries (mirrors and roto-inversions) are gradually broken, the KNLM transitions into a KWS, allowing the FALSSs to evolve continuously into the Fermi arc states of the KWS. We also explore the conditions under which FALSSs emerge in KNLMs with straight KNLs. Through bulk-boundary correspondence, we clarify the topological nature of KNLMs.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04536v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Ferroelectric oxide superlattices with complex topological structures such as vortices, skyrmions, and flux closure domains have garnered significant attention due to their fascinating properties and potential applications. However, progress in this field is often impeded by challenges such as limited data-sharing mechanisms, redundant data generation efforts, high barriers between simulations and experiments, and the underutilization of existing datasets. To address these challenges, we have created the Polar Topological Structure Toolbox and Database(PTST). This community driven repository compiles both standard datasets from high throughput phase field simulations and user submitted nonstandard datasets. The PTST utilizes a Global Local Transformer (GL Transformer) to classify polarization states by dividing each sample into spatial sub blocks and extracting hierarchical features, resulting in ten distinct topological categories. Through the PTST web interface, users can easily retrieve polarization data based on specific parameters or by matching experimental images. Additionally, a Binary Phase Diagram Generator allows users to create strain and electric field phase diagrams within seconds. By providing ready-to-use configurations and integrated machine-learning workflows, PTST significantly reduces computational load, streamlines reproducible research, and promotes deeper insights into ferroelectric topological transitions.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04662v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: An outstanding challenge in materials science and physics is the harnessing of light for switching charge order in e.g., ferroelectrics. Here we propose a mechanism through which electrons in ferroelectric bilayers excited with light cause ionic structural transitions. Using perturbation theory within a many-body formalism, we show that the ionic coupling is mediated by a resonant change in electronic occupation functions, ultimately governed by the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of the ground state. Furthermore, we show that such transitions are generally accompanied by multiferroic order switching. We demonstrate two examples of light-induced structural and polarization switching under this mechanism using first-principle calculations on bilayer CrI$_{3}$ and MoTe$_{2}$. We show that the two materials can switch between atomic stackings with a light intensity threshold of only 10-100 GW/cm$^2$, a value 1-3 orders of magnitude lower than that required by direct light-ion coupling thanks to the superior efficiency of resonant light-electron coupling. Since such switching is fast, highly controllable, contactless, and reversible, it is promising for use in optically controlled nonvolatile memory, nanophotonics and polar electronics.</description>

      <title>Taming Flat Bands with Breathing Superlattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04759</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04759v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Flat bands have become a pillar of modern condensed matter physics and photonics owing to the vanishing group velocity and diverging density of states. Here, we present a paradigmatic scheme to construct arbitrary flat bands on demand by introducing a new type breathing superlattice, where both the number and spectral positions of isolated flat bands can be continuously tailored by simply controlling the breathing strength. Microscopically, the momentum-independent interband scatterings near the band edge protect them robust against weak intra-cell disorder. By dimensional reduction, we establish a duality between the one-dimensional (1D) breathing superlattice and the 2D Harper-Hofstadter model, where cascade flat bands naturally emerge as the different orders of Landau levels in the weak magnetic flux limit. As a proof of concept, photonic flat bands at optical frequencies are experimentally demonstrated with all-dielectric photonic crystal slabs. Finally, we generalize our scheme to 2D systems to realize partial and omnidirectional flat bands, and discuss the achievement of high-quality factors. Our findings shed new light on the manipulation of flat bands with high band flatness and large usable bandwidth, paving the way for the development of advanced optical devices.</description>

      <title>Fast gates for bit-flip protected superconducting qubits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04807</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04807v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Superconducting qubits offer an unprecedentedly high degree of flexibility in terms of circuit encoding and parameter choices. However, in designing the qubit parameters one typically faces the conflicting goals of long coherence times and simple control capabilities. Both are determined by the wavefunction overlap of the qubit basis states and the corresponding matrix elements. Here, we address this problem by introducing a qubit architecture with real-time tunable bit-flip protection. In the first, the `heavy' regime, the energy relaxation time can be on the order of hours for fluxons located in two near-degenerate ground states, as recently demonstrated in Ref. [Hassani et al., Nat.~Commun.~14 (2023)]. The second, `light' regime, on the other hand facilitates high-fidelity control on nanosecond timescales without the need for microwave signals. We propose two different tuning mechanisms of the qubit potential and show that base-band flux-pulses of around 10 ns are sufficient to realize a universal set of high-fidelity single- and two-qubit gates. We expect that the concept of real-time wavefunction control can also be applied to other hardware-protected qubit designs.</description>

      <title>Pyroelectric doping reversal of MoS2 p-n junctions on ferroelectric domain walls probed by photoluminescence</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04886</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.04886v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Tailoring the optical properties and electronic doping in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) is a central strategy for developing innovative systems with tunable characteristics. In this context, pyroelectric materials, which hold the capacity for charge generation when subjected to temperature changes, offer a promising route for this modulation. This work employs spatially resolved photoluminescence (PL) to explore the impact of pyroelectricity on the electronic doping of monolayer MoS2 deposited on periodically poled LiNbO3 (LN) substrates. The results demonstrate that pyroelectricity in LN modulates the charge carrier density in MoS2 on ferroelectric surfaces acting as doping mechanism without the need for gating electrodes. Furthermore, upon cooling, pyroelectric charges effectively reverse the doping of p-n junctions on DWs, converting them into n-p junctions. These findings highlight the potential of pyroelectric substrates for tunable and configurable charge engineering in transition metal dichalcogenides and suggest their applicability to other combinations of 2D materials and ferroelectric substrates. They also open avenues for alternative device architectures in nanoelectronic or nanophotonic devices including switches, memories or sensors.</description>

      <title>Fine tuning generative adversarial networks with universal force fields: application to two-dimensional topological insulators</title>

      <description>arXiv:2504.04940v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Despite rapid growth in use cases for generative artificial intelligence, its ability to design purpose built crystalline materials remains in a nascent phase. At the moment inverse design is generally accomplished by either constraining the training data set or producing a vast number of samples from a generator network and constraining the output via post-processing. We show that a general adversarial network trained to produce crystal structures from a latent space can be fine tuned through the introduction of advanced graph neural networks as discriminators, including a universal force field, to intrinsically bias the network towards generation of target materials. This is exemplified utilizing two-dimensional topological insulators as a sample target space. While a number of two-dimensional topological insulators have been predicted, the size of the band-gap, a measure of topological protection, remains a concern in most candidate compounds. The resulting generative network is shown to yield novel topological insulators.</description>

      <title>Energy Gap Modulation in Proximitized Superconducting Puddles of Graphene</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05000</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05000v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We investigated proximity-induced superconductivity in a graphene-insulating InO bilayer system through gate-controlled transport measurements. Distinct oscillations in the differential conductance are observed across both the electron and hole doping regimes, with oscillation amplitudes increasing as the chemical potential moves away from the Dirac point. These findings are explained using a theoretical model of a normal-superconductor-normal (NSN) junction, which addresses reflection and transmission probabilities at normal incidence. From this model, we extract key parameters for the proximitized graphene, including the superconducting energy gap Delta and the effective length scale Ls of the superconducting regions. Near the Dirac point, we observe a minimal Ls and a maximal Delta, aligning with the theory that the gap in strongly disordered superconductors increases as the coherence length of localized pairs decreases. This suggests that spatial confinement in a low-density superconductor leads to an effective increase in the superconducting gap.</description>

      <title>Topological transition between gapless phases in quantum walks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05023</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05023v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Topological gapless phases of matter have been a recent interest among theoretical and experimental condensed matter physicists. Fermionic chains with extended nearest neighbor couplings have been observed to show unique topological transition at the multicritical points between distinct gapless phases. In this work, we show that such topological gapless phases and the transition between them can be simulated in a quantum walk. We consider a three-step discrete-time quantum walk and identify various critical or gapless phases and multicriticalities from the topological phase diagram along with their distinguished energy dispersions. We reconstruct the scaling theory based on the curvature function to study transition between gapless phases in the quantum walk. We show the interesting features observed in fermionic chains, such as diverging, sign flipping and swapping properties of curvature function, can be simulated in the quantum walk. Moreover, the renormalization group flow and Wannier state correlation functions also identify transition at the multicritical points between gapless phases. We observe the scaling law and overlapping of critical and fixed point properties at the multicritical points of the fermionic chains can also be observed in the quantum walk. Furthermore, we categorize the topological transitions at various multicritical points using the group velocity of the energy eigenstates. Finally, the topological characters of various gapless phases are captured using winding number which allows one to distinguish various gapless phases and also show the transitions at the multicritical points.</description>

      <title>Inertia-induced scaling and criticality in martensites</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05115</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05115v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Martensites subjected to quasistatic deformation are known to exhibit power law distributed acoustic emission in a broad range of scales. However, the origin of the observed scaling behavior and the mechanism of self organization towards criticality remains obscure. Here we argue that the power law structure of the fluctuations spectrum can be interpreted as an effect of inertia. The general insight is that inertial dynamics can become a crucial player when the underlying mechanical system is only marginally stable. We first illustrate the possibility of inertia-induced criticality using an elementary example of mass points connected by bi-stable springs. We then explore the effects of inertia in the fully realistic two and three dimensional continuum models of specific elastic phase transitions in crystals.</description>

      <title>Control and Transient Spectroscopy of Engineered Spin-Cavity Back-Action</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05133</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05133v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present an experimental arrangement that permits engineering of cavity back-action on a mesoscopic spin ensemble. By coupling a superconducting thin-film Nb microstrip resonator to a Trityl OX63 electron spin sample, we access different regimes of spin-cavity dynamics by designing the ensemble size, effective coupling strength, cavity temperature, and spin saturation. We performed transient spectroscopy measurements under continuous microwave drive in the strong radiation damping regime. These measurements exhibit a long-lived plateau response that distinguishes important features of spin-cavity models, such as the radiation damping Bloch equations and Maxwell-Bloch equations. We demonstrate control of the plateau response through adjustment of temperature, microwave drive power, and variable spin saturation. The presented experimental arrangement serves as a robust system to explore the space of spin-cavity dynamics and develop new quantum devices that harness the complexity of mesoscopic spin ensembles coherently interacting with high quality factor cavities.</description>

      <title>Breakdown of Bulk-Radiation Correspondence in Radiative Photonic Lattices</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05188</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.05188v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: The topological characteristics of energy bands in crystalline systems are encapsulated in the Berry curvature of the bulk Bloch states. In photonic crystal slabs, far-field emission from guided resonances naturally provides a non-invasive way to probe the embedded wavefunctions, raising the question of how the information carried by escaping photons relates to the band topology. We develop a non-Hermitian model to describe the guided and leaky modes of photonic crystal slabs with long-range couplings and non-local responses. Within this framework, radiation Berry curvature is defined from the far-field polarization and compared to the conventional bulk Berry curvature of the crystal Bloch modes. We investigate this bulk-radiation correspondence in the vicinity of the $\Gamma$-point of the square lattice and the $K$-point of the honeycomb lattice. The results show that the comparability between the bulk topology and the radiation topology is not universal; the validity is contingent upon the specific bulk Bloch states. Notably, the correspondence completely breaks down surrounding the far-field singularities, while it can hold in smooth regions under special symmetry conditions, e.g., rotational symmetry. Besides, net Berry curvature concentration is captured at the valleys of the non-local honeycomb lattice, facilitating further exploration on generalized topological phases in photonic lattices beyond the regimes with localized couplings and Hermiticity.</description>

      <title>Massive Dirac-Pauli physics in lead-halide perovskites</title>

      <description>arXiv:2407.04450v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In standard quantum electrodynamics (QED), the so-called non-minimal (Pauli) coupling is suppressed for elementary particles and has no physical implications. Here, we show that the Pauli term naturally appears in a known family of Dirac materials -- the lead-halide perovskites, suggesting a novel playground for the study of analogue QED effects. We outline measurable manifestations of the Pauli term in the phenomena pertaining to (i) relativistic corrections to bound states (ii) the Klein paradox, and (iii) spin effects in scattering. In particular, we demonstrate that (a) the binding energy of an electron in the vicinity of a positively charged defect is noticeably decreased due to the polarizability of lead ions and the appearance of a Darwin-like term, (b) strong spin-orbit coupling due to the Pauli term affects the exciton states, and (c) scattering of an electron off an energy barrier with broken mirror symmetry produces spin polarization in the outgoing current. Our study adds to understanding of quantum phenomena in lead-halide perovskites, and paves the way for tabletop simulations of analogue Dirac-Pauli equations.</description>

Abstract: In this paper, we present the extended dissipaton theory, including the dissipaton-equation-of-motion formalism and the equivalent dissipaton-embedded quantum master equation. These are exact, non-Markovian, and non-perturbative theories, capable of handling not only linear but also quadratic environmental couplings. These scenarios are prevalent in a variety of strongly correlated electronic systems, including mesoscopic nanodevices and superconductors. As a demonstration, we apply the present theory to simulate the spectral functions of an adatom on a graphene substrate. We analyze the spectral peaks in the presence of the graphene substrate and compare them to those obtained in conventional metal environments. The adatom's spectral functions reveal intricate behaviors arising from the band structure of graphene.</description>

      <title>Super-Poissonian noise from quasiparticle poisoning in electron transport through a pair of Majorana bound states</title>

      <description>arXiv:2409.05594v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Topological qubits based on non-abelian Majorana bound states (MBSs) are protected by parity which is challenged by quasiparticle poisoning (QPP). In this work, we show how QPP affects transport through a pair of coupled MBSs weakly connected to two current leads, using an open system approach and full counting statistics. We find that the correct low-energy physics requires to include next to leading order tunneling events in the coupling to the leads. In particular, our results show that QPP causes super-Poissonian local shot noise with a Fano factor that diverges with decreasing bias voltage, while the current and the non-local (cross-)noise are only little affected. We explain that these features are a direct consequence of the nature of MBSs being their own antiparticle making noise measurements a viable tool to search for MBSs in the presence of QPP.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.14512v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this Letter, we study a previously unexplored class of topological states protected by hidden chiral symmetries that are local, that is, that protect against any off-diagonal disorder. We derive their related topological invariant for the first time, and show that these previously unidentified symmetries can act together with standard chiral symmetries to increase the protection of the end modes, using the Creutz ladder as an example. Finally, thanks to local hidden symmetries, we show that the diamond necklace chain can have three different types of topological end modes: strong, weak or square-root, with some of the states inheriting their topology from others. This marks the first time a square-root topological insulator is identified as its own parent.</description>

Abstract: The effect of polaron formation on the ground state of excitons, trions and biexcitons confined in CsPbBr$_3$ nanocrystals is studied in the framework of effective mass Hamiltonians, using a Haken-like (Bajaj) potential for carrier-phonon coupling. The binding energy of trions agrees well with that observed in experiments, with position-dependent dielectric screening playing a significant role. For biexcitons, however, neither polaronic effects, nor dielectric confinement, nor electronic correlations -- here accounted for with a variational Quantum Monte Carlo method -- suffice to explain the large binding energies reported by single nanocrystal spectroscopy experiments. This result reinforces the hypothesis that biexcitons polarize the perovskite lattice differently from excitons and trions.</description>

      <title>Fine-Tuning Magnetism in CrI$_3$ Monolayers and Bilayers: A DFT+U Approach</title>

      <description>arXiv:2411.19357v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The magnetic properties of CrI$_3$ monolayers, which were recently measured, have been investigated considering electronic repulsion and localization effects in Cr 3d orbitals. In this study, we propose a DFT approach using Hubbard U corrections to improve accuracy. We compare the valence density-of-states using the HSE06 hybrid functional and the DFT+U approach, which includes U parameters for both Cr 3d and I 5p orbitals. The results of our study indicate that the optimal values for U(Cr$_{3d}$) and U(I$_{5p}$) are 3.5 eV and 2.0 eV, respectively. This approach is further applied to improve calculations of electronic and magnetic properties in CrI$_3$ monolayers and, more importantly, in bilayers combined with van der Waals functionals. These refinements hold promise for further studies of complex CrI$_3$ nanostructures, and may also be of interest for other trihalide few-layer systems.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2501.03317v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We present a novel fabrication procedure to produce high-quality lift-off structures on diamond anvils extending from the culet down to the slanted facets. Feature sizes down to 500 nm are achieved through the use of a bi-layer resist stack and electron beam lithography. Device structures with strong adhesion to the diamond surface and high abrasion resistance are realized by optimizing the surface treatment. To benchmark our process, we fabricate a multi-lead tungsten circuit to measure changes of the superconducting transition temperature of zirconium across the structural phase transition at $\sim$30 GPa; showing a 4-fold jump of the critical temperature. Our process is easily reproducible in most traditional academic and industrial cleanroom facilities. This work paves the way for complex and high-precision fabrication and measurements inside diamond anvil cells and on other faceted crystalline samples.</description>

      <title>Strong coupling of polaritons at room temperature in a GaAs/AlGaAs structure</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12338</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.12338v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: We report direct measurement of the dispersion relation of polaritons in GaAs/AlGaAs microcavity structures at room temperature, which clearly shows that the polaritons are in the strong coupling limit. The Rabi splitting of the polariton states decreases as the polariton gas increases in density, but even when the polariton gas becomes a coherent, Bose-condensate-like state, the polaritons retain a strong exciton component, as seen in the nonlinear energy shift of the light emission. This opens up the possibility of polaritonic devices at room temperature in a material system which can be grown with very high quality and uniformity.</description>

      <title>SEMIDV: A Compact Semiconductor Device Simulator with Quantum Effects</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00214</link>
      <description>arXiv:2504.00214v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, I present SEMIDV - a compact semiconductor device simulator incorporating quantum effects. SEMIDV solves the Poisson-Drift-Diffusion equations for semiconductor devices and provides a user-friendly Python interface for scripting and data analysis. Localization landscape theory is introduced to provide quantum corrections to the Drift-Diffusion equation. This theory directly solves the ground state of the Schrodinger equation without further approximation, offering an efficient solution for quantum effect modeling. Additionally, a compact mobility model considering ballistic transport is developed to capture the ballistic length dependence of mobility and the velocity overshoot effect in short-channel devices. Finally, a study on a nanosheet FET using SEMIDV is conducted. I analyze the electrical characteristics of a state-of-the-art GAA/RibbonFET with a 6 nm gate length and discuss the effects of velocity overshoot and quantum confinement on currents and capacitances. A design for an ultra-short-channel transistor with a gate length down to 4.5 nm with a Vdd = 0.45 V is proposed to push the boundaries of integrated circuit technology further.</description>

      <title>Intensity Correlation Measurement to Simulate Two-body BICs and Probe Nonlinear Discrete Breathers</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.18340</link>
      <description>arXiv:2402.18340v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study Hanbury Brown-Twiss spatial intensity correlations in femtosecond laser-fabricated photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices using coherent input states with tunable phases. By mapping intensity correlations to the two-body quantum walk, we experimentally simulate edge bound states in the continuum (BICs) of two indistinguishable bosons. These two-body edge BICs show remarkable robustness in the presence of disorder. We then discuss how intensity correlations can capture the dynamics of two identical fermions for which BICs do not exist on the same edge of the lattice. The localization of intensity correlation, observed in the linear regime, persists at weak nonlinearity due to the formation of long-lived edge breathers -- spatially localized nonlinear states with oscillating intensity along the propagation distance. For stronger nonlinearities, localized edge states are not formed for a range of phases, destroying the localization of the intensity correlation. Our results highlight the interplay of band structure, initial state, and nonlinearity influencing transport and intensity correlations.</description>

      <title>Disorder effects in planar semiconductor-superconductor structures: Majorana wires versus Josephson junctions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12192</link>
      <description>arXiv:2405.12192v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Disorder effects in hybrid semiconductor-superconductor (SM-SC) nanowires, widely recognized as the main obstacle to realizing stable Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in these structures, have been systematically investigated theoretically in recent years. However, there are no corresponding detailed studies of disorder effects in planar Josephson junction (JJ) structures, which represent a promising alternative to the Majorana nanowire platform. In this paper, we perform a numerical analysis of the low-energy physics of JJ structures based on an effective microscopic model that includes two types of disorder, charge impurities inside the semiconductor and roughness on the surface of the superconducting film. We consider different parameter regimes, including low and high chemical potential values, weak and strong effective SM-SC coupling strengths, and weak and strong disorder strengths. The results are benchmarked using disordered hybrid nanowires realized in planar SM-SC structures similar to those involved in the fabrication of Josephson junctions and having similar model parameters and disorder strengths. We find that the topological superconducting phase hosted by a JJ structure is, generally, more robust against disorder than the topological superconductivity realized in a hybrid nanowire with similar parameters. On the other hand, we find that operating the JJ in a regime characterized by large values of chemical potential results in huge finite-size effects that can destroy the stability of MZMs.</description>

      <title>Sulfur and sulfur-oxide compounds as potential optically active defects on SWCNTs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18283</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.18283v3 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNT) functionalized with covalent defects are a promising class of optoelectronic materials with strong, tunable photoluminescence and demonstrated single photon emission. Here, we investigate sulfur-oxide containing compounds as a new class of optically active dopants on (6,5) SWCNT. Experimentally, it has been found that when the SWCNT is exposed to sodium dithionite, the resulting compound displays a red-shifted and bright photoluminescence peak that is characteristic of these covalent defects. We perform density functional theory calculations on the possible adsorbed compounds that may be the source of this red-shifted state (S, SO, SO2 and SO3). We predict that the two smallest molecules strongly bind to the SWCNT with binding energies of ~ 1.5-1.8 eV and 0.56 eV for S and SO, respectively, and introduce in-gap electronic states into the bandstructure of the tube consistent with the measured red-shift of (0.1-0.3) eV, consistent with measurements. In contrast, the larger compounds are found to be either unbound or weakly physisorbed with no appreciable impact on the electronic structure of the tube, indicating that they are unlikely to occur. Overall, our study suggests that sulfur-based compounds are promising new dopants for (6,5) SWCNT with tunable electronic properties.</description>

      <title>Learning classical density functionals for ionic fluids</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02556</link>
      <description>arXiv:2410.02556v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Accurate and efficient theoretical techniques for describing ionic fluids are highly desirable for many applications across the physical, biological and materials sciences. With a rigorous statistical mechanical foundation, classical density functional theory (cDFT) is an appealing approach, but the competition between strong Coulombic interactions and steric repulsion limits the accuracy of current approximate functionals. Here, we extend a recently presented machine learning (ML) approach [Samm\"uller et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 120, e2312484120 (2023)] designed for systems with short-ranged interactions to ionic fluids. By adopting ideas from local molecular field theory, the framework we present amounts to using neural networks to learn the local relationship between the one-body direct correlation functions and inhomogeneous density profiles for a "mimic'' short-ranged system, with effects of long-ranged interactions accounted for in a mean-field, yet well-controlled, manner. By comparing to results from molecular simulations, we show that our approach accurately describes the structure and thermodynamics of prototypical models for electrolyte solutions and ionic liquids, including size-asymmetric and multivalent systems. The framework we present acts as an important step toward extending ML approaches for cDFT to systems with accurate interatomic potentials.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2410.04812v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: A particle-hole symmetry protected 2D non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model is investigated. This version differs from the usual Hermitian version by the inclusion of gain and/or loss terms which are represented by complex on-site potentials. The exceptional points occur, when the dimensionless potential magnitude and the hopping amplitudes become close to unity, leading to the coalescence of eigenvalues and nontrivial eigenvector degeneracies. Furthermore, the vectored Zak phase quantization has been obtained and a topolectric RLC circuit has been analysed. If realized experimentally (in photonic and acoustic crystals), the quantization is expected to lead to an extended bulk-boundary correspondence.</description>

      <title>Controlled probing of localization effects in non-Hermitian Aubry-Andr\'e model via topolectrical circuits</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04502</link>
      <description>arXiv:2501.04502v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Anderson localization (AL) and the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) are two distinct confinement phenomena of the eigenfunctions that are, respectively, driven by disorder and non-reciprocity. Understanding their interplay within a unified framework offers valuable insights into the localization properties of low-dimensional systems. To this end, we investigate a non-Hermitian (NH) version of the celebrated Aubry-Andr\'e (AA) model, which serves as an ideal platform due to its unique self-dual properties and ability to demonstrate localization-delocalization transition in one dimension. Interestingly, in our setting, the competition between AL and NHSE can be precisely controlled via the complex phase of the quasiperiodic disorder. Additionally, by analyzing the time evolution, we demonstrate quantum jumps between the NH-induced skin states and the AL states to occur in the system. Further, to gain support for our theoretical predictions in an experimental platform, we propose a topolectrical circuit featuring an interface that separates two distinct electrical circuit networks. The localization properties of our model can be studied by analyzing the voltage profile (VP) of the circuit. The VP exhibits confinement at the interface, analogous to the NHSE, while the phenomenon of AL can be perceived via the localization of the VP in the vicinity of the excitation node where the power supply is connected. This interplay leads to a spatially tunable localization of the VP. Our findings provide deeper insights into the controlled confinement of the eigenstates of the NH AA model by designing analogous features in topolectrical circuits that should open avenues in the fabrication of advanced electronic devices, such as highly sensitive sensors and efficient information transfer systems.</description>

      <title>In-plane Ising superconductivity revealed by exchange interactions</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19599</link>
      <description>arXiv:2502.19599v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Two-dimensional superconductors with spin-textured Fermi surfaces can be a platform for realizing unconventional pairing states and are of substantial interest in the context of quantum information science, and superconducting spintronics/orbitronics. We observed an unusual in-plane Ising like uniaxial anisotropy in the superconducting 2D electron gas (2DEG) formed at EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interfaces, where the EuOx is magnetic. This anisotropy is not evident in AlOx/KTaO3 (110) where the overlayer is non-magnetic. Our results are consistent with a highly anisotropic spin-textured Fermi surface in 2DEGs formed at the KTaO3 (110) interface that is hidden from external magnetic fields due to a near cancellation between orbital and spin moments but revealed by exchange interactions of the electrons in the 2DEG with Eu moments near the EuOx/KTaO3 (110) interface. The interactions between the uniaxial spin texture and the magnetic overlayer offer new ways to explore the interplay between magnetism and 2D superconductivity.</description>

      <title>Four-terminal Josephson junctions: diode effects, anomalous currents and transverse currents</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19376</link>
      <description>arXiv:2503.19376v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: We study a multi-terminal Josephson junction consisting of a central spin-orbit-coupled region with an in-plane Zeeman field connected to four superconducting terminals. This setup allows for the simultaneous measurement of both longitudinal and transverse Josephson currents in response to a phase bias and provides a platform to probe the planar Hall effect in superconducting transport. We find that the system exhibits the anomalous Josephson effect (AJE) and the Josephson diode effect (JDE) when the symmetry between opposite momentum modes is broken. Specifically, breaking the symmetry between $k_x$ and $-k_x$ results in JDE and AJE in the longitudinal Josephson current, while breaking the symmetry between $k_y$ and $-k_y$ leads to a finite transverse Josephson current that also exhibits JDE and AJE. Furthermore, for specific parameter choices, the current-phase relation in the transverse direction supports unidirectional transport, highlighting its potential for superconducting circuit applications. Our setup offers a new route to engineering nonreciprocal superconducting transport.</description>
