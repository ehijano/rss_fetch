      <title>ShibuyaSocial: Multi-scale Model of Pedestrian Flows in Scramble Crossing</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18550</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18550v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based model of pedestrian flows that integrates multi scale behaviors such as global route selection and local collision avoidance in urban spaces, particularly focusing on pedestrian movements at Shibuya scramble crossing. Since too much congestion of pedestrian flows can cause serious accidents, mathematically modeling and predicting pedestrian behaviors is important for preventing such accidents and providing a safe and comfortable environment. Although numerous studies have investigated learning-based modeling methods, most of them focus only on the local behavior of pedestrians, such as collision avoidance with neighbors and environmental objects. In an actual environment, pedestrian behavior involves more complicated decision making including global route selection. Moreover, a state transition from stopping to walking at a traffic light should be considered simultaneously. In this study, the proposed model integrates local behaviors with global route selection, using an Attention mechanism to ensure consistent global and local behavior predictions. We recorded video data of pedestrians at Shibuya scramble crossing and trained the proposed model using pedestrian walking trajectory data obtained from the video. Simulations of pedestrian behaviors based on the trained model qualitatively and quantitatively validated that the proposed model can appropriately predict pedestrian behaviors.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Accountability in Networked MAS: Tracing and Mitigating Emergent Norms at Scale</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18561</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18561v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Large-scale networked multi-agent systems increasingly underpin critical infrastructure, yet their collective behavior can drift toward undesirable emergent norms that elude conventional governance mechanisms. We introduce an adaptive accountability framework that (i) continuously traces responsibility flows through a lifecycle-aware audit ledger, (ii) detects harmful emergent norms online via decentralized sequential hypothesis tests, and (iii) deploys local policy and reward-shaping interventions that realign agents with system-level objectives in near real time. We prove a bounded-compromise theorem showing that whenever the expected intervention cost exceeds an adversary's payoff, the long-run proportion of compromised interactions is bounded by a constant strictly less than one. Extensive high-performance simulations with up to 100 heterogeneous agents, partial observability, and stochastic communication graphs show that our framework prevents collusion and resource hoarding in at least 90% of configurations, boosts average collective reward by 12-18%, and lowers the Gini inequality index by up to 33% relative to a PPO baseline. These results demonstrate that a theoretically principled accountability layer can induce ethically aligned, self-regulating behavior in complex MAS without sacrificing performance or scalability.</description>

      <title>Q-KVComm: Efficient Multi-Agent Communication Via Adaptive KV Cache Compression</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17914</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17914v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Multi-agent Large Language Model (LLM) systems face a critical bottleneck: redundant transmission of contextual information between agents consumes excessive bandwidth and computational resources. Traditional approaches discard internal semantic representations and transmit raw text, forcing receiving agents to recompute similar representations from scratch. We introduce Q-KVComm, a new protocol that enables direct transmission of compressed key-value (KV) cache representations between LLM agents. Q-KVComm combines three key innovations: (1) adaptive layer-wise quantization that allocates variable bit-widths based on sensitivity profiling, (2) hybrid information extraction that preserves critical facts across content domains, and (3) heterogeneous model calibration establishing cross-architecture communication. Extensive experiments across three diverse question-answering datasets demonstrate that Q-KVComm achieves 5-6x compression ratios while maintaining semantic fidelity, with coherence quality scores above 0.77 across all scenarios. The protocol exhibits robust performance across model sizes (1.1B-1.5B parameters) and adapts to real-world applications including conversational QA and multi-hop reasoning. Our work establishes a new paradigm for LLM agent communication, shifting from text-based to representation-based information exchange.</description>

      <title>Adaptive Agents in Spatial Double-Auction Markets: Modeling the Emergence of Industrial Symbiosis</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17979</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.17979v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Industrial symbiosis fosters circularity by enabling firms to repurpose residual resources, yet its emergence is constrained by socio-spatial frictions that shape costs, matching opportunities, and market efficiency. Existing models often overlook the interaction between spatial structure, market design, and adaptive firm behavior, limiting our understanding of where and how symbiosis arises. We develop an agent-based model where heterogeneous firms trade byproducts through a spatially embedded double-auction market, with prices and quantities emerging endogenously from local interactions. Leveraging reinforcement learning, firms adapt their bidding strategies to maximize profit while accounting for transport costs, disposal penalties, and resource scarcity. Simulation experiments reveal the economic and spatial conditions under which decentralized exchanges converge toward stable and efficient outcomes. Counterfactual regret analysis shows that sellers' strategies approach a near Nash equilibrium, while sensitivity analysis highlights how spatial structures and market parameters jointly govern circularity. Our model provides a basis for exploring policy interventions that seek to align firm incentives with sustainability goals, and more broadly demonstrates how decentralized coordination can emerge from adaptive agents in spatially constrained markets.</description>

      <title>Rethinking Multi-Agent Intelligence Through the Lens of Small-World Networks</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18094</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18094v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have enabled multi-agent systems (MAS) in which multiple agents argue, critique, and coordinate to solve complex tasks, making communication topology a first-class design choice. Yet most existing LLM-based MAS either adopt fully connected graphs, simple sparse rings, or ad-hoc dynamic selection, with little structural guidance. In this work, we revisit classic theory on small-world (SW) networks and ask: what changes if we treat SW connectivity as a design prior for MAS? We first bridge insights from neuroscience and complex networks to MAS, highlighting how SW structures balance local clustering and long-range integration. Using multi-agent debate (MAD) as a controlled testbed, experiment results show that SW connectivity yields nearly the same accuracy and token cost, while substantially stabilizing consensus trajectories. Building on this, we introduce an uncertainty-guided rewiring scheme for scaling MAS, where long-range shortcuts are added between epistemically divergent agents using LLM-oriented uncertainty signals (e.g., semantic entropy). This yields controllable SW structures that adapt to task difficulty and agent heterogeneity. Finally, we discuss broader implications of SW priors for MAS design, framing them as stabilizers of reasoning, enhancers of robustness, scalable coordinators, and inductive biases for emergent cognitive roles.</description>

      <title>Efficient Mixture-of-Agents Serving via Tree-Structured Routing, Adaptive Pruning, and Dependency-Aware Prefill-Decode Overlap</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18126</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18126v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Mixture-of-Agents (MoA) inference can suffer from dense inter-agent communication and low hardware utilization, which jointly inflate serving latency. We present a serving design that targets these bottlenecks through an algorithm-system co-design. First, we replace dense agent interaction graphs with a hierarchical tree topology that induces structured sparsity in inter-agent communication. Second, we introduce a runtime adaptive mechanism that selectively terminates or skips downstream agent invocations using semantic agreement and confidence signals from intermediate outputs. Third, we pipeline agent execution by overlapping incremental prefilling with decoding across dependency-related agents, improving utilization and reducing inference latency. Across representative tasks, this approach substantially reduces end-to-end latency (up to 90%) while maintaining comparable accuracy (within $\pm$1%) relative to dense-connectivity MoA baselines, and can improve accuracy in certain settings.</description>

      <title>On Swarm Leader Identification using Probing Policies</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18146</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18146v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Identifying the leader within a robotic swarm is crucial, especially in adversarial contexts where leader concealment is necessary for mission success. This work introduces the interactive Swarm Leader Identification (iSLI) problem, a novel approach where an adversarial probing agent identifies a swarm's leader by physically interacting with its members. We formulate the iSLI problem as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP) and employ Deep Reinforcement Learning, specifically Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to train the prober's policy. The proposed approach utilizes a novel neural network architecture featuring a Timed Graph Relationformer (TGR) layer combined with a Simplified Structured State Space Sequence (S5) model. The TGR layer effectively processes graph-based observations of the swarm, capturing temporal dependencies and fusing relational information using a learned gating mechanism to generate informative representations for policy learning. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our TGR-based model outperforms baseline graph neural network architectures and exhibits significant zero-shot generalization capabilities across varying swarm sizes and speeds different from those used during training. The trained prober achieves high accuracy in identifying the leader, maintaining performance even in out-of-training distribution scenarios, and showing appropriate confidence levels in its predictions. Real-world experiments with physical robots further validate the approach, confirming successful sim-to-real transfer and robustness to dynamic changes, such as unexpected agent disconnections.</description>

      <title>Snowveil: A Framework for Decentralised Preference Discovery</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18444</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18444v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Aggregating subjective preferences of a large group is a fundamental challenge in computational social choice, traditionally reliant on central authorities. To address the limitations of this model, this paper introduces Decentralised Preference Discovery (DPD), the problem of determining the collective will of an electorate under constraints of censorship resistance, partial information, and asynchronous communication. We propose Snowveil, a novel framework for this task. Snowveil uses an iterative, gossip-based protocol where voters repeatedly sample the preferences of a small, random subset of the electorate to progressively converge on a collective outcome. We demonstrate the framework's modularity by designing the Constrained Hybrid Borda (CHB), a novel aggregation rule engineered to balance broad consensus with strong plurality support, and provide a rigorous axiomatic analysis of its properties. By applying a potential function and submartingale theory, we develop a multi-level analytical method to show that the system almost surely converges to a stable, single-winner in finite time, a process that can then be iterated to construct a set of winning candidates for multi-winner scenarios. This technique is largely agnostic to the specific aggregation rule, requiring only that it satisfies core social choice axioms like Positive Responsiveness, thus offering a formal toolkit for a wider class of DPD protocols. Furthermore, we present a comprehensive empirical analysis through extensive simulation, validating Snowveil's $O(n)$ scalability. Overall, this work advances the understanding of how a stable consensus can emerge from subjective, complex, and diverse preferences in decentralised systems for large electorates.</description>

      <title>Agent-Based Output Drift Detection for Breast Cancer Response Prediction in a Multisite Clinical Decision Support System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18450</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18450v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Modern clinical decision support systems can concurrently serve multiple, independent medical imaging institutions, but their predictive performance may degrade across sites due to variations in patient populations, imaging hardware, and acquisition protocols. Continuous surveillance of predictive model outputs offers a safe and reliable approach for identifying such distributional shifts without ground truth labels. However, most existing methods rely on centralized monitoring of aggregated predictions, overlooking site-specific drift dynamics. We propose an agent-based framework for detecting drift and assessing its severity in multisite clinical AI systems. To evaluate its effectiveness, we simulate a multi-center environment for output-based drift detection, assigning each site a drift monitoring agent that performs batch-wise comparisons of model outputs against a reference distribution. We analyse several multi-center monitoring schemes, that differ in how the reference is obtained (site-specific, global, production-only and adaptive), alongside a centralized baseline. Results on real-world breast cancer imaging data using a pathological complete response prediction model shows that all multi-center schemes outperform centralized monitoring, with F1-score improvements up to 10.3% in drift detection. In the absence of site-specific references, the adaptive scheme performs best, with F1-scores of 74.3% for drift detection and 83.7% for drift severity classification. These findings suggest that adaptive, site-aware agent-based drift monitoring can enhance reliability of multisite clinical decision support systems.</description>

      <title>SWE-EVO: Benchmarking Coding Agents in Long-Horizon Software Evolution Scenarios</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18470</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18470v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Existing benchmarks for AI coding agents focus on isolated, single-issue tasks such as fixing a bug or implementing a small feature. However, real-world software engineering is fundamentally a long-horizon endeavor: developers must interpret high-level requirements, plan coordinated changes across many files, and evolve codebases over multiple iterations while preserving existing functionality. We introduce SWE-EVO, a benchmark that evaluates agents on this long-horizon software evolution challenge. Constructed from release notes and version histories of seven mature open-source Python projects, Tool comprises 48 evolution tasks that require agents to implement multi-step modifications spanning an average of 21 files, validated against comprehensive test suites averaging 874 tests per instance. Experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal a striking capability gap: even GPT-5 with OpenHands achieves only a 21 percent resolution rate on Tool, compared to 65 percent on the single-issue SWE-Bench Verified. This demonstrates that current agents struggle with sustained, multi-file reasoning. We also propose Fix Rate, a fine-grained metric that captures partial progress toward solving these complex, long-horizon tasks.</description>

      <title>DASH: Deception-Augmented Shared Mental Model for a Human-Machine Teaming System</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18616</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18616v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We present DASH (Deception-Augmented Shared mental model for Human-machine teaming), a novel framework that enhances mission resilience by embedding proactive deception into Shared Mental Models (SMM). Designed for mission-critical applications such as surveillance and rescue, DASH introduces "bait tasks" to detect insider threats, e.g., compromised Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs), AI agents, or human analysts, before they degrade team performance. Upon detection, tailored recovery mechanisms are activated, including UGV system reinstallation, AI model retraining, or human analyst replacement. In contrast to existing SMM approaches that neglect insider risks, DASH improves both coordination and security. Empirical evaluations across four schemes (DASH, SMM-only, no-SMM, and baseline) show that DASH sustains approximately 80% mission success under high attack rates, eight times higher than the baseline. This work contributes a practical human-AI teaming framework grounded in shared mental models, a deception-based strategy for insider threat detection, and empirical evidence of enhanced robustness under adversarial conditions. DASH establishes a foundation for secure, adaptive human-machine teaming in contested environments.</description>

      <title>A Multi-agent Text2SQL Framework using Small Language Models and Execution Feedback</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18622</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18622v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Text2SQL, the task of generating SQL queries from natural language text, is a critical challenge in data engineering. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated superior performance for this task due to their advanced comprehension and generation capabilities. However, privacy and cost considerations prevent companies from using Text2SQL solutions based on external LLMs offered as a service. Rather, small LLMs (SLMs) that are openly available and can hosted in-house are adopted. These SLMs, in turn, lack the generalization capabilities of larger LLMs, which impairs their effectiveness for complex tasks such as Text2SQL. To address these limitations, we propose MATS, a novel Text2SQL framework designed specifically for SLMs. MATS uses a multi-agent mechanism that assigns specialized roles to auxiliary agents, reducing individual workloads and fostering interaction. A training scheme based on reinforcement learning aligns these agents using feedback obtained during execution, thereby maintaining competitive performance despite a limited LLM size. Evaluation results using on benchmark datasets show that MATS, deployed on a single- GPU server, yields accuracy that are on-par with large-scale LLMs when using significantly fewer parameters. Our source code and data are available at https://github.com/thanhdath/mats-sql.</description>

      <title>Explainable and Fine-Grained Safeguarding of LLM Multi-Agent Systems via Bi-Level Graph Anomaly Detection</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2512.18733v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent systems (MAS) have shown strong capabilities in solving complex tasks. As MAS become increasingly autonomous in various safety-critical tasks, detecting malicious agents has become a critical security concern. Although existing graph anomaly detection (GAD)-based defenses can identify anomalous agents, they mainly rely on coarse sentence-level information and overlook fine-grained lexical cues, leading to suboptimal performance. Moreover, the lack of interpretability in these methods limits their reliability and real-world applicability. To address these limitations, we propose XG-Guard, an explainable and fine-grained safeguarding framework for detecting malicious agents in MAS. To incorporate both coarse and fine-grained textual information for anomalous agent identification, we utilize a bi-level agent encoder to jointly model the sentence- and token-level representations of each agent. A theme-based anomaly detector further captures the evolving discussion focus in MAS dialogues, while a bi-level score fusion mechanism quantifies token-level contributions for explanation. Extensive experiments across diverse MAS topologies and attack scenarios demonstrate robust detection performance and strong interpretability of XG-Guard.</description>

Abstract: Self-evolving memory systems are unprecedentedly reshaping the evolutionary paradigm of large language model (LLM)-based agents. Prior work has predominantly relied on manually engineered memory architectures to store trajectories, distill experience, and synthesize reusable tools, enabling agents to evolve on the fly within environment interactions. However, this paradigm is fundamentally constrained by the staticity of the memory system itself: while memory facilitates agent-level evolving, the underlying memory architecture cannot be meta-adapted to diverse task contexts. To address this gap, we propose MemEvolve, a meta-evolutionary framework that jointly evolves agents' experiential knowledge and their memory architecture, allowing agent systems not only to accumulate experience but also to progressively refine how they learn from it. To ground MemEvolve in prior research and foster openness in future self-evolving systems, we introduce EvolveLab, a unified self-evolving memory codebase that distills twelve representative memory systems into a modular design space (encode, store, retrieve, manage), providing both a standardized implementation substrate and a fair experimental arena. Extensive evaluations on four challenging agentic benchmarks demonstrate that MemEvolve achieves (I) substantial performance gains, improving frameworks such as SmolAgent and Flash-Searcher by up to $17.06\%$; and (II) strong cross-task and cross-LLM generalization, designing memory architectures that transfer effectively across diverse benchmarks and backbone models.</description>

      <title>Quantifying the Lifelong Impact of Resilience Interventions via Agent-Based LLM Simulation</title>

Abstract: Establishing the long-term, causal impact of psychological interventions on life outcomes is a grand challenge for the social sciences, caught between the limitations of correlational longitudinal studies and short-term randomized controlled trials (RCTs). This paper introduces Large-Scale Agent-based Longitudinal Simulation (LALS), a framework that resolves this impasse by simulating multi-decade, counterfactual life trajectories. The methodology employs a "digital clone" design where 2,500 unique LLM-based agent personas (grounded in a curated corpus of 3,917 empirical research articles) are each cloned across a 2x2 factorial experiment. Specifically, the simulation models the efficacy of extended psychological resilience training (Intervention vs. Control) either in childhood or as a young adult (age 6 vs. age 18). Comparing digital clones enables exceptionally precise causal inference. The simulation provides a quantitative, causal estimate of a resilience intervention's lifelong effects, revealing significant reductions in mortality, a lower incidence of dementia, and a substantial increase in accumulated wealth. Crucially, the results uncover a crucial developmental window: the intervention administered at age 6 produced more than double the positive impact on lifetime wealth compared to the same intervention at age 18. These benefits were most pronounced for agents from low-socioeconomic backgrounds, highlighting a powerful buffering effect. The LALS framework serves as a "computational wind tunnel" for social science, offering a new paradigm for generating and testing causal hypotheses about the complex, lifelong dynamics that shape human capital and well-being.</description>

      <title>Networked Communication for Mean-Field Games with Function Approximation and Empirical Mean-Field Estimation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11607</link>
      <description>arXiv:2408.11607v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent algorithms allow decentralised agents, possibly connected via a communication network, to learn equilibria in mean-field games from a non-episodic run of the empirical system. However, these algorithms are for tabular settings: this computationally limits the size of agents' observation space, meaning the algorithms cannot handle anything but small state spaces, nor generalise beyond policies depending only on the agent's local state to so-called 'population-dependent' policies. We address this limitation by introducing function approximation to the existing setting, drawing on the Munchausen Online Mirror Descent method that has previously been employed only in finite-horizon, episodic, centralised settings. While this permits us to include the mean field in the observation for players' policies, it is unrealistic to assume decentralised agents have access to this global information: we therefore also provide new algorithms allowing agents to locally estimate the global empirical distribution, and to improve this estimate via inter-agent communication. We prove theoretically that exchanging policy information helps networked agents outperform both independent and even centralised agents in function-approximation settings. Our experiments demonstrate this happening empirically, and show that the communication network allows decentralised agents to estimate the mean field for population-dependent policies.</description>

      <title>Networked Communication for Decentralised Cooperative Agents in Mean-Field Control</title>

      <description>arXiv:2503.09400v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: The mean-field framework has been used to find approximate solutions to problems involving very large populations of symmetric, anonymous agents, which may be intractable by other methods. The cooperative mean-field control (MFC) problem has received less attention than the non-cooperative mean-field game (MFG), despite the former potentially being more useful as a tool for engineering large-scale collective behaviours. Decentralised communication algorithms have recently been introduced to MFGs, giving benefits to learning speed and robustness. Inspired by this, we introduce networked communication to MFC - where populations arguably have broader incentive to communicate - and in particular to the setting where decentralised agents learn online from a single, non-episodic run of the empirical system. We adapt recent MFG algorithms to this new setting, as well as contributing a novel sub-routine allowing networked agents to estimate the global average reward from their local neighbourhood. Previous theoretical analysis of decentralised communication in MFGs does not extend trivially to MFC. We therefore contribute new theory proving that in MFC the networked communication scheme allows agents to increase social welfare faster than under both of the two typical alternative architectures, namely independent and centralised learning. We provide experiments that support this new result across different classes of cooperative game, and also give numerous ablation studies and additional experiments concerning numbers of communication round and robustness to communication failures.</description>

      <title>Personalized and Resilient Distributed Learning Through Opinion Dynamics</title>

      <description>arXiv:2505.14081v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: In this paper, we address two practical challenges of distributed learning in multi-agent network systems, namely personalization and resilience. Personalization is the need of heterogeneous agents to learn local models tailored to their own data and tasks, while still generalizing well; on the other hand, the learning process must be resilient to cyberattacks or anomalous training data to avoid disruption. Motivated by a conceptual affinity between these two requirements, we devise a distributed learning algorithm that combines distributed gradient descent and the Friedkin-Johnsen model of opinion dynamics to fulfill both of them. We quantify its convergence speed and the neighborhood that contains the final learned models, which can be easily controlled by tuning the algorithm parameters to enforce a more personalized/resilient behavior. We numerically showcase the effectiveness of our algorithm on synthetic and real-world distributed learning tasks, where it achieves high global accuracy both for personalized models and with malicious agents compared to standard strategies.</description>

      <title>Cooperation as a Black Box: Conceptual Fluctuation and Diagnostic Tools for Misalignment in MAS</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22876</link>
      <description>arXiv:2506.22876v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Misalignment in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) is frequently treated as a technical failure. Yet, issues may arise from the conceptual design phase, where semantic ambiguity and normative projection occur. The Rabbit-Duck illusion illustrates how perspective-dependent readings of agent behavior, such as the conflation of cooperation-coordination, can create epistemic instability; e.g., coordinated agents in cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) benchmarks being interpreted as morally aligned, despite being optimized for shared utility maximization only. Motivated by three drivers of meaning-level misalignment in MAS (coordination-cooperation ambiguity, conceptual fluctuation, and semantic instability), we introduce the Misalignment Mosaic: a framework for diagnosing how misalignment emerges through language, framing, and design assumptions. The Mosaic comprises four components: 1. Terminological Inconsistency, 2. Interpretive Ambiguity, 3. Concept-to-Code Decay, and 4. Morality as Cooperation. Building on insights from the Morality-as-Cooperation Theory, we call for consistent meaning-level grounding in MAS to ensure systems function as intended: technically and ethically. This need is particularly urgent as MAS principles influence broader Artificial Intelligence (AI) workflows, amplifying risks in trust, interpretability, and governance. While this work focuses on the coordination/cooperation ambiguity, the Mosaic generalizes to other overloaded terms, such as alignment, autonomy, and trust.</description>

      <title>SafeSieve: From Heuristics to Experience in Progressive Pruning for LLM-based Multi-Agent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11733</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.11733v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: LLM-based multi-agent systems exhibit strong collaborative capabilities but often suffer from redundant communication and excessive token overhead. Existing methods typically enhance efficiency through pretrained GNNs or greedy algorithms, but often isolate pre- and post-task optimization, lacking a unified strategy. To this end, we present SafeSieve, a progressive and adaptive multi-agent pruning algorithm that dynamically refines the inter-agent communication through a novel dual-mechanism. SafeSieve integrates initial LLM-based semantic evaluation with accumulated performance feedback, enabling a smooth transition from heuristic initialization to experience-driven refinement. Unlike existing greedy Top-k pruning methods, SafeSieve employs 0-extension clustering to preserve structurally coherent agent groups while eliminating ineffective links. Experiments across benchmarks (SVAMP, HumanEval, etc.) showcase that SafeSieve achieves 94.01% average accuracy while reducing token usage by 12.4%-27.8%. Results further demonstrate robustness under prompt injection attacks (1.23% average accuracy drop). In heterogeneous settings, SafeSieve reduces deployment costs by 13.3% while maintaining performance. These results establish SafeSieve as an efficient, GPU-free, and scalable framework for practical multi-agent systems. Our code can be found here: https://github.com/csgen/SafeSieve</description>

      <title>RadAgents: Multimodal Agentic Reasoning for Chest X-ray Interpretation with Radiologist-like Workflows</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20490</link>
      <description>arXiv:2509.20490v3 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Agentic systems offer a potential path to solve complex clinical tasks through collaboration among specialized agents, augmented by tool use and external knowledge bases. Nevertheless, for chest X-ray (CXR) interpretation, prevailing methods remain limited: (i) reasoning is frequently neither clinically interpretable nor aligned with guidelines, reflecting mere aggregation of tool outputs; (ii) multimodal evidence is insufficiently fused, yielding text-only rationales that are not visually grounded; and (iii) systems rarely detect or resolve cross-tool inconsistencies and provide no principled verification mechanisms. To bridge the above gaps, we present RadAgents, a multi-agent framework that couples clinical priors with task-aware multimodal reasoning and encodes a radiologist-style workflow into a modular, auditable pipeline. In addition, we integrate grounding and multimodal retrieval-augmentation to verify and resolve context conflicts, resulting in outputs that are more reliable, transparent, and consistent with clinical practice.</description>

      <title>HyperAgent: Leveraging Hypergraphs for Topology Optimization in Multi-Agent Communication</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10611</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.10611v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Recent advances in large language model-powered multi-agent systems have demonstrated remarkable collective intelligence through effective communication. However, existing approaches face two primary challenges: (i) \textit{Ineffective group collaboration modeling}, as they rely on pairwise edge representations in graph structures, limiting their ability to capture relationships among multiple agents; and (ii) \textit{Limited task-adaptiveness in communication topology design}, leading to excessive communication cost for simple tasks and insufficient coordination for complex scenarios. These issues restrict the scalability and practical deployment of adaptive collaboration frameworks. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{HyperAgent}, a hypergraph-based framework that optimizes communication topologies and effectively captures group collaboration patterns using direct hyperedge representations. Unlike edge-based approaches, HyperAgent uses hyperedges to link multiple agents within the same subtask and employs hypergraph convolutional layers to achieve one-step information aggregation in collaboration groups. Additionally, it incorporates a variational autoencoder framework with sparsity regularization to dynamically adjust hypergraph topologies based on task complexity. Experiments highlight the superiority of HyperAgent in both performance and efficiency. For instance, on GSM8K, HyperAgent achieves 95.07\% accuracy while reducing token consumption by 25.33\%, demonstrating the potential of hypergraph-based optimization for multi-agent communication.</description>

      <title>STAIR: Stability criterion for Time-windowed Assignment and Internal adversarial influence in Routing and decision-making</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05715</link>
      <description>arXiv:2511.05715v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A major limitation of existing routing algorithms for multi-agent systems is that they are designed without considering the potential presence of adversarial agents in the decision-making loop, which could lead to severe performance degradation in real-life applications where adversarial agents may be present. We study autonomous pickup-and-delivery routing problems in which adversarial agents launch coordinated denial-of-service attacks by spoofing their locations. This deception causes the central scheduler to assign pickup requests to adversarial agents instead of cooperative agents. Adversarial agents then choose not to service the requests with the goal of disrupting the operation of the system, leading to delays, cancellations, and potential instability in the routing policy. Policy stability in routing problems is typically defined as the cost of the policy being uniformly bounded over time, and it has been studied through two different lenses: queuing theory and reinforcement learning (RL), which are not well suited for routing with adversaries. In this paper, we propose a new stability criterion, STAIR, which is easier to analyze than queuing-theory-based stability in adversarial settings. Furthermore, STAIR does not depend on a chosen discount factor as is the case in discounted RL stability. STAIR directly links stability to desired operational metrics, like a finite number of rejected requests. This characterization is particularly useful in adversarial settings as it provides a metric for monitoring the effect of adversaries in the operation of the system. Furthermore, we demonstrate STAIR's practical relevance through simulations on real-world San Francisco mobility-on-demand data. We also identify a phenomenon of degenerate stability that arises in the adversarial routing problem, and we introduce time-window constraints in the decision-making algorithm to mitigate it.</description>

      <description>arXiv:2511.20663v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Reliability in multi-agent systems (MAS) built on large language models is increasingly limited by cognitive failures rather than infrastructure faults. Existing observability tools describe failures but do not quantify how quickly distributed reasoning recovers once coherence is lost. We introduce MTTR-A (Mean Time-to-Recovery for Agentic Systems), a runtime reliability metric that measures cognitive recovery latency in MAS. MTTR-A adapts classical dependability theory to agentic orchestration, capturing the time required to detect reasoning drift and restore coherent operation. We further define complementary metrics, including MTBF and a normalized recovery ratio (NRR), and establish theoretical bounds linking recovery latency to long-run cognitive uptime. Using a LangGraph-based benchmark with simulated drift and reflex recovery, we empirically demonstrate measurable recovery behavior across multiple reflex strategies. This work establishes a quantitative foundation for runtime cognitive dependability in distributed agentic systems.</description>

      <title>MAPPO-LCR: Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization with Local Cooperation Reward in Spatial Public Goods Games</title>

      <description>arXiv:2512.17187v2 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Spatial public goods games model collective dilemmas where individual payoffs depend on population-level strategy configurations. Most existing studies rely on evolutionary update rules or value-based reinforcement learning methods. These approaches struggle to represent payoff coupling and non-stationarity in large interacting populations. This work introduces Multi-Agent Proximal Policy Optimization (MAPPO) into spatial public goods games for the first time. In these games, individual returns are intrinsically coupled through overlapping group interactions. Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) treats agents as independent learners and ignores this coupling during value estimation. MAPPO addresses this limitation through a centralized critic that evaluates joint strategy configurations. To study neighborhood-level cooperation signals under this framework, we propose MAPPO with Local Cooperation Reward, termed MAPPO-LCR. The local cooperation reward aligns policy updates with surrounding cooperative density without altering the original game structure. MAPPO-LCR preserves decentralized execution while enabling population-level value estimation during training. Extensive simulations demonstrate stable cooperation emergence and reliable convergence across enhancement factors. Statistical analyses further confirm the learning advantage of MAPPO over PPO in spatial public goods games.</description>

      <title>JustAct+: A Framework for Auditable Multi-Agent Systems Regulated by Inter-Organisational Policies</title>

      <description>arXiv:2502.00138v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: In open multi-agent agent systems that cross organisational boundaries, agent actions must be regulated by complex policies. Consider medical data processing systems, which must observe generic laws (e.g., EU data protection regulations) and also specific participants' resource conditions (e.g., Bob consents to sharing his X-Rays with EU hospitals). Presently, we address the implementation of these systems as distributed software. Solutions to key sub-problems are available: existing policy languages capture the necessary normative concepts and formalise the computational representation and reasoning about policies, and existing distributed algorithms and protocols coordinate agents' changing actions and policies. But which policies and protocols are useful in application? With the JustAct framework, we characterise a class of multi-agent systems where actors justify their actions with sufficient policy information collected from dynamic policy statements and agreements. We prove key properties of these systems, e.g., any decision that an action is permitted now cannot be refuted later, regardless of any added statements or updated agreements. We study a particular instance of the framework by specifying (in Rocq) and implementing (in Rust) a particular policy language and runtime system for mediating agent communications. We demonstrate and assess JustAct via a case study of this implementation: we reproduce the usage scenarios of Brane, an existing policy-regulated, inter-domain, medical data processing system.</description>

      <title>WebATLAS: An LLM Agent with Experience-Driven Memory and Action Simulation</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22732</link>
      <description>arXiv:2510.22732v2 Announce Type: replace-cross 
Abstract: Large Language Model (LLM) web agents often struggle with long-horizon web navigation and web task completion in new websites, producing inefficient action sequences unless fine-tuned on environment-specific data. We show that experience-driven memory, combined with look-ahead action simulation, is sufficient for LLM agents to adapt to unseen web environments by remembering past failures and predicting the consequences of future actions. We introduce WebATLAS (Actor-Critic Task-completion with Look-ahead Action Simulation), a memory-augmented LLM web agent that learns a lightweight internal model of the environment from interaction experience and performs hypothetical action rollouts before acting in the real world. WebATLAS builds a persistent cognitive map via curiosity-driven exploration, stores interaction outcomes as experience-based memory, and evaluates candidate actions in cognitive space using a planner--simulator--critic loop. This enables the agent to reuse past experience, avoid previously unsuccessful behaviors, and generate more efficient plans. We evaluate WebATLAS on the WebArena-Lite benchmark for autonomous web navigation and demonstrate a success rate of 63%, outperforming the previous state-of-the-art at 53.9%. Unlike previous systems, our modular architecture requires no website-specific LLM fine-tuning. Ablation studies confirm that experience-driven memory, look-ahead action simulation, and hierarchical replanning play complementary roles in enabling robust, training-free web agents.</description>
