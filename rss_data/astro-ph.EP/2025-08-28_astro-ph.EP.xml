      <title>Modeling Orbital Decay of Low-Earth Orbit Satellites due to Atmospheric Drag: A Simplified Analytical Approach</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19549</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19549v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) satellites are crucial for communications, navigation, and Earth observation. However, their operational lifetimes are strongly influenced by orbital decay due to atmospheric drag. This work presents a simplified analytical model of orbital decay in LEO, incorporating atmospheric density variations and satellite parameters. Using standard drag force equations and density models, we explore how altitude, satellite mass, and cross-sectional area affect decay timescales. Comparisons are made with existing NASA models and previous literature. The results highlight the importance of accurate atmospheric density representation and solar activity in predicting satellite lifetimes, especially relevant in the context of increasing space debris and mega-constellations.</description>

      <title>Century-Scale Effect of Climate Change on Meteorite Falls</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19745</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19745v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: Climate change is inducing a global atmospheric contraction above the tropopause (~10 km), leading to systematic decrease in neutral air density. The impact of climate change on small meteoroids has already been observed over the last two decades, with documented shifts in their ablation altitudes in the mesosphere (~50-85 km) and lower thermosphere (~85-120 km). This study evaluates the potential effect of these changes on meteorite-dropping fireballs, which typically penetrate the stratosphere (~10-50 km). As a case study, we simulate the atmospheric entry of the fragile Winchcombe carbonaceous chondrite under projected atmospheric conditions for the year 2100 assuming a moderate future emission scenario. Using a semi-empirical fragmentation and ablation model, we compare the meteoroid's light curve and deceleration under present and future atmospheric density profiles. The results indicate a modest variation of the ablation heights, with the catastrophic fragmentation occurring 300 m lower and the luminous flight terminating 190 m higher. The absolute magnitude peak remains unchanged, but the fireball would appear 0.5 dimmer above ~120 km. The surviving meteorite mass is reduced by only 0.1 g. Our findings indicate that century-scale variations in atmospheric density caused by climate change moderately influence bright fireballs and have a minimal impact on meteorite survival.</description>

      <title>HD 44892: The youngest (or oldest?) gas-harbouring debris disc around an intermediate mass star</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19860</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19860v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first detections of gas around a 2.1 Myr old debris disc-bearing intermediate-mass star, HD 44892. Through our analysis we deem the alternative age of 800 Myr unlikely. Gas is detected both in $^{12}$CO (2-1) emission through ALMA Band 6 observations and absorption in Ca II K and H seen with high-resolution UVES spectroscopy. The star exhibits a 12 $\mu$m fractional excess of $7.86^{+0.11}_{-2.27}$, placing it in the transition stage between protoplanetary and debris discs, at a level comparable to HD 141569. Our detection of 1.3 mm emission yields the dust mass of 0.019$\pm$0.009 $M_{\oplus}$ assuming 115 K temperature. Assuming a gas temperature of 20 K, the resulting CO gas mass is (7.86$\pm$2.05)$\times$10$^{-5}$ $M_{\oplus}$. For a warmer gas of 50 K it increases to (1.62$\pm$0.17)$\times$10$^{-4}$ $M_{\oplus}$. From the $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O non-detections we derive upper limits which suggest this CO gas mass estimate should be treated as a lower limit, because the CO emission might be optically thick. From the analysis of UVES spectroscopic data we find variability in the spectrum of HD 44892, in both calcium Ca II K and H lines, which is absent from sodium Na I D1 and D2 lines, and can be interpreted by transiting circumstellar gas. Through comparison to spectra of nearby stars we exclude the possibility of these features being caused by interstellar absorption. Both the dust mass, which is within an order of magnitude of HD 141569, and the gas mass derived here indicate a late gas dispersal stage of the protoplanetary disc.</description>

      <title>Jupiter Trojans spectrophotometry using Gaia DR3 catalog</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19872</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19872v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the spectral characterization of Jupiter Trojans using data from the Gaia mission DR3 spectral catalog (320 spectra of good quality) and from the literature. Gaia spectrophotometry is available in 16 spectrophotometric points covering the 0.33-1.08 $\mu$m range. The final dataset includes 519 Trojans, 291 in the leading swarm (L4) and 228 in the trailing swarm (L5), which we classified using the Bus-Demeo and Mahlke classification schemes.
  The Trojan population is dominated by featureless asteroids with red spectral slopes belonging to the D-type, and an important fraction ($\sim$ 40\%) belong to the Z-class (in Mahlke taxonomy), characterized by very red slopes. The L4 swarm shows a higher spectral variability and a higher amount, by a factor of 2, of less spectrally red asteroids belonging to the C, P, and X classes, mainly associated with families members.
  Once excluding peculiar families members the two swarms have very similar average slope and albedo values (7.86 $\pm$ 0.15\% and 7.35 $\pm$0.15\% for the L4 and L5 swarms, respectively). This points toward a common origin of the bodies of the two swarms, likely from the Transneptunian region. We do not observe a spectral color bi-modality distribution, conversely to the results previously reported in the literature. The spectral slope distribution, peaked at 9-11 \%/1000 \AA, it is very narrow compared to that of Transneptunian objects (TNOs) or cometary nuclei. Trojans visible spectral slopes match those of the less red TNOs, and lack of extremely red and organic rich bodies. We suggest that the Jupiter Trojans might have been captured by Jupiter from the Centaurs and scattered disk population, and that the lack of extremely red objects among Trojans is due to removal of the organic-rich crust through the sublimation of volatiles and collisions as TNOs migrated inward in the Solar System.</description>

      <title>Collisional excitation of HCN by CO to refine the modeling of cometary comae</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19904</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19904v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: We present the first dataset of collisional (de)-excitation rate coefficients of HCN induced by CO, one of the main perturbing gases in cometary atmospheres. The dataset spans the temperature range of 5-50 K. It includes both state-to-state rate coefficients involving the lowest ten and nine rotational levels of HCN and CO, respectively, and the so-called "thermalized" rate coefficients over the rotational population of CO at each kinetic temperature. The derivation of these coefficients exploited the good performance of the statistical adiabatic channel model (SACM) on top of an accurate interaction potential computed at the CCSD(T)-F12b/CBS level of theory. The reliability of the SACM approach was validated by comparison with full quantum calculations restricted at the lowest total angular momentum of the system. These results provide essential input to accurately model the distribution among the rotational energy levels and the abundance of HCN in cometary atmospheres, accounting for deviations from local thermodynamic equilibrium that typically occurs in such environments.</description>

      <title>Energetic proton dropouts during the Juno flyby of Europa strongly depend on magnetic field perturbations</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19986</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19986v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: During Juno's only flyby of Europa, the Jupiter Energetic Particle Detector Instrument (JEDI) measured complex dropouts in the energetic ion flux in Europa's wake. We investigate the causes of these dropouts, focusing specifically on energetic protons of ~100 keV and ~1 MeV, using back-tracking particle simulations, a prescribed description of Europa's atmosphere and a three-dimensional single fluid magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) model of the plasma-atmosphere interaction.
  We investigate the role of magnetic field perturbations resulting from the interaction between Jupiter's magnetospheric plasma and Europa's atmosphere and the presence of field-aligned electron beams in Europa's wake. We compare the simulated effect of the perturbed fields on the pitch angle distributions of the ion losses to Juno-JEDI measurements. We find that at ~100 keV, field perturbations are the dominant factor controlling the distribution of the losses along the flyby, while at ~1 MeV a combination of field perturbations and absorption by the surface due to short half bounce periods is required to explain the measured losses. We also find that the effect of charge-exchange with Europa's tenuous atmosphere is weak and absorption by dust in Europa's environment is negligible.
  Furthermore, we find that the perturbed magnetic fields which best represent the measurements are those that account for the plasma interaction with a sub-/anti-Jovian asymmetric atmosphere, non-uniform ionization of the atmosphere, and electron beams. This sensitivity to the specific field perturbation demonstrates that combining observations and modeling of proton depletions constitute an important tool to probe the electromagnetic field and atmospheric configurations of Europa.</description>

      <title>Evidence of Titanate Clouds in the Day-side Atmosphere of the Ultra-Hot Jupiter WASP-121b</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20022</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20022v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: The day-side atmospheres of the hottest ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs) have long been subject to speculation about cloud formation, often without direct observational evidence. Here, we present a detailed analysis of the panchromatic day-side emission spectrum of WASP-121b$\unicode{x2014}$one of the hottest known UHJs$\unicode{x2014}$covering a broad wavelength range of $\sim$0.6-5.1$\unicode{x00B5}$m, based on archival JWST observations from NIRISS and NIRSpec/G396H. We report statistically significant detections of several key molecular species, including H$_2$O (13.4 $\sigma$), CO (14.7 $\sigma$), SiO (4.9 $\sigma$), TiO (5.4 $\sigma$), and VO (6.6 $\sigma$), establishing WASP-121b as one of the most thoroughly characterized exoplanetary atmospheres to date. Additionally, we present the robust detection of Titanate (CaTiO$_3$) clouds at 6.7$\sigma$$\unicode{x2014}$the first such detection in any exoplanet atmosphere. Our analysis further reveals strong evidence of TiO depletion, likely due to sequestration into refractory condensates such as Titanate clouds. The precisely constrained molecular abundances yield a super-solar C/O ratio of 0.963$\pm$0.024, a sub-solar Si/O ratio of 0.034$\pm$0.024, and a metallicity of 4.7$_{-1.38}^{+1.99}$ $\times$solar. These findings offer a unique window into the atmospheric chemistry of an extreme UHJ, positioning WASP-121b as a key benchmark for next-generation models of atmospheric evolution and dynamics.</description>

      <title>A unique solution to overcome the barriers to planetesimal formation at low dust-to-gas ratio</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20070</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.20070v1 Announce Type: new 
Abstract: In the incremental growth model, planetesimal formation constitutes the least understood step in the process of planetary formation. The two main difficulties in this regard are the collision/fragmentation and the drift barriers. Numerous solutions have been proposed to overcome these barriers, but often need a conjunction of processes to reach the conditions for planetesimal formation. We present numerical simulations, in which the protoplanetary disk turbulence is fully captured rather than modeled with a turbulent diffusion or turbulent viscosity parameter. When the turbulent cascade is taken into account, and in the case of weakly turbulent disks, not only can solid grains be highly concentrated in clusters, but their radial drift can also be slowed or even halted. These results open a unique path to planetesimal formation starting at disk canonical dust-to-gas ratio, namely Keplerian turbulence.</description>

      <title>VLT observations of interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS II. From quiescence to glow: Dramatic rise of Ni I emission and incipient CN outgassing at large heliocentric distances</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18382</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.18382v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: We report VLT spectroscopy of the interstellar comet 3I/ATLAS (C/2025 N1) from $r_{\rm h}\!\simeq\!4.4$ to $2.85$ au using X-shooter (300-550 nm, $R\!\simeq\!3000$) and UVES (optical, $R\!\simeq\!35k-80k$). The coma is dust-dominated with a fairly constant red optical continuum slope ($\sim$21-22\%/1000\AA). At $r_{\rm h}\!\simeq\!3.17$ au we derive $3\sigma$ limits of $Q({\rm OH})&lt;7.76\times10^{23}\ {\rm s^{-1}}$, but find no indications for [O I], C$_2$, C$_3$ or NH$_2$. We report detection of CN emission and also detect numerous Ni I lines while Fe I remains undetected, potentially implying efficiently released gas-phase Ni. From our latest X-shooter measurements conducted on 2025-08-21 ($r_{\rm h} = 2.85$\,au) we measure production rates of $\log~Q(\mathrm{CN}) = 23.61\pm 0.05$ molecules s$^{-1}$ and $\log~Q$(Ni) $= 22.67\pm0.07$ atoms s$^{-1}$, and characterize their evolution as the comet approaches perihelion. We observe a steep heliocentric-distance scaling for the production rates $Q(\mathrm{Ni}) \propto r_h^{-8.43 \pm 0.79}$ and for $Q(\mathrm{CN}) \propto r_h^{-9.38 \pm 1.2}$, and predict a Ni-CO$_{(2)}$ correlation if the Ni I emission is driven by the carbonyl formation channel. Energetic considerations of activation barriers show that this behavior is inconsistent with direct sublimation of canonical metal/sulfide phases and instead favors low-activation-energy release from dust, e.g. photon-stimulated desorption or mild thermolysis of metalated organics or Ni-rich nanophases, possibly including Ni-carbonyl-like complexes. These hypotheses are testable with future coordinated ground-based and space-based monitoring as 3I becomes more active during its continued passage through the solar system.</description>

      <title>STCTM: a forward modeling and retrieval framework for stellar contamination and stellar spectra</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19297</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19297v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Transmission spectroscopy is a key avenue for the near-term study of small-planet atmospheres and the most promising method when it comes to searching for atmospheres on temperate rocky worlds, which are often too cold for planetary emission to be detectable. At the same time, the small planets that are most amenable for such atmospheric probes orbit small and cool M dwarf stars. As the field becomes increasingly ambitious in the search for signs of even thin atmospheres on small exoplanets, the transit light source effect (TLSE), caused by unocculted stellar surface heterogeneities, is becoming a limiting factor: it is imperative to develop robust inference methods to disentangle planetary and stellar contributions to the observed spectra. Here, I present STCTM, the STellar ConTamination Modeling framework, a flexible Bayesian retrieval framework to model the impact of the TLSE on any exoplanet transmission spectrum, and infer the range of stellar surface parameters that are compatible with the observations in the absence of any planetary contribution. With the "exotune" sub-module, users can also perform retrievals directly on out-of-transit stellar spectra in order to place data-driven priors on the extent to which the TLSE can impact any planet's transmission spectrum. The input data formats, stellar models, and fitted parameters are easily tunable using human-readable files and the code is fully parallelized to enable fast inferences.

      <title>Time-resolved protoplanetary disk physics in DQ Tau with JWST</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19701</link>
      <description>arXiv:2508.19701v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: Accretion variability is ubiquitous in YSOs. While large outbursts may strongly affect the disk, the effects of moderate bursts are less understood. We aim to study the physical response of the disk around the eccentric binary system DQ Tau to its periodic accretion changes. We organized a multi-wavelength campaign centered on four JWST/MIRI spectra. We targeted three periastrons (high accretion state) and one apastron (quiescence). We used optical and near-infrared spectroscopy and photometry to measure how the accretion luminosity varies. We decomposed the multi-epoch SEDs into stellar, accretion, and rim components. We fitted the solid-state features using various opacity curves and the molecular features using slab models. We find the inner disk of DQ Tau to be highly dynamic. The temperature, luminosity, and location of the inner dust rim vary in response to the movement of stars and the L_acc variations. This causes variable shadowing of the outer disk, leading to an anti-correlation between the rim temperature and the strength of the silicate feature. The dust mineralogy remains constant, dominated by large amorphous olivine and pyroxene grains, with smaller fractions of crystalline forsterite. The excitation of CO (1550-2260 K), HCN (880-980 K), and hot H2O (740-860 K) molecules as well as the luminosity of the [NeII] line correlate with the accretion rate, while the warm (650 K) and cold (170-200 K) H2O components are mostly constant. CO emission, originating from a hot (&gt;1500 K) region likely within the dust sublimation radius, is most sensitive to L_acc changes. In comparison with other T Tauri disks, DQ Tau is highly C-poor and displays moderately inefficient pebble drift. We conclude that even moderate accretion rate changes affect the thermal structure in the planet-forming disk regions on short timescales, providing a crucial benchmark for understanding disk evolution.</description>

      <title>Convective Mixing in Gas Giant Planets with Primordial Composition Gradients</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09341</link>
      <description>arXiv:2407.09341v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: Linking atmospheric measurements to the bulk planetary composition and ultimately the planetary origin is a key objective in planetary science. In this work, we identify the cases in which the atmospheric composition represents the bulk composition. We simulate the evolution of giant planets considering a wide range of planetary masses ($0.3-2~M_{\mathrm{J}}$), initial entropies ($8-11~k_{\mathrm{B}} m_\mathrm{u}^{-1}$), and primordial heavy-element profiles. We find that convective mixing is most efficient at early times (ages $\lesssim 10^7$ yr) and that primordial composition gradients can be eroded. In several cases, however, the atmospheric composition can differ widely from the planetary bulk composition, with the exact outcome depending on the details. We show that the efficiency of convection is primarily controlled by the underlying entropy profile: For low primordial entropies of $8-9~k_\mathrm{B} m_\mathrm{u}^{-1}$, convective mixing can be inhibited and composition gradients can persist over billions of years. The scaling of mixing efficiency with mass is governed by the primordial entropy. For the same primordial entropy, low-mass planets mix more efficiently than high-mass planets. If the primordial internal entropy would increase with mass, however, this trend could reverse. We also present a new analytical model that predicts convective mixing under the existence of composition (and entropy) gradients. Our results emphasize the complexity in the interpretation of atmospheric abundance measurements and show the great need to better understand the planetary formation process as it plays a key role in determining the planetary evolution and final structure.</description>

Abstract: We investigate the consequences of non-ideal mixing between silicate, iron metal, and hydrogen for the structures of the cores of sub-Neptunes with implications for super-Earths, warm Neptunes, and ice giants. A method of extrapolating what we know about the miscibility in the three bounding binary systems MgSiO$_3$-H$_2$, MgSiO$_3$-Fe, and Fe-H$_2$ to the ternary composition space is used to deduce the phase equilibria of this system at relevant temperature and pressure conditions. We find that while separate silicate and metal phases can exist at shallow depths, the phases become entirely miscible deeper in the cores, thus altering the density structure of the cores. The assumption that the interiors of large rocky planets, either with extant magma oceans beneath H$_2$-rich envelopes, or evolved from such bodies, are composed of a differentiated metal core overlain by a silicate mantle is inconsistent with our understanding of the phase equilibria of these bodies.</description>

      <title>Error dependencies in the space-based CNEOS fireball database</title>

Abstract: We evaluate the reliability of CNEOS-derived ephemerides of fireball events given the absence of the underlying data. We analyzed 18 events that have both (i) sufficient satellite information to derive orbits and (ii) ground-based observational counterparts. We quantify the uncertainties on these calibrated events using the orbital similarity criterion $D_D$. We also examine the velocity components imbalance and identify discriminants that can indicate the accuracy of an event. We identify two groups in the CNEOS database. CNEOS data produces ephemeris determinations with $D_D$&lt;0.1 for fireballs reported either (i) after late 2017 or (ii) with impact energies above 0.45 kt with 74-78% of events having $D_D$=0.03$\pm$0.02, while ~11% show $D_D$&lt;0.008. Our statistical test confirms these two parameters as the only reliable discriminants that, when combined, explain the two accuracy groups. Daylight, z-velocity component, low altitude, long duration, and latitude might also indicate errors, although the limited dataset may obscure correlations. No clear discriminants are identified for more restrictive $D_D$ cut-offs. We provide estimates of orbital uncertainties for calibrated events. The hyperbolic fireball subset in the CNEOS database appears as an outlier in the velocity imbalance test. Our results confirm that the fidelity of CNEOS fireball data improved significantly from 2018, likely due to the deployment of next-generation space sensors, and show a growing number of high-velocity events. Hyperbolic candidates should be interpreted with caution, as their velocities and inclinations likely reflect measurement errors. Accuracy constraints remain limited by the dataset size, as evidenced by the lack of statistically significant dependence on duration, preventing strong conclusions from being drawn.</description>
