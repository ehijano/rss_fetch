      <title>Random ensembles of symplectic and unitary states are indistinguishable</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.16500</link>
      <description>arXiv:2409.16500v1 Announce Type: cross 
Abstract: A unitary state $t$-design is an ensemble of pure quantum states whose moments match up to the $t$-th order those of states uniformly sampled from a $d$-dimensional Hilbert space. Typically, unitary state $t$-designs are obtained by evolving some reference pure state with unitaries from an ensemble that forms a design over the unitary group $\mathbb{U}(d)$, as unitary designs induce state designs. However, in this work we study whether Haar random symplectic states -- i.e., states obtained by evolving some reference state with unitaries sampled according to the Haar measure over $\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$ -- form unitary state $t$-designs. Importantly, we recall that random symplectic unitaries fail to be unitary designs for $t&gt;1$, and that, while it is known that symplectic unitaries are universal, this does not imply that their Haar measure leads to a state design. Notably, our main result states that Haar random symplectic states form unitary $t$-designs for all $t$, meaning that their distribution is unconditionally indistinguishable from that of unitary Haar random states, even with tests that use infinite copies of each state. As such, our work showcases the intriguing possibility of creating state $t$-designs using ensembles of unitaries which do not constitute designs over $\mathbb{U}(d)$ themselves, such as ensembles that form $t$-designs over $\mathbb{SP}(d/2)$.</description>

      <title>On $[1,2]$-Domination in Interval and Circle Graphs</title>
      <link>https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04694</link>
      <description>arXiv:2403.04694v4 Announce Type: replace 
Abstract: A subset $S$ of vertices in a graph $G=(V, E)$ is a Dominating Set if each vertex in $V(G)\setminus S$ is adjacent to at least one vertex in $S$. Chellali et al. in 2013, by restricting the number of neighbors in $S$ of a vertex outside $S$, introduced the concept of $[1,j]$-dominating set. A set $D \subseteq V$ of a graph $G = (V, E)$ is called a $[1,j]$-Dominating Set of $G$ if every vertex not in $D$ has at least one neighbor and at most $j$ neighbors in $D$. The Minimum $[1,j]$-Domination problem is the problem of finding the minimum $[1,j]$-dominating set $D$. Given a positive integer $k$ and a graph $G = (V, E)$, the $[1,j]$-Domination Decision problem is to decide whether $G$ has a $[1,j]$-dominating set of cardinality at most $k$. A polynomial-time algorithm was obtained in split graphs for a constant $j$ in contrast to the Dominating Set problem which is NP-hard for split graphs. This result motivates us to investigate the effect of restriction $j$ on the complexity of $[1,j]$-domination problem on various classes of graphs. Although for $j\geq 3$, it has been proved that the minimum of classical domination is equal to minimum $[1,j]$-domination in interval graphs, the complexity of finding the minimum $[1,2]$-domination in interval graphs is still outstanding. In this paper, we propose a polynomial-time algorithm for computing a minimum $[1,2]$-dominating set on interval graphs by a dynamic programming technique. Next, on the negative side, we show that the minimum $[1,2]$-dominating set problem on circle graphs is $NP$-complete.</description>
